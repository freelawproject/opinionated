He now moves for a writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to vacate his conviction. For the reasons that follow, the writ is denied and his petition is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Within a few months of the filing of the second superseding indictment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18, in August 2011, Rosemond was in negotiations with the government about resolving the case short of trial. Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. to Set Aside Sentence (\"Mem.\"), Dkt. No. 286, at 5. Over the course of these negotiations, Rosemond participated in nine proffer sessions. Mem. at 5-9. Rosemond was represented by Gerald Shargel, a prominent criminal defense lawyer who was present for all of\n   these sessions. Before each one of the proffer sessions, both Rosemond and Attorney Shargel signed a proffer agreement that barred the government from using any statements made in its case in chief or at sentencing except \"as substantive evidence to rebut, directly or indirectly, any evidence offered or elicited, or factual assertions made, by or on behalf of [Rosemond] at any stage of a criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mem. in Opp. to Pet. to Vacate Sentence Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Opp.\"), Dkt. No. 293, at Ex. A \u00b6 3(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rosemond's proffers loosed a torrent of incriminating details, including about his role, the identity of his suppliers and the quantity of cocaine he had purchased from them, the means of communication employed by members of the drug trafficking organization and his involvement in laundering the drug proceeds. Opp. at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 13-14 (listing Rosemond's statements and describing them as \"inculpating not only himself but also a wide variety of others\"). Among the statements Rosemond made during the proffer sessions was an account of a drug transaction involving a supplier named Wayne Champagne. Truthfulness, obviously, is a\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of proffering. The government contends that this narrative about Champagne was untruthful and further offers that Champagne was out of the relevant geographic region on the date Rosemond claimed. Trial Tr. of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rosemond\n   </em>\n   , No. 11 -cr-424 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (\"Tr.\"), Dkt. No. 293-1, at 2293;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the most part, though, the information Rosemond proffered was not only truthful, but also, in some ways, helpful. For instance, some of it was later used by the United States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Tr. 2316 (testimony of DEA Special Agent Steven Miller). Petitioner provided information about drug suppliers in unrelated cases, Tr. 2301, about cold cases, Tr. 2308, and even about his brother's criminal conduct. Tr. 2310-11. He also discussed the 1983 murder of a club owner - eventually admitting his role in it, Mem. at 9 - and the 2010 drug-related murder of an individual named Lowell Fletcher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp. at 9. The government does not dispute that some of Rosemond's proffer statements were truthful. Opp. at 15 n.7. Nor is there any disagreement that Rosemond had engaged in these repeated proffer sessions specifically to secure a cooperation agreement and avoid trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Fletcher murder was the subject of a separate prosecution in the Southern District of New York.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    As proof of this intent, Rosemond cites a \"letter to the Court, dated November 4, 2011,\" before the seventh proffer session, in which his counsel requested a status conference adjournment, explained that he \"expected that [Rosemond] will enter into a cooperation agreement with the United States Attorney's Office\" and noted that the Assistant U.S. Attorney joined in the request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. at 8-9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Rosemond's prayer would go unanswered. A cooperation agreement was never tendered. Mem. at 10. Worse yet, the government extended cooperation agreements to five \"star witnesses\" who would testify against him at trial: Henry Butler, Winston Harris, Khalil Abdullah, Bryan James and Tony Martin. Mem. at 15. There was little mystery about what the next act of the pre-trial play would be.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Advised that Rosemond's lead counsel had been present at each proffer session, the trial court held a\n    <em>\n     Curcio\n    </em>\n    hearing to ensure that Attorney Shargel's representation of Rosemond would not create a conflict of interest or an ethical impediment presenting an obstacle to his continued\n    representation and, most important, that Rosemond was aware of his right to counsel who was conflict- and impediment-free. Namely, Attorney Shargel was a witness to Rosemond's proffer sessions and might need to take the stand to rebut the government's evidence of what petitioner had proffered.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Opp. Ex. E. At the hearing, Attorney Shargel represented that his recollection of the proffer sessions did not differ from that of his co-counsel, and his co-counsel could, therefore, testify, if necessary. Opp. Ex. E at 15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    At trial, Shargel's opening statement was premised on the fact that Rosemond made misstatements, or outright lies, during the proffer sessions:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    [Rosemond] was going to come to the table and make a deal with the government.... He was going to cooperate, and he sat with them .... And you're going to find from the evidence in this case that Jimmy Rosemond went in and he made false accusations and false confessions....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    False confessions. He said he saw things that he didn't see. He said he did things that he didn't do. He says he was at places where he wasn't.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Tr. 56. Attorney Shargel then gave examples of Rosemond's \"false confessions,\" such as his claim that he met with an attorney in Los Angeles who, it turns out, was in Colorado on the date in question. Tr. 57. Attorney Shargel went on to reference in his opening an article written by Chuck Phillips: \"[Phillips] said in the article, in the Los Angeles Times, that Jimmy Rosemond was responsible for the 1994 shooting of Tupac Shakur. He was not. Jimmy Rosemond was not involved in that shooting.... You will learn more about that during the course of the trial.\" Tr. 45. Attorney Shargel's stratagem having failed, Rosemond now lambastes his trial counsel for an opening statement that told the jury that \"his own client told the government lies - and only lies - during his proffer sessions.\" Mem. at 46.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    There was also a more significant reaction. Immediately after Attorney Shargel's opening, the government latched on to the reference in it to petitioner's non-involvement in the 1983 murder to argue that \"Mr. Shargel has opened the door on the proffer statements\" and presumed, somewhat brashly, that \"all of the [proffer] statements are coming in.\" Tr. 59. In reply, Attorney Shargel acknowledged that this was his intended outcome, stating, \"Well, I certainly opened the door intentionally and deliberately,\" Tr. 60, doubling down on his theory that \"everything\" Rosemond said during the proffer sessions \"was untruthful.\" Tr. 61.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    During its closing statement, the government \"repeatedly relied on the fact that Mr. Rosemond confessed to the charged crimes,\" Mem. at 20, statements that were allowed into evidence, he complains now, because his trial counsel had opened the door to them. The government's \"tenth reason\" why the jury should convict Rosemond was that \"the defendant confessed to being the boss\" and that \"[o]n nine separate occasions, represented by two able Counsel, the defendant met with the Government and confessed to his involvement in every crime for which he has been charged in this case.\" Tr. 2486.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    In reality, though, the evidence extended far beyond his own words during the proffer sessions that his lawyer had branded as total lies. In traditional fashion, for example, one of the cooperating witnesses, Henry Butler, a member of the narcotics trafficking organization, would testify against him. Butler would reveal his pedigree on direct examination, testifying that he had previously pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm; that he faced a minimum of ten years in prison;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    and that the government had offered him a cooperation agreement, in which it would file a \"5(k)1 motion with the courts\" to \"allow[ ] the judge to sentence [him] below the minimum guideline\" if he fulfilled his part of the agreement. Tr. 789-91,802.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The defense sought to buttress its theory that the evidence, including confessions that Rosemond had told the government and which had been retold to the jury, was a collection of lies. It called as a witness Scott Srebnick, a Miami-area lawyer, who Rosemond had retained to represent him in a potential libel action against the Los Angeles Times. Tr. 2435. The Los Angeles Times had published an article, later discredited, connecting Rosemond with the murder of Tupac Shakur. Tr. 2436-37.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    On June 5, 2012, Rosemond was convicted on all counts. Dkt. No. 127. Rosemond moved for a new trial, in part based on what he claimed to be \"juror misconduct,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 33, and submitted to the court an affidavit by an individual, Jarrod Whittaker, who had met Rosemond ten years earlier and \"wanted to write an article about his trial.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. Ex. J (\"First Whittaker Affidavit\") \u00b6 1-2. The First Whittaker Affidavit relates that Whittaker searched on his computer \"to locate and interview one of the jurors\" from Rosemond's trial, Austin Olatunji.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     \u00b6 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Olatunji purportedly told Whittaker that two of his female co-jurors \"made it very clear that they opined that James Rosemond was guilty due to his involvement in the Tupac thing.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     \u00b6 5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The reported juror improprieties were raised by the defense at the time of sentencing. With apparent concern that the recollection of jurors be protected from taint by a frenzy of post-trial contact, the trial court barred the parties from contacting any of the jurors without prior judicial approval. Referring specifically to the Whittaker episode, the trial court warned counsel: \"It's true in any case, but this case has the specter of - I'm referring now to the activity that got Mr. Rosemond into my courtroom.... And I'll accept that this Whittaker did this on his own. No one contacts jurors in this case on behalf of the defense or the prosecution without running it through me first. Okay? Understood?\" Mem. Ex. F at 27. The court also orally denied the motion for a new trial.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Rosemond was then sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. Dkt. No. 244.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Rosemond's direct appeal to the Second Circuit advanced six grounds for relief:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    \u2022 The denial of his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel, which Attorney Shargel purportedly could not provide because he was present for, and a witness to, Rosemond's proffer sessions;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    \u2022 Juror misconduct violated his due process and fair trial rights;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    \u2022 Error in the admission of evidence of the possession of cocaine base, for which Rosemond had not been charged;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    \u2022 The imposition of a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment for engaging in continuing a criminal enterprise (\"CCE\") was not supported by legally sufficient evidence;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    \u2022 The CCE conviction, and that for the lesser included charge for conspiring to distribute cocaine, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    \u2022 The government's use of his proffer statements at trial violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Each appellate point was rejected by the Circuit except for the claim of double jeopardy. Indeed, the government had conceded that point, and Rosemond's conviction\n    on the count charging conspiracy to distribute cocaine was ordered to be vacated as a lesser included offense of his CCE conviction.\n    <em>\n     United Sates v. Rosemond (\"Rosemond E.D.N.Y. Appeal\")\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749920\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/595/26/#p31\">\n     595 F. App'x 26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 31 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    On March 10, 2016, Rosemond filed the instant petition, Dkt. No. 286, which included an out of the ordinary attachment in the form of an audio exhibit, supposedly a recording of an interview that Butler - the cooperating witness who had damned petitioner at trial - had engaged in with a \"reporter.\" In that interview, Butler seemingly brags about what Rosemond describes as a \"\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    arrangement\" with the government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. at 20; Mem. Ex. E. Specifically, Butler says that, in return for his cooperation, the government brought him sushi to eat, followed his son's football games and relayed statistics about his performance, allowed Butler access to an iPad, allowed him to eat barbeque, allowed visits with his wife and allowed Butler to \"act like [he] had a proffer session\" when, in reality, he was \"ordering lunch\" at the government's offices. Mem. at 20. Although the exact nature and authenticity of the recording are unsettled - Rosemond does not provide any information about the date or circumstances of the recording - the government assumes in its brief that the recording is authentic. Opp. at 17 n.9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Also attached to the memorandum submitted by Rosemond on this petition is a new and improved affidavit by Whittaker, supplying more detail about alleged juror misconduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. Ex. K (\"Second Whittaker Affidavit\"). Unlike the first, which mentioned nothing about it, the Second Whittaker Affidavit asserts that the co-jurors of tipster Olatunji \"admitted they had researched Mr. Rosemond's connection with Tupac Shakur on the internet\" and \"broadly and generally conducted research on James Rosemond on the internet.\" Mem. Ex. K \u00b6 2. Additionally, Whittaker opines that \"[t]his is what bothered [Olatunji] specifically; so it was clear that he did not believe the female jurors were basing their conclusions on trial evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Already on a winding road, even more twists would be revealed in Rosemond's\n    <em>\n     habeas\n    </em>\n    proceeding. Brought to new focus, for example, was the fact that Rosemond had also caught the eye of prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Rosemond, in fact, was tried twice in the Southern District for the 2010 Fletcher murder, a topic of Rosemond's proffers in this case. Following a mistrial, Rosemond was convicted at a second trial and was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Rosemond (\"Rosemond S.D.N.Y.

Hope apparently springing eternal, Rosemond had similarly proffered in the Southern District in expectation of a cooperation agreement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173717\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/95/#p103\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173717\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/95/#p103\">\n     at 103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That failed effort brought the prosecution's use of his proffers at trial to the Second Circuit, which remanded, holding that the scope of the proffer agreement unduly restricted his counsel's presentation and argument to the jury.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173717\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/95/#p103\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173717\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/95/#p103\">\n     at 106, 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Mem. at 27. Given that the decision on whether to extend a cooperation agreement or file a \"substantial assistance motion,\" pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1, is generally left to the government's discretion,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

As described earlier, none of the items on Rosemond's list of undisclosed impeachment materials involves anything related to Butler's exposure to criminal liability. Rather, founded on an audio recording of him, they all relate to the conditions of Butler's confinement in the period prior to taking the stand at trial to point the finger at Rosemond. In other words, without disclosure to the defense, and in return for his cooperation, petitioner argues that Butler received more than a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance letter.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Mem. at 39;\n    <em>\n     see also supra\n    </em>\n    Background (listing benefits).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Curiously, as the government observes, despite the critical importance of the audio recording to the claim he makes and despite the government's repeated requests for it, Rosemond has never \"identified the date or source of the recording.\" Opp. at 17 n.9. Nonetheless, the government responds directly to the claim Rosemond bases on the recording and the essential thrust of his argument that Butler had a strong incentive to testify against him because of these undisclosed benefits, and that the government's failure to disclose them (or elicit testimony to that effect) violated his constitutional rights by denying him an effective opportunity to question him. Mem. at 39.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Having assumed the existence and accuracy of the tape's transcription for the sake of argument, the government then flatly denies Butler's supposed account of his treatment during his proffering and before he testified at trial. In evidentiary support, the government attached to its opposition papers two affidavits: one from DEA Special Agent Steven J. Miller, who investigated the case against Butler, and another from Butler's attorney, Jason Russo. Special Agent Miller attended many of Butler's meetings with the government. Opp. Ex. B. \u00b6 4. One by one, Special Agent Miller contradicts each of Butler's various boasts. The Miller Affidavit avers, for example, that Butler never received sushi or barbeque (but did receive barbeque-flavored, rather than regular, potato chips); that Butler's son's football games were discussed with agents only in the ordinary course of case preparation; that Butler used Special Agent Miller's iPad but solely to look up telephone numbers of the \"associates and coconspirators he was speaking about\"; that Butler did not attend phony proffer sessions as a break from detention; and that, to the best of Special Agent Miller's knowledge, Butler did not have any \"face-to-face contact\" with his wife.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 6-10. For the most part, Attorney Russo's\n    account corroborated the Miller Affidavit, although he acknowledged that he, and not the government, had brought for his client sushi \"on one occasion.\" Opp. Ex. C. \u00b6 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The defense frames all of these benefits as \"withheld information\" that constituted \"false testimony\" when Butler did not disclose them while cross-examined by Attorney Shargel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 893 (\"Q: So, you are testifying here, as we have it, in return for a promise that if you tell the truth, you will be rewarded with a 5K1 letter, right?

The Second Circuit has established two slightly different tests for cases like these, involving alleged \"perjury\" or \"false evidence.\" Under one test, a court must ask (i) \"whether the perjury was material to the jury's verdict\" and also (ii) the \"extent to which the prosecution knew or should have known about the perjury\"; under the other, whether (i) \"the witness actually committed perjury\" and whether the alleged perjury was (ii) material, (iii) known or constructively known to the government at the time of trial and (iv) undisclosed during trial.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

To make matters more complex, two standards of review exist based on whether the government had knowledge of the alleged perjury:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    If the prosecution knew or should have known of the perjury, the conviction must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury. But where the government was unaware of the perjury, a new trial is warranted only if the testimony was material and the court [is left] with a firm belief that but for the perjured testimony, the defendant would most likely not have been convicted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     Ferguson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756274\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/260/#p282\">\n     676 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    280 n.19 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    All of these tests point to the same outcome here. First, petitioner avoids acknowledging that Butler's answer was an entirely truthful response to Attorney Shargel's question about the government's promise to him in connection with a prospective \u00a7 5K1.1 letter. The defense\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    asked Butler whether he had also received other benefits. Of course, it is no wonder why defense counsel did not go that far: the prospect of a substantial assistance motion was the single most important incentive Butler had to testify against Rosemond, and that information was already before the jury. The other benefits Butler boasts about were, at most, window dressing. To be sure, there is a world of difference between a witness falsely answering a question on cross-examination and, essentially, him not volunteering additional information that was outside the scope of the question asked.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Second, there is no evidence - other than a recording of undisclosed origin - that the government actually gave Butler any of these benefits. Rosemond fails to offer any reason why any weight should be given to the unsworn, uncorroborated account Butler supposedly gave an unknown reporter, at an unknown time and under unknown circumstances, much less even greater weight than to sworn affidavits\n    from a special agent assigned to the case and Butler's own attorney. The two affidavits disprove most of Butler's account.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Third, even assuming that the government did offer all of these so-labeled benefits, Rosemond still would not be entitled to\n    <em>\n     habeas\n    </em>\n    relief because there is no reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury. The jury was already aware that Butler was receiving perhaps the most valuable benefit of all: a potential sentence-reducing substantial assistance motion. Butler's testimony simply corroborated otherwise \"suffocating evidence\" of Rosemond's guilt,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Mem. Ex. F at 28-29, and his counsel had the opportunity to, and did, impeach Butler's credibility at trial. Butler testified about his decades-long history of crime, including \"illegal gun-possession, a shooting, larceny, bribery, witness tampering, perjury, extensive drug use and trafficking, gang membership, use of aliases, and lies to federal agents (including lies related to this case).\" Opp. at 21-22;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Tr. 795-801. Defense counsel questioned Butler on his history of lying, especially his lies during the course of Rosemond's case,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Tr. 875, 890, 918, 926, and vigorously attacked Butler's credibility during summation:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    But I suggest that this was not a small lie when Henry Butler told the Government, over and over again, that he had nothing to do with the Rolling 60 Crips [gang].

You know when he discloses? After you folks are selected as jurors.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Tr. 2617-18. And, contrary to the picture Rosemond attempts to paint now - that Butler was a \"star witness\" on whose testimony the prosecution's case relied - the reality is that Butler was but one tile in a mosaic of evidence against Rosemond. Butler's testimony was corroborated by other sources, both with respect to his own role as a cocaine supplier,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Tr. 277-78, 393, 451, 1976, and Rosemond's role in obstructing justice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. 456-63, 483-89, 860-64, 2161-70.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plainly, notwithstanding any purported failure to disclose \"benefits\" like upgraded meals and occasional iPad usage, jurors considered significant evidence central to Butler's credibility.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Even putting the Shargel Affidavit aside, Rosemond acknowledges that he received advice from counsel and only claims now that it was inadequate. But, beyond dispute, Rosemond also signed a proffer agreement in which he acknowledged, in writing, that his proffer statements could be used against him, but only \"as substantive evidence to rebut, directly or indirectly, any evidence offered or elicited, or factual assertions made\" on his behalf at trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. Ex.

H. \u00b6 4. Yet, the advice Rosemond says he received from counsel matches precisely what the proffer agreements allowed him to do if they did not blossom into a cooperation agreement: mount a defense. The clear language of the agreements, however, made as plain as day that certain defense tactics would trigger the government's right to admit some or all of\n    his proffer statements against him. Obviously, both client and counsel believed that pursuing a cooperation agreement was in petitioner's best interest and were aware that the proffers might fail and that failure would restrict the defense at trial, but that, as Attorney Shargel advised correctly, a defense could still be asserted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    There is nothing in the record that undermines this shared understanding.

He argues that his counsel's attempt to discredit the proffer statements in his opening,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Tr. 56., was, figuratively, \"attack[ing] the disease by killing the patient.\" Mem. at 46.

Mem. at 46-47. Somehow, he says, all of this makes the resulting unconstitutionally deficient assistance of counsel \"self-evident.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Attorney Shargel embraces the strategy as deliberate and represents it was designed to \"provide [Rosemond] the only meaningful opportunity to defend against the charges in the Indictment.\" Opp. Ex.

Attorney Shargel was then confronted with the reality that, as the proffer agreements advised Rosemond in plain English, certain defenses would trigger the admission of his self-incriminating statements at trial. Attorney Shargel had to reshape his defense to meet that reality. What needed to be evaluated was whether a defense unfettered by concerns that it might trigger the admissibility of the proffers was better than a defense that attacked the believability of Rosemond's self-incrimination. The strategic choice by Attorney Shargel was, if at all erroneous, not so off the mark \"that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\"\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     466 U.S. at 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In any event, it is not necessary to rest decision on this prong of Strickland because Rosemond clearly fails to carry his burden on the prejudice prong.

The hand Attorney Shargel was dealt by Rosemond's lies also helps to explain why\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    does not require courts to punish \"gambles\" that fail to carry the day. The interplay between\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    's two prongs creates a sort of sliding scale in a court's analysis. Stronger prosecutions frequently will prompt defense counsel to make gasp-inducing, Hail Mary passes; in these circumstances, however, prejudice -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    a reasonable likelihood of a different outcome - is less likely to occur.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519209\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/845/#p862\">\n     908 F.3d at 862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The prejudice inquiry is therefore ineluctably tied to the strength of the prosecution's evidence.

This high risk, high reward strategy is exactly what Rosemond, in the near perfect vision of hindsight, now criticizes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Of course, Rosemond's argument would carry greater weight if the circumstances were such that the government's case-in-chief was so wafer-thin as to be doomed from the start. Attorney Shargel's strategy, given those facts, would have been\n    <em>\n     needlessly\n    </em>\n    risky. But Attorney Shargel, in his reasonable and professional judgment, believed that, given the air-tight case the government had here, opening the door to the introduction of those proffer statements was his best, and perhaps only, opportunity to obtain an acquittal.

Ex. F at 27, and, thus, neither the trial court nor the Second Circuit had an opportunity consider the \"facts\" set forth in the Second Whittaker Affidavit.

Without passing on the government's argument that this claim has been defaulted, the Court will consider Rosemond's argument, especially given that the Second Circuit's decision hinged, in large measure, on the absence of what the Second Whittaker Affidavit now purports to produce: an allegation that jurors conduct independent research in violation of the trial court's instructions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    1. Consideration of Information Outside the Record\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Almost seven years since verdict, there is not a speck of direct evidence that any Rosemond juror accessed or considered any information about petitioner or the matter in controversy other than that which was revealed in the courtroom by Rosemond's own counsel at trial. All that petitioner offers is the double hearsay account of a non-juror, about what a juror told him, of what he heard two other jurors say - indeed, an account that was revised years after it was first determined\n    to be factually insufficient to support relief. Rosemond nonetheless contends that this provides \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that jurors were \"exposed to improper influences.\" Mem. at 50.

There must be some evidentiary showing that any violation of the trial court's instruction not to do any independent research and to consider only evidence in the record affected the defendant to his detriment. All that Rosemond offers is the Second Whittaker Affidavit, which falls well short of any such showing. To the extent the affidavit recounts Whittaker's journalistic impression of juror Olatunji's unsworn understanding of what he recalls two other unidentified jurors as saying, it carries little, if any, weight.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Moreover, putting aside Whittaker's impressions of what he thought Olatunji believed or now says he believes, a hearing cannot be justified based merely on Olatunji's comment that he had overheard conversations between two of his co-jurors, in which they said that they had researched Rosemond's \"connection with Tupac Shakur on the internet\"; \"found information attributing\" the shooting of Mr. Shakur to Rosemond; and also \"broadly\" researched Rosemond on the internet.\" Mem. Ex. K \u00b6 2. That is so because, even crediting the double hearsay, although the conduct of Olatunji's co-jurors would have violated standard instructions given to them, none of this suggests the kind of prejudice that would require an evidentiary hearing. To conclude otherwise would be to overlook the obvious. Beyond the overwhelming evidence of guilt, Rosemond, essentially, admitted all of the facts supposedly unearthed by the two jurors, including his (debunked) connection to the murder of Tupac Shakur, in the proffer statements introduced at trial.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Tr. 2435-37 (examination of Scott Srebnick about libel action Rosemond contemplated bringing against the Los Angeles Times in response to the newspaper's connecting him with the murder of Mr. Shakur).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    At bottom, there is no showing, even crediting Whittaker's double-hearsay affidavit, that any of the jurors learned harmful information about Rosemond not otherwise revealed at trial or that, in light of the actual evidence, there was any overall prejudice. Consequently, even assuming that a violation of the trial court's instruction regarding juror conduct occurred here, in the absence of demonstrable prejudice, case law does not countenance an evidentiary hearing into the jury's decision making.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    2. Harmless Error\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Furthermore, this conclusion is buttressed by the application of harmless error analysis. Assuming only for argument\n    that jurors consulted information outside the record, that they shared it with the other jurors and that the jury relied on it, Rosemond would not be entitled to relief if the government demonstrated that the misconduct was harmless. Clearly, although it \"is well-settled that any extra-record information of which a juror becomes aware is presumed prejudicial[, a] government showing that the information is harmless will overcome this presumption.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

As a result, there was \"no plausible theory for how Fumo suffered any prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, from Juror 1's Facebook and Twitter comments.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828964\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/288/#p306\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 306 ;\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Those circumstances, however, are not present here.\") (internal footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Likewise, here, to the extent that any purported view of a juror regarding the defendant on trial became public, it occurred after trial - not in an online post by a juror but in a double-hearsay account of a journalist. That distinction might weaken the magnitude of the claimed harm, but would not in and of itself overcome the presumed harmfulness of the claim misconduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    But, more significant to the circumstances here, with respect to Juror 2's exposure to extra-record information, the Third Circuit looked at six factors to determine \"whether there was substantial prejudice\":\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    \u2022 (1) Whether the extraneous information related to one of the elements of the case;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    \u2022 (2) The extent of the jury's exposure to the extraneous information;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    \u2022 (3) The time at which the jury received the extraneous information;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    \u2022 (4) The length of the jury's deliberations and the structure of the verdict;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n    \u2022 (5) The existence of jury instructions from the court about considering only evidence developed in the case; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    \u2022 (6) Whether there was a heavy volume of incriminating evidence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 307. The court held that the first and fourth factors weighed in Fumo's favor but were \"easily overwhelmed by the second, fifth and sixth factors, which weigh heavily against a finding of substantial prejudice.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The facts that the conviction occurred almost 30 years earlier (and was overturned); that the district court gave \"careful and repeated instructions\" to the jurors to limit their deliberations to only the evidence at trial; and that there was a \"heavy volume\" of incriminating evidence were sufficient to find that prejudice was absent.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Uncontradicted facts in the record in this collateral proceeding make clear that an evidentiary invasion into the jury's deliberative process is unwarranted because, applying those facts to the harmless error analytical framework, it is crystal clear that any error attributable to juror misconduct here was harmless. Specifically, the only hot button information that the Second Whittaker Affidavit surmises the researching jurors might have obtained related to a shooting occurring in 1996, more than 15 years before trial and which the jury was told at trial had\n    <em>\n     nothing\n    </em>\n    to do with Rosemond. Moreover, the record demonstrates that the trial judge properly charged the jury on considering only the evidence presented at trial. Lastly, and quite significantly, there was a heavy volume of incriminating evidence, including the testimony of five cooperating witnesses corroborated by physical evidence that firmly established Rosemond's guilt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The conclusion that neither an evidentiary hearing nor a new trial be afforded to Rosemond is well supported by relevant Second Circuit case law. The Circuit has affirmed findings of harmless error in cases involving a wide range of conduct where jurors were unlikely to reach a different result; for instance, where an \"unbalanced\" and \"disturbed\" juror was excused after making accusatory comments about the defendant to co-jurors,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Peterson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319396\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/127/#p136\">\n     385 F.3d 127\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 136 (2d Cir. 2004) (reasoning that the \"remaining jurors already disbelieved the excluded juror\"); where a juror, during the trial of a CPA for mail fraud, reviewed a textbook on bookkeeping and read an excerpt to his co-jurors that explained a CPA's responsibilities and training,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Weiss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297202\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/777/#p782\">\n     752 F.2d 777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 782 (2d Cir. 1985) ; and where an unredacted transcript of grand jury testimony was submitted to the jury without affording defendants an opportunity to respond,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Simmons\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545976\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/934/#p944\">\n     923 F.2d 934\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 944-45 (2d Cir. 1991) (ruling that the redacted testimony was \"cumulative\" of evidence introduced at trial).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The path forward here is clear. Rosemond relies on a second version of a journalist's double-hearsay affidavit, submitted years after trial, in sole support of a third bite at upsetting the decision-making of a jury without the slightest showing that the alleged misconduct of the two jurors caused an iota of prejudice. An evidentiary hearing invades the secrecy that safeguards the functioning of one of the most sacrosanct institutions of our criminal justice system. The facts presented here do not require such a hearing. Any error in\n    the conduct of the jury was demonstrably harmless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Unsealing\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Finally, the government requests that the documents filed by the parties related to this petition be unsealed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 2 n.1.

Consequently, because neither party has made a persuasive showing that the documents concerning Rosemond's\n    <em>\n     habeas\n    </em>\n    petition remain under seal, and notwithstanding that they might contain copies of documents otherwise under seal, the Court orders that they be unsealed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
