The case turns on the amount of depreciation which should be allowed plaintiff because of his interest in the property from which the revenue was derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-28\">The details are set out in the findings of fact. During the year 1936 plaintiff was one of the beneficiaries of a trust established by the will of Charles F. Grey, who died May 10, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-29\">By the terms of the will one-half of the net income for a period of twenty years was to be paid to certain charitable organizations, the other half to individuals. Plaintiff as one of the beneficiaries received during the taxable year one-fourth of the one-half of the income that was allotted to individuals, or, in other words, one-eighth of the total net income for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-30\">By the terms of the will the trustees were to receive, hold and manage the properties, collect the income and profits, sell and lease the properties under certain conditions, pay all costs, charges and expenses of the estate and pay out the income currently on the basis indicated. There was no specific provision in the will as to deduction for or apportionment of depreciation on the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The income of the trust for 1936 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">Nontaxable income (gross) ..................$5,189.23</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">Taxable income (gross) ...................... 85,899.54</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">Depreciation .................................. 16,548.47</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">Deductible expenditures ..................... 11,654.09</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">In reporting his income for 1936, which included income from other sources, the plaintiff reported $2,641.90 as the total amount of taxable income received from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that plaintiff\u2019s taxable income received from the trust was $7,212.12. The computation was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">Taxable gross income ...................... $85,899.54</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">Less:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">Depreciation .................... $16,548.47</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">Deductible expenditures........ 11,654.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-14\">- 28,202.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-15\">Net income .............................. 57,696.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-16\">One-half distributable to charitable organization ................................. 28,848.49</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-17\">One-half distributable to individual beneficiaries ........... 28,S48.49</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">The plaintiff\u2019s share was computed as one-fourth of the one-half distributable to individuals. The Commissioner accordingly levied a deficiency assessment which was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">Plaintiff filed a timely claim for refund with interest in the aggregate sum of $1,465.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">The gist of plaintiff\u2019s claim is that under the applicable statute the Commissioner should have allocated the nontaxable income, and the entire depreciation to the taxable individual beneficiaries instead of allocating a portion of it to the charitable organizations which were nontaxable. The plaintiff has waived the question as to the apportionment of nontaxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">The question is whether the plaintiff, who received one-eighth of the distributable income of the trust in 1936, is entitled to a deduction of one-eighth of the depreciation sustained on the trust property, or whether he is entitled to claim one-fourth on the ground that individual beneficiaries are entitled to deduct the entire depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-22\">The applicable statutes are set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-23\">Plaintiff makes a very plausible argument that the language of section 162(-a), especially the expression \u201cwithout limitation\u201d, shows that the intention of Congress was to give the taxable-income beneficiaries the entire depreciation, and that therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>since plaintiff is entitled to one-fourth of the taxable income he is entitled to one-fourth of the depreciation. He appeals to the legislative history of the quoted sections as bearing out his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The effect of plaintiff\u2019s contention would be to give him the benefit of depreciation on that part of the property in which he had neither a legal nor an equitable interest. If such position is correct, the settlor of a trust might convey 95 percent of the income to charities and 5 percent to an individual and such an individual, by deducting depreciation on the entire property, might escape taxes altogether. To justify such an inequitable conclusion would require a very clear mandate of the statute. Of course, if the statute shows that as the manifest intention of the Congress we have no choice but to apply it, regardless of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Do the provisions of the statute when read together show this to be the intent of the Congress? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Section 23(?) under the heading of \u201cDepreciation\u201d contains the following language :</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cIn the case of property held in trust the allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the instrument creating the trust, or, in the absence of such provisions, on the basis of the trust income allocable to each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">It is the effect of plaintiff\u2019s position that the term \u201cincome beneficiaries\u201d as here used refers to taxable income beneficiaries, and that since the charitable beneficiaries are not taxable, it applies in the case at bar only to the individual beneficiaries. A careful reading of the quoted sentence shows otherwise. The term \u201cincome beneficiaries\u201d in the first part of the sentence is carried forward with the same meaning into the last expression \u201con the basis of the trust income allocable to each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">If there had been a provision in the trust instrument that the trustee should set up a reserve for depreciation and distribute the net balance, then charitable beneficiaries would have borne their part of the depreciation and the plaintiff would have received only that part of the depreciation which was allocable to his interest. Since the instrument did not provide for such a reserve, the charitable organizations bore the loss that was occasioned by depreciation in the form of subsequently reduced income. It seems very clear from this provision that plaintiff was entitled only to the depreciation allocable to his interest, and not to his interest plus a corresponding part of the depreciation attributable to the interest of the charitable beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Plaintiff, however, contends that section 162(a), by the use of the words \u201cwithout limitation\u201d, shows that he was entitled to the depreciation on his proportion of the taxable income. This position was decided adversely to plaintiff in the case of Grey v. Commissioner, 41 B.T.A. 234, and in the same case by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 118 F.2d 153, 141 A.L.R. 1113. In fact, the identical questions involved here were presented in that case by another of the beneficiaries under this trust instrument. In the Grey case, supra, the Board of Tax Appeals in constru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ing the words \u201cwithout limitation\u201d at page 243 of 41 B.T.A. uses the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\u201cPetitioner argues that the words \u2018without limitation\u2019 appearing in section 162(a) preclude us from doing what we have indicated we think should be done, but we do not so construe these words. When they are examined in their context it is obvious that they were used merely to direct that a trust, more than 15 percent of the income of which was used for the prescribed\u2014 charitable \u2014 purposes, should not be limited to \u201815 per centum of the taxpayer\u2019s net income\u2019 as provided in section 23(o). The parenthetical clause of section 162(a), we think, clearly justifies this conclusion. We, therefore, sustain the respondent upon this issue and hold that petitioner is entitled to deduct only 4% percent of the depreciation sustained upon the trust property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In the case of Newbury v. United States, 57 F.Supp. 168, 102 Ct.Cl. 192, 202, the court quoted the committee report explaining changes in the Revenue Act of 1928 which were made by the act of 1934. This report shows the purposes for which the changes were made and indicates that they were other than those contended for by the plaintiff. The same applicable provisions were carried forward into the act of 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">We find nothing in the legislative history nor in the previous decisions in similar cases, nor in the wording of the statute itself, when construed as a whole, to support the contention that the expression \u201cincome beneficiaries\u201d, as used in the statute, is limited to taxable income beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">We are unable to give substantial weight to the plaintiff\u2019s position that the Congress made the additional allowance for depreciation to taxable income beneficiaries in order to encourage charitable bequests. The charitable organizations would get no benefit from such a construction. The additional allowance would result in the plaintiff\u2019s paying a lesser amount of income tax, but would not affect the charitable beneficiaries in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">We do not regard the facts and the decision in the case of Commissioner v. Pupin\u2019s Estate, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 745 applicable to the facts in this case. That case involved the liability of the executor for an estate tax and concerned other provisions of the Revenue Act than those involved in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">We find that the Commissioner was right in allocating the depreciation allowable to the plaintiff on the basis of his proportionate interest in the entire income distributable by the terms of the trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Plaintiff is not entitled to recover and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">HOWELL, MADDEN, WHITAKER, and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-24\"> Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1652.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-25\">\u201cSec. 23.
