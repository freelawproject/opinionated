McCree, be removed from office and conditionally suspended without pay for six years beginning on January 1, 2015 \u2014 with the suspension becoming effective only if respondent is reelected to judicial office in November 2014 \u2014 and that he be ordered to pay costs in the amount of $11,645.17. Respondent has filed a petition asking this Court to reject that recommendation. We affirm almost all of the JTC\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, and we adopt its recommendation. The evidence establishes that respondent (a) had a sexual relationship with a complaining witness in a case pending before him without recusing himself for several months, (b) engaged in numerous ex parte communications with her concerning the case, as well as concerning another case in which one of her relatives was a party, (c) violated various policies of the courthouse by permitting his mistress to enter the facility through an employee entrance without going through security, allowing her to remain alone in his chambers while he was on the bench, arranging for her to park her vehicle in an area reserved for judges, and sneaking her cell phone into the courthouse for her, (d) transmitted numerous text messages to her while he was on the bench that contained inappropriate and derogatory references to defendants, litigants, and witnesses appearing before him, (e) lied about when and why he finally did recuse himself from the case in which his mistress was the complaining witness, (f) sought to use the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office as leverage against his then ex-mistress by concocting charges of stalking and extortion against her, and (g) lied under oath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>during the JTC proceedings. The cumulative effect of respondent\u2019s misconduct convinces this Court that respondent should not remain in judicial office, and we therefore remove him from office and conditionally suspend him without pay for six years beginning on January 1, 2015, with the suspension becoming effective only if respondent is reelected to judicial office in November 2014. In addition, because respondent engaged in conduct involving \u201cdeceit, or intentional misrepresentation,\u201d pursuant to MCR 9.205(B) we order respondent to pay costs of $11,645.17 to the JTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In respondent\u2019s words in his own defense, \u201cWade should have recused himself,\u201d but the failure to do so resulted in \u201cno harm no foul.\u201d We disagree. The \u201charm\u201d done was to the parties\u2019 rights to a fair legal process and the public\u2019s right to an impartial judiciary, and the \u201cfoul\u201d committed was the resulting violation of Michigan\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On January 7, 2013, pursuant to MCR 9.219(A)(2), the JTC filed a petition for the interim suspension without pay of respondent. By order of February 8, 2013, this Court granted the petition, effective immediately. <em>In re McCree, </em>493 Mich 935 (2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 12, 2013, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 93 against respondent, alleging five counts of misconduct. It asserted that respondent had engaged in (a) \u201cimproper conduct [in] <em>People v King\u201d </em>(Wayne Circuit Court Case No. 12-003141-01-FH); (b) the \u201cfalse report of a felony\u201d; (c) \u201cimproper conduct [in] <em>People v Tillman\u201d </em>(Wayne Circuit Court Case No. 12-000686-01-FH); (d) \u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>proper bench conduct and demeanor\u201d; and (e) \u201cmisrepresentations to the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">With regard to Count I, the complaint alleged that between May and November 2012, respondent had a sexual relationship with Geniene LaShay Mott, who was the complaining witness in <em>People v King. </em>Robert King, the father of one of Mott\u2019s children, was the defendant in that case, which pertained to his failure to pay Mott child support. Respondent and Mott repeatedly engaged in ex parte communications about the <em>King </em>case. For example, in response to Mott\u2019s texted suggestion to impose a jail sentence until King paid $2,500, respondent texted back:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I figured if [he] hasn\u2019t come current by his courtdate, he gets jail 2 pay. If he says he can bring me the $$, I\u2019ll put him on a tether till he brings the receipt 2 FOC or do \u2018double time\u2019.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Respondent asked Mott to keep their relationship confidential because of the then-pending JTC investigation regarding respondent\u2019s previous conduct of having texted a photograph of himself without a shirt to a female deputy sheriff and telling a reporter in response to questions about his actions that \u201cthere is no shame in my game.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, on June 20, 2012, respondent included the following in an email to Mott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">My Judicial Tenure Commission matter has me nervous, as you might expect. I have to be real careful until this matter is put to rest. I can only ask humbly for your indulgence. Sorry. Second, you are the complaining witness on a case that is before me. Naturally if it got out that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>were seeing each other before your B.D.\u2019s[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] case closed, everybody could be in deep shit. [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Respondent did not transfer the <em>King </em>case to another judge until September 18, 2012, at which point respondent sent the following text message to Mott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">DONE DEAL!!!!:-) I told a story so well, I had me believing it!! Brother King is on his way 2 \u2018hangin\u2019 Judge [James A.] Callahan. He fuck up ONCE &amp; he\u2019s through!![<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">With regard to Count II, the complaint alleged that respondent later made a false stalking/extortion complaint against Mott with the Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office. He also falsely told the prosecutor\u2019s office that he had transferred the <em>King </em>case immediately upon starting his relationship with Mott and that Mott had demanded $10,000 in return for terminating her pregnancy and not revealing respondent\u2019s affair with her to respondent\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">With regard to Count III, the complaint alleged that respondent was involved in another failure-to-pay-child-support case in which Mott had an interest\u2014 <em>People v Tillman. </em>The defendant in that case was a relative of Mott\u2019s. Respondent and Mott engaged in ex parte communications regarding this case as well. Off the record, and in the absence of any motion being filed, respondent signed an order for the reduction of bond relating to Mott\u2019s relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">With regard to Count iy the complaint alleged that respondent transmitted numerous text messages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Mott while he was on the bench. Many of these text messages contained inappropriate and sexually explicit comments. For example, respondent texted Mott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Oh yeah, I text from the bench. After last nite, its all I can do not 2 jerk off \u2018under\u2019 the bench:-). U know U have a magnificent pair of legs!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Numerous text messages respondent transmitted from the bench contained inappropriate and derogatory personal references to defendants, litigants, and witnesses appearing before him. For example, he texted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">C\u2019mon, U\u2019r talking about the \u2018docket from Hell\u2019; filled w/tatted up, overweight, half-ass English speaking, gap tooth skank hoes....and then U walk N.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">He also texted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">2 funny, I just had Monica Conyers\u2019[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] nephew B4 me (ignorant shit...as usual).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Finally, with regard to Count <em>V, </em>the complaint alleged that respondent made several misrepresentations to the JTC. For example, respondent told the JTC that he had irrevocably terminated his relationship with Mott on October 31, 2012, although he actually continued his affair with Mott into November 2012. Respondent also told the JTC that he did not take any action on the <em>Tillman </em>case in November 2012, but he actually signed an order for reduction of bond in that month. In addition, respondent told the JTC that he did not know of any familial relationship between Tillman and Mott, but he did, in fact, know that they were relatives. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Also on March 12, 2013, the JTC filed a request for the appointment of a master. Three days later, on March 15, 2013, this Court appointed the Honorable Charles A. Nelson, a former circuit judge in Jackson County, as the master, and hearings began on May 20, 2013, and concluded on May 29, 2013. On June 23, 2013, the master filed his findings of fact and conclusions of law with the JTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">With regard to Count I, the master found that respondent should have disqualified himself from the <em>King </em>case as soon as he started a relationship with Mott and that \u201c[f]or McCree to claim in sworn testimony during these proceedings that it was an OVERSIGHT or it didn\u2019[t] DAWN on him that he should recuse himself is not credible. In short he lied to the JTC.\u201d Respondent intentionally used his judicial position to advance his own interests by holding on to the <em>King </em>case in order to keep Mott interested in him. According to the master, \u201cHe had a hot young lady who was in his words \u2018eye candy\u2019 and a way to keep her interested was to keep her case and be of assistance in the collection of money.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent also continuously engaged in ex parte communications with Mott about the case, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>led her to believe that she could influence his judicial decisions. \u201cMott was providing input, without objection by McCree, as to how King should be dealt with,\u201d and this \u201csocial relationship gave Mott the belief that she was able to influence his judicial duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">With regard to Count II, the master found that respondent lied to the prosecutor\u2019s office when he told them that Mott was stalking him and trying to extort money from him and that he had recused himself from the <em>King </em>case when he found out that a child of Mott\u2019s had interacted with one of his children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIt is clear that he was improperly seeking to get the prosecutor and her office involved with alleged crimes that were not existent.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">With regard to Count III, the master found that when respondent signed the order reducing Tillman\u2019s bond, he was just \u201cconfirming in the order what had already been done by [Judge Kevin E] Robbins.\u201d However, the master further concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>[Respondent and Mott] were communicating with texts. He was advising what had to be done when the order was signed and how they would get Tillman out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">The main import of the matter to me is that he again had a case in which Mott had an interest. He was ethically not to be involved and should not have been signing any orders pertaining to the case. McCree\u2019s actions were beyond an appearance of impropriety \u2014 they were in violation of the ethical standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">With regard to Count IY the master found that although many of the text messages that respondent sent while he was on the bench were inappropriate, they were \u201cused in a private context and when used there was no reason to believe that the statements would become public\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he fact that he may have sent some messages from the bench (as in Tillman) does not mean that he was not performing as a judge.\u201d Therefore, the master concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">[t]here is no showing that the sending of the texts in any way interfered with his duties as a judge. I do not believe that this count rises to the level of judicial misconduct.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Finally, with regard to Count <em>V, </em>the master found that respondent did not falsely tell the JTC that he had irrevocably terminated his relationship with Mott on October 31, 2012, because \u201cthere is no indication that a sexual relationship continued after that date.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And although respondent lied to the JTC about not knowing that Mott and Tillman were relatives and not taking any action on the <em>Tillman </em>case, this \u201cdoes not appear to be a material misrepresentation as the Examiner had all of the texts and had an accurate picture when the answer was filed.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the master concluded that \u201cthese alle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>gations are not such as to warrant action by the JTC.\u201d In conclusion, the master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">In final summary there is Shame in the McCree game: shame to the good name of McCree and shame brought upon the judiciary of the State of Michigan.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The JTC then held a hearing on August 5, 2013, and issued its decision and recommendation for discipline on September 10, 2013. With regard to Count I, the JTC found that respondent had a sexual affair with Mott, who was a complaining witness in a case before him, and that respondent regularly engaged in ex parte communications with Mott regarding the case, even while he was sitting on the bench. For example, respondent and Mott exchanged the following text messages regarding the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\"><em>Mott-. </em>Just keep in mind thur ill be in ur courtroom &amp; need 2 bring in my phone so I can text U what I want done incase he makes payment that morning.......otherwise lock his ass up until he pays 2500 in cash directly 2 me via FOC... u seem 2 always call his case last so ill show up late &amp; we can leave 2gether.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Respondent: Likewise, my truck will B unlocked so U can set anything out of sight N my car. We\u2019ll hold the case till U get there, or B sure 2 call Sharon Grier ahead of time so she\u2019ll know U (the \u2018C.P.\u2019)[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] will B N the courtroom. I figured if [he] hasn\u2019t come current by his courtdate, he gets jail 2 pay. If he says he can bring me the $$, I\u2019ll put him on a tether till he brings the receipt 2 FOC or do \u2018double time\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\"><em>Mott: </em>Huh??? Teether? 4 how long and how much??</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\"><em>Respondent: </em>Oooops, did I misspell \u2018tether\u2019. No, some guys say if they get locked up they can\u2019t bring the $$, but if let out they can. So here\u2019s the deal: go 2 jail (150 days), release upon payment of $1500. OR, get a tether &amp; bring back w/n 30 days $2500 or serve 9 months! BONUS: pay w/n the 30 days, remove tether</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\"><em>Mott: </em>He\u2019s about 15k behind... 2500 is asking much plus YOU only ordered him 2 pay $50 bucks a month towards arrage . ,@ that rate ill be getting CS[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] til Racheal is 26</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\"><em>Respondent: </em>OK, the math will be based on his failures since being placed on probation, but if U\u2019r righ the threat of jail will loosen his purse strings!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\"><em>Mott: </em>ok so let\u2019s go with what u proposed.....go to jail (150 days), release upon payment of $1500. OR, get a tether &amp; bring back w/n 30 days $2500 or serve 9 months! BONUS: pay w/n 30 days, remove tether</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\"><em>Mott: </em>He will pay cause they won\u2019t let him go 2 jail PLUS u sending him 2 jail would violate his Oakland county probation and he gets lOyrs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Respondent: </em>Cool. I\u2019ll run it by the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\"><em>Mott: </em>Make sure she\u2019s aware they already let him off by accepting 400 for probation when they told him 1000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\"><em>Respondent: </em>Will do. That\u2019s good <em>2 </em>know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Then, on the morning of the review hearing in the <em>King </em>case, respondent and Mott exchanged the following text messages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\"><em>Respondent: </em>I think Ur B.D. is here!!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\"><em>Mott: </em>Did the prosecuter agree wit our deal since she cut him a break .last time??</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\"><em>Respondent: </em>Look 4 \u2018my girl\u2019 Sharon Grier, she\u2019s our prosecutor &amp; she\u2019s been \u2018prepped\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">With regard to Count II, the JTC found that \u201cRespondent reported to Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney Kym Worthy that he was being stalked and extorted by Mott,\u201d but \u201cRespondent did not tell Worthy that Mott had been a complainant in a case before him.\u201d In addition, \u201c[w]hile Respondent did tell Worthy\u2019s investigators that Mott had been a complainant in a case before him, he falsely told the investigators that he immediately recused himself from the case once he realized the conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">With regard to Count III, the JTC found that \u201cRespondent\u2019s ex parte communications with Mott regarding <em>People v Tillman </em>and Respondent\u2019s failure to immediately recuse himself from <em>People v Tillman </em>upon learning that Tillman was Mott\u2019s relative constituted judicial misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Finally, with regard to Count Y<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the JTC found that \u201cRespondent engaged in a pervasive pattern of dishon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>esty that included lying under oath to the Commission and to the Master.\u201d For example, respondent testified that it did not \u201cdawn\u201d on him to recuse himself from the <em>King </em>case and that his failure to recuse himself was a mere \u201coversight.\u201d However, his e-mails and text messages to Mott reveal otherwise. Indeed, they reveal that respondent knew very early on that what he was doing was wrong and that he would be in serious trouble if anybody found out. For example, in one e-mail he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Second, you axe the complaining witness on a case that is before me. Naturally if it got out that we were seeing each other before your B.D.\u2019s case closed, everybody could be in deep shit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">And in a text message, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Yeah, I\u2019m DEEPLY concerned that certain levels of \u2018us\u2019 remain COMPLETELY UNDETECTED as long as U\u2019r still a litigant N case B4 me &amp; while my nuts R still on a chopping block B4 the JTC.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The JTC finally concluded that \u201c[a] preponderance of the evidence at the formal hearing shows that Respondent breached the standards of judicial conduct....\u201d More specifically, the JTC concluded that respondent engaged in \u201c[mjisconduct in office . . . [and] [c]onduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, as defined by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>amended, Article 6, Section 30 and MCR 9.205\u201d and violated MCR 9.104(1), (2), (3), and (4); MCR 2.003; MCR 2.103; MCR 2.114; and MCL 750.423, as well as Canons 1; 2(A), (B), and (C); and 3(A)(1) and (4) and (C) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In determining an appropriate sanction, the JTC considered the factors that this Court set forth in <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1292-1293; 625 NW2d 744 (2000). Finding that respondent\u2019s misconduct implicated six of the seven <em>Brown </em>factors and that his \u201cmisconduct affected not only the litigants in the <em>King </em>and <em>Tillman </em>cases, but harmed the integrity of the judicial system as a whole,\u201d the JTC recommended that respondent be removed from office and conditionally suspended without pay for six years beginning on January 1, 2015, with the suspension becoming effective only if respondent is reelected to judicial office in November 2014, and that he be ordered to pay costs in the amount of $11,645.17.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">This Court reviews de novo the JTC\u2019s factual findings, conclusions of law, and disciplinary recommendations. <em>In re James, </em>492 Mich 553, 560; 821 NW2d 144 (2012); <em>In re Halloran, </em>466 Mich 1219, 1219; 647 NW2d 505 (2002). \u201cFindings of misconduct must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Haley, </em>476 Mich 180, 189; 720 NW2d 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(2006). MCR 9.225 provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings and file a written opinion and judgment, which may accept or reject the recommendations of the commission, or modify the recommendations by imposing a greater, lesser, or entirely different sanction.\u201d \u201cAlthough we review the JTC\u2019s recommendations de novo, this Court generally will defer to the JTC\u2019s recommendations when they are adequately supported.\u201d <em>Haley, </em>476 Mich at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Adm\">A. FACTUAL FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">After reviewing the record and hearing oral arguments, we agree with and adopt almost all the factual findings of the JTC. Indeed, most of the JTC\u2019s factual findings are not even in dispute. That is, respondent does not dispute that he engaged in a sexual relationship with Mott, who was a complaining witness in a case before him, and that he regularly engaged in ex parte communications with Mott regarding the case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Respondent also does not dispute that when he told the Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney that he was being stalked and extorted by Mott, he did not tell the prosecutor that Mott had been a complainant in a case before him; that he falsely told investigators that he had immediately recused himself from the case once he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>realized the conflict;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that he knew that the defendant in the <em>Tillman </em>case was one of Mott\u2019s relatives; that he engaged in ex parte communications with Mott about the <em>Tillman </em>case; and that he signed an order in the <em>Tillman </em>case. Finally, respondent does not dispute that he testified that it did not \u201cdawn\u201d on him to recuse himself from the <em>King </em>case and that his failure to recuse himself was a mere \u201coversight,\u201d nor does he dispute that his e-mails and text messages to Mott reveal that he had given thought to his obligation to recuse himself from the case long before he finally did so. Although respondent argues about the significance of some of these facts and what the appropriate sanction should be in light of them, he does not dispute the above facts.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In addition to the factual findings that we adopt from the JTC, we also find that respondent lied to the prosecutor\u2019s office about Mott stalking and extorting him and about why he eventually recused himself in the <em>King </em>case. In addition, we find that respondent lied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the JTC about irrevocably terminating his relationship with Mott on October 31, 2012, and about whether he knew that Mott and Tillman were related and whether he took any action in the <em>Tillman </em>case. Finally, we find that respondent sent numerous text messages to Mott while he was on the bench that contained inappropriate and derogatory references to defendants, litigants, and witnesses appearing before him.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Although we believe that the sanctions recommended by the JTC, and adopted by this Court today, would be warranted even without considering these additional findings of fact, we believe that these additional findings provide relevant background and context and demonstrate more fully the nature and magnitude of respondent\u2019s misconduct. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that, unlike the additional findings of fact made by the JTC and discussed in note 24 of this opinion, the additional findings of this Court do not relate to uncharged conduct, and thus respondent does not argue that we cannot consider these additional allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The JTC concluded that respondent engaged in \u201c[mjisconduct in office ... [and] [cjonduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, as defined by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended, Article 6, Section 30 and MCR 9.205\u201d and violated MCR 9.104(1), (2), (3), and (4); MCR 2.003; MCR 2.103; MCR 2.114; and MCL 750.423, as well as Canons 1; 2(A), (B), and (C); and 3(A)(1) and (4) and (C) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. After reviewing the record and hearing oral arguments, we agree with and adopt almost all of the JTC\u2019s conclusions of law. We agree with the JTC that respondent engaged in misconduct in office and conduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice within the meaning of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30 and MCR 9.205. More specifically, we agree that respondent violated MCR 9.104(1) through (4) by engaging in \u201cconduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice\u201d; \u201cconduct that exposes the legal profession or the court to obloquy, contempt, censure, or reproach\u201d; \u201cconduct that is contrary to justice, ethics, honesty, or good morals\u201d; and \u201cconduct that violates the standards or rules of professional conduct adopted by the Supreme Court[.]\u201d He violated MCR 2.003 by failing to disqualify himself in both the <em>King </em>and <em>Tillman </em>cases.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He violated MCL 750.423 by testifying falsely under oath. He violated Canon 1 by failing to maintain \u201chigh standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He violated Canon 2 by failing to \u201cavoid all impropriety and appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>anee of impropriety,\u201d failing to \u201cpromote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,\u201d and allowing a social relationship \u201cto influence judicial conduct or judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Finally, we agree that respondent violated Canon 3<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> by failing to \u201cbe faithful to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>law,\u201d engaging in ex parte communications, and failing to \u201craise the issue of disqualification.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">C. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The purpose of the judicial disciplinary process is to \u201cprotect the people from corruption and abuse on the part of those who wield judicial power.\u201d <em>In re Jenkins, </em>437 Mich 15, 28; 465 NW2d 317 (1991). \u201cIn determining appropriate sanctions, we seek to \u2018restore and maintain the dignity and impartiality of the judiciary and to protect the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>James, </em>492 Mich at 569, quoting <em>In re Ferrara, </em>458 Mich 350, 372; 582 NW2d 817 (1998). We agree with the JTC\u2019s assessment of the <em>Brown </em>factors\u2014 the considerations that this Court set forth to guide the formation of judicial-discipline recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The first <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct[.]\u201d <em>Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>461 Mich at 1292.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We agree with the JTC that respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct when he maintained a sexual relationship with a complaining witness in a case before him for several months and repeatedly engaged in ex parte communications with her about the case as well as in another case in which her relative was a party. Respondent also engaged in a pattern of texting messages to Mott while he was on the bench that contained inappropriate and derogatory references to defendants, litigants, and witnesses appearing before him. Furthermore, respondent engaged in a practice of violating various security policies of the courthouse by permitting Mott to enter the courthouse through an employee entrance without going through security, allowing Mott to remain alone in his chambers while he was on the bench, arranging for Mott to park her vehicle in an area reserved for judges, and sneaking Mott\u2019s cell phone into the courthouse for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Finally, as the JTC explained, \u201cthe evidence revealed a pattern of dishonesty that included lying under oath to the Commission and to the Master.\u201d Respondent lied to the Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office about, among other things, when and why he recused himself from the <em>King </em>case, and he lied to the JTC and the master about, among other things, why it took him so long to finally recuse himself from the <em>King </em>case. As the master explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">For McCree to claim in sworn testimony during these proceedings that it was an OVERSIGHT or it didn\u2019fi] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>DAWN on him that he should recuse himself is not credible. In short he lied to the JTC... .[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">McCree\u2019s problem with the truth is also shown in his contact with law enforcement officials in seeking to have pressure brought to bear on Mott. He told Prosecutor Worthy that a lady with whom he had a relationship was stalking him. There was no indication [made to Worthy] that he and his wife had been engaged in a plan of deception which resulted in continuing contacts between the parties, i.e., calls to secure the abortion, to complete negotiations for the divorce, etc....</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">He told [investigator] Robert Donaldson that he had recused himself from the King case when he found out that a child of Mott\u2019s had interacted with one of his children. A lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">He told Detective Timothy Matlock that Mott had been stalking him by showing up at Belle Isle. He did not tell [him] that he got in the car and had a conversation with her. He was also a witness to the statement as to the basis for the transfer of the case which was a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Sharon Greer, the prosecutor who worked in McCree\u2019s courtroom, was also told the same lie as to the basis for the transfer of the Rang case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">... [T]he events over the October 30 through late November period show a pattern of lies and deception by McCree....</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>As explained by the JTC, respondent also \u201cfalsely told the investigators that he immediately recused himself from the case once he realized the conflict.\u201d Respondent\u2019s pattern of dishonesty is perhaps best summed up in a text message from Mott to respondent: \u201cguess I shoulda believd u in church when u said u can\u2019t go 1 day without lien[.]\u201d For all these reasons, we agree with the JTC that \u201c[t]his factor weighs in favor of a more serious sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The second <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, we agree with the JTC that respondent engaged in misconduct on the bench when he had a sexual relationship with a complaining witness in a case before him for several months without recusing himself and by engaging in ex parte communications with her about the case while he was on the bench. We also find that respondent engaged in misconduct on the bench when he transmitted numerous text messages to Mott while he was on the bench that contained inappropriate and derogatory references to defendants, litigants, and witnesses appearing before him. For these reasons, we agree with the JTC that this factor weighs in favor of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The third <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance of propriety[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293. As the JTC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">A neutral and impartial judge is one of the central tenets of our judicial system. Respondent wholly disregarded his duty to remain a detached, impartial figure by engaging in a personal relationship with a litigant in a case before him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and by regularly engaging in ex parte discussions regarding the litigant\u2019s case, as well as another case in which the litigant had an interest. In addition, Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations to the Commission and the Master were prejudicial to the actual administration of justice because they brought deceptive evidence before the Commission and the Master.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s misconduct was prejudicial to the actual administration of justice. Indeed, there is not much, if anything, that is more prejudicial to the actual administration of justice than having a sexual relationship with a complaining witness without recusing oneself, engaging in ex parte communications with this mistress/complaining witness, attempting to use the prosecutor\u2019s office as leverage against this now ex-mistress by concocting charges of stalking and extortion against her, and then lying under oath about these matters.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the JTC that this factor weighs in favor of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Similarly, the fourth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>reasons already discussed, we agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s misconduct implicated the actual administration of justice. Therefore, we agree with the JTC that this factor supports the imposition of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The fifth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree with the JTC that respondent\u2019s misconduct was premeditated or deliberated. Respondent\u2019s sexual affair with Mott lasted for several months, giving respondent more than sufficient time to carefully reflect on his behavior. In addition, his e-mails and text messages to Mott demonstrate that he was well aware that what he was doing was unethical, and yet he continued to proceed with the relationship for a considerable period of time without recusing himself from the case in which his mistress was the complaining witness. Accordingly, we agree with the JTC that this factor weighs in favor of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The sixth <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lying under oath\u2014 \u2022 conduct in which respondent engaged- is certainly \u201cmisconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy.\u201d In addition, failing to recuse oneself from a case in which one\u2019s mistress is the complaining witness, as respondent did in this case, is also misconduct that undermines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ability of the justice system \u201cto reach the most just result in such a case.\u201d As the JTC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">[T]he ability of the justice system to reach the most just result in a case is undermined when one party has an intimate relationship with the judge and continually engages in ex parte communications regarding that party\u2019s case while the other party is required to follow the rules and procedures governing the admission of evidence and the making of arguments to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Therefore, we agree with the JTC that this factor weighs in favor of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Finally, the seventh <em>Brown </em>factor states that \u201cmisconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the JTC that there is no evidence that respondent did anything to \u201cdisparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship\u201d and that this factor does not weigh in favor of a more serious sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Finding that six of the <em>Brown </em>factors weigh in favor of a more serious sanction, and that \u201cRespondent\u2019s misconduct affected not only the litigants in the <em>King </em>and <em>Tillman </em>cases, but harmed the integrity of the judicial system as a whole,\u201d the JTC concluded that removing respondent from office and conditionally suspending him without pay for six years beginning on January 1, 2015, with the suspension becoming effective only if respondent is reelected to judicial office in November 2014, would be a sufficient sanction.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>agree. We believe that this sanction is necessary in order to sufficiently redress the harm done to the integrity and reputation of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Just last term, this Court held that lying under oath \u201c \u2018is entirely incompatible with judicial office and warrants removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adams, </em>494 Mich 162, 184-185; 833 NW2d 897 (2013), quoting <em>In re Justin, </em>490 Mich 394, 419; 809 NW2d 126 (2012).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In the instant case, as already set forth at length, respondent has done far more than lie under oath. And he committed most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>this misconduct while being investigated by the JTC for <em>other </em>misconduct for which he has since been sanctioned. As explained by the master:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">[Respondent\u2019s] actions in the <em>King </em>case show, however, a gross dereliction of judicial duties. His standard of conduct, for his own sexual gratification, has severely damaged the public\u2019s view of the judiciary. His irresponsible conduct could only lead to the public having no confidence in the judiciary. He clearly knew he was especially subject to public scrutiny when he had a case pending before the JTC when he began his escapade with Mott. He knew he was on the \u201cchopping block\u201d. Yet he continued to engage in activities which would bring even greater scrutiny. He was using his judicial position to advance his own interests by keeping the <em>King </em>case. His social relationship gave Mott the belief that she was able to influence his judicial duties. He continuously engaged in <em>ex </em>[porte] communications with Mott about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Having already received substantial publicity over his photo sent to the deputy and his remarks to the press regarding same he should have been aware that when the story would break about his relationship with Mott and his handling of the <em>King </em>case all of his duplicity would be revealed. That the public\u2019s trust in an independent and honorable judiciary would be put to the test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">That respondent was prepared to engage in this conduct while already undergoing a pending JTC investigation demonstrates the extent of his disregard for the rules of judicial conduct. The people of this state need to know that this Court will not tolerate such disregard for even minimal ethical standards of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Respondent questions this Court\u2019s authority to remove him and conditionally suspend him. This Court\u2019s authority to sanction a judge can be found in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 30. Section 4 provides this Court\u2019s general superintending authority over courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The supreme court shall have general superintending control over all courts; power to issue, hear and determine prerogative and remedial writs; and appellate jurisdiction as provided by rules of the supreme court. The supreme court shall not have the power to remove a judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cThe power of superintending control is an extraordinary power. It is hampered by no specific rules or means for its exercise. It is so general and comprehensive that its complete and full extent and use have practically hitherto not been fully and completely known and exemplified. It is unlimited, being bounded only by the exigencies which call for its exercise. As new instances of these occur, it will be found able to cope with them. Moreover, if required, the tribunals having authority to exercise it will, by virtue of it, possess the power to invent, frame, and formulate new and additional means, writs, and processes whereby it may be exerted. This power is not limited by forms of procedure or by the writ used for its exercise.\u201d <em>[In re Huff, </em>352 Mich 402, 418; 91 NW2d 613 (1958) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">While \u201c\u00a7 4 does not comprehend the power to permanently enjoin a person from holding juridical office,\u201d it does \u201cinvest [] this Court with the power to determine that a person is unfit for judicial office and to prevent him from ever exercising judicial power in this state for as long as he is, in our judgment, judicially unfit.\u201d <em>In re Probert, </em>411 Mich 210, 231, 233; 308 NW2d 773 (1981).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In addition, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">On recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Removal and suspension are sanctions that are expressly listed in \u00a7 30(2). Finally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">[t]he power to suspend is also not limited to cases in which the judge currently holds judicial office. As this Court noted in <em>Probert </em>[411 Mich at 224], we possess the author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ity under the constitution to issue conditional suspensions that \u201cforeclose!] the exercise of the prerogatives inhering in any judicial office to which the disciplined party might have been elected or appointed in the future, the condition being, of course, re-election or appointment to judicial office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Such conditional suspensions \u201cdisengage the disciplined party from judicial power\u201d only if the person occupies judicial office again during the term of the suspension and do not permanently enjoin the person from holding judicial office. This Court has historically issued conditional suspensions when other sanctions could not fully and adequately address the effect of particular misconduct on the integrity of the judicial system. Although often the greatest danger will pass once \u201can unfit or incompetent judge is separated from judicial power,\u201d this Court should not refuse to consider other sanctions, such as conditional suspensions, when removal alone cannot sufficiently protect the integrity of the judiciary. <em>[James, </em>492 Mich at 576-577 (MARKMAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>Probert, </em>411 Mich at 222, this Court censured and conditionally suspended Judge Charles V. Probert for five years, \u201cregardless of any possible intervening election or appointment to judicial office.\u201d This Court could not remove Judge Probert because he had already left office as the result of his term ending and his defeat in his efforts at reelection. In <em>Probert, </em>this Court recognized that we had on three previous occasions \u201cissued conditional suspensions that would have foreclosed the exercise of the prerogatives inhering in any judicial office to which the disciplined party might have been elected or appointed in the future, the condition being, of course, re-election or appointment to judicial office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223-224. This Court explained that \u201c[t]he effect of those suspensions would have been to disengage the disciplined party from judicial power, but only had that person come to occupy judicial office again during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>term of the suspension, and only to the extent that the terms of office and suspension coincided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. See also <em>In re Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 200; 267 NW2d 914 (1978), in which this Court suspended Judge Earl Warren Bennett for one year without pay \u201cregardless of Judge Bennett\u2019s election to another judicial office\u201d; <em>In re Del Rio, </em>400 Mich 665, 672; 256 NW2d 727 (1977), in which this Court suspended Judge James Del Rio for five years without pay \u201cregardless of respondent\u2019s possible intervening re-election to office or election to any other state court\u201d; and <em>In re Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 549; 243 NW2d 86 (1976), in which we suspended Judge Willard L. Mikesell for IV2 years without pay \u201cregardless of respondent\u2019s possible intervening reelection to office or election to any other state court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We agree with the JTC that a removal, without more, would be an insufficient sanction in this case. If we were to remove respondent and he were to be reelected in 2014, that would amount to a less than one-year suspension (less than two years including his interim suspension), which we believe is clearly insufficient given the seriousness of his misconduct. This Court has a duty to preserve the integrity of the judiciary. Allowing respondent to serve as a judge after only a one-year suspension will not, in our judgment, adequately preserve the integrity of our state\u2019s judiciary. Respondent was just recently publicly censured by this Court and yet continued to engage in misconduct, with his attitude toward the instant JTC investigation perhaps being best summarized by his remark that although \u201cWade should have recused himself,\u201d \u201cno harm no foul.\u201d This is strongly suggestive that respondent has not yet learned from his mistakes and that the likelihood of his continuing to commit judicial misconduct is high. Such a cavalier attitude about serious misconduct is disturb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ing, and respondent\u2019s apparent failure to comprehend fully the magnitude of his wrongdoing is equally troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In summary, respondent had an affair with a complaining witness in a case pending before him, had numerous ex parte communications with that witness about the case, extended to her special treatment concerning the case, and caused her reasonably to believe that she was influencing how he was handling her case. When their relationship subsequently went sour, he sought to employ the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office as leverage against her by concocting charges of stalking and extortion. And he lied repeatedly to the JTC and the master while under oath.

Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">A. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges.

Judge Chrzanowski appointed an attorney with whom she was having an affair to represent indigent defendants, presided over those cases without disclosing this relationship, and initially made false statements to the police who were investigating the death of this attorney\u2019s wife. Although there are some similarities between Judge Chrzanowski\u2019s and respondent\u2019s misconduct, respondent did far more than have an affair with an interested person in a case pending before him and then initially lie about it.

In any event, \u201cwe always retain the power to determine that a person is unfit for judicial office and to prevent him from ever exercising judicial power in this state for as long as he is, in our judgment, judicially unfit.\u201d <em>In re Jenkins, </em>437 Mich 15, 29-30; 465 NW2d 317 (1991) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, I would remove respondent from office and assess costs, but would not impose a conditional suspension.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
