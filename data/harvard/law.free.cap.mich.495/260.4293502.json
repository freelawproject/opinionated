The NLRA established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which has exclusive jurisdiction over activity \u201carguably subject\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 7<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the NLRA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These provisions forbid an employer from interfering with an employee\u2019s right to engage in concerted activities for the mutual aid or protection of employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The LMRDA safeguards a union member\u2019s ability to elect union leadership, provides broad discretion for elected union officials to implement their policies, and protects union members who exercise their freedom of expression from retaliation by union officials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More recently, the Michigan Legislature enacted the WPA to protect employees from retaliation for reporting violations or suspected violations of laws and regulations to a public body.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We hold that neither the NLRA nor the LMRDA preempts WPA claims premised on reporting suspected criminal misconduct. The NLRA does not cover the reporting of suspected criminal misconduct, while the LMRDA does not provide a union official with discretion to cover up suspected criminal misconduct by retaliating against employees who report their allegations. However, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of retaliation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>their reporting of improper wages and an unsafe work environment cover conduct \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by the NLRA and, as a result, must be litigated exclusively before the NLRB. Accordingly, we affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Defendant Laborers\u2019 Local 1191 is a Wayne County labor union that represents construction workers. At all times relevant to these consolidated appeals, the union\u2019s member-elected leadership included its president (defendant Bruce Ruedisueli) and its business manager (defendant Michael Aaron). The union also employed several unelected business agents who serve at the pleasure of the business manager. Plaintiffs Anthony Henry and Keith White (Docket No. 145631) and Michael Ramsey and Glenn Dowdy (Docket No. 145632) all worked as business agents until their terminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">While the facts leading up to plaintiffs\u2019 terminations are contested, it is undisputed that in September 2009, defendants asked several Local 1191 members to repair the crumbling fagade of the Trade Union Leadership Council (TULC) building.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The work lasted for two days, and each member received $30 a day. Although Local 1191 recorded these payments as \u201cpicket duty\u201d on the memo line of the checks used for payment and in the union\u2019s treasury, it admits that its members did not engage in picket duty on those days.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Henry witnessed the work. He and the three other plaintiffs suspected that Aaron was involved in criminal activity, including fraud, an illegal kickback scheme, and misappropriation of union funds. They also believed that Local 1191 required members to work without proper safety precautions and without receiving union wages. As a result, on September 25, 2009, Henry circulated an unsigned open letter to Local 1191\u2019s leadership and distributed that letter to union membership, the union\u2019s parent leadership, and local news outlets. In the letter, Henry asked why Local 1191 was paying members out of its picket fund to work on a for-profit establishment (the TULC) and suggested that Aaron had received illegal kickbacks from the TULC in exchange for providing the TULC with free construction labor. The letter also complained that union members received only $60 for two full days of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In October 2009, Henry and White contacted the United States Department of Labor with their suspicions and informed the union of their decision to report the allegations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Department of Labor investigated the allegations and interviewed several union employees and officials.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It subsequently referred the matter to an Assistant United States Attorney, who declined to intervene.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>On November 11, 2009, Aaron notified Henry and White that they were indefinitely laid off from employment at Local 1191. The letters claimed that the \u201cextremely difficult economic climate\u201d necessitated the layoffs. Henry and White disputed that stated rationale and, instead, filed a complaint in the Wayne Circuit Court against Local 1191 as an entity and against Aaron and Ruedisueli individually, in which they alleged unlawful retaliation under the WPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">During the pendency of that initial action, Dowdy and Ramsey were terminated from their employment at Local 1191. Dowdy and Ramsey claim that they were terminated for their cooperation in the Department of Labor investigation and for disclosing to investigators facts substantiating the allegations of criminal illegality.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They also filed a separate WPA complaint against Local 1191 as an entity and against Aaron and Ruedisueli individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Defendants moved for summary disposition in the Henry/White lawsuit and for partial summary disposition in the Dowdy/Ramsey lawsuit,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> alleging that the LMRDA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims and that, as a result, the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court denied the motions from the bench, concluding that the WPA\u2019s protection of an employee against an employer\u2019s retaliatory employment actions does not contravene the LMRDA because the LMRDA only protects from retaliation the rights afforded union members.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>On appeal, defendants reasserted their claim of LMRDA preemption and raised the new defense that the NLRA independently preempted the circuit court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court agreed with the circuit court that plaintiffs \u201chave not alleged any infringement on their membership rights\u201d and that, as a result, the LMRDA\u2019s protections did not cover plaintiffs\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court also examined whether the WPA undermined the LMRDA\u2019s democratic purpose to give elected union officials the discretion to implement policies that reflect the wishes of union membership. The Court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not infringe union leaders\u2019 discretion \u201cwhere a union employee claims wrongful discharge for refusing \u2018to commit or aid in committing a crime\u2019... .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, the Court held that the NLRA did not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 claims because \u201c[a] claim for retaliatory discharge arising out of an employee\u2019s report of suspected illegal activity or participation in investigation thereof is only of peripheral concern to the NLRA\u2019s purpose of protecting employees\u2019 rights to engage in \u2018concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">This Court granted defendants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal and requested that the parties brief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">(1) whether, regardless of the public body involved, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 USC 151 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>seq., </em>or the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 USC 401 <em>et seq., </em>preempt Michigan\u2019s Whistle-blowers\u2019 Protection Act (WPA), MCL 15.361 <em>et seq., </em>if the challenged conduct actually or arguably falls within the jurisdiction of the NLRA or the LMRDA; (2) whether a union employee\u2019s report to a public body of suspected illegal activity or participation in an investigation thereof is of only peripheral concern to the NLRA or the LMRDA so that the employee\u2019s claims under the WPA are not preempted by federal law; and, (3) whether the state\u2019s interest in enforcing the WPA is so deeply rooted that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, courts cannot infer that Congress has deprived the state of the power to act.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Defendants assert that federal law preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims and precludes Michigan courts from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction over them. As a result, they argue, they are entitled to summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Jurisdictional questions under MCR 2.116(C)(4), including whether federal statutory law preempts state law,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> are questions of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In deciding whether to grant a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4), a court must consider \u201c[t]he affidavits, together with the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence then filed in the action or submitted by the parties . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>hi. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">A. GENERAL PREEMPTION PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>M\u2018Culloch v Maryland, </em>Chief Justice John Marshall addressed the relationship between the federal and state governments in our constitutional republic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">If any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we might expect it would be this \u2014 that the government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action. This would seem to result, necessarily, from its nature. It is the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all. Though any one state may be willing to control its operations, no state is willing to allow others to control them. The nation, on those subjects on which it can act, must necessarily bind its component parts. But this question is not left to mere reason: the people have, in express terms, decided it. .. .[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">To this end, the Framers of the Constitution drafted, and the people ratified, the Supremacy Clause, which states the core principle of preemption:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Justice Cooley observed that the Supremacy Clause requires \u201c[a] State law [to] yield to the supreme law, whether expressed in the Constitution of the United States or in any of its laws or treaties, so far as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>come in collision. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, because a state\u2019s traditional police powers are broad, the United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201c [consideration of issues arising under the Supremacy Clause start[s] with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Preemption \u201cfundamentally is a question of congressional intent.. . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Congress can preempt state law either explicitly or implicitly.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the absence of explicit statutory language, state law is pre-empted where it regulates conduct in a field that Congress intended the Federal Government to occupy exclusively\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or when \u201cit actually conflicts with federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n the final analysis, there can be no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula\u201d to apply preemption principles in all contexts.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Rather, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>must examine congressional intent to preempt state law in the specific context of the statute or statutes at issue \u2014 in this case, how the Michigan WPA operates against the background of the NLRA and the LMRDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">B. THE NLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 after it concluded that \u201c[t]he denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The NLRA\u2019s enactment \u201cmarked a fundamental change in the Nation\u2019s labor policies.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Congress replaced \u201c[t]he earlier notion that union activity was a species of \u2018conspiracy\u2019 and that strikes and picketing were examples of unreasonable restraints of trade\u201d with \u201can unequivocal national declaration of policy establishing the legitimacy of labor organization and encouraging the practice of collective bargaining.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Section 7 of the NLRA states that \u201c[e]mployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection... ,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Section 8(a)(1) states that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> while \u00a7 10(a) empowers the National Labor Relations Board \u201cto prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice . . . affecting commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The structure of the NLRA not only creates federal rules of decision regarding labor relations, but also delegates enforcement of that policy to an administrative agency. The United States Supreme Court has acknowledged this dual purpose of the NLRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[T]he unifying consideration of our decisions has been regard to the fact that Congress has entrusted administration of the labor policy for the Nation to a centralized administrative agency, armed with its own procedures, and equipped with its specialized knowledge and cumulative experience:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">... Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules and to avoid these diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes towards labor controversies. ... A multiplicity of tribunals and a diversity of procedures are quite as apt to produce incompatible or conflicting adjudications as are different rules of substantive law.[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Indeed, the Count has explained that \u201cnothing could serve more fully to defeat the congressional goals underlying the Act than to subject, without limitation, the relationships it seeks to create to the concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts free to apply the general local law.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon </em>is the \u201cwatershed\u201d case analyzing \u201cthe extent to which the maintenance of a general federal law of labor relations combined with a centralized administrative agency to implement its provisions necessarily supplants the operation of the more traditional legal processes in this field\u201d \u2014 that is, state regulation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In <em>Garmon, </em>the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law. Nor has it mattered whether the States have acted through laws of broad general application rather than laws specifically directed towards the governance of industrial relations.[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Moreover, even when it is unclear \u201cwhether the particular activity regulated by the States was governed by \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 or was, perhaps, outside both these sections,\u201d the Court held that \u201c [i]t is essential to the administration of the Act that these determinations be left in the first instance to the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201c[wjhen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Court subsequently clarified the \u201carguably subject\u201d standard to mean that \u201cthe party claiming preemption is required to demonstrate that his case is one that the Board could legally decide in his favor.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In other words, \u201ca party asserting pre-emption must advance an interpretation of the Act that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been \u2018authoritatively rejected\u2019 by the courts or the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Nevertheless, the Court \u201chas been unwilling to \u2018declare pre-empted all local regulation that touches or concerns in any way the complex interrelationships between employees, employers, and unions .. . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> To this end, <em>Garmon </em>recognized two related exceptions to preemption of state law regulations that are \u201carguably subject\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 7 or 8 of the NLRA.

THE LMRDA</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Congress enacted the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act in 1959 as \u201cthe product of congressional concern with widespread abuses of power by union leadership.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court explained that \u201callegations of union wrongdoing led to extended congressional inquiry\u201d and resulted in \u201cenlarged protection for members of unions paralleling certain rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution; not surprisingly, these amendments . . . were introduced under the title of \u2018Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The LMRDA\u2019s Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations protects union members\u2019 freedom of expression and assembly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments, or opinions; and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views, upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization\u2019s established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings!.[<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">It also provides union members with procedural protections against discipline by the union:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">No member of any labor organization may be fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise disciplined except for nonpayment of dues by such organization or by any officer thereof unless such member has been (A) served wdth written specific charges; (B) given a reasonable time to prepare his defense; (C) afforded a full and fair hearing.[<footnotemark>65</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u201cAny person whose rights secured by the [Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations] have been infringed by any violation of this title may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States for such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In <em>Finnegan v Leu, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]t is readily apparent, both from the language of these provisions and from the legislative history. .., that it was rank-and-file union members \u2014 not union officers or employees, as such \u2014 whom Congress sought to protect.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Court explained that when plaintiffs have \u201cdual status as both employees and members of the Union,\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the LMRDA only provides a member/employee with protection from discipline in his or her capacity as a member, not in his or her capacity as an employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">[T]he term \u201cdiscipline\u201d ... refers only to retaliatory actions that affect a union member\u2019s rights or status <em>as a member </em>of the union.... In contrast, discharge from union employment does not impinge upon the incidents of union membership, and affects union members only to the extent that they happen also to be union employees.[<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">This limitation ensures \u201cthe freedom of an elected union leader to choose a staff whose views are compatible with his own.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This is \u201can integral part\u201d of the LMRDA\u2019s purpose \u201cof ensuring a union administration\u2019s responsiveness to the mandate of the union election.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>Finnegan </em>did not examine the LMRDA in the context of preemption \u2014 no Supreme Court decision has \u2014 but several lower courts have done so. Because conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>protected under the LMRDA does not extend to a union member/employee\u2019s rights as <em>an employee, </em>a state-law retaliation claim brought by a union employee as an employee is preempted to the extent that it conflicts with the LMRDA\u2019s purposes. Because \u201cthe courts have been reluctant to interfere with the right of elected union officers to select their own administrators,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> which is protected under the LMRDA, we likewise hold that the LMRDA preempts state law that would unduly limit the discretion of union officials to select their employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">As a result, when a union employee brings a state-law retaliation claim as an employee, we must analyze whether the claim conflicts with the LMRDA\u2019s \u201cpurpose and goal of protecting democratic processes in union leadership.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In <em>Packowski v United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 951, </em>for example, the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c [i]f union members cannot choose their leaders, or if the chosen leaders cannot implement the policies they were elected to implement, then the rights of union members (as represented by their elected leaders) would be thwarted, or at least diminished.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Nevertheless, a state-law retaliation claim is not preempted when it does not conflict with the purposes of the LMRDA. Indeed, courts have recognized that the discretion the LMRDA affords unions to choose their employees is not limitless. In <em>Bloom v Gen Truck Drivers, Office, Food &amp; Warehouse Union, </em>the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the LMRDA did not preempt a state claim for wrongful discharge after a union employee refused to illegally alter the minutes of a union meeting.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The court balanced the state\u2019s interest in deterring crime with the purpose of the LMRDA, explaining that \u201c[i]f federal labor law preempts such a cause of action, the deterrent effect is lost and nothing prevents unscrupulous employers from forcing employees to choose between committing crimes and losing their jobs.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[t]he kind of discharge alleged, retaliation for refusal to commit a crime and breach a trust, is not the kind sanctioned by the Act\u201d to further the goals and policies of elected union officials.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[protecting such a discharge by preempting a state cause of action based on it does nothing to serve union democracy or the rights of union members; it serves only to encourage and conceal such criminal acts and coercion by union leaders.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We adopt the exception to LMRDA preemption articulated in <em>Bloom </em>and related cases. Accordingly, we hold that the LMRDA does not preempt state wrongful-termination claims in cases in which elected union officials attempt to use their discretion as a shield to hide alleged criminal misconduct. To hold otherwise would undermine the explicit purpose of the LMRDA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cto eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> In fact, protecting union employees from retaliation when they raise claims of criminal wrongdoing helps to protect the interests of rank-and-file union members and safeguard union democracy and, as a result, achieve the purposes of the LMRDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">D. THE WPA</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Legislature enacted the WPA in 1980 to \u201c \u2018provide protection to employees who report a violation or suspected violation of state, local, or federal law. . . \u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The WPA \u201cremove[s] barriers that may interfere with employee efforts to report those violations or suspected violations, thus establishing a cause of action for an employee who has suffered an adverse employment action for reporting or being about to report a violation or suspected violation of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">MCL 15.362 specifically regulates an employer\u2019s retaliation against employees who report a violation or suspected violation of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because the employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, reports or is about to report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>verbally or in writing, a violation or a suspected violation of a law or regulation or rule promulgated pursuant to law of this state, a political subdivision of this state, or the United States to a public body, unless the employee knows that the report is false, or because an employee is requested by a public body to participate in an investigation, hearing, or inquiry held by that public body, or a court action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Defendants argue that federal law preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims. Because courts examine preemption under the NLRA separately from preemption under the LMRDA, as shown earlier, we will likewise consider each federal statute separately in determining whether federal law preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA actions.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AnI\">A. NLRA PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In assessing claims of NLRA preemption, the Supreme Court has clarified that \u201c[i]t is the conduct being regulated, not the formal description of governing legal standards, that is the proper focus of concern.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The specific conduct alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims is that defendants unlawfully retaliated against them for their reporting of suspected wrongdoing to the United States Department of Labor. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of wrongdoing fall into two general categories: (1) improper working conditions \u2014 that workers were paid unfairly and were not provided with necessary safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>precautions \u2014 and (2) criminality \u2014 that defendants were engaged in fraud, embezzlement, and misuse of union funds. Because a court may separate preempted claims from nonpreempted claims,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> we will examine each category of claims separately in determining whether the NLRA preempts plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As stated, the threshold inquiry in determining whether the NLRA preempts state-law claims is to determine whether \u201can activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the Act. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Among other protections, \u00a7 7 of the NLRA provides employees the right \u201cto form, join, or assist labor organizations\u201d and \u201cengage in ... concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> These rights are intertwined: \u201cBasic to the right guaranteed to employees in \u00a7 7 to form, join or assist labor organizations, is the right to engage in concerted activities to persuade other employees to join for their mutual aid and protection.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Defendants claim that all of plaintiffs\u2019 activities are \u201carguably subject\u201d to \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Court has held that the \u201cmutual aid or protection clause\u201d in \u00a7 7 \u201cprotects employees from retaliation by their employers when they seek to improve working conditions through resort to administrative and judicial forums,\u201d among other activities intended to improve working conditions.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Similarly, the relevant inquiry in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>examining whether activity is \u201cconcerted\u201d within the meaning of the NLRA is \u201cwhether the employee acted with the purpose of furthering group goals.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Plaintiffs unquestionably acted with the purpose of furthering group goals when they disputed the working conditions for union members. Their claims of unfair wages and an unsafe work environment are prototypical issues of dispute under the NLRA.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> As a result, plaintiffs\u2019 conduct to improve unfair wages and an unsafe work environment is arguably protected under \u00a7 7 of the NLRA. Furthermore, \u00a7 8 specifically prohibits defendants from retaliating against plaintiffs for engaging in conduct protected under \u00a7 7. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 conduct regarding working conditions satisfies the initial <em>Garmon </em>threshold, such that federal law would preempt state law unless one of the two exceptions applies.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Moreover, neither of the two exceptions to the NLRA applies to plaintiffs\u2019 concerted activity regarding work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ing conditions. First, working conditions are of central, not peripheral, concern to the NLRA\u2019s purposes. As stated, the NLRA specifically sought to protect the right of employees to organize to improve their working conditions. Relatedly, because this protection has been central to the NLRA\u2019s purposes for nearly 80 years, the more recent attempt of the WPA to regulate retaliation for an alleged unfair labor practice does not \u201ctouchD interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> that the Court could not infer that Congress intended the NLRB to have exclusive jurisdiction over a state whistleblower claim arising out of complaints regarding an employer\u2019s improper working conditions. Indeed, allowing plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claim regarding defendants\u2019 working conditions would amount to \u201ca supplemental sanction for violations of the NLRA,\u201d which the NLRA prohibits.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Nevertheless, in addition to their claims of retaliation for reporting working conditions, plaintiffs also make independent assertions that defendants retaliated against them for reporting allegations of criminal misconduct.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Plaintiffs reported to the Department of Labor and reiterated in the instant WPA complaints that union members were receiving money \u201cpaid out of the Union treasury . . . attributed to Ticket line\u2019 duty when that clearly was not the case\u201d and that they reported \u201ctheir suspicions of fraud and illegal activity on the part of their employer.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Indeed, in recognizing the potential illegal nature of the union officials\u2019 ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tions, the Department of Labor referred the matter for investigation by an Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">While the NLRA regulates employees\u2019 concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection, it simply does not regulate the reporting of federal and state crimes.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Section 7 is not so broad as to protect <em>all </em>employees\u2019 concerted activities. \u201c[A]t some point the relationship\u201d between the concerted activity and the \u201cemployees\u2019 interests as employees .. . becomes so attenuated that an activity cannot fairly be deemed to come within the \u2018mutual aid or protection\u2019 clause.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The NLRB has explained that protection under \u00a7 7 \u201ccan be lost whenever employee communications to third parties do not relate to [the] labor practices of the employer .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The allegations of criminal misconduct that plaintiffs communicated to the Department of Labor do not relate to the employer\u2019s labor practices. Rather, a state court can adjudicate the underlying allegations of embezzle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment and other criminal misconduct without having to consider an employer\u2019s labor practices or whether employees engaged in protected activity in reporting those allegations.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> By contrast, the relationship between allegations of improper working conditions and employees\u2019 protected activity gets to the heart of the employer\u2019s labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The crux of the partial dissent\u2019s disagreement with our analysis is over whether plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of defendants\u2019 violations of the federal laws regarding their fiduciary obligations toward the union and protecting union funds from embezzlement are arguably within the right of an employee under \u00a7 7 to \u201cassist labor organizations.\u201d Courts ordinarily have examined the phrase \u201cform, join, or assist labor organizations\u201d in \u00a7 7 in its entirety, suggesting a continuum of protections. Yet when the term \u201cassist\u201d has been given independent force, it appears in the context of a <em>nonmember\u2019s </em>assistance to the labor organization.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>even when interpreting the term \u201cassist\u201d independently, courts have examined it in the context of the phrase \u201cmutual aid or protection,\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> perhaps because assisting a labor organization is supposed to be for the mutual aid or protection of the employees that it represents. For all these reasons, the partial dissent\u2019s focus on the phrase \u201cassisting] labor organizations\u201d without reference to the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d analysis is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Even if the underlying allegations of criminal misconduct brought to light by concerted activity <em>arguably </em>relate to an employer\u2019s labor practices, enforcement of well-established criminal law is at the heart of a state\u2019s police power and is \u201cso deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> that we cannot infer that Congress intended when it enacted the NLRA to relieve states from enforcing that well-established criminal law or protecting from retaliation employees who report allegations of criminal wrongdoing.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> A state\u2019s prohibition of adverse employment actions resulting from the reporting of suspected criminal misconduct does not \u201c \u2018frustrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>effective implementation of the Act\u2019s processes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Moreover, when there are \u201cdiscrete concerns of the federal scheme and the state tort law, that potential for interference is insufficient to counterbalance the legitimate and substantial interest of the State in protecting its citizens.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> In this case, the state has a deeply rooted and substantial interest in enforcing its criminal law,<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> which the NLRB has no authority to enforce<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and which the WPA assists by protecting employees who report allegations of criminal misconduct.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Because these interests are separate from the interests articulated in the NLRA, we hold that the NLRA does not preempt the WPA with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 claims alleging retaliation for reporting defendants\u2019 criminal wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">B. LMRDA PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Defendants also assert that the LMRDA preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> As stated, the LMRDA safeguards union democracy by protecting union members\u2019 right to free expression and by providing democratically elected union leaders wide discretion in pursuing the policies that they were elected to accomplish. The Supreme Court held in <em>Finnegan </em>that \u201cthe freedom of an elected union leader to choose a staff whose views are compatible with his own\u201d is \u201can integral part\u201d of the LMRDA\u2019s protections because an elected union leadership must be responsive \u201cto the mandate of the union election.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> However, <em>Finnegan </em>does not stand for the proposition that the LMRDA gives an elected union leader unfettered discretion with respect to employment matters. Although the LMRDA does not provide union employees who have been terminated a cause of action for retaliation taken against them as employees, this does not lead to the conclusion that states are completely forbidden from restricting a union leader\u2019s discretion to terminate a union employee. Rather, if a union retaliates against a union employee as an employee, then any underlying state-law retaliation claim is only preempted to the extent that it conflicts with the purposes of the LMRDA. The LMRDA is contrasted against the more expansive federal preemption doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of the NLRA \u2014 states are afforded considerably more freedom to supplement the LMRDA federal scheme as long as no conflict arises between state law and the LMRDA.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Moreover, although the saving clauses of the LMRDA do not directly apply to save plaintiffs\u2019 civil action, they do support a finding that the LMRDA both recognizes a strong state interest in protecting against criminal misconduct and implicitly approves plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, the exception to a union employer\u2019s discretion for allegations of criminal misconduct is conclusive in this case. A union employer\u2019s discretion in employment decisions must yield in cases in which elected union officials attempt to use that discretion as a shield to hide alleged criminal misconduct. Of course, while <em>Bloom </em>involved union employees who claim that they were fired for refusing to commit crimes themselves, this case involves union employees who claim that they were fired for reporting union officials\u2019 alleged crimes. This distinction is without a difference because, in both cases, the relationship between the state-law claim and the LMRDA is identical: the union employer is retaliating against employees and, in doing so, trying to shield alleged criminal misconduct from union rank-and-file membership and the public. Moreover, in both cases, the state-law claims are consistent with the LMRDA\u2019s expressly stated purposes of abating union corruption and breaches of trust. As a result, the LMRDA allows state-law retaliation claims to proceed in state courts. Therefore, we hold that plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims premised on their reporting of defendants\u2019 al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>leged criminal misconduct survive defendants\u2019 assertion of LMRDA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Court of Appeals correctly determined that federal law did not preempt plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims premised on their allegations of criminal misconduct. However, the court did not distinguish these WPA claims from plaintiffs\u2019 claims involving defendants\u2019 working conditions. As a result, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision only in part. Going forward, plaintiffs may only pursue in state court their WPA claims involving retaliation for their reporting of alleged illegal conduct to a public body or bodies.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Because neither the NLRA nor the LMRDA preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims to the extent that they allege retaliation for reporting criminal misconduct such as fraud and embezzlement, state courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over those claims. Accordingly, we affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-8\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\"> MCL 15.361 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"><em> </em>29 USC 151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\"> 29 USC 401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\"> 29 USC 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"> 29 USC 158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> <em>San Diego Bldg Trades Council v Garmon, </em>359 US 236, 245; 79 S Ct 773; 3 L Ed 2d 775 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\"> 29 USC 157; 29 USC 158(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> 29 USC 411(a)(1), (2), and (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b534-11\"> MCL 15.362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> The parties dispute the nature of the TULC.

Significantly, while the NLRB \u201cis empowered ... to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice,\u201d 29 USC 160(a), the power of the NLRB does not extend to enforce 29 USC 501(c) or, indeed, any criminal law.

Suppose that plaintiffs\u2019 claim of improper wage and unsafe working conditions simply did not exist and, instead, that defendants paid union members a bargained-for wage and the members repaired the TULC building under safe working conditions. In this scenario, plaintiffs would still be able to allege that defendants misappropriated union funds for unlawfully paying those union members their bargained-for wage out of the picket fund when the members did not actually engage in picket duty and that defendants received illegal kickbacks from the TULC. By stripping away plaintiffs\u2019 claims of unsafe working conditions and unfair wages that are preempted by the NLRA, it becomes clear that plaintiffs\u2019 criminal-misconduct claims exist independently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"100\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> <em>Southern Greyhound Lines and Anderson, 169 </em>NLRB 627, 628 (1968) (\u201cIt is well settled that Section 7 of the Act protects an employee in his right to assist a labor organization regardless of whether he is eligible for membership in it. . . .\u201d).

APPLICABLE LAW: NLRA PREEMPTION AND ITS EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">I am in agreement with the <em>general </em>legal propositions stated by the majority with regard to NLRA preemption and its exceptions. As noted by the majority, <em>San Diego Bldg Trades Council v </em>Garmon<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the seminal case governing the extent of NLRA preemption. <em>Garmon </em>provides the following preemption rule: \u201cWhen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] or \u00a7 8[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of the [NLRA], the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But I also find guidance from the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent case, <em>Local 100, United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen &amp; Apprentices v Borden, </em>in which the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">[I]n the absence of an overriding state interest..., state courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board in cases in which <em>the activity that is the subject matter of the litigation </em>is arguably subject to the <em>protections </em>of \u00a7 7 or the <em>prohibitions </em>of \u00a7 8 of the National Labor Relations Act.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The standard for \u201carguably subject\u201d is permissive. An activity that is the subject matter of the litigation at hand is \u201carguably subject\u201d to the protections of \u00a7 7 or the prohibitions of \u00a7 8 if it \u201cis not plainly contrary to [the NLRA\u2019s] language and.. . has not been \u2018authoritatively rejected\u2019 by the courts or the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The majority relies on <em>Belknap, Inc v Hale </em>for the proposition that conduct is \u201carguably prohibited\u201d by the NLRA when \u201cthe controversy presented to the state court is identical with that which could be presented to the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While this is a correct statement of the law, I take issue with the majority\u2019s interpretation of this passage as whether the \u201cstate law <em>claim . </em>. . could have been presented [to the NLRB].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is, in my view, an incorrect interpretation. The more precise interpretation is whether the underlying \u201cactivity that is the <em>subject matter </em>of the litigation is arguably subject to the protections of \u00a7 7 or the prohibitions of \u00a7 8\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\u2014 the same inquiry as in <em>Garmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>After a court determines that certain activity is arguably subject to the protections of \u00a7 7 or the prohibitions of \u00a7 8 of the NLRA, the matter will only be preempted if it is also determined that no exception to NLRA preemption applies.

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">A. \u201cARGUABLY SUBJECT\u201d TO THE NLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Unlike the majority, I conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims are \u201carguably subject\u201d to the NLRA. I start my analysis by reviewing the activity that is the subject matter of this litigation \u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 claims that they were wrongfully discharged for reporting their suspicions of wrongdoing to the United States Department of Labor (USDOL). Accepting as true plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of wrongdoing, plaintiffs were assisting their labor organization, Laborers\u2019 Local 1191, by exposing that the organization\u2019s assets might be subject to depletion through fraud, embezzlement, and misuse of union funds. By exposing this conduct, plaintiffs clearly hoped to bring an end to this activity, thereby preserving the integrity, effectiveness, and financial assets of their union.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The provisions of the NLRA clearly give plaintiffs the right to engage in the conduct that they did. That right may be found in \u00a7 7 of the NLRA, which states that all \u201c[e]mployees shall have the right to .. . assist labor organizations . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Additionally, employers are prohibited from engaging in \u201cunfair labor practice^]\u201d by \u00a7 8 of the NLRA, which bars \u201cinterfering] with, restraining], or coercing] employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7[.]\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These two NLRA provisions apply in this case. Plaintiffs are undoubtedly employees of the labor union, entitled to the protections of \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The labor union, in its relationship to plaintiffs as their employer, is clearly subject to the restrictions in the NLRA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 discharges, if the allegations are true, would violate the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The majority opinion erroneously asserts that when the term \u201cassist\u201d has been given independent legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>force, it has only been in the context of a nonmember\u2019s assistance to the labor organization. But its own citation demonstrates that this is not so. The majority cites <em>Southern Greyhound Lines and Anderson, </em>which states: \u201cIt is well-settled that Section 7 of the Act protects an employee in his right to assist a labor organization <em>regardless of whether he is eligible for membership in it. . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This quotation implies that both members and nonmembers may assist a union and be protected under \u00a7 7. Furthermore, in <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, INS, Border Patrol v Fed Labor Relations Auth, </em>the court noted that the right to assist any labor organization \u201cconfer[s] the right to wear a union lapel pin. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Border Patrol </em>did not distinguish between members who wear a pin and nonmembers who may choose to do the same, nor would it be sensible to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">It is of no legal consequence that plaintiffs have not specifically asserted their right to assist their labor organization under \u00a7 7 because reporting suspected criminal activity to the USDOL is per se \u201cassistance] [to a] labor organization[].\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Specifically, plaintiffs based their claims of criminal activity on 29 USC 501(a) and (c), which detail the fiduciary responsibilities of officers of labor organizations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 29 USC 501(a) states that \u201cofficers ... of a labor organization occupy positions of trust in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>such organization and its members as a group\u201d and that each officer therefore has a duty \u201cto account to the organization for any profit received by him in whatever capacity in connection with transactions conducted by him or under his direction on behalf of the organization.\u201d Similarly, 29 USC 501(c) prohibits an officer of a labor organization from embezzling, stealing, or converting any \u201cassets of a labor organization of which he is an officer ....\u201d To point out when a union officer may not be complying with his or her fiduciary responsibilities is, without question, \u201cassisting] a union,\u201d irrespective of how plaintiffs characterize their complaints. The NLRA not only protects employees who assist unions in their formation, but also those employees who help unions continue to exist for the benefit of the union members.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Likewise, employees who notice and report corruption of union leadership, particularly when that corruption suggests embezzlement from the union itself or gaining an unfair profit at the union\u2019s expense, assist the union by enabling the members to be well represented in a manner consistent with the members\u2019 best interests. In this consolidated case, the union officials, in their capacity as employers, were prohibited by the NLRA from discharging their employees simply because the employees reported their suspicions of illegal activity that would harm the union. To permit the employer to do otherwise would \u201cinterfere with . . . employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7[.]\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The majority, in my view, errs by calling plaintiffs\u2019 claims of criminal misconduct \u201cindependent assertions\u201d because this implies that those assertions of criminal misconduct had nothing to do with unions or union assistance. It then states that \u201c[w]hile the NLRA regulates employees\u2019 concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection, it simply does not regulate the reporting of federal and state crimes.\u201d The majority focuses on the wrong activity. The issue is not whether the NLRA regulates the reporting of federal and state crimes. Rather, the issue is whether reporting a federal or state crime in this instance would fall under the protections of the NLRA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because the purpose of reporting the federal and state crimes was to aid or assist the union, the activity falls under \u00a7 7 of the NLRA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Likewise, the majority\u2019s focus on <em>Eastex, Inc v NLRB</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is misplaced. The <em>Eastex </em>case focuses on the provision in \u00a7 7 that states, \u201cEmployees shall have the right... to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. . ..\u201d In determining the scope of \u201cother mutual aid or protection, <em>Eastex </em>states that \u201cat some point the relationship\u201d between concerted activity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the \u201cemployees\u2019 interests as employees .. . becomes so attenuated that an activity cannot fairly be deemed to come within the \u2018mutual aid or protection\u2019 clause.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Though <em>Eastex </em>guides us with regard to the meaning of \u201cmutual aid and protection,\u201d it does not aid us in determining what activities \u201cassist\u201d a labor union.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">I also conclude that the majority has erroneously applied <em>Handicabs, Inc and </em>Trail<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to the case at hand. True enough, <em>Handicabs </em>states that protection under \u00a7 7 \u201ccan be lost whenever employee communications to third parties do not relate to [the] labor practices of the employer . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But the majority omits two important details of <em>Handicabs </em>that suggest that its rule does not apply in the instant case. First, <em>Handicabs </em>addresses the \u201cmutual aid or protection\u201d aspect of \u00a7 7, not its provision related to \u201cassisting]\u201d a labor organization.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Second, the portion quoted by the majority truncates language that is not superfluous, but is important to an understanding of the quotation\u2019s context; <em>Handicabs </em>states that NLRA \u201cprotection can be lost whenever employee communications to third parties do not relate to labor practices of the employer, <em>such as disparaging </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>the employer\u2019s reputation or quality of its product, or whenever those communications are maliciously motivated. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The employee complaints described in <em>Handicabs </em>are a far cry from those in the case at hand, in which the employees reported that the union manager was violating his federal, statutorily created fiduciary duties to the union and its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">B. THE PREEMPTION EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Controversies that would otherwise be preempted by the NLRA are not preempted when a plaintiffs claim reflects \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d state interests or are matters of \u201cperipheral concern\u201d to the NLRA.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, the issue is whether Michigan has a deeply rooted state interest in applying the WPA in plaintiffs\u2019 cases or whether the claims are of peripheral concern to the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Though these appear to be two exceptions, in application they amount to one. In practice, courts effectively presume that claims grounded in state law reflect deeply rooted state interests.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, the critical inquiry is whether the conduct at issue is of peripheral concern to the NLRA. Generally speaking, courts make this determination by engaging in a fact-intensive inquiry to decide whether the NLRA and the state statute, as applied, prohibit the same activity. When the NLRA and state law do not prohibit the same conduct, the preemption exception will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The United States Supreme Court case <em>Farmer v United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; </em>Joiners<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> is instrumental in demonstrating how to apply the NLRA pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>emption exception. In <em>Farmer, </em>to determine whether a state-law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) was exempt from NLRA preemption, the Court focused on whether the NLRA\u2019s prohibitions protected the plaintiff from the same complained-of conduct as the state-law IIED claim.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Court contrasted the plaintiffs IIED claim, which protected the plaintiff from conduct that no reasonable person in civilized society should be required to endure, with the plaintiffs potential NLRA claim, which would ask whether the alleged employer conduct rose to the level of an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court noted that the two inquiries would be different because the NLRA did not punish outrageous conduct as outrageous conduct, but merely insofar as the conduct would have constituted an unfair labor practice.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Court wrote: \u201cNo provision of the National Labor Relations Act protects the \u2018outrageous conduct\u2019 complained of by petitioner.... [T]here is no federal protection for conduct on the part of union officers which is so outrageous that \u2018no reasonable man in civilized society should be expected to endure it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court determined that the NLRA preemption exception applied to the plaintiffs claim for IIED because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>state-court tort action [could] be adjudicated without resolution of the \u2018merits\u2019 of the underlying labor dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The United States Supreme Court clarified this rule in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co v San Diego Co Dist Council of </em>Carpenters, pronouncing that the preemption exception depends upon whether the \u201ccontroversy presented to the state court is identical to ... or different from . .. that which could have been, but was not, presented to the Labor Board.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s rationale for this rule was that \u201cit is only [when the <em>controversy </em>would be identical] that a state court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 claims sound in retaliatory discharge. As discussed previously, I conclude that the alleged retaliatory discharges are not only prohibited by the WPA but also by the NLRA. Plaintiffs reported alleged criminal conduct that triggered protection under the WPA and simultaneously assisted a labor organization, which entitles plaintiffs\u2019 activity to NLRA protection. Thus, both the WPA and the NLRA prohibit discharge for the protected action. For this reason, ours is a much weaker case for the preemption exception than any other United States Supreme Court case granting the exception. As noted by the majority, the Court has excepted from the NLRB\u2019s exclusive purview causes of action for IIED,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> threats of violence,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> tres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>pass,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> malicious interference with a lawful occupation,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and malicious libel.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Beyond this, the Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and other state courts have consistently held that one type of wrongful-discharge case is not preempted \u2014 wrongful discharge for claiming workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> But in most other cases that involve union activity, claims for wrongful discharge are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The wrongful-discharge cases in which courts have found no NLRA exception more closely resemble the case at hand than those in which they have found an exception. Courts have extended preemption to cases alleging wrongful discharge under state constitutions, state statutes, state common law, and violations of state public policy. In some, if not all, of these cases, the state has an interest in regulating the conduct at issue.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> However, the prevailing consideration is not whether the state has an interest in protecting a plaintiff from some employer action, but whether that interest is distinct from the actions the NLRA guards against.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Courts have held that wrongful-discharge claims are preempted by the NLRA despite strong state interests in regulating the conduct. Consider, for example, that at least one federal court and several state courts have held that claims of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are preempted by the NLRA.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In one of these violation-of-public-policy cases, <em>Lontz v Tharp, </em>the factual background was similar to this case insofar as plaintiffs in both cases allege facts that demonstrate that they had tried to assist unions.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Additionally, one federal court has held that a claim for wrongful discharge based in the common law of contracts was preempted by the NLRA.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In that case, <em>Morris v Chem-Lawn Corp, </em>the court looked through the plaintiffs breach-of-employment-contract claim and held that it was preempted because the substance of the claim was that she had been discharged for supporting a union.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In another case similar to this one, a state appeals court held that the NLRA preempted a state statutory claim for wrongful discharge.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> That case, <em>Kilb v First Student Transp, LLC, </em>is akin to our case both because it presents a conflict between the NLRA and a state statutory claim and because it is a case in which the plaintiff was discharged for attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>assist a union.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Finally, at least one federal court has held as preempted a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of the most deeply rooted state interest of all, a state constitutional right.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In that case, <em>Veal v Kerr-McGee Coal Corp, </em>the court went out of its way to explain that NLRA preemption did not depend on how strong the state\u2019s interest was in protecting its citizens.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Rather, the cases governing the NLRA preemption exception base their holdings on whether the state constitution and the NLRA governed the same conduct. Because the two laws attempted to govern the same employer conduct, the claim was preempted because permitting any tribunal but the NLRB to adjudicate the claim presented a great risk that the state constitutional right would conflict with the \u201cfederal regulatory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">This case bears a greater resemblance to the aforementioned no-exception cases than to the cases that find a preemption exception. In this case, plaintiffs were employees of a union who noticed that certain union officials were incorrectly reporting the union members\u2019 activities for the purpose of paying them out of the strike fund when the members had actually been making repairs on a building. Alarmed, plaintiffs reported to the USDOL, on the union members\u2019 behalf, that a union official might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>have embezzled union funds or otherwise violated his statutory duty not to profit from his position as a union official.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This was an attempt to assist the union members; the fact that the claims were criminal in nature is immaterial. The unfair labor practice in this case is <em>not </em>the alleged criminal actions \u2014 embezzlement or breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs never alleged a cause of action for embezzlement or breach of fiduciary duty in the circuit court; therefore, the employer\u2019s alleged criminal conduct does not constitute the unfair labor practice. The unfair labor practice here is the wrongful discharge of these employees. In this case, the claim for wrongful discharge under the WPA essentially prohibits the same employer conduct as a claim of unfair labor practices under \u00a7 8 of the NLRA. An employer may not discharge an employee for attempting to assist a labor organization. Thus, because the conduct of the employer would be prohibited by the NLRA in the same way that it would be prohibited under Michigan law, Michigan has no deeply rooted interest in hearing plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims, which allege the very same unlawful conduct as an unfair-labor-practice claim under the NLRA.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> And because the employer\u2019s discharge of plaintiffs for protected activities is a preeminent rather than a peripheral concern of the NLRA, any claims arising from the wrongful discharge must \u201cbe left in the first instance to the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Labor Relations Board.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Though the majority is correct that Michigan\u2019s WPA statute protects important state interests that are often different than the NLRA\u2019s main concerns, this is not the question that we must answer. This case is not about whether the WPA protects an <em>area of law </em>that is of peripheral concern to the NLRA; indeed, if it did not, it would be completely preempted by the NLRA. Instead, the issue is whether the <em>controversy </em>is of peripheral concern to the NLRA. Because a discharge for assisting a labor union would be an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, Michigan has no deeply rooted state interest in deciding that controversy for its citizens, and the NLRA will provide the relevant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">III. ANTICIRCUMVENTION AND NLRA PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims represent a classic example of unacceptable NLRB circumvention by artful pleading. Courts adjudicating NLRA preemption are rightfully concerned about circumvention, which would undermine the NLRB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over labor disputes. One example of circumvention through artful pleading that courts have struck down is the identical-elements test, under which plaintiffs incorrectly allege that, because the elements of their state-law claim and the elements of unfair labor practices under the NLRA are not identical, their state-law claim should not be preempted. Courts reject the identical-elements test because it undermines the NLRB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. For example, in <em>Hussaini v Gelita USA, Inc, </em>the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa stated that there was no identical-elements test because an \u201cNLRB proceeding and a state-law cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>action will, by definition, deal with different claims and if this lack of identity were conclusive, state claims would never be preempted.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Likewise, the court in <em>Robbins v Harbour Indus, Inc </em>eschewed formalism in holding that \u201c[t]he characterization of the claim under state law has little, if any, bearing on the outcome of the preemption issue. Rather, cases applying the exception for conduct which is only of peripheral concern to the NLRA almost always involve an analysis of the facts underlying the state action\u201d to determine whether the \u201ccontroversy presented to the state court is identical to . . . or different from\u201d the controversy that could have been presented to the NLRB.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> It does not matter what terms a plaintiffs state claim is couched in when the \u201cbasis of [the plaintiffs] claim, as revealed [by discovery], is that [the] employer discharged [the employee] because of [the employee\u2019s] support of\u201d a union<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> \u2014 whether that be aid in its formative stages or assistance sometime down the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The majority\u2019s ruling enables plaintiffs to circumvent the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB simply because they alleged criminal conduct to the USDOL. In doing so, the majority overlooks the fact that plaintiffs alleged that the criminal conduct violated a federal labor statute, 29 USC 501(a) and (c), which leads to the key conclusion that plaintiffs took the steps that they did to assist the members of the labor union. Labor union members are in need of this type of assistance because any right to bargain for the members\u2019 collective good might be undermined by corrupt union leadership that embezzles union funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>or prioritizes its own profit over the interests of the members. Because the NLRA preempts plaintiffs\u2019 WPA claims in full, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> 29 USC 401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> MCL 15.361 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> 29 USC 151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> <em>San Diego Bldg Trades Council v Garmon, </em>359 US 236; 79 S Ct 773; 3 L Ed 2d 775 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\"> 29 USC 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-12\"> 29 USC 158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b564-13\"> <em>Garmon, </em>359 US at 245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> <em>Local 100, United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen &amp; Apprentices v Borden, </em>373 US 690, 693; 83 S Ct 1423; 10 L Ed 2d 638 (1963) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> <em>Int\u2019l Longshoreman\u2019s Ass\u2019n v Davis, </em>476 US 380, 395, 106 S Ct 1904, 90 L Ed 2d 389 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> <em>Belknap, Inc v Hale, </em>463 US 491, 510; 103 S Ct 3172; 77 L Ed 2d 798 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\"> Emphasis altered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\"> <em>Borden, </em>373 US at 693 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> <em>Farmer v United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>430 US 290, 296-297; 97 S Ct 1056; 51 L Ed 2d 338 (1977) (emphasis added) (quotation marks, citation, and original alterations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> 29 USC 157.
