Specifically, we address whether this unreasonable-to-repair presumption violates substantive and procedural due process protections by permitting demolition without affording the owner of the structure an option to repair as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As a preliminary matter, we clarify that the landowners\u2019 substantive due process and procedural due process claims implicate two separate constitutional rights, and that we must analyze each claim under separate constitutional tests. The Court of Appeals therefore erred by improperly conflating these analyses and subsequently determining that BCO \u00a7 18-59 facially violates plaintiffs\u2019 general due process rights. Instead, when each due process protection is separately examined pursuant to the proper test, the ordinance does not violate either protection on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We hold that BCO \u00a7 18-59 does not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of substantive due process because the ordinance\u2019s unreasonable-to-repair presumption is reasonably related to the city of Brighton\u2019s legitimate interest in promoting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. Furthermore, the ordinance is not an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction on a property owner\u2019s use of his or her property because there are circumstances under which the presumption may be overcome and repairs permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We likewise hold that the city of Brighton\u2019s existing demolition procedures provide property owners, including plaintiffs, with procedural due process. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the prescribed procedures are not faulty for failing to include an automatic repair option, which is, in essence, plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process argument recast in procedural due process terms. For purposes of this facial challenge, it is sufficient that aggrieved parties are provided the right to appeal an adverse decision to the city council as well as the right to subsequent judicial review. For the facial challenge to succeed, plaintiffs must show that no aggrieved property owners can meaningfully exercise their right to review or that such review is not conducted impartially. Because they have not done so, plaintiffs have failed to establish that BCO \u00a7 18-59, on its face, violates their procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Livingston Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Plaintiffs Leon and Marilyn Bonner own two residential properties, 122 E. North Street and 116 E. North Street, both located in downtown Brighton. Situated on these properties are three structures \u2014 two former residential homes and one barn/garage \u2014 all of which have been unoccupied and generally unmaintained for over 30 years. In January 2009, defendant city of Brighton\u2019s (the City) building and code enforcement officer, James Rowell (the building official), informed plaintiffs via written notice that these three structures had been deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d in violation of the Brighton Code of Ordinances, and further constituted public nuisances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>violation of Michigan common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs were also informed of the building official\u2019s additional determination that it was unreasonable to repair these structures consistent with the standard set forth in BCO \u00a7 18-59, which provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><em>Whenever the city manager, or his designee, has determined that a structure is unsafe and has determined that the cost of the repairs would exceed 100 percent of the true cash value of the structure as reflected on the city assessment tax rolls in effect prior to the building becoming an unsafe structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the purpose of this article that such structure is a public nuisance which may be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. </em>This section is not meant to apply to those situations where a structure is unsafe as a result of an event beyond the control of the owner, such as fire, windstorm, tornado, flood or other Act of God. If a structure has become unsafe because of an event beyond the control of the owner, the owner shall be given by the city manager, or his designee, reasonable time within which to make repairs and the structure shall not be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. If the owner does not make the repairs within the designated time period, then the structure may be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. The cost of demolishing the structure shall be a lien against the real property and shall be reported to the city assessor, who shall assess the cost against the property on which the structure is located.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Consequently, plaintiffs were ordered to demolish the structures within 60 days of the date of the building official\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Because demolition had been ordered without an option to repair, plaintiffs appealed the building official\u2019s determination to the Brighton City Council (city council) pursuant to the appellate process set forth in BCO \u00a7 18-61, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">An owner of a structure determined to be unsafe may appeal the decision to the city council. The appeal shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the appeal. . . . The owner or his agent shall have an opportunity to be heard by the city council at a regularly scheduled council meeting. The city council may affirm, modify, or reverse all or part of the determination of the city manager, or his designee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Initially, the city council stayed its review pending the building official\u2019s interior inspection of the structures. However, despite having previously agreed to allow the building official interior access, plaintiffs thereafter refused entry, causing the City to petition for and obtain administrative search warrants. On May 27, 2009, the building official and several other representatives of the City inspected the structures and found over 45 unsafe conditions therein. The hearing resumed on June 4, 2009, and June 18, 2009, during which the city council received written reports and heard oral testimony from both parties on the issues of the City\u2019s findings and conclusions pursuant to the interior and exterior inspection of the premises, as well as its cost estimates for the structures\u2019 repair versus their demolition. On July 16, 2009, the city council unanimously affirmed the building official\u2019s determination that the structures were unsafe</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>under all ten of the standards set forth in BCO \u00a7 18-46.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The city council likewise found that plaintiffs had been maintaining unsafe structures in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>violation of BCO \u00a7 18-47,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the structures were unreasonable to repair under BCO \u00a7 18-59, and that demolition was required within 60 days of its decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Rather than appeal the city council\u2019s decision to the Livingston Circuit Court as an original action per BCO \u00a7 18-63,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiffs instead filed this independent cause of action against the City, alleging violations of due process, generally, as well as substantive due process; a violation of equal protection; inverse condemnation or a regulatory taking; contempt of court; common-law and statutory slander of title; and a violation of Michigan housing laws under MCL 125.540.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The City subsequently filed its own complaint against plaintiffs in a separate action, requesting injunctive relief in the form of an order enforcing BCO \u00a7 18-59 and requiring demolition of the structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">After consolidating these cases, the circuit court denied the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief and likewise denied relief to plaintiffs on several of the theories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>they had advanced. However, the circuit court did address the constitutionality of the ordinance, determining that, on its face, BCO \u00a7 18-59 violates substantive due process by permitting the City to order an unsafe structure to be demolished as a public nuisance without providing the owner the option to repair it when the structure is deemed unreasonable to repair as defined under the ordinance. The circuit court thus granted plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for partial summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) on the substantive due process claim and thereafter denied reconsideration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\">After granting the City\u2019s application for leave to appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court in a split published opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The majority concluded that the standard set forth under BCO \u00a7 18-59 is arbitrary and unreasonable, and thus violates substantive due process, because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">only allow[s] the exercise of an option to repair when a property owner overcomes or rebuts the presumption of economic unreasonableness, regardless of whether the property owner is otherwise willing and able to timely make the necessary repairs.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The majority also determined that BCO \u00a7 18-59 does not bear a reasonable relationship to the permissible legislative objective of protecting citizens from unsafe and dangerous structures because demolition does not advance the objective of abating nuisances and protecting citizens to a greater degree than repairs, even ones more costly than the present value of the structure and that an owner is willing and able to timely finance. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>majority held that BCO \u00a7 18-59 is facially unconstitutional. Finally, notwithstanding the circuit court\u2019s abstention from reaching the procedural due process issue, the majority went on to conclude that BCO \u00a7 18-59 likewise violates procedural due process because \u201cthe only way the city\u2019s ordinances could withstand a procedural due process challenge\u201d would be if it provides a property owner with the option to repair the structure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We granted the City\u2019s application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to brief separately \u201cwhether \u00a7 18-59 is facially unconstitutional on the basis that the ordinance violates: (1) substantive due process; and/or (2) procedural due process.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">This case implicates myriad standards of review. The circuit court granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). We review de novo a circuit court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Summary disposition is appropriate under MCR 2.116(C)(10) if, \u201c[ejxcept as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment or partial judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists when, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the record which might be developed. .. would leave open an issue upon which reasonable minds might differ.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In deciding whether to grant a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), a court must consider \u201c[t]he affidavits, together with the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence then filed in the action or submitted by the parties,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">This dispute also concerns the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance, which necessarily involves the interpretation and application of the ordinance itself. We review de novo questions of constitutional law;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> however, this Court accords deference to a deliberate act of a legislative body, and does not inquire into the wisdom of its legislation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The decision to declare a legislative act unconstitutional should be approached with extreme circumspection and trepidation, and should never result in the formulation of a rule of constitutional law \u201cbroader than that demanded by the particular facts of the case rendering such a pronouncement necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cEvery reasonable presumption or intendment must be indulged in favor of the validity of the act, and it is only when invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution that a court will refuse to sustain its validity.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Further, because ordinances are treated as statutes for purposes of interpretation and review, we also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>review de novo the interpretation and application of a municipal ordinance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since the rules governing statutory interpretation apply with equal force to a municipal ordinance,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the goal of construction and interpretation of an ordinance is to discern and give effect to the intent of the legislative body.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The most reliable evidence of that intent is the language of the ordinance itself and, therefore, the words used in an ordinance must be given their plain and ordinary meanings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Plaintiffs make two facial constitutional attacks upon BCO \u00a7 18-59. First, they assert that the ordinance violates substantive due process by permitting demolition of an unsafe structure without extending to its owner an option to repair, because denying a property owner the chance to repair an unsafe structure does not advance the City\u2019s otherwise legitimate interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the Brighton citizenry. Second, plaintiffs argue that the ordinance violates procedural due process by failing to provide a procedure to safeguard a property owner\u2019s right to choose whether to repair a structure municipally deemed unsafe before the City orders it demolished. We will address plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in this order; before proceeding further, however, we find it necessary to make two critical observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>First, we emphasize that this is a <em>facial </em>challenge to BCO \u00a7 18-59;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> plaintiffs do not challenge the ordinance\u2019s application in a particular instance.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A party challenging the facial constitutionality of an ordinance \u201cfaces an extremely rigorous standard.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To prevail, plaintiffs must establish that \u201c \u2018no set of circumstances exists under which the [ordinance] would be valid\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]he fact that the .. . [ordinance] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient\u2019 \u201d to render it invalid.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201c \u2018if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain [the ordinance], the existence of the state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed\u2019 \u201d and the ordinance upheld.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Finally, because facial attacks, by their nature, are not dependent on the facts surrounding any particular decision, the specific facts surrounding plaintiffs\u2019 claim are inapposite.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Second, and particularly noteworthy here, we emphasize that analysis of substantive and procedural due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>process involves two separate legal tests. While the touchstone of due process, generally, \u201cis protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the substantive component protects against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> whereas the procedural component is fittingly aimed at ensuring constitutionally sufficient procedures for the protection of life, liberty, and property interests.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As evidenced by the following statement, the Court of Appeals made clear its misunderstanding of these distinct constitutional claims when it concluded that BCO \u00a7 18-59 was facially unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Ultimately, we conclude that the ordinance infringes on plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights, whether denominated procedural or substantive, thereby <em>making it unnecessary to determine which due process principle is actually embodied in plaintiffs\u2019 </em>argument.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As a result, the Court of Appeals conflated what previous decisions have indicated should be treated as separate inquiries. Indeed, the issue whether BCO \u00a7 18-59 is facially unconstitutional for denying property owners the opportunity to repair unsafe structures in violation of substantive due process is distinct from the issue whether the ordinance is facially unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>for permitting the demolition of unsafe structures without providing adequate procedural safeguards in violation of the right to procedural due process. By melding together plaintiffs\u2019 substantive and procedural due process claims, the Court of Appeals failed to observe that distinction and thus examine these claims in light of the correct legal standards. We therefore take this opportunity to clarify that alleged violations of substantive and procedural due process must be separately analyzed in order to determine whether the specific dictates of due process have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">A. GENERAL DUE PROCESS PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"AxW\">1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The federal due process provision guarantees that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Prior caselaw has interpreted this language to \u201cgu\u00e1rante [e] more than fair process,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> but to encompass a substantive sphere as well, \u201cbarring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Determining whether the ordinance in this case violates due process requires that we engage in several inquiries, the first and most essential of which asks whether the interest allegedly infringed by the challenged government action \u2014 here, a property owner\u2019s interest in repairing an unsafe structure \u2014 comes within the definition of \u201clife, liberty or property.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> If it does not, the Due Process Clause affords no protection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>If, however, a life, liberty or property interest is found to exist and to be threatened by the City\u2019s conduct, the next two queries will address what process is due before the government can interfere with that interest. Because the Due Process Clause offers two separate types of protections \u2014 substantive and procedural \u2014 separate inquiries must examine whether these protections have been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">2. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Plaintiffs allege that their property rights have been violated by the City\u2019s decision to order their structures demolished without providing them with the option to repair the structures. Explicit in our state and federal caselaw is the recognition that an individual\u2019s vested interest in the use and possession of real estate is a property interest protected by due process.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Accordingly, plaintiffs, as owners of the three structures at issue and the land on which those structures are situated, have a significant property interest within the protection of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">B. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"A12\">1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Having identified a significant property interest protected by the Due Process Clause, we continue our analysis by addressing plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim. \u201c \u2018Substantive due process\u2019 analysis must begin with a careful description of the asserted right,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>for there has \u201calways been reluctan[ce] to expand the concept of substantive due process\u201d given that \u201c[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Where the right asserted is not fundamental, the government\u2019s interference with that right need only be reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">A zoning ordinance must similarly stand the test of reasonableness \u2014 that it is \u201c \u2018reasonably necessary for the preservation of public health, morals, or safety\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u2014 and, as we have stated, it is presumed to be so until the plaintiff demonstrates otherwise. Accordingly, a plaintiff may successfully challenge a local ordinance on substantive due process grounds, and therefore overcome the presumption of reasonableness, by proving either \u201cthat there is no reasonable govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mental interest being advanced by the present zoning classification itself. . . or, secondly, that an ordinance [is] unreasonable because of the purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use from the area in question.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The reasonableness of the ordinance thus becomes the test of its legality.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">2. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Mindful of these principles, we begin by describing the right asserted by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are not generally arguing that they have a categorical right of property use or possession, but assert a much more limited constitutional right; namely, that encompassed within the Due Process Clause\u2019s protection of property is a property owner\u2019s right to repair a structure municipally deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d before that structure can be demolished. However, we are unaware of any court that has ever granted a property owner the fundamental right of an absolute repair option involving property that has fallen into such disrepair as to create a risk to the health and safety of the public. Indeed, that conclusion would hardly be compatible with the line of cases in which this Court and the United States Supreme Court have held that reasonableness is essential to the validity of an exercise of police power affecting the general rights of the land owner by restricting the character of the owner\u2019s use,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> which would include the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>to repair unsafe structures. The right asserted by plaintiffs, then, cannot be considered fundamental. Therefore, to demonstrate a violation on substantive due process grounds, plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the unreasonable-to-repair presumption set forth in BCO \u00a7 18-59 does not bear any reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">BCO \u00a7 18-59 was enacted pursuant to the City\u2019s police powers, and its purpose is to abate a public nuisance by requiring repairs or demolition of unsafe structures. It is firmly established that nuisance abatement, as a means to promoting public health, safety, and welfare, is a legitimate exercise of police power<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and that demolition is a permissible method of achieving that end.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Certainly, then, there can be no dispute that the public interest that BCO \u00a7 18-59 is intended to serve \u2014 protecting the health and welfare of the citizens of Brighton by eliminating the hazards posed by dangerous and unsafe structures \u2014 is a legitimate one. What is in dispute, however, is whether the unreasonable-to-repair presumption bears a reasonable relationship to that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Court of Appeals found it did not. In the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, to refuse a willing and able property owner the option to repair property that has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>deemed unsafe because of the City\u2019s view of the unreasonableness of the cost does no more to advance this permissible legislative objective than does allowing corrective repairs to be made in the first instance. In our view, however, if permitting demolition of unsafe structures (notwithstanding the willingness and financial ability of property owners to undertake corrective repairs) is not unconstitutional in itself, it does not become so simply because it is shown to be less desirable than some other action. While affording a property owner the opportunity to perform corrective repairs is one method by which the dangers posed by an unsafe structure may be remedied, it is by no means the only method \u2014 much less the only <em>constitutional </em>method \u2014 of doing so. As long as certain minimum standards have been met, and the ordinance does not encroach upon a property owner\u2019s fundamental rights, the decision to exceed those standards by providing a property owner with an automatic right of repair, as some municipalities have chosen to do, is a policy judgment, not a constitutional mandate.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Indeed, to satisfy substantive due process, the infringement of an interest that is less than fundamental, such as the right asserted here, requires no more than a reasonable relationship between the governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose. This standard allows a municipal body sufficient lati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tude to decide, as the City has, that certain considerations favor using one means, i.e., demolition, rather than another, i.e., repairing. Enacting an ordinance that presumes repairs will be unreasonable to undertake if the cost of those repairs exceeds 100 percent of the property\u2019s value before it became unsafe protects children and others from the risk of increased injury, reduces the opportunity for crime, and aids in the maintenance of property values and marketability of lands. Any one of these purposes is reasonably related to the City\u2019s interest in promoting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and it is presumed that the City acted for such reasons, or for any other valid reason, in enacting BCO \u00a7 18-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Without question, property owners have a constitutional right of property use, but this does not translate into an absolute constitutional right to repair unsafe structures. Moreover, even assuming that plaintiffs had a protected interest in repairing the unsafe structures at issue here before that property could be subject to demolition,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> BCO \u00a7 18-59 is reasonably related to several governmental interests, and thus did not facially violate substantive due process. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 asserted private right of repair must yield to the City\u2019s higher governmental interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Nor have plaintiffs shown that BCO \u00a7 18-59 violates their substantive due process rights as an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction on plaintiffs\u2019 constitutionally recognized property interests. Under this standard, a presumption still prevails in favor of the reasonableness and validity in all particulars of a municipal ordinance, unless plaintiffs can show that the unreasonable-to-repair-presumption constitutes \u201c \u2018an arbitrary fiat, a whimsical ipse dixit,\u2019 \u201d leaving \u201c \u2018no room for a legitimate difference of opinion concerning its reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Plaintiffs argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO \u00a7 18-59 can only be overcome upon a showing of economic reasonableness, i.e., that repair costs would not exceed \u201c100 percent of the true cash value of the structure as reflected on the city assessment tax rolls prior to the building becoming an unsafe structure.\u201d There is, however, no textual support for this interpretation because BCO \u00a7 18-59 does not specify the manner in which the unreasonable-to-repair presumption may be overcome. A showing of reasonableness could therefore be established by presenting a viable repair plan; evidence from the challenger\u2019s own experts that, contrary to the City\u2019s estimates, the repair costs would not exceed 100 percent of the property value; or evidence that the structure subject to demolition has some sort of cultural, historical, familial, or artistic value. Because reasonableness can be established in economic or noneconomic terms, plaintiffs have failed to show, and the Court of Appeals erred by concluding, that BCO \u00a7 18-59 is arbitrary and unreasonable because \u201cit denies a property owner the option to repair an unsafe structure simply on the basis that the city deems repair efforts to be economically unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Again, even assuming that there is a protected property interest in repairing an unsafe structure, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that BCO \u00a7 18-59 arbitrarily or unreasonably infringes that right by denying a property owner an option to repair as a matter of right. The unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO \u00a7 18-59 is not arbitrary because it does not represent a total prohibition on a property owner\u2019s opportunity to repair an unsafe structure, and the ordinance applies uniformly to all structures that have repair costs in excess of 100 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the structure\u2019s value before it became unsafe, except those structures that BCO \u00a7 18-59 expressly exempts.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Nor is the ordinance unreasonable merely because there exists an arguably preferred method of addressing the legislative objective sought to be attained, or because the prohibited land use is just as reasonable as the one permitted or required under the ordinance. Certainly, a variety of permissible land uses may be excluded or restricted by local ordinance provided the ordinance is reasonable, and we do not concern ourselves with the wisdom or desirability of such legislation. Furthermore, even if the relationship between BCO \u00a7 18-59 and the City\u2019s interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare is debatable, we need more than a mere difference of opinion to establish a substantive due process violation, and plaintiffs have failed to make such a showing. Accordingly, the presumption of constitutionality favors the ordinance\u2019s validity, and we may not second-guess the City\u2019s policy judgment in enacting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We find nothing arbitrary or unreasonable about the City\u2019s interest in demolishing unsafe structures and believe the means selected \u2014 the unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO \u00a7 18-59 \u2014 bears a reasonable relationship to the objective sought to be attained. Because plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the burden necessary to invalidate BCO \u00a7 18-59 on substantive due process grounds, it must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">C. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"Asx\">1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We turn now from the claim that the City may not, by virtue of BCO \u00a7 18-59, deprive plaintiffs of their as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>serted property interest without first affording them the opportunity to repair a structure deemed unsafe by the City, to plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process claim that the City may not order demolition on the basis of the procedures BCO \u00a7 18-59 provides. Well established is the assurance that deprivation of a significant property interest cannot occur except by due process of law.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> While the meaning of the Due Process Clause and the extent to which due process must be afforded has been the subject of many disputes, there can be no question that, at a minimum, due process of law requires that deprivation of life, liberty, or property by adjudication must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> To comport with these procedural safeguards, the opportunity to be heard \u201cmust be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> As recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">[Ildentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.[<footnotemark>59</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>2. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">To determine whether BCO \u00a7 18-59 provides property owners the process to which they are constitutionally entitled, we first review in some detail the procedures the City has employed through this ordinance. The City\u2019s demolition process ordinarily begins with an inspection of a particular structure followed by a determination by the city manager, or some other agent designated by the City, that the structure is unsafe pursuant to any one or more of the ten factors delineated in BCO \u00a7 18-46 and is, therefore, subject to demolition. This determination triggers BCO \u00a7 18-59, which requires that the city manager, or the city manager\u2019s designee, determine the cost to repair the structure and compare that cost to the structure\u2019s true cash value as reflected in assessment tax rolls before the structure became unsafe. If the cost to repair exceeds the structure\u2019s true cash value, then the structure is presumed to be a public nuisance subject to demolition. If not, the structure remains in its unsafe condition but may not, at this point, be subject to demolition. In either case, the city manager must then serve the structure\u2019s owner with written notice pursuant to BCO \u00a7 18-52.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> If the city manager has determined that the structure at issue can be made safe, the notice must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>identify the required repairs and improvements with which the property owner must comply within a reasonable time or face demolition. However, if, as in this case, the city manager determines that the structure cannot be made safe, the notice must indicate that demolition will ensue. Moreover, following either determination, the notice must inform the property owner of the right to appeal the city manager\u2019s determination to the city council pursuant to BCO \u00a7 18-61. Within ten calendar days of receipt of this notice, the property owner must notify the City of his or her intent to accept or reject the terms of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">If the owner rejects the terms of the notice and submits a written appeal that \u201cstate[s] the basis for the appeal,\u201d \u201c[t]he owner or his agent shall have an opportunity to be heard by the city council at a regularly scheduled council meeting.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The city council then has the discretion to \u201caffirm, modify, or reverse all or part of the determination of the city manager, or his designee.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> If the owner receives an adverse final decision from the city council, the owner \u201cmay appeal th[at] decision to the county circuit court by filing a complaint within 20 calendar days from the date of the decision.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Because this is a facial constitutional challenge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>plaintiffs do not argue that the City failed to properly execute or enforce this procedural system.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Instead, plaintiffs contend that the City\u2019s procedural system results in an unconstitutional deprivation of a property interest absent due process of law because it fails to give the owner of an unsafe structure the procedural protection of a repair option before that property may be demolished. Because this argument is simply the substantive due process argument recast in procedural due process terms, the argument meets with the same fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals determined that although BCO \u00a7 18-61 comports with procedural due process to the extent that it provides notice, a hearing, and a decision by an impartial decision-maker, \u201cthe [C]ity should have also provided for a reasonable opportunity to repair the unsafe structure\u201d in order for the ordinance to pass constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We disagree. At least as it pertains to this facial challenge, due process was satisfied by giving plaintiffs the right to an appeal before the city council and the opportunity to appeal that decision to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The essence of due process is the requirement that \u201ca person in jeopardy of serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> All that is necessary, then, is that the procedures at issue be tailored to \u201cthe capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> to ensure that they are given a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>meaningful opportunity to present their case, which must generally occur before they are permanently deprived of the significant interest at stake.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Here, there is no dispute that if the city manager orders a structure to be demolished under BCO \u00a7 18-59, aggrieved parties, such as plaintiffs, have the right to appeal that determination to the city council under BCO \u00a7 18-61. Although BCO \u00a7 18-59 creates a presumption that an unsafe structure shall be demolished as a public nuisance if the cost to repair the structure would exceed 100 percent of the structure\u2019s true cash value as reflected in the assessment tax rolls before the structure became unsafe, this presumption is rebuttable. To rebut this presumption and avoid demolition, the aggrieved party need only show that the repair is reasonable, a showing that may be achieved by economic or noneconomic means. It is then within the city council\u2019s discretion to \u201caffirm, modify, or reverse all or part of the determination of the city manager, or his designee.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> When the city council decides, as it did here, to affirm the determination of the building official based on the evidence before it, that adverse ruling does not render an aggrieved party\u2019s opportunity to be heard any less meaningful. To the contrary, it shows that the procedures in place are sufficient to provide property owners with notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Furthermore, vital to the assessment of what process is due in this case is the tenet that substantial weight must be given to the procedures provided for by those individuals holding legislative office \u2014 including members of a city council with whom the electorate has entrusted the duty of protecting the health and safety of all citizens \u2014 for \u201c[i]t is too well settled to require citation that a statute must be treated with the deference due to a deliberate action of a coordinate branch of our State government... .\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This is especially so where, as here, in addition to providing the aggrieved party with an effective process for asserting his or her claim before any demolition, the prescribed procedures also ensure the right to a hearing, as well as to subsequent judicial review, before the denial of the aggrieved party\u2019s claim becomes final.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a facial procedural due process violation where they received all the process to which they were constitutionally entitled. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversibly erred by holding to the contrary. We therefore conclude that affording a property owner an option to repair as a matter of right is not required before the demolition of an unsafe structure and, furthermore, existing procedures in BCO \u00a7 18-59 comport entirely with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Court of Appeals erroneously determined that BCO \u00a7 18-59 is facially violative of due process. BCO \u00a7 18-59 does not, on its face, deprive plaintiffs of substantive due process when the ordinance\u2019s unreasonable-to-repair presumption is reasonably related to the City\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens from unsafe or dangerous structures. Furthermore, the presumption set forth in BCO \u00a7 18-59 is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable because there are circumstances under which the presumption could be overcome and repairs permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Nor does \u00a7 18-59, on its face, deprive plaintiffs of procedural due process. BCO \u00a7 18-61 affords an aggrieved party notice and a meaningful opportunity to present evidence to rebut the unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO \u00a7 18-59 before an impartial decision-maker, and plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of showing that they are constitutionally entitled to further processes in order to satisfy due process requirements. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Livingston Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-4\"> Specifically, the property was deemed \"unsafe,\u201d as defined by BCO \u00a7 18-46, for the foEowing defects: \u201ccoEapsing porch structure and foundations for same; coEapsing porch roof structure; damaged or missing shingles; rotted roof sheathing; lacking platform at front door; rotted and damaged wood siding; damaged/coEapsing rear porch roof structure; damaged or missing stairs, handra\u00fcs, guardraEs at rear porch; damaged/missing footings for rear porch; rotted rafters; fascia and exterior trim; damaged and/or lacking foundations; and repair damaged chimney.\u201d This fist only included violations observable from outside the structures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\"> Emphasis added.

To affirm the lower courts\u2019 conclusion to the contrary would appear to subject the City\u2019s demolition process to heightened scrutiny by requiring that BCO \u00a7 18-59 be narrowly tailored to minimize the denial of a repair option. Of course, narrow tailoring is not required here because fundamental rights are not involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\"> For a property interest to be protected pursuant to the Due Process Clause, a claimant must have \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to the property interest, not simply \u201ca unilateral expectation of it.\u201d <em>Williams v Hofley Mfg Co, </em>430 Mich 603, 610; 424 NW2d 278 (1988), quoting <em>Roth, </em>408 US at 577.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on several nonbinding decisions from other jurisdictions for their \u201cgeneral due process analys[e]s,\u201d <em>Bonner, </em>298 Mich App at 727, provides nominal, if any, support for its holding that BCO \u00a7 18-59, on its face, violates due process. Indeed, both <em>Horton v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Gulledge, </em>277 NC 353, 360; 177 SE2d 885 (1970), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v Jones, </em>305 NC 520; 290 SE2d 675 (1982), and <em>Johnson v City of Paducah, </em>512 SW2d 514, 516 (Ky, 1974), involve as-applied challenges, not facial challenges. Nor do the cases relied on by the Court of Appeals assist us in resolving the specific inquiry whether BCO \u00a7 18-59 is facially violative of substantive due process, since <em>Horton, </em>277 NC 353, <em>Horne v City of Cordele, </em>140 Ga App 127; 230 SE2d 333 (1976), <em>Herrit v Code Mgmt Appeal Bd of City of Butler, </em>704 A2d 186 (1997), and <em>Washington v City of Winchester, </em>861 SW2d 125 (Ky App, 1993), do not specifically consider a local demolition ordinance in the context of substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Furthermore, <em>Horton, Herrit, </em>and <em>Horne </em>all involve takings claims, and, unlike the rebuttable unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO \u00a7 18-59, the ordinances at issue in both <em>Horton </em>and <em>Johnson </em>were held unconstitutional on the basis that they <em>required </em>demolition if the cost to repair an unsafe structure exceeded a certain no-repair cost threshold. In contrast, nothing in BCO \u00a7 18-59 expressly provides that the unreasonable-to-repair presumption is irrebuttable. Indeed, had the legislative body intended to make demolition the unavoidable result upon incidence of the unreasonahle-to-repair presumption, it certainly could have drafted BCO \u00a7 18-59 to make that result explicit. However, under the plain language of the ordinance, demolition is permissive. Consequently, to read BCO \u00a7 18-59 as creating an irrebuttable presumption would impermissibly render a portion of the ordinance surplusage in violation of the rules of statutory construction.
