In the instant case, a jury convicted defendant of extortion after he maliciously threatened to injure a mechanic unless the mechanic resumed working on defendant\u2019s truck in the rain. Defendant, relying on <em>Fobb, </em>maintains that he cannot be convicted of extortion because the act defendant sought to compel \u2014 the mechanic\u2019s continued work on the truck \u2014 was not of serious consequence to the mechanic. But the plain language of the extortion statute, MCL 750.213, defines extortion in terms of whether the defendant maliciously threatened a person with harm in order to \u201ccompel the person so threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>to do .. . <em>any </em>act against his will.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature clearly intended the crime of extortion to occur when a defendant maliciously threatens to injure another person with the intent to compel that person to do any act against his will, without regard to the significance or seriousness of the compelled act. Because the defendant\u2019s conduct satisfies the requirements set forth in MCL 750.213, we affirm his conviction of extortion. Furthermore, we overrule the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>People v Fobb </em>and <em>People v Hubbard </em>to the extent that those decisions require that the act or omission compelled by the defendant be of serious consequence to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Defendant, James Early Harris, Jr., agreed to pay Willie Lee Neal $400 to fix the transmission on defendant\u2019s truck. Defendant paid $210 in advance, and agreed to tender the balance upon completion of the work. On the afternoon of September 11, 2010, Neal was working on the truck in the shared driveway between defendant\u2019s home and that of his neighbor, Robbin Smith. Smith had just returned home from work, and her mother and aunt were sitting on her front porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">It began to rain, and Smith\u2019s mother invited Neal to sit on Smith\u2019s covered porch to get out of the rain. Smith went inside to prepare a sandwich for Neal. When she returned outside, defendant was on the porch talking to Neal. He was upset that Neal was not repairing the truck. Neal indicated that he would resume working once it stopped raining, but defendant continued to express his displeasure with Neal. Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fended by defendant\u2019s vulgar language, Smith asked defendant to leave her porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendant went into his house and returned with a handgun. Waving the gun, defendant confronted Neal from the side of Smith\u2019s porch. Defendant told Neal that he would \u201csilence him\u201d unless Neal either immediately resumed working on the truck or returned $100 of the prepaid compensation. Neal did neither, but instead indicated that he would rather meet his maker than capitulate to defendant\u2019s demands. The incident upset the three women on the porch. Smith\u2019s mother was in tears. Smith perceived defendant\u2019s actions as a threat, and announced her intention to telephone the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendant went home. He was in the shared driveway carrying a rifle when the police arrived. Defendant was arrested and charged with felonious assault, carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, assaulting, resisting or obstructing a police officer, and three corresponding counts of carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony (felony-firearm). The felonious assault charge was amended to extortion at the request of the prosecution, and defendant was bound over to circuit court on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">A jury found defendant guilty of all counts after a three-day trial. Defendant appealed by right in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed his convictions in a divided, unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The Court of Appeals majority concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s extortion conviction. For present purposes, the first two elements of extortion are (1) an oral threat (2) to harm another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>person. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, because defendant held a gun and threatened Neal that he would \u201csilence him\u201d if Neal did not comply with defendant\u2019s demands, the first two elements of extortion were satisfied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the third element of extortion \u2014 that defendant\u2019s threat was intended to compel Neal to perform an act against Neal\u2019s will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals acknowledged that <em>People v Fobb </em>held that only \u201cserious\u201d acts could support a conviction under the \u201cagainst his will\u201d prong of the extortion statute, but observed that \u201cnothing in the statutory language of MCL 750.213 requires the action to be serious in nature or have significant value.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that defendant\u2019s threat was intended to compel Neal to perform an act against Neal\u2019s will and therefore the third element of MCL 750.213 was satisfied, even under the <em>Fobb </em>standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Judge O\u2019CONNELL dissented in part, asserting that \u201c [established precedent required the prosecution to prove that defendant intended to compel Neal to do something that had serious consequences, against Neal\u2019s will.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because Neal had previously agreed to repair the truck for his own pecuniary benefit, Judge O\u2019CONNELL reasoned that returning to work would not have been against Neal\u2019s will.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his view, neither returning to work nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>returning $100 of the prepayment were of \u201cserious consequence\u201d to Neal as required by <em>Fobb.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Judge O\u2019CONNELL concluded that although this Court might wish to clarify the elements of extortion and the holding in <em>Fobb, </em>the Court of Appeals panel was bound to follow precedent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, Judge O\u2019CONNELL would have reversed defendant\u2019s extortion conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal to determine what the prosecution must prove to convict a defendant of extortion and whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Whether the crime of extortion requires that the act compelled of the victim be one having \u201cserious consequences\u201d to the victim is a question of statutory interpretation, which is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In determining whether sufficient evidence exists to sustain a conviction, this Court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and considers whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">A. INTERPRETING MCL 750.213</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">As always, the goal of statutory interpretation \u201c \u2018is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The touchstone of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s language. If the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended its plain meaning and we enforce the statute as written.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">At common law, extortion was defined as \u201cthe unlawful taking by a public officer, under color of his office, of any money or thing of value that was not due to him, or more than was due, or before it was due.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The origin of statutory extortion, however, is attributed at least in part to the English courts\u2019 refusal to expand the scope of common-law robbery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">The English courts had held it to be robbery, where a defendant coerced payment of money or goods by a threat to accuse the victim of sodomy or to destroy a dwelling; however, they refused to extend robbery to threats of other accusations or of other harm to persons or property. Thus, they held it was robbery when the threat was to commit immediate violence, but not robbery where the threat was of violence in the future, or was of destruction of property, or of accusation of crime. This gap in coverage was filled in various ways by the statutory extortion offenses enacted in many jurisdictions.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Michigan was among those jurisdictions that enacted an extortion statute early in its statehood.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The current version of the statute, MCL 750.213, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Any person who shall, either orally or by a written or printed communication, maliciously threaten to accuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>another of any crime or offense, or shall orally or by any written or printed communication maliciously threaten any injury to the person or property or mother, father, husband, wife or child of another with intent thereby to extort money or any pecuniary advantage whatever, or with intent to compel the person so threatened to do or refrain from doing any act against his will, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 20 years or by a fine of not more than 10,000 dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The statute has remained largely unchanged since its enactment more than 150 years ago.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">According to the plain language of the statute, the crime of extortion is complete when a defendant (1) either orally or by a written or printed communication, maliciously threatens (2) to accuse another of any crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>or offense, <em>or </em>to injure the person or property or mother, father, spouse or child of another (3) with the intent to extort money or any pecuniary advantage whatever, <em>or </em>with the intent to compel the person threatened to do or refrain from doing any act against his or her will. In the instant case, the prosecution alleged that defendant maliciously threatened to injure Neal with the intent to compel Neal to do an act against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Relying on <em>Fobb, </em>defendant maintains that the prosecution failed to prove that he intended to compel Neal to do \u201cany act against his will.\u201d In <em>People v Fobb, </em>the defendant twice telephoned the victim, first complaining that the victim had been spreading lies about the defendant, and then again threatening to sue the victim for $21,000.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After the victim hung up the telephone on defendant the second time, the defendant broke through the victim\u2019s locked door and attacked the victim, first choking her and then beating her with a hairdryer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> During the attack, the defendant demanded that the victim draft and sign a note admitting that she had spread lies about the defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant was convicted of extortion and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed Fobb\u2019s extortion conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Although acknowledging that the note was obtained against the victim\u2019s will, the <em>Fobb </em>panel held that the defendant\u2019s extortion conviction should be overturned because \u201cthe act required of the victim was minor with no serious consequences to the victim. The note the victim was forced to write was erratic, quixotic and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>not used to the victim\u2019s detriment or defendant\u2019s advantage.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The <em>Fobb </em>panel reasoned that \u201c[t]he Legislature did not intend punishment for every minor threat,\u201d and after discussing \u201can old Tennessee case,\u201d noted \u201cthat Michigan cases brought under the \u2018against his will\u2019 section of the extortion statutes have been for serious demands.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Despite the lack of any \u201cseriousness\u201d requirement in the plain language of the \u201cagainst his will\u201d prong of MCL 750.213, <em>Fobb </em>concluded \u201cthat the demand by the defendant that the victim execute a useless note was not an offense such as was contemplated by the extortion statute as no pecuniary advantage was obtained nor was the act demanded of such consequence or seriousness as to apply that statute.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzP\">In <em>People v Hubbard, </em>the defendant challenged his extortion conviction on the ground that MCL 750.213 is void for vagueness because \u201cthe statute allows a defendant to be convicted of extortion after making a minor threat that results in the victim engaging in an action with no serious consequences to the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Relying on its decision in <em>Fobb, </em>the Court of Appeals, reasoned that the Legislature did not intend to punish every minor threat, but only \u201cthose threats that result in pecuniary advantage to the individual making the threat or that result in the victim undertaking an action of serious consequence . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that the statute is not void for vagueness because \u201cthe construction afforded the statute by <em>Fobb </em>provides sufficient guidance regarding the nature of the threat and act compelled to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the statute will not be enforced arbitrarily or discriminatorily.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although <em>Fobb </em>was decided before 1990 and was therefore not binding on subsequent panels of the Court of Appeals, the reaffirmation of <em>Fobb </em>by <em>Hubbard </em>in 1996 rendered it binding on subsequent panels.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Court of Appeals holding in <em>Fobb </em>is contrary to the plain language of MCL 750.213. The statute contains no requirement whatsoever that the act demanded must be of serious consequence to the victim in order to convict a defendant. The \u201cagainst his will\u201d prong of MCL 750.213 is satisfied when a malicious threat is communicated \u201cwith intent to compel the person so threatened to do or refrain from doing <em>any </em>act against his will.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cAny\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">1. one, a, an, or some; one or more without specification or identification. 2. whatever or whichever it may be. 3. in whatever quantity or number, great or small; some. 4. every; all... [<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Because \u201cany\u201d is commonly understood to encompass a wide range of things, we conclude that the Legislature intended that MCL 750.213 is satisfied without regard to whether the act required of the victim had \u201cserious consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how the Legislature could have cast a broader net given the use of the words \u201cany act\u201d in MCL 750.213. Consequently, the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Fobb </em>requiring that the act demanded be of serious consequence to the victim improperly narrowed the scope of MCL 750.213, and we overrule that aspect of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Tombs, </em>defendant urges this Court to maintain the <em>Hubbard </em>panel\u2019s adoption of <em>Fobb\u2019s </em>construction of the extortion statute. In <em>Tombs, </em>the defendant challenged his conviction of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive material under MCL 750.145c(3).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This Court addressed the question of whether MCL 750.145c(3) requires that the distribution or promotion of child sexually abusive material be performed with criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>intent. We concluded that despite the absence of an explicit criminal intent requirement in the statutory language, the Legislature\u2019s use of active verbs \u201csupports the presumption that the Legislature intended that the prosecution prove that an accused performed the prohibited act with criminal intent.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Citing the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>United States v X-Citement Video, </em>Inc, the Court reasoned that \u201cif there were no <em>mens rea </em>element respecting the distribution of the material, the statute could punish otherwise innocent conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court inferred a criminal intent requirement in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Just as the Court inferred a criminal intent element in the statute in <em>Tombs, </em>the defendant in the instant case urges the Court to retain <em>Fobb\u2019s </em>\u201cserious consequences\u201d construction of MCL 750.213 \u2014 as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Hubbard </em>\u2014 for the purpose of limiting the scope of the extortion statute. The comparison of the statutory analysis in <em>Tombs </em>to that of instant case is inapposite. Because the language of MCL 750.145c(3) lacked a <em>mens rea </em>requirement, the <em>Tombs </em>Court saved the statute by inferring a criminal intent requirement in the statute. Unlike MCL 750.145c(3), the plain language of the extortion statute passes constitutional muster without any judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A statute may be challenged for vagueness on three grounds: (1) that it fails to provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed; (2) that it is so indefinite that it confers on the trier of fact unstructured and unlimited discretion to determine whether an offense has been committed; or (3) that its coverage is overbroad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>impinges on First Amendment protections.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving that the law is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This Court is responsible for upholding both the Michigan and federal constitutions, and our authority to invalidate laws is limited and must be predicated on a clearly apparent demonstration of unconstitutionality. Moreover, laws are presumed constitutional, and this Court must construe a statute as constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Because neither <em>Hubbard </em>nor the instant case implicates First Amendment freedoms, the constitutionality of the extortion statute must be examined in light of the particular facts at hand.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The pertinent inquiry is whether the extortion statute gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited, and also whether the statute provides an explicit standard for those who apply it.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In <em>Kolender v Lawson, </em>the United States Supreme Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">[a]lthough the doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement, we have recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>recently that the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine \u201cis not actual notice, but the other principal element of the doctrine-the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d <em>[Smith v Goguen, </em>415 US 566, 574; 94 S Ct 1242; 39 L Ed 2d 605 (1974)]. Where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit \u201ca standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections. <em>Id., </em>at 575.\"[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Thus, the key question is whether the extortion statute provides adequate notice to citizens regarding what conduct is prohibited and sufficient guidance to fact-finders in order to avoid arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>Hubbard </em>correctly concluded that the Legislature did not intend to punish every minor threat, but it need not have relied on the judicially crafted \u201cserious consequences\u201d construction of the extortion statute to arrive at its conclusion. The <em>Hubbard </em>panel relied on <em>Fobb\u2019s </em>\u201cserious consequences\u201d construction to conclude that the statute provides the fact-finder with sufficient guidance so as not to encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. But the plain language of the extortion statute itself clearly provides that the Legislature intended punishment for those who <em>\u201cmaliciously </em>threaten\u201d others.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In other words, the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of a malice requirement provides law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ment, judges, and juries with an explicit standard for applying MCL 750.213. Malice is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">1. The intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act. 2. Reckless disregard of the law or of a person\u2019s legal rights. 3. Ill will; wickedness of heart. This sense is most typical in nonlegal contexts.[<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Therefore, only those threats made with the intent to commit a wrongful act without justification or excuse, or made in reckless disregard of the law or of a person\u2019s legal rights, rise to the level necessary to support an extortion conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge in <em>Hubbard </em>was premised on the theory that MCL 750.213 conferred unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether extortion had been committed. Thus, the panel did not address whether the statute provides a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he or she may act accordingly. With regard to whether a person of ordinary intelligence is afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited by the extortion statute, the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>People v Boomer </em>is insightful.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In <em>Boomer, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed the constitutionality of MCL 750.337, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Given the lack of any restrictive language to limit or guide a prosecution for \u201cindecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language,\u201d the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[allowing a prosecution where one utters \u2018insulting\u2019 language could possibly subject a vast percentage of the populace to a misdemeanor conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Because the statute failed to provide fair notice of the scope of conduct it prohibited, and also because it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, the Court of Appeals held that the statute was facially vague.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Central to its analysis, the panel reasoned that the statute\u2019s failure to provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed was due at least in part to the subjective nature of the statutory language. The Court of Appeals noted that even inferring a reasonable person standard</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">would require every person who speaks audibly where children are present to guess what a law enforcement officer might consider too indecent, immoral, or vulgar for a child\u2019s ears. Children aside, it is far from obvious what the reasonable adult considers to be indecent, immoral, vulgar, or insulting. As a result, a judicially imposed \u201creasonable person\u201d limitation would not, in our opinion, cure the vagueness of the statute.[<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In light of the reasoning in <em>Boomer, </em>the <em>Hubbard </em>panel\u2019s adoption of <em>Fobb\u2019s </em>\u201cserious consequences\u201d construction actually exposes the extortion statute to a vagueness claim premised on the lack of notice of the prohibited conduct. Indeed, how would a putative defendant in a statutory extortion context know with any degree of certainty whether the act he or she intends to compel is of serious consequence to the victim? Just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>in <em>Boomer, </em>it may be far from obvious what a reasonable adult considers to be \u201cserious\u201d in consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">Nonetheless, any claim that MCL 750.213 fails to provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed is merit-less. A statute is not vague if the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by referring to their generally accepted meaning.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Because the word \u201cany\u201d is commonly understood to encompass a wide range of things,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and the word \u201cmalicious\u201d is commonly understood to involve either the intent to commit a wrongful act, absent justification or excuse, or an act or omission in reckless disregard of the law or of a person\u2019s legal rights,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> any contention that the defendant did not have sufficient notice that his conduct would fall within the scope of the extortion statute is meritless. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of a scienter requirement \u2014 in this case the requirement that the defendant \u201cmaliciously\u201d threaten another\u2014 may mitigate a statute\u2019s vagueness, \u201cespecially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The plain language of MCL 750.213 provides the trier of fact with sufficient guidance regarding the nature of the threat required for a conviction of statutory extortion and also provides a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited so that he or she <em>may </em>act accordingly. Therefore, the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Hubbard </em>erred by relying on the \u201cserious consequences\u201d construction afforded the statute in <em>Fobb. </em>Accordingly, we overrule that aspect of those decisions.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Having overruled <em>Fobb </em>and <em>Hubbard, </em>and looking exclusively to the text of the extortion statute, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support defendant\u2019s extortion conviction. The existence of malice, as set forth in this opinion, depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and can be inferred from a defendant\u2019s conduct. In this case, the record shows that defendant was upset and used vulgar language when, while armed with a handgun, he threatened to \u201csilence\u201d Neal. Defendant\u2019s threat to \u201csilence\u201d Neal, while waving a gun, unless Neal resumed repairing the truck in the rain, was certainly a wrongful act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>and it was not justified.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Therefore, the threat was sufficiently malicious. Neal expressed a willingness to face God rather than capitulate to the defendant\u2019s demands. Defendant orally communicated a malicious threat to injure Neal, thereby satisfying the first two elements of statutory extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Moreover, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the third element \u2014 that defendant made the threat with the intent to compel Neal to undertake an act against his will. Although Neal initially agreed to work on the truck, the record establishes that he did not want to work on the truck in the rain, when defendant demanded otherwise. Whether a victim was in breach of a contract is immaterial under the extortion statute.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence to justify a rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Because the plain language of MCL 750.213 requires that a defendant maliciously threaten harm to another with the intent to compel that person \u201cto do or refrain from doing any act against his will,\u201d the level of significance or seriousness of the consequences of the compelled act to the victim is immaterial. We overrule the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>People v Fobb </em>and <em>People v Hubbard </em>to the extent that they require that the intended compelled act or omission be of serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>consequence to the victim, and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the instant case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-5\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Zahra, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b407-6\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> <em>People v Fobb, </em>145 Mich App 786, 791-792; 378 NW2d 600 (1985).

In 1897, \u201cverbally\u201d was replaced by \u201corally\u201d with respect to malicious threats to accuse another of a crime, and \u201corally\u201d was added with respect to \u201cwritten or printed\u201d malicious threats to injure persons or property. See 1897 PA 188. In 1925, \u201cthreaten injury to the person or property or property of another\u201d was amended to include \u201cor mother, father, husband, wife, or child of another.\u201d See 1925 PA 83, \u00a7 1. The extortion statute was most recently amended during the 1931 enactment of the Penal Code, which reused the maximum authorized fine to $10,000 and the maximum authorized imprisonment to 20 years.
