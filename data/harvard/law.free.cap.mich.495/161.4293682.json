We previously held that the six-year period of limitations of MCL 600.5807(8) applies to the parties\u2019 indemnification contract. We now hold that the indemnity clauses in the parties\u2019 subcontract apply here, because the plain language of the indemnification clauses extends to Ahrens\u2019s failure to undertake corrective work as obligated by the subcontract. We further hold that Sherman Lake YMCA made a \u201cclaim\u201d upon Miller-Davis which triggered Ahrens\u2019s liability under the indemnity clauses. Ahrens\u2019s failure to indemnify therefore caused the damages Miller-Davis sustained in undertaking the corrective work itself. Finally, we hold that Miller-Davis\u2019s claim was not barred by the six-year statute of limitations found in MCL 600.5807(8). Rather, Miller-Davis\u2019s breach of contract claim for Ahrens\u2019s failure to indemnify is distinct from its breach of contract claim based on Ahrens\u2019s failure to install the roof according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>specifications, and Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnity action necessarily accrued at a later point. We therefore reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion discussing Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnity claim, and remand this case to the Kalamazoo Circuit Court for entry of judgment in Miller-Davis\u2019s favor and to determine whether Miller-Davis is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the relevant indemnification clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Miller-Davis Company was an \u201cat risk\u201d contractor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Sherman Lake YMCA\u2019s natatorium project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Miller-Davis hired defendant Ahrens Construction, Inc., as a subcontractor to install similar roof systems on three rooms, including the natatorium. The contract incorporated by reference the applicable project plans and specifications, the American Institute of Architects General Conditions (AIA A201), the project manual, and a written guarantee of Ahrens\u2019s work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> AIA A201 required the subcontractor to \u201cassume toward the Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities which the Contractor, by these Documents, assume[d] toward the Owner and Architect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It further obligated Ahrens to \u201cbear costs of correcting such rejected Work, including additional testing and inspections and compensation for the Architect\u2019s services and expenses made necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>thereby,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to correct at its expense any work \u201cfound to be not in accordance with the Contract Documents\u201d within one year of Substantial Completion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ahrens agreed to install all products in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the requirements of the plans and specifications. Ahrens further agreed to indemnify Miller-Davis from and against any liabilities, claims, damages, losses, actions, and expenses arising out of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">- Ahrens substantially completed the work on June 11, 1999, at which point its Written Guarantee commenced. The Guarantee provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">[Ahrens] hereby agree [s] that all work furnished to the project is guaranteed against deficiencies and defects in materials and/or workmanship for a period of one (1) year, as described in the Contract Documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">We agree to satisfy such obligations, which appear within the guarantee period without cost to the Owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed to establish a period of limitation with respect to any other obligation we may have under the Contract Documents or to alter any longer period of time as may be prescribed by law of the Contract Documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">A certificate of substantial completion issued on June 25, 1999. During the winter season of 1999-2000, Sherman Lake YMCA experienced excessive condensation in the natatorium, which it termed the \u201cnatatorium moisture problem\u201d (NMP). As a result of the accumulated conden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sation, it sometimes appeared to be raining within the natatorium. Miller-Davis notified Ahrens of the NMP on January 28, 2000, and Ahrens returned to the project to undertake remedial work not contemplated in the original design. Ahrens received its final payment on February 17, 2000, but the NMP persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In February 2003, the project architects opened the roof and discovered significant deficiencies with Ahrens\u2019s installation of the roof system, namely inch-wide gaps between the Styrofoam blocks and sub-T supports, and many gaps and tears in the vapor barrier. The architects determined that the installation was not in substantial compliance with the contract, and directed reinstallation of the roof system using salvageable materials to the extent possible. The corrective work contained three elements not contained in the original design: Procor, a waterproofing agent; expanding foam insulation; and butyl caulk sealant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">By letter dated April 2, 2003, Miller-Davis notified Ahrens that the roof system was not installed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s requirements and the subcontract guidelines. Miller-Davis\u2019s May 5, 2003 letter to Merchants Bonding Company, Ahrens\u2019s surety, explicitly declared Ahrens in default and requested a conference within fifteen days. The parties met on June 27,2003, and Ahrens agreed to review the corrective work plans and provide a plan for performance within a week. Neither Ahrens nor its bonding company provided such a plan. On July 15, 2003, Miller-Davis gave Ahrens notice of default, terminated Ahrens\u2019s right to perform the contract, and demanded the bonding company perform under the bond. In that letter, plaintiff noted that Sherman Lake YMCA was \u201cconsidering declaring a Contractor Default....\u201d The bonding company notified Miller-Davis that Ahrens had waived the surety\u2019s right to perform under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Miller-Davis and Sherman Lake YMCA entered into an Agreement for Corrective Work on August 27, 2003. Pursuant to the agreement and at the direction of the architects, Miller-Davis installed Procor, expanding foam insulation, and butyl caulk. On December 8, 2003, an independent contractor certified that Miller-Davis had completed the corrective work. Sherman Lake YMCA has not since experienced the NMR</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Miller-Davis filed suit in the Kalamazoo Circuit Court against Ahrens and its bonding company in May 2005, alleging breach of contract and seeking indemnification and bond collection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following a bench trial, the circuit court found that Ahrens\u2019s work was deficient and that it caused the NMR The court rejected Ahrens\u2019s assertion that it had ceased involvement with the project before July 2003, noting that the parties had engaged in a series of meetings regarding corrective work from March to July 2003. Although the court found that \u201cno claims, suits, actions, recoveries, or demands were ever made or recovered\u201d by Sherman Lake YMCA against Miller-Davis, it found that Miller-Davis had nonetheless suffered damages as a result of Ahrens\u2019s deficient work and awarded Miller-Davis damages of $348,851.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">On appeal, Ahrens argued that the circuit court erred by not granting summary disposition in its favor based on the contractor\u2019s statute of repose, MCL 600.5839(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The Court of Appeals agreed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reversed, holding that the general statute of limitations for contract actions set forth in MCL 600.5807(8)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applies to this case rather than the contractor\u2019s statute of repose, which applies only to tort actions against a contractor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We remanded to the Court of Appeals for application of the proper statute of limitations and for consideration of any remaining issues.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">On remand, the Court of Appeals explained that MCL 600.5827 provided that Miller-Davis\u2019s claim ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>crued at the time of the wrong upon which it was based rather than the time when damage resulted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to that distinction, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201cthe underlying basis for [Miller-Davis\u2019s] claim is that defendant breached a contract provision providing that [a]ll. .. work furnished on this order shall comply with the terms and requirements of the plans and specifications . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, it held that Ahrens\u2019s breach occurred upon the date of substantial completion, which was beyond the six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract actions supplied by MCL 600.5807(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Court of Appeals also held that the indemnity clauses did not affect its conclusion, explaining that \u201cno one had brought a claim or demand against plaintiff within the meaning of the indemnification clause.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals found that \u201cdefendant did not breach [the indemnity] provision[s] of the contract,\u201d and Miller-Davis could not use the date of defendant\u2019s alleged breach of the indemnity clause as an \u201calternative accrual date\u201d for its underlying breach of contract claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also concluded that even if Miller-Davis could show that Sherman Lake YMCA made a claim or demand against plaintiff, such a demand \u201carose out of the owner\u2019s contract with plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tiff, not plaintiffs subcontract with defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that Miller-Davis had failed to provide evidence causally linking Ahrens\u2019s nonconforming work to the NMIJ which it considered to be the basis for Miller-Davis\u2019s claim for damages.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We again granted Miller-Davis\u2019s application for leave to appeal, requesting that the parties brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">(1) whether the indemnification clause in the plaintiffs contract with defendant Ahrens applies to this case; (2) if so, whether the plaintiffs action for breach of that provision was barred by the statute of limitations, MCL 600.5807(8); and (3) whether the plaintiff adequately proved that any breach of the indemnification clause caused its damages, including the issue whether the trial court clearly erred in concluding that defendant Ahrens\u2019 performance of nonconforming work caused the natatorium moisture problem.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Resolution of this case requires interpretation of MCL 600.5807(8). We review this question of law de novo.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The proper interpretation of a contract is also a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We review a trial court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, giving particular deference to the trial court\u2019s superior position to determine witness credibility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A factual finding is clearly erroneous if there is no substantial evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sustain it<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or if, although there is some evidence to support it, the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">III. ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">To determine whether Miller-Davis has an actionable claim for indemnification, we will first consider the language of the indemnity clauses, ascertaining whether they apply to the facts of this case. If these clauses apply, we must then consider whether Miller-Davis has shown that Ahrens\u2019s failure to conduct corrective work caused Miller-Davis\u2019s damages. Finally, we determine whether Miller-Davis sustained any such damages within the six-year limitations period for breach of contract actions found in MCL 600.5807(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">A. INDEMNIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">An indemnity contract creates a direct, primary liability between the indemnitor and the indemnitee that is original and independent of any other obligation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In the construction context, indemnity clauses between general contractors (indemnitees) and subcontractors (indemnitors) are common, with general contractors and subcontractors ultimately liable to the project owner. Michigan law provides contracting parties with broad discretion in negotiating the scope of indemnity clauses. The only legal restriction upon indemnity in the subcontractor context is the prohibition on indemnification against the \u201csole negligence\u201d of the contractor, which is not at issue here.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>As with any other contract, our primary task in construing a contract for indemnification is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intention at the time they entered into the contract.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We determine the parties\u2019 intent by examining the language of the contract according to its plain and ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In doing so, we avoid an interpretation that would render any portion of the contract nugatory.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We assess the threshold question whether a contract\u2019s indemnity clause applies to a set of facts by a \u201cstraightforward analysis of the facts and the contract terms.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">Where parties have expressly contracted for indemnification, \u201cthe extent of the duty must be determined from the language of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> To this end, the indemnity clauses in the parties\u2019 subcontract are critical in applying general indemnification principles to the facts of this case. The subcontract provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">You [Ahrens] as Subcontractor/Supplier agree to <em>defend, hold harmless and indemnify </em>Miller-Davis Company... from and against <em>all </em>claims, damages, losses, demands, liens, payments, suits, actions, recoveries, judgments and expenses including attorney\u2019s fees, interest, sanctions, and court costs which are made, brought, <em>or recovered </em>against Miller-Davis Company, by reasons of or resulting from, but not limited to, any injury, damage, loss, or occurrence arising out of or resulting from the performance or execution of this Purchase Order and caused, in whole or in part, by any act, omission, fault, negligence, or breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>conditions of this Purchase Order by the Subcontractor/Supplier, its agents, employees, and subcontractors regardless of whether or not caused in whole or in part by any act, omission, fault, breach of contract, or negligence of Miller-Davis Company. The Subcontractor/Supplier shall not, however, be obligated to indemnify Miller-Davis Company for any damage or injuries caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of Miller-Davis Company.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The plain language of this clause is inclusive.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The clause uses the terms \u201call\u201d or \u201cany,\u201d which provide for the broadest possible obligation to indemnify.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The language used by the parties in contracting for indemnity is unambiguous and clearly intended to apply as broadly as possible. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals determined that the indemnity clauses were inapplicable because \u201cno one had brought a claim or demand against plaintiff within the meaning of the indemnification clause.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While the indemnity clauses specifically mention a \u201cclaim,\u201d they also trigger liability more broadly, when \u201cdamages, losses, demands,\u201d or \u201cexpenses,\u201d result from \u201cany act, omission, fault, negligence, or breach ....\u201d Furthermore, the definition of \u201cclaim\u201d itself is broad. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines a claim as the \u201caggregate of operative facts giving rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>a right <em>enforceable </em>by a court,\u201d and \u201cany <em>right </em>to payment or to an equitable remedy. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, ALA A201, \u00a7 4.3.1, incorporated into the subcontract, defines a claim as \u201ca demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking, as a matter of right,. . . relief with respect to the terms of the Contract,\u201d as well as \u201cother disputes and matters in question ... arising out of or relating to the Contract.\u201d It further requires any claims to be made in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">To determine whether Sherman Lake YMCA made a written claim or demand against Miller-Davis, we look to the Agreement for Corrective Work they entered into. That agreement specified that Miller-Davis \u201cacknowledges it has responsibility to correct work or replace materials that are not in compliance with the contract documents\u201d and that \u201csubcontractor Ahrens did not install one or more components of the Roof System in accordance with the Owner-Contractor contract documents.\u201d The purpose of the agreement was to \u201cavoid differences or any dispute that may be time consuming, financially expensive and/or not in the best interest of any of [the parties] or the users of the Project,\u201d and it goes on to outline \u201cthe rights and obligations\u201d of the parties. \u201cNothing herein,\u201d it continues, \u201cshall. . . release any rights of claim the Owner, and/or the Contractor may now have or hereafter acquire against any third person regarding responsibility for the NMP . . . .\u201d The agreement termed this course of action a \u201ccompromise, settlement and accord ... to effect a settlement of contested claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A straightforward reading of the Agreement for Corrective Work confirms that Sherman Lake YMCA possessed a claim or demand against Miller-Davis that was resolved \u2014 at Miller-Davis\u2019s expense \u2014 by this settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ment between them. That Sherman Lake YMCA and Miller-Davis succeeded in resolving their dispute without resort to legal action does not alter Ahrens\u2019s obligation to indemnify Miller-Davis for the corrective work it was required to undertake in light of Ahrens\u2019s default. The indemnity provisions do not require Sherman Lake YMCA to prove liability or initiate a lawsuit or arbitration proceeding against Miller-Davis for Miller-Davis to seek indemnification from Ahrens for the corrective work it performed under the Agreement, nor do we see any question regarding the reasonableness of that agreed-upon work or Miller-Davis\u2019s liability to Sherman Lake YMCA for it.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As a result, we hold that the indemnity clauses of the subcontract apply to Miller-Davis\u2019s corrective work.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">B. CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We turn next to the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Miller-Davis is not entitled to indemnification because it has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that Ahrens\u2019s nonconforming work caused the NME<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> As the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Appeals recognized, causation of damages is an essential element of any breach of contract action, including an action for indemnity.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> A party asserting a breach of contract must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there was a contract (2) which the other party breached (3) thereby resulting in damages to the party claiming breach.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The Court of Appeals, however, misconstrued the relevant causation inquiry. There is no dispute that Miller-Davis incurred costs in undertaking the corrective work that Ahrens refused to perform, and that Miller-Davis has claimed those costs as damages. Therefore, to the extent that Ahrens was obligated to indemnify Miller-Davis for the costs of the corrective work, its breach of that obligation caused Miller-Davis\u2019s claimed damages. Whether Ahrens\u2019s nonconforming work caused the NMP is not relevant to this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Nor do the terms of the subcontract require Miller-Davis to show that Ahrens caused the NME Under the subcontract, Ahrens is obligated to indemnify Miller-Davis for, among other things, all claims and demands made or brought against Miller-Davis \u201cby reasons of or resulting from, but not limited to, any injury, damage, loss, or occurrence arising out of or resulting from the performance of execution of [the subcontract] and caused, in whole or in part, by any act, omission, fault, negligence, or breach of the conditions of this [subcontract] by\u201d Ahrens. At no point did Sherman Lake YMCA demand, or Miller-Davis guarantee, to correct the NME Indeed, the Agreement for Corrective Work made clear that Miller-Davis did not concede that Ahrens\u2019s work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>caused the NMP: \u201cThe Contractor does not acknowledge that its or any subcontractor\u2019s non-conforming work or materials were or are a contributing or the sole cause of the NME\u201d Rather, Miller-Davis acknowledged only that it \u201chas the responsibility for construction of the Project in accordance with the Owner-Contractor contract documents\u201d under the Agreement for Corrective work, never promising to resolve the NME Correspondingly, Miller-Davis maintained at trial and throughout its communication with Ahrens that it does not know whether Ahrens\u2019s workmanship caused the NME</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">Ahrens, for its part, was obligated to install the roof system in accordance with the plans and specifications and to correct any nonconforming installation, regardless of whether its nonconforming work caused the NME<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accordingly, as the terms of the subcontract and the Agreement for Corrective Work make clear, Miller-Davis was only obligated, in light of Ahrens\u2019s default, to correct Ahrens\u2019s nonconforming work; whether such correction resolved the NMP is separate from the question whether Ahrens\u2019s nonconforming work caused Miller-Davis damages for which it could seek indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Miller-Davis has shown that Ahrens\u2019s failure to undertake corrective work caused those damages by way of Sherman Lake YMCA\u2019s demand that Miller-Davis itself correct the work.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Ahrens\u2019s refusal to correct its nonconforming work was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the Agreement for Corrective Work, which passed liability for that work on to Miller-Davis. Miller-Davis\u2019s duty to undertake the corrective-work obligation shirked by Ahrens resulted in the out-of-pocket expenses\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cdamages\u201d or \u201closses\u201d \u2014 sustained by Miller-Davis in the course of reinstalling the roof. Because Miller-Davis presented sufficient evidence to establish that Ahrens\u2019s breach of the indemnity clauses caused its losses in correcting Ahrens\u2019s work, Miller-Davis is entitled to damages in the amount of its losses.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">C. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Nevertheless, Ahrens also asserts that Miller-Davis brought its breach of contract action beyond the relevant limitations period. MCL 600.5807(8) provides that \u201c[n]o person may bring or maintain an action to recover damages or sums due for breach of contract. . . unless, after the claim first accrued ..., he commences the action within ... 6 years . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The six-year limitation of MCL 600.5807(8) begins to run \u201cwhen the promisor fails to perform under the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> A specific action for indemnification against losses accrues \u201cwhen the indemnitee [has] sustained the loss.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The Court of Appeals examined the subcontract to determine the wrong on which Miller-Davis\u2019s claims were based, explaining that the \u201cunderlying basis\u201d for its claims was Ahrens\u2019s breach of the contract provision that \u201c \u2018[a]ll materials and/or work furnished on this order shall comply with the terms and the requirements of the plans and specifications . .. \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As a result, the Court of Appeals held that the wrong that provided the basis for Miller-Davis\u2019s complaint \u201cmust have occurred on or before defendant completed its portion of the overall construction project.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This analysis fails to recognize that Ahrens <em>twice </em>breached the contract: first, when it failed to install the roof system in accordance with the relevant plans and specifications, and then later when it refused to indemnify Miller-Davis for the corrective work required to remedy its nonconforming installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">While these contract claims were both based on terms within the same agreement, nothing in MCL 600.5807 or our contract-law principles compels the conclusion that the claims must therefore share a common point of accrual. Rather, the date of accrual for the breach of an indemnified promise does not serve as the date of accrual for an indemnity action. These separate breaches have logically distinct points of accrual.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Ahrens first failed to perform under the contract when it installed a roof that did not conform to plan specifications. The cause of action for <em>this </em>breach accrued by April 1999, when Miller-Davis made its last payment to Ahrens under the subcontract. This oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>curred more than six years before Miller-Davis brought suit in May 2005. As a result, Miller-Davis\u2019s cause of action for breach of Ahrens\u2019s promise to install a roof conforming to plan specifications is barred by MCL 600.5807(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">However, Ahrens\u2019s breach of the indemnity provision provides an independent basis for Miller-Davis\u2019s current indemnification claim. This breach necessarily occurred <em>after </em>Ahrens\u2019s breach of the underlying promise to conform its work to the subcontract\u2019s specifications. This is because no demand or claim upon Miller-Davis could trigger Ahrens\u2019s obligation to indemnify until <em>after </em>Ahrens had breached its promise to install the roof system according to the specifications. Miller-Davis offers three potential points of first accrual for this claim: February 26, 2003 (when Miller-Davis conducted a partial tear-off of the roof and discovered the nonconforming work); August 27, 2003 (when Miller-Davis settled Sherman Lake YMCA\u2019s claims via the Agreement for Corrective Work); and December 8, 2003 (when an independent engineering firm certified that Miller-Davis had corrected Ahrens\u2019s defective work). We need not decide which of these dates marks the accrual of Miller-Davis\u2019s cause of action for indemnity because we agree the claim did not accrue before February 2003 and Miller-Davis\u2019s May 2005 complaint was therefore well within the six-year period of limitations. Accordingly, we hold that Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnification claim was not barred by MCL 600.5807(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the indemnity clauses in the parties\u2019 subcontract were inapplicable because no third party made a claim or demand upon Miller-Davis. Rather, Miller-Davis en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tered into the Agreement for Corrective Work with Sherman Lake YMCA that clearly established Sherman Lake YMCA\u2019s claim against Miller-Davis that Ahrens\u2019s installation of the natatorium did not conform to the subcontract\u2019s specifications. Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnity claim for Ahrens\u2019s failure to undertake corrective work is logically distinct from its breach of contract claim for Ahrens\u2019s faulty installation of the roof system, and necessarily accrued at a later point. As such, the Court of Appeals further erred to the extent it held that Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnity claim was barred by MCL 600.5807(8) because it accrued on the date of substantial completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Because Sherman Lake YMCA made a claim or demand upon Miller-Davis for corrective work which Ahrens was obligated to perform, and Ahrens refused to indemnify Miller-Davis for undertaking that work, Miller-Davis has established that Ahrens caused its damages. We therefore reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion discussing Miller-Davis\u2019s indemnity claim, and remand this case to the Kalamazoo Circuit Court for entry of judgment in Miller-Davis\u2019s favor and to determine whether Miller-Davis is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the relevant indemnification clauses.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-5\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> Miller-Davis was contractually obligated to the owner, Sherman Lake YMCA, to fulfill the obligations of all subcontractors in the event of a subcontractor default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> Sherman Lake YMCA is not a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the record was unclear whether AIA A201 was part of the subcontract, or that Miller-Davis waived any arguments regarding AIA A201.
