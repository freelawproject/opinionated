In <em>People v Lester, </em>232 Mich App 262; 591 NW 2d 267 (1998), the Court of Appeals adopted a four-factor test that added a requirement of defendant diligence to the traditional <em>Brady </em>test. Neither the Supreme Court of the United States nor this Court has endorsed this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We hold that a diligence requirement is not supported by <em>Brady </em>or its progeny. Thus, we overrule <em>Lester </em>and reaffirm the traditional three-factor <em>Brady </em>test. Because the defendant cannot establish that the suppressed evidence was material, however, his <em>Brady </em>claim nevertheless fails. Accordingly, we affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The defendant\u2019s convictions for felony murder, MCL 750.316(l)(b), and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b, arose out of the shooting death of Kevin Harris in Pontiac, Michigan, on June 29, 2008. Harris was a cocaine dealer, who often used Jared Chambers as a middleman to connect with buyers. Chambers occasionally contacted Harris through Harris\u2019s girlfriend, Heather Holloway.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">On June 29, 2008, Chambers arranged a transaction between the defendant and Harris. The defendant and Chambers, together with several others, met Harris on a side street in Pontiac. Harris pulled up behind the defendant\u2019s car. Holloway was in Harris\u2019s passenger seat. As both Chambers and the defendant approached Harris\u2019 car, shots were fired at Harris, and he was struck in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The Pontiac Police Department conducted an investigation and interviewed Holloway on June 29 and July 2, 2008, and Chambers on June 30, 2008. All of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>these interviews were video recorded. Holloway also produced two written statements, one after each interview, and Detective Steven Wittebort summarized the interviews in an incident report. Holloway\u2019s written statements and the police report summarizing them were provided to defense counsel before trial, but the video recordings were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Holloway was more forthcoming in her second interview than in her first. At her first interview, Holloway told the police that two unknown men walked up to the car and shot Harris. During her second interview, which took place after Harris died on June 30, 2008, Holloway said that Harris had been shot as part of a drug deal. Although Holloway identified the defendant in a photo array, neither of Holloway\u2019s written statements mentioned Chambers\u2019s presence. According to Wittebort\u2019s report, Holloway said that she did not get a good look at the shooter but that she could identify him. The report also revealed that she confidently selected the defendant\u2019s photo from an array.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant never denied that he was present at the scene of the shooting, and most of the facts were likewise not in dispute. The sole question at trial concerned the identity of the shooter. Only the defendant, Holloway, and Chambers witnessed the shooting and, unsurprisingly, they did not agree about what happened: the defendant identified Chambers as the shooter while Holloway and Chambers identified the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no physical evidence to tie either the defendant or Chambers to the shooting. The defense theory was that Chambers shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Harris, and that Holloway identified the defendant as the shooter out of fear of Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On the last day of trial, the prosecution called Wittebort as its final witness. When questioned, Wittebort was surprised that Holloway\u2019s second written statement did not confirm that she had mentioned Chambers and was confident that the video recordings would verify his recollection. He was also surprised to learn that the recordings had not been provided to the defendant. On March 11, 2010, the defendant was convicted of felony murder and felony-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On April 13, 2010, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial and requested a copy of the interview recordings. Later, counsel amended the motion to add claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct regarding the failure to provide the recorded statements. There was no dispute that the defendant never had the recordings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court conducted two evidentiary hearings on the motion. On February 29, 2012, Wittebort testified that the police generally let the prosecution know when recordings are available, but the regular practice was to provide them only \u201cif there\u2019s an admission or something of that nature from the person of interest or defendant in that matter.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 8, 2012, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, concluding that his due process rights were violated pursuant to <em>Brady </em>because the suppressed videotaped recordings undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court. <em>People v Chenault, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Court of Appeals, issued November 27, 2012 (Docket Nos. 309384 and 310456). The Court of Appeals analyzed the <em>Brady </em>claim using the four-factor test articulated in <em>Lester. </em>The Court held that trial counsel had not exercised due diligence, and that the suppressed evidence was neither favorable nor material. It also held that the defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel because there was no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On June 5, 2013, this Court granted leave to appeal, directing the parties to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">(1) whether the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Lester </em>correctly articulates what a defendant must show to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation; (2) whether the Court of Appeals erred when it reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial, which was premised on the prosecution\u2019s violation of the rule from <em>Brady, </em>and (3) whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>for failing to exercise reasonable diligence after learning of the existence of the videotaped interviews. <em>[People v Chenault, </em>494 Mich 862 (2013) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The Supreme Court of the United States held in <em>Brady </em>that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 US at 87. In identifying the essential components of a <em>Brady </em>violation, the Supreme Court has articulated a three-factor test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ensued. <em>[Strickler v Greene, </em>527 US 263, 281-282; 119 S Ct 1936; 144 L Ed 2d 286 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Stated differently, the components of a \u201ctrue <em>Brady </em>violation,\u201d are that: (1) the prosecution has suppressed evidence; (2) that is favorable to the accused; and (3) that is material. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The contours of these three factors are fairly settled. The government is held responsible for evidence within its control, even evidence unknown to the prosecution, <em>Kyles v Whitley, </em>514 US 419, 437; 115 S Ct 1555; 131 L Ed 2d 490 (1995), without regard to the prosecution\u2019s good or bad faith, <em>United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97, 110; 96 S Ct 2392; 49 L Ed 2d 342 (1976) (\u201cIf the suppression of evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the character of the prosecutor.\u201d). Evidence is favorable to the defense when it is either exculpatory or impeaching. <em>Giglio v United States, </em>405 US 150, 154; 92 S Ct 763; 31 L Ed 2d 104 (1972) (\u201cWhen the \u2018reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,\u2019 nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within this general rule [of <em>Brady].\u201d), </em>quoting <em>Napue v Illinois, </em>360 US 264, 269; 79 S Ct 1173; 3 L Ed 2d 1217 (1959). To establish materiality, a defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v Bagley, </em>473 US 667, 682; 105 SC 3375; 87 L Ed 2d 481 (1985). This standard \u201cdoes not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal.. . .\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 434. The question is whether, in the absence of the suppressed evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>dence, the defendant \u201creceived a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing the materiality of the evidence, courts are to consider the suppressed evidence collectively, rather than piecemeal. <em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In contrast to the three-factor <em>Brady </em>test articulated by the United States Supreme Court, our Court of Appeals adopted a four-factor <em>Brady </em>test in 1998:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must prove: (1) that the state possessed evidence favorable to the defendant; (2) that he did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it himself with any reasonable diligence; (3) that the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) that had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>[Lester, </em>232 Mich App at 281, citing <em>United States v Meros, </em>866 F 2d 1304, 1308 (CA 11, 1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The inclusion of the second factor is the only difference between the <em>Lester </em>test and the test articulated in <em>Strickler. </em>Although <em>Lester </em>did not involve a question of a defendant\u2019s diligence, the Court of Appeals relied on authority from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for this additional requirement, now widely referred to as a \u201cdue diligence\u201d or \u201creasonable diligence\u201d factor. This test has been applied by our Court of Appeals since <em>Lester.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">III. <em>BRADY </em>DISCLOSURES</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">A. <em>PEOPLE </em>v <em>LESTER </em>AND THE ADDITION OF A DILIGENCE REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">This is the first occasion on which this Court has examined the merits of the diligence requirement. Some understanding of its doctrinal history is useful. As noted, the Court of Appeals borrowed the four-factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>test from the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Meros, </em>866 F 2d at 1308, which in turn cited another Eleventh Circuit case, <em>United States v Valera, </em>845 F 2d 923, 927-928 (CA 11, 1988). In <em>Valera, </em>the Eleventh Circuit relied on two cases from the Fifth Circuit, <em>United States v Cravero, </em>545 F2d 406, 420 (CA 5, 1976), and <em>United States v Prior, </em>546 F2d 1254, 1259 (CA 5, 1977). Both of these Fifth Circuit cases in turn relied on authority from other circuits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> None of these cases, however, provides a sufficient explanation for adding a diligence requirement to the Supreme Court\u2019s three-factor <em>Brady </em>test and are consequently of little value to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We disagree with the prosecution\u2019s suggestion that the diligence requirement is consistent with or implied by United States Supreme Court precedent. Nor do we conclude that a diligence requirement is consistent with the <em>Brady </em>doctrine generally. We believe that the concerns that a diligence requirement might address are already confronted in the context of <em>Brady\u2019s </em>suppression requirement as well as in the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel. For these reasons, we reject the addition of a diligence requirement to the <em>Brady </em>test and we overrule <em>Lester.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We are not persuaded by the prosecution\u2019s reliance on <em>Agurs </em>and <em>Kyles </em>for the proposition that the diligence requirement is merely a clarification of existing Supreme Court precedent. The prosecution argues that the phrase \u201cunknown to the defense,\u201d as used in these two cases, suggests that the Supreme Court would affirm the addition of a diligence requirement to the <em>Brady </em>analysis. Specifically, the argument goes, the phrase \u201cunknown to the defense\u201d implies that <em>Brady </em>places some sort of burden onto the defense to discover <em>Brady </em>information when possible. We do not share the prosecution\u2019s understanding of the meaning of this phrase in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">In <em>Agurs, </em>the Supreme Court identified three different contexts in which <em>Brady </em>applies, stating that \u201c[e]ach involves the discovery, after trial, of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.\u201d <em>Agurs, </em>427 US at 103. The phrase is best understood as a general description of what constitutes <em>Brady </em>evidence, instead of the imposition of a new hurdle for defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We see no additional meaning to the phrase given its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The <em>Kyles </em>Court held that \u201cshowing that the prosecution knew of an item of favorable evidence unknown to the defense does not amount to a <em>Brady </em>violation without more.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 437. The phrase is used in a larger discussion of the materiality requirement and the prosecution\u2019s duty to gauge the likely effect of potential <em>Brady </em>evidence: although the mere showing that the prosecution knew of evidence that was unknown to the defense does not amount to a <em>Brady </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>showing by itself, <em>Brady </em>imposes on the prosecution \u201ca duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Read in context, this language is meant to define the prosecution\u2019s duty both to become aware of evidence in the government\u2019s possession and to weigh the materiality of evidence. We believe that if the Supreme Court wanted to articulate a diligence requirement, it would do so more directly. It has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Moreover, we do not believe that the goals of <em>Brady </em>counsel in favor of adopting a diligence requirement. The Supreme Court has consistently stated that, when confronted with potential <em>Brady </em>evidence, the prosecution must always err on the side of disclosure. <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 439; <em>Agurs, </em>427 US at 108. Just recently the Supreme Court underscored this obligation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Our decisions lend no support to the notion that defendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosed <em>Brady </em>material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed. As we observed in <em>Strickler, </em>defense counsel has no \u201cprocedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The State here nevertheless urges, in effect, that \u201cthe prosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has the burden to . . . discover the evidence,\u201d so long as the \u201cpotential existence\u201d of a prosecutorial misconduct claim might have been detected. A rule thus declaring \u201cprosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,\u201d is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process .... We have several times underscored the \u201cspecial role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials.\u201d Courts, litigants, and juries properly anticipate that \u201cobligations [to refrain from improper methods to secure a conviction] . . . plainly restfing] upon the prosecuting attorney, will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>faithfully observed.\u201d Prosecutors\u2019 dishonest conduct or unwarranted concealment should attract no judicial approbation.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In fact, we conclude that a diligence rule of the sort adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Lester </em>is contrary to <em>Brady, </em>i.e., a rule requiring a defendant to show that counsel performed an adequate investigation in discovering the alleged <em>Brady </em>material. The <em>Brady </em>rule is aimed at defining an important prosecutorial duty; it is not a tool to ensure competent defense counsel. Adding a diligence requirement to this rule undermines the fairness that the rule is designed to protect. However, as we previously explained, evidence that the defense knew of favorable evidence, will reduce the likelihood that the defendant can establish that the evidence was suppressed for purposes of a <em>Brady </em>claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We decline to adopt the four-factor <em>Lester </em>test, as we believe it is not doctrinally supported and undermines the purpose of <em>Brady. </em>We hold that the controlling test is that articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickler, </em>no less and no more: (1) the prosecution has suppressed evidence; (2) that is favorable to the accused; and (3) viewed in its totality, is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>B. APPLICATION OF <em>BRADY </em>TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We now apply the controlling <em>Brady </em>test to the defendant\u2019s claim. As an initial matter, we note that the prosecution has conceded that the evidence in question was suppressed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That leaves two questions: whether the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defendant, either as exculpatory or impeaching evidence, and whether it was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In contrast to the question of materiality, the favorability of evidence is a simple threshold question that need not delay us long. Only three people witnessed the shooting: Holloway, Chambers, and the defendant. Other than the testimony of Holloway and Chambers, there was no other evidence at trial that identified the defendant as the shooter. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>videotaped statements could have impeached Holloway and Chambers as well as undermined the strength of Holloway\u2019s identification, the evidence was favorable to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We are not convinced, however, that the suppressed evidence was material. \u201cThe question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 US at 434. We conclude that, even in the absence of the suppressed evidence, the defendant received a trial that resulted in a verdict worthy of confidence, because the cumulative effect of the evidence was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We disagree with the defendant that Wittebort\u2019s promises of leniency to both Holloway and Chambers were material. While the detectives assured both witnesses that they would not be investigated or charged for drug crimes, these promises of leniency were not conditioned on any behavior on the part of the witnesses. Indeed, Chambers decided not to make any written statement even after such promises were made, and, likewise, any alleged promises of leniency occurred after Chambers implicated himself in the drug activity. For her part, Holloway also admitted that she lied in her first interview, promises of leniency notwithstanding, and in her second interview, the alleged promises were made <em>after </em>she disclosed the drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We are similarly unconvinced that the evidence would have undermined Holloway\u2019s identification of the defendant in a material way. While there were minor discrepancies between the characterization of Holloway\u2019s identification as expressed in the disclosed material and at trial as contrasted with her recorded identification, she was able to quickly identify the defendant as the shooter in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>second interview.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the specific strong language that Wittebort attributed to Holloway as she identified the defendant is not supported by the recording, Holloway did identify the defendant with confidence. Holloway\u2019s honest qualifications about her ability to view the shooter do not undermine the overall strength of her identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, we disagree with the defendant that the suppressed evidence supports his trial theory that Chambers was the shooter, and that Holloway only identified the defendant as the shooter out of fear of Chambers. Although Holloway was not forthright in her first statement about Chambers\u2019s involvement, in her second interview she expressed confidence that Chambers must have been involved. If Holloway were frightened of Chambers to the extent that she would implicate an innocent third party, she would not have engaged in a discussion with the police about Chambers\u2019s own culpability. The suppressed evidence did not contain information that leads us to conclude that defense counsel would have asserted the defense that Holloway misidentified the defendant, rather than the cover-up theory that defense counsel pursued at trial. Furthermore, another witness placed the defendant on the side of Harris\u2019s car where the shooter indisputably stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We therefore conclude that, even in the absence of the suppressed evidence, the defendant received a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>that resulted in a verdict worthy of confidence. The defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim must fail because the suppressed evidence was not material to his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IV INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The defendant also raises a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and acquire the video recordings during trial. Whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of fact and law. <em>People v Armstrong, </em>490 Mich 281, 289; 806 NW2d 676 (2011). A trial court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>We have determined that the defendant cannot establish a <em>Brady </em>violation because the suppressed evidence was not, in sum, material. As <em>Brady </em>materiality is assessed under the same \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard that is used to assess prejudice under <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 LEd2d 674 (1984),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we similarly conclude that the defendant cannot establish prejudice in order to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">We conclude that <em>Brady </em>does not support the adoption of a diligence requirement and we therefore over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>rule <em>Lester. </em>In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant need only demonstrate that the government suppressed evidence that is both favorable to the defendant and material. Because the defendant cannot establish that the suppressed evidence in this case was material, he cannot prevail on either his <em>Brady </em>claim or his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-5\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, Zahra, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with McCORMACK, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> Three others were present at the scene, but did not provide any evidence supporting either theory.

None of these cases articulated a diligence prong of the sort that the Court of Appeals applied in this case. In each of these cases, the factual predicate was different in an important way because the defendant had actual knowledge of the evidence in question. In other words, the evidence was not \u201csuppressed.\u201d In particular, <em>Ruggiero </em>explicitly (and, in our view, appropriately) addressed diligence under the suppression prong of <em>Brady, </em>finding there was no suppression when the government provided the requested evidence to the trial court for an in camera inspection and ruling. <em>Ruggiero, </em>472 F2d at 604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\"> <em>Bagley </em>retreated from the different materiality standards articulated in <em>Agurs. Bagley, </em>473 US at 682. Thus, any reliance on the <em>Agurs </em>language as an articulation of existing Supreme Court precedent is undermined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> <em>Banks v Dretke, </em>540 US 668, 695-696; 124 S Ct 1256; 157 L Ed 2d 1166 (2004) (citations omitted). In reliance on this language, the Sixth Circuit recently \u201cdecline[d] to adopt the due diligence rule that the government proposes based on earlier, erroneous cases.\u201d <em>United States v Tavera, </em>719 F 3d 705, 712 (CA 6, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"> Failures on the part of defense counsel to make use of known and available evidence can instead be evaluated under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. To he sure, there is a relationship between <em>Brady </em>claims and ineffective assistance of counsel claims: when the government complies with its obligation to provide favorable and material evidence, it becomes the defendant\u2019s burden to then make use of that evidence. If defense counsel\u2019s failure to make use of the evidence is not strategic and prejudice results, the defendant will surely bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> As noted, the defendant\u2019s first counsel never received the recorded statements. Additionally, all three assistant prosecutors never received the recorded statements, as evidenced by their affidavits submitted in the tried court. At the second evidentiary hearing, the prosecution stated, \u201cCertainly it was not disclosed \u2014 it was not turned over to them and the police had it, so truthfully, my understanding of the case law ... it really doesn\u2019t matter whether it was intentional or inadvertent, the question is if it wasn\u2019t disclosed and is it exculpatory, would it affect the trial. ...\u201d The prosecution also stated specifically that the evidence was suppressed: \u201cWell, I would say prong three [of Brady] is satisfied. The prosecutor suppressed \u2014 well, we did not give out the evidence but we don\u2019t agree it\u2019s favorable....\u201d At no point before the trial court or the Court of Appeals did the prosecution argue otherwise. The prosecution argued that the evidence was not suppressed for the first time at oral argument before this Court, and we decline to address this argument. That the <em>existence </em>of the videotapes was discovered before the end of trial does not change our view because the prosecution waived the argument that the midtrial disclosure and defense counsel\u2019s subsequent actions affected the defendant\u2019s ability to show that he was prejudiced for purposes of his <em>Brady </em>claim. Although a defense counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a continuance may be relevant in a case where defense counsel has actual knowledge of the suppressed evidence midtrial, <em>see, </em>e.g., <em>State v Spivey, </em>102 NC App 640, 646; 404 SE2d 23 (1991), we decline to address this issue in light of the prosecution\u2019s waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> Specifically, in her first interview, Holloway was asked if she saw the shooter\u2019s face \u201cpretty good.\u201d Holloway responded, \u201cNot that good, I could, maybe if I seen him you know I might be able to say it was him.\u201d In her second interview, Holloway stated: \u201c[I]f I seen him..., I could be like that\u2019s that guy, I know it.\u201d After picking defendant in the photo array she stated: \u201cThis guy right here.
