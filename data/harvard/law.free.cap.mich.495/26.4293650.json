The Department of Treasury assessed a use tax against petitioner based on the lease transaction, and the Michigan Tax Tribunal ultimately upheld the assessment. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that petitioner did not \u201cuse\u201d the aircraft because it ceded total control of the aircraft to the lessee by virtue of the lease and the lessee had uninterrupted possession of the aircraft before and during the lease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted leave, directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>parties to \u201caddress the applicability of the use tax to a transaction where tangible personal property is purchased by one party and leased to another party when the purchaser/lessor does not obtain actual possession of the property.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">This case requires us to interpret and apply the pertinent statutory provisions of the UTA. When interpreting a statute, this Court\u2019s primary goal \u201cis to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, focusing first on the statute\u2019s plain language.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the words of a statute are unambiguous, we must enforce them as written and no further judicial construction is permitted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Under the UTA, a <em>6% </em>tax is levied \u201cfor the privilege of using, storing, or consuming tangible personal property in this state ... .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The UTA defines \u201cuse,\u201d in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">[T]he exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property including transfer of the property in a transaction where possession is given.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In light of this statutory definition, we must determine whether petitioner exercised a right or power incident to ownership in Michigan when it executed a lease of the aircraft in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">It is a basic precept of property law that a property owner has the right to the use and enjoyment of his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>her personalty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A corollary to this right is the property owner\u2019s right to allow others to use his or her property in exchange for consideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One way in which a property owner exercises this right is by executing a lease.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, because the right to allow others to use one\u2019s personal property is a right incident to ownership, and a lease is an instrument by which an owner exercises that right, it follows that the execution of a lease is an \u201cexercise of a right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property ... ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">In arriving at the opposite conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>WPGP1, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Czars, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two cases that distinguished between partial and 'total relinquishment of control of an aircraft for purposes of assessing the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tax.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> According to those cases, when an out-of-state <em>owner </em>allows another person to use his or her aircraft, and that person uses the aircraft in Michigan, the owner is subject to Michigan use tax unless the owner can show that he or she previously relinquished total control.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, we find those cases factually distinguishable because, unlike the present case, neither involved the execution of a lease in Michigan. In applying <em>Czars </em>and <em>WPGP1 </em>to the facts of this case, the Court of Appeals failed to recognize that the act of ceding control of an aircraft can, itself, be an exercise of a right incident to ownership.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this case, petitioner relinquished control of its property by executing a lease in Michigan. As previously discussed, that act, alone, is sufficient to constitute \u201cuse\u201d under the UTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Court of Appeals also maintained that \u201ca transfer of property unaccompanied by a transfer of possession is simply not \u2018use\u2019 that is subject to the tax.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The basis for this conclusion was the emphasized portion of the statutory definition of \u201cuse\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">[T]he exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property <em>including transfer of the property in a transaction where possession is given.[</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The statutory language on which the Court of Appeals relied is introduced by the term \u201cincluding.\u201d As we have stated previously, \u201cincluding\u201d is a term of enlargement, not limitation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, a transaction in which possession is transferred is but one way to satisfy \u201cuse\u201d under the UTA; it is not the only way, as the Court of Appeals erroneously held.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">The execution of a lease in Michigan is the exercise of a right incident to property ownership and, therefore, falls squarely within the statutory definition of \u201cuse.\u201d We hold that petitioner \u201cused\u201d the aircraft in question for purposes of the UTA when it executed a lease of the aircraft in Michigan, regardless of whether it ever had actual possession of the aircraft. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that Court to consider petitioner\u2019s alternative claim challenging the calculation of the assessment amount.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, Zahra, and McCORMACK, JJ., concurred with Viviano, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\"> MCL 205.91 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> <em>NACG Leasing v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of Court of Appeals, issued October 16, 2012 (Docket No. 306773), unpub op at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\"> <em>NACG Leasing v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>494 Mich 851 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\"> <em>Malpass v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>494 Mich 237, 247-248; 833 NW2d 272 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-12\"> <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-13\"> MCL 205.93(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b294-14\"> MCL 205.92(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-4\"> See, e.g., <em>Daugherty v Thomas, 174 </em>Mich 371, 375; 140 NW 615 (1913); <em>Continental Motors Corp v Muskegon Twp, </em>376 Mich 170, 182; 135 NW2d 908 (1965) (Adams, J., dissenting) (\u201cProperty, as the word is commonly used, denotes an entire object.

In addition, the Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201cactual\u201d possession elsewhere in the UTA is a strong textual indication that the term \u201cpossession\u201d in MCL 205.92(b) does not refer to actual possession. See MCL 205.94(k) (exempting from the use tax \u201c[p]roperty purchased for use in this state where <em>actual personal possession </em>is obtained outside this state, the purchase price or actual value of which does not exceed $10.00 during 1 calendar month\u201d) (emphasis added). Reading \u201cpossession\u201d in \u00a7 92(b) to mean \u201cactual possession\u201d would render the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cactual possession\u201d in other statutory provisions mere surplusage, something courts must avoid when interpreting statutory language. <em>Klapp v United Ins Group Agency, Inc, </em>468 Mich 459, 468; 663 NW2d 447 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> Because the Court of Appeals held that petitioner was not subject to the use tax, it declined to address petitioner\u2019s challenge to the amount of the final assessment.

However, the Department counters that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>among other things, petitioner failed to challenge the assessment amount in the Tax Tribunal.
