That, to secure a part of said purchase money, said rifle club on the delivery to it of said deed, on June 21, 1871, executed and delivered to said society two mortgages of said premises,\u2014 one for $12,000, recorded July 5, 1871; and the other for $6,000, recorded July 12, 1871. That said agricultural society subsequently assigned said two mortgages to Jesse Sharpe, since deceased, and that his administrator afterwards recovered against the said rifle club a judgment in the superior court on the said mortgage of $12,000. That under a writ of <em>levcvri facias </em>to the November Term, 1874, issued on said judgment, the sheriff sold and conveyed said premises to the complainants, for $16,000, and that said sheriff applied to said writ of <em>levari facias </em>so much of the proceeds of said sale as was sufficient to satisfy the same, and retains in his hands the balance thereof,\u2014\u2022 $2,700. That while said agricultural society' was seised of said premises,\u2014 to wit, on May 12, 1871,\u2014 an agreement in writing was made by said society and said rifle club for the sale and conveyance to the latter of said premises, and that said club should have immediate possession. That upon the execution of said agreement said rifle club paid part of. the purchase money, and took possession of said premises under said agreement. That while said rifle club was in possession under said agreement, as well as afterwards while in possession under said deed, H. L. Tatnall, the defendant, sold and furnished to said rifle club materials for the erection of certain buildings on said premises, and that he afterwards, on December 1, 1871, filed his claim in the superior court, and has issued thereon a writ of <em>scire facias </em>against the said rifle club for the purpose of obtaining a lien on said buildings and the ground on which the same were erected, and that judgment was rendered thereon against the said rifle club at the May Term, 1874, for $2,057.45. That the defendant has caused to be issued on his said judgment a writ of <em>levari </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Jadas </em>to the Hay Term, 1876, under which the said premises are about to be sold. That until after said conveyance to said rifle club, it had no right to suffer or create any lien on said premises, and that the liens of said mortgages for purchase money are paramount to any lien created or suffered by said rifle club, and that said sheriff\u2019s sale to the complainants discharged said premises from the lien of said judgment of the defendant. That the advertisement and sale of said premises under said judgment of said defendant would cast a cloud upon the title of the complainants, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">The complainants pray that an injunction may be issued, restraining all proceedings against said premises under said judgment and execution of said defendant, and also that a preliminary injunction,, to the same effect, may be issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-7\">A preliminary injunction was granted March 13, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-8\">The answer of the defendant, filed .December 6, 1876, claims that the lien of his said judgment under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law relates back to May 23, 1871, when the furnishing of said materials was commenced, and that said lien is paramount to the lien of said mortgages; that his lien was not affected by said sale under said mortgage of $12,000, but that said sale was subject to the lien of said judgment; that he has the right now to sell said premises under his said judgment. That said deed to the rifle club was delivered May 19, 1871, more than a month before said mortgages were executed; that neither of said mortgages was made for securing part of the purchase money of said premises; that there was no legal or valid consideration for the assignment of said mortgages to said Sharpe. That the furnishing of said materials by the defendant did not commence while the rifle club was in possession under said agreement, but under said deed; that his said judgment has priority, whether the rifle club was then in possession under said agreement or deed. That the rifle club took title to the premises subject to certain liens and floating claims against the agricultural society, amounting to about $12,000. That after the delivery of the deed, on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>'21, 1871, an arrangement was made between the agricultural \u25a0society and the rifle club, by which the latter should and did \u25a0execute said two mortgages to the former, but without any \u25a0agreement that they should be drawn as purchase-money mortgages; that said mortgages were not made or intended \u25a0as purchase-money mortgages, but for the purpose of sale to raise money by way of loan thereon to pay off said liens and floating claims against the agricultural society. That on said June 21, 1871, it was also arranged and agreed between the \u00a1agricultural society and the rifle club that-the former would find a person to loan money on said mortgages, if the latter would pay the expenses of negotiating said loan, not exceeding $500; that there was no consideration for said mortgage \u25a0of $12,000 between said society and club when the same was \u25a0executed and negotiated; that pursuant to said agreement, \u25a0and with knowledge thereof, the said Sharpe discounted said mortgage of $12,000, and made a loan of money thereon on \u25a0July 3, 1871, and on the same day he received from the rifle \u2022club the sum of $500 as a bonus therefor, and from the agricultural society a further bonus of $500; and that by reason \u25a0of said arrangement said mortgage of $12,000 was and is illegal and void, and was and is in its inception and transfer founded upon and made in pursuance of an usurious contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">At the September Term, 1877, a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction was, after argument, denied, and said injunction continued until the further order of the chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">At the February Term, 1880, the case came on for final hearing upon the pleadings and proofs, and was fully argued by the solicitors of the respective parties.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-8\"><em>William G.

If a deed of conveyance and a mortgage for the purchase-money be delivered at the same time, it is of no consequence-that they bear different dates, and were executed on different days, because they take effect only from delivery. <em>Mayburry </em>v. <em>Brien, </em>40 U.

This Act repealed the Act of 1803, and gave a lien not merely for \u201c debts contracted by the owner,\u201d as 'did the Act of 1803, but for \u201c debts contracted for or by reason of any work done or materials found,\u201d etc., without regard to the person by whom such debts were contracted.

Id. 319.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-9\">The Act of June 16,1836, extended over the whole State the operation of the Act of 1806; and the supplements thereto made the lien extend to the ground covered by the building, etc., as'well as to the building; declared that the lien for\u2019 work and materials should be preferred to every other lien which attached upon the building or ground subsequent to-the commencement of the building; required that the claim filed should set forth the names of the claimant and of the owner or reputed owner of the building, also of the contractor, architect, or builder, when the contract of the claimant was made with such contractor, architect, or builder; and directed that the proceedings to recover the amount of the claim should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>be by <em>scire facias, </em>but reserved to the person to whom such \u25a0debt is due the right to maintain a personal action against the \u2022owner of the building or other person liable therefor. Id. 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-6\">The Act of April 28, 1840, provided that the lien created by the Act of 1836 should not be construed to extend to any \u2022other or greater estate in the ground on which the building is erected than that of the person in possession at the time of commencing said building, and at whose instance the same is \u25a0erected; and that no other or greater estate than the above should be sold under said Act.

The vendor commenced the house, and the vendee completed it after he took title and made said mortgage. <em>Held, </em>that persons furnishing-labor and materials after the recording of the mortgage should be preferred to the mortgage.

One in possession under an agreement for' purchase erected buildings, and subsequently the land was conveyed to him, and, 17 days after this, judgment entered on note for purchase money. <em>Held, </em>that the mechanics\u2019 lien had preference to this judgment, but that it would have been otherwise if the judgment had been entered at the same time the deed was delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-11\"><em>Gaule </em>v. <em>Bilyeau, </em>25 Pa. 522, was under the Acts of 1836 and 1840.

If the society had mortgaged the premises after that date, the mechanics\u2019 lien would have taken priority. The society\u2019s title was subject to that lien. That incumbered title was all it could convey. And when it sold, the lien for the purchase money or its purchase-money mortgage was precisely, to the extent of its interest, of the same grade and character that its own mortgage would have been if given instead of a deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The vested right of purchasers or incumbrancers, and, reciprocally, the liens of mechanics, are not affected or displaced, when once attached, by other rights subsequently accruing. <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Daly, 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">The lien attaches from the commencement of furnishing the materials; and, the contract being an entirety, mortgagees who loan money prior to the last delivery of materials will be postponed to it. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>West, </em>12 Iowa, 119; <em>Milner </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>13 Minn. 455.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">In those States where the authority of a contractor under the lien law is coextensive with the necessities of the building, and endures until it is finished, a contract for the erection of a house is in effect a power to charge the land for the purposes of the contract, and the.commencement of the building-is notice to all the world of the existence of the power. And where the property'was sold during its erection, and after a short interval the contractor was permitted to go on and complete the building,\u2014to hold the land discharged under such circumstances would be highly unjust to those who furnished materials in reliance upon its protection. They have an equity which the purchaser of an unfinished house, who suffers it to be finished afterwards on the credit of the original authority, plainly wants. <em>Mears </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>2 Phila. 19; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Barroll, </em>14 Md. 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">A mortgage prior to the delivery of any materials will be preferred to its full extent in a contest with mechanics. <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>13 Wis. 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\">Therefore, in this case, if the purchase-money mortgage had been made June 21, 1871, before any materials had been delivered, it would have taken priority if recorded within 60 days. Other mortgages would take rank according to date1 of recording. If contractor or material man commenced work or delivery of materials before such mortgage is recorded, his lien would take priority. The principle is that when the mortgage is not executed until the lien of the mechanic has attached, the former will be subordinated to the latter. <em>Mitchel </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>2 Bro.

Code, p. 681) in relation to the discharge of liens by execution sales.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">This is a lien specially given by statute, and clings to the building until satisfied, even in the hands of a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale upon a lien subsequently obtained, in a case where, like this, the rifle club, whose land was sold under the mortgage, had taken title subject to this mechanics\u2019 lien. In fact, it was a lien upon the agricultural society\u2019s land, similar in its nature to a mortgage given by that society. It was not simply a lien <em>\u201c </em>against the defendant \u201d (the rifle club) in the <em>lewarifacias, </em>such as is meant by the statute last above quoted. That club was a defendant in the mechanics\u2019 lien suit simply as \u201c owner or reputed owner and contractor.\u201d A claim so filed became a lien on the real owner\u2019s land, whoever he might be. The real defendant was the agricultural society. The real defendant, the action being <em>in rem, </em>was the land and buildings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-9\">The statute last above referred to seems to refer to cases where the judgment or lien on the land is also a personal claim against the defendant in the execution, created by him against his own land, and not to liens upon lands of another (although given by statute on the act or contract of the party who afterwards becomes the owner), subject to which liens said defendant in the execution takes title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ANq\">In the view which I take of this case, it is not necessary for me to consider many of the interesting questions which have been argued, arising under the Act known as the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, as amended March 29, 1871 (Rev. Code, p. 668); nor is it material that I should decide any of the controverted questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>It is not disputed that the premises known as \u201cthe agricultural fair grounds were sold and conveyed to the complainants by the sheriff of Hew Castle County, under a writ of <em>levari facias </em>to the Hovember Term, 1874, issued on a judgment recovered against the Wilmington Rifle Club upon a mortgage for $12,000 executed by said rifle club to the Agricultural Society of Hew Castle County, dated June 23,1871, and recorded July 5,1871, and subsequently assigned to Jesse Sharpe, since deceased. For the purposes of this case it is of no consequence whether this mortgage was or was not a \u201cpurchase-money mortgage,\u201d or whether it was executed and delivered at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed by the agricultural society to the rifle club or afterwards. It was certainly a lien on the premises from the time it was recorded, July 5,1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">It is claimed by the defendant that said mortgage, and also the assignment of the same to Jesse Sharpe, were usurious and void, and that no valid title could be sold under said mortgage. I am not satisfied, from the evidence, that said mortgage or assignment was in fact usurious; but if they were both usurious, this defense would be of no avail in this suit. There is no allegation in the pleadings, or evidence of any kind, of any privity between the said Jesse Sharpe and the complainants, or of any knowledge by the complainants of the usurious character of said mortgage or assignment; and they must therefore be considered by this court as <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, without notice of any of the circumstances alleged by the defendant as impeaching the validity of said mortgage or assignment. It is well settled that' the title of an innocent purchaser of land at a judicial sale under a mortgage is not affected by the usurious character of said mortgage. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. Dodds, 1 Johns. Cas. 158; <em>Bartlett </em>v. Henry, 10 Johns. 185; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>53 Barb. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u2018 The testimony is somewhat conflicting as to the time of the delivery of said deed to the rifle club ; but supposing it was delivered on the day it bears date, May 19,1871, and that said club was seised in fee simple of the premises when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>furnishing of the materials was commenced, May 23, 1871, and afterwards while the furnishing of said materials was continued; and that the lien of the judgment of the defendant under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law relates back to the said May 23, 1871,\u2014the question remains as to the effect of the sale of the premises under said mortgage. It is contended by the defendant that his said lien was not affected by said sale, but that said sale was subject to the lien of his said judgment, and that he has now the right to sell the premises under his said judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">The court of errors and appeals in 1828, in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickory, </em>1 Harrington, 193, held that the sale of land by the sheriff, under a junior judgment, discharged the land sold from the lien of a prior recognizance in the orphans\u2019 court, and declared the law to be settled by practice and by the decision of the court of appeals that, if land be sold under a junior judgment, the lien of a prior judgment is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"AHx\">In the case of <em>Farmers Bank </em>v. Wallace, 3 Harrington, 370, it was held that lands sold by the sheriff in execution:,of a judgment are discharged, in the purchaser\u2019s hands, of all judgment liens, whether due or not due; and that it is the policy of the law to disincumber lands as much as possible from all liens which a sale could possibly remove.</p>\n<p id=\"AFK\">Section 1 of the \u201cAct in Relation to Sales of Real Estate under Execution Process,\u201d passed March 29,1871 (Rev. Code, p. 681), provides \u201cthat real estate sold by virtue of execution process shall be discharged from all liens thereon against the defendant . . . whose property such real estate is, except such liens as have been created by mortgage or mortgages prior to any general liens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ai7P\">This statute is conclusive as to the effect of the sale of the premises by virtue of the execution under said mortgage. The only liens against a defendant not discharged by a sale of his lands under execution process against him are mortgages which are prior to any general liens. The lien of H. L. Tat-nail is against the rifle club, the defendant in the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>under which, the property was sold to the complainants. This lien is certainly not a mortgage of any kind. It is a judgment which, while it bound specific property, and may have had relation back to a date prior to its rendition, is as much subject to the provisions of this statute as any general judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The sale and conveyance of said premises to the complainants, by virtue of said writ of <em>levari facias </em>to the November Term, 18.14, discharged said premises from the lien of said judgment of said defendant, H. L. Tatnall.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Although no valid title to the premises could now be sold or conveyed under said judgment of the defendant, a pretended sale and conveyance under it might cause the complainants expense and trouble, and would cast a cloud upon their title. For such threatened injury by the defendant there is no sufficient or adequate remedy at law. The prevention of a cloud upon title is a salutary branch of equity jurisdiction, universally recognized, and founded upon sound principles.
