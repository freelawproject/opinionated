Claim was filed by the president, etc., of the General Lying-in Hospital of Westminster, against the executors, stating that they were a body corporate, etc. After argument the Master of the Bolls decided: \u201c As there was no similar charity in Westminster, and the plaintiffs having at one time borne a name something similar, I think, without further arguing, I may declare that the General Lying-in Hospital was intended by the testator, and make a decree for the legacy and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-7\"><em>Minot </em>v. <em>Boston Asylum &amp; Farm for Indigent Boys,. </em>7 Met. 416. A testator gave a legacy to the \u201c Boys\u2019 Asylum &amp; Farm School,\u201d there being no institution or association of any similar name except the Boston Asylum &amp; Farm School for Indigent Boys. Held, that this corporation was-entitled to the legacy. The general rule is, that where either a corporation or a natural person is so identified by the name and description in the will, as applied to the facts and circumstances, as to distinguish such person or corporation from all others, such person or corporation shall take the bequest in the same manner as if no such discrepancy had appeared. Where the name and description in a legacy, when applied to-the facts, lead to a reasonable belief that they apply to some one person, and there is no other person to whom they can with any probability apply, then much slighter evidence will be sufficient to prove that that person was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-8\"><em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Seaman\u2019s Aid Society, </em>7 Met. 188. The testator had left, in consequence of mistaken information, a legacy to the Seaman\u2019s Aid Society of Boston. It was claimed by the Seaman\u2019s Friend Society of New York and Boston. Shaw, <em>Ch. J., </em>in a very learned opinion, says: <em>\u201c </em>The Seaman\u2019s-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Friend Society, either of Hew York or Boston, cannot take, because the name and description are not those by which they have ever acted or been known or designated; and because the Seaman\u2019s Aid Society is the one precisely named and described in the will. Had there been but one charitable society established for the relief and benefit of seamen, and that one the Seaman\u2019s Friend Society, the evidence to be \u25a0derived from the facts and circumstances, combined with a name very near the one mentioned in the will, and a description indicating the purposes to which the gift was devoted, in the absence of any other claim on the part of any similar society, would have been very strong, without direct proof of intention, to show that the Seaman\u2019s Friend Society was intended; and, if so, they would be entitled to take the legacy by the established rules of law.\u201d Again, referring to this \u25a0case, in 7 Met. 419, <em>Chief Justice </em>Shaw says: \u201c So, in the \u2022case of the Seaman\u2019s Aid Society, had there not been a corporation by the name of the Seaman\u2019s Aid Society, nor any \u25a0other of a similar name or description, the Seaman\u2019s Friend Society would have been sufficiently identified and designated to enable them to take the bequest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\">A court never construes a devise void unless it is so absolutely dark that they cannot find out the testator\u2019s meaning. 1 Atk. 411; Pow.

A devise to \u201c the American Home Mission Tract Society \u201d was held a .good devise to the American Tract Society, the court saying: \u25a0\u201cThe description of-the devisee in the will contains all the words which constituted the name of the tract society. It \u2022does, indeed, contain other terms, but those are not inapplicable to, but are descriptive of, the American Tract Society. ' The terms used by the testator are applicable to and will -describe the American Tract Society, and there is no other \u25a0society, that we are aware of, to which all the terms are \u2022applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-9\"><em>Brewster </em>v. McCall, 15 Conn. 276,292. Bequest to \u201c the Missionary Society of Foreign Missions\u201d was held a good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\"bequest to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The court says: \u201c It is, however, insisted that in this case the evidence proves that there is no such corporation \u2022or society in existence as the Missionary Society of Foreign Missions, and therefore the devise is inoperative. If, indeed, there were no society in existence, either of this name or description, the devise would he void for the want of any person to take under it. If, however, there is a corporation of either that name or description, and only one, we think there -cannot be a doubt that it would take under this devise. Under the circumstances of this ease the devise must be deemed to be made to that society by description, and not by name.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>McBride </em>v.

Held, a good devise to be executed, and trustees were appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\"><em>Pepper's Will, </em>1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 436. The law of charitable uses has always formed a part of the Civil Code of Pennsylvania. The statute of 43 Elizabeth as a statute has never been adopted in this State; but its conservative provisions have been in force here by common usage and constitutional provision,\u2014not only so, but the more extensive range of charitable uses which chancery sustained before the statute of Elizabeth, and even beyond it. The statute of 9 Geo. II. never was in force in Pennsylvania, and consequently the law of charitable uses here stands unaffected by it. The -courts of equity in this State will not hesitate in supplying any formal defect in the execution of a power by will, in favor of a charity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\"><em>Domestic &amp; F. Miss. Society's Appeal, </em>30 Pa. 425. A legacy to <em>\u201c </em>the Missions and Schools of the Episcopal Church about to be established at or near Port Cresson,\u201d upon the western coast of Africa, is a good charitable bequest to the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America. When it is remembered that this legacy to the \u201c Mission and Schools of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Episcopal Church\u201d is a charitable bequest, it certainly cannot be successfully contended that it is void because it does, not sufficiently designate the persons for whom the testator intended the beneficial use of the $5,000. In such gifts,, beneficiaries have been held to be sufficiently described in numerous cases still more indefinite. They have been sustained in England in the following cases amongst others: a gift to the poor in general (2 Lev. 167; Finch, 245); a bequest for the advancement of religion (1 Mol. 616); a gift to such charitable uses as A shall appoint (1 Ves. Jr. 464; 7 Ves. 36); a bequest to a particular charity by a description equally applicable to two, and it is wholly uncertain which was intended fl P. Wms. 674; 5 Russ. 112). These, and numerous other cases of a similar character, are collected by Mr. Jarman. They are all cases in which, as ordinary testamentary dispositions, the legacies would be held void; but as charities they are valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">Our American books are equally full of similar adjudications. In 27 U. S. 2 Pet. 578 (7 L. ed. 526), land marked, in the plan of a town, \u201c for the Lutheran Church,\u201d for religious purposes, was held a good charity without any other description of donees or uses. In <em>Witman </em>v. <em>Lex, </em>17 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 88, a legacy was given to \u201c the poor of the Lutheran congregation.\u201d It was held good. In the same case a legacy, the interest of which was to be applied from time to time to the education of young men in the ministry of a congregation under the direction of the vestry, was sustained. So, a bequest \u201c for the relief of the indigent, blind, and lame, giving a preference to those resident in Philadelphia and its neighborhood \u201d (3 Rawle, 170), was held valid. So, also, in <em>Pickering </em>v. Shotwell, 10 Pa. 23, a devise to an unincorporated religious society, \u201c to he applied as a fund for the distribution of good books among poor people in the back parts of Pennsylvania, or to the support of an institution or free school in or near Philadelphia,\u201d was maintained as a good charitable gift. 13 U. S. 9 Cranch, 296 (3 L. ed. 737); 28 U. S. 3 Pet. 99 (7 L. ed. 617); <em>Magill </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>Brightly, 347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>A bequest to a school has been held to be a gift to a schoolmaster; one to a church, a gift to the parson and his successors; one to parishioners, a gift to churchwardens. 11 Hen.

In fact the city of Philadelphia is and always has been the manager of the Philadelphia Waterworks. The city acts through its councils and its committee of councils on water. The case of <em>Vidal </em>v. <em>Girard, </em>43 U. S. 2 How. 127 (11 L. ed. 205), settled the right of the city to act as trustee for a charitable bequest. In that case it was held \u201c that the corporation of the city of Philadelphia has power, under its charter, to take real and personal estate by deed, and also by devise, inasmuch as the Act of 32 &amp; 34 Hen. VIII., which exempts corporations from taking by devise, is not in force in Pennsylvania; \u201d and that \u201c where a corporation has this power it may also take and hold property in trust in the same manner and to the same extent that a private person may do.\u201d There are no private waterworks in Philadelphia, and no. one could possibly have any doubt as to the particular object of bounty designated by the testatrix. That a bequest for waterworks is one for a charitable use was expressly held in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>Amb. 651, by <em>Lord Chancellor </em>Camden.

It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>only necessary to remark that trusts for religious and educational purposes, and for the benefit of the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the helpless, are charitable. They are governed by the rules that apply to trusts for private benefit. The intention of the donor is ascertained by 'the application of the same rules of construction. Where, however, it is plain that a public charity is intended, different rules from those applied to private trusts may be invoked in order to give effect to the-intention of the donor, and to establish the charity. A public charity will not fail by reason of the fact that the trustee is uncertain, or is incapable of taking, or that the objects of the charity are uncertain and indefinite. These, however,, would be fatal to gifts for private benefit. The greatest favor has for many centuries been shown by those who make and administer the laws to gifts for public charities. This favor is clearly discernible in the history of Boman legislation and jurisprudence. Writers on the civil law furnish the clearest evidence of the peculiar regard in which testaments, for charitable purposes were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We all know how favorably gifts for charitable uses were regarded by the early English law. Prior to the enactment of the Statute of Distributions (22 Car. II. chap. 13), the ordinary was obliged to apply a portion of the residue of every intestate estate to charity, on the ground that there was a general principle of piety and charity in every man, or that every man must be presumed to have intended a portion of his goods for the benefit of charity. In 1601 the Statute of 34 Elizabeth, chap. 4, commonly called the Statute of Charitable Uses, was enacted. It is unnecessary to consider the provisions of this statute, or the objects sought to be accomplished by its enactment. I can find no evidence that it has ever been recognized as in force in this State. It is trac that we derive our system of equity jurisprudence from that of England ; but they err who suppose that the jurisdiction of the English Court of Chancery over charities or charitable bequests owed its origin to the provisions of that statute. It is now fully established that the chancellor of England had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u25a0\u25a0and exercised jurisdiction over charities and charitable uses long before that statute. That jurisdiction was of two distinct characters,\u2014ministerial and judicial. The king, as <em>pwms pa-trice, </em>had the administration of all charities. The judicial part of this administration was entrusted to the ordinary equity jurisdiction of the court of chancery. The part not thus entrusted the king exercised, as paid of his prerogative, by his sign manual. This latter part, however, was .generally administered by the chancellor, representing the king as <em>parens patrice. </em>The ministerial function of the chancellor was exercised in cases not cognizable by him acting \u25a0solely in his judicial capacity. Of this class of cases may be mentioned gifts made for charitable uses that were illegal or -contrary to public policy, or that were impossible to be carried into effect, or in cases of charity generally, or to religion \u25a0or education, without directions when, where, or by whom the gift should be applied or used.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The principle or doctrine of the exercise of this ministerial function of the English chancellor was what is known as <em>ey pres; </em>that is to say, where there was a definite charitable purpose which co'uld not take place, the court would substitute another, and formerly of a very different character. It was not, however, in the exercise of the judicial function of his office, but in the exercise of his ministerial function, that the English chancellor applied the fund to a different purpose from that contemplated by the testator, provided it was charitable. It has been well remarked that \u201cmost of the cases carry the doctrine beyond what is allowed where private interests are concerned, and have in no inconsiderable degree to draw for their support on the prerogative of the Crown and the Statute of Charitable Uses.\u201d 43 Eliz. chap. 4. The doctrine of <em>ey pres </em>has never been recognized in this State. \u25a0Our court of chancery has been accustomed to exercise only the ordinary or judicial function of the English Court of Chancery; and it is believed that the ordinary powers of a court of equity, applied properly to the subject-matter, are sufficient to carry into effect all charitable bequests reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>able in' their character and proper in their objects. While, under our system of equity jurisprudence, charitable bequests to be administered only <em>cy pres </em>cannot be sustained, chancery here, as in England, in the exercise of its judicial functions,\u2014 here it possesses no other,-\u2014will sustain bequests in favor of charity not in contravention of law or public policy and that are capable of being carried into effect by the exercise of the judicial power vested in the court; and where a testator has clearly indicated when, where, how, and by whom his gifts are to be applied or used ; and also in all cases of such charities in which nothing is wanting for their application but a trastee. In the latter case chancery will not allow an otherwise proper trust to fail for want of a trustee, but will supply that want.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">What is a charity, a charitable use, a public charity ? In the case in Ambler to which reference will be hereafter made, this definition is given : <em>\u201cA </em>gift to a general public use which extends to the poor as well as the rich.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 556, <em>Justice </em>Gray says: \u201cA charity, in a legal sense, may be more fully defined as a gift to be applied, consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them -to establish themselves for life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works, or otherwise lessening the burdens of government. It is immaterial whether the purpose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it is so-described as to show that it is charitable in its nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">These general principles, applicable to public charities, seem sufficiently established by equity decisions. It is immaterial whether the person to take be <em>in esse </em>or not, or whether the legatee were at the time of the bequest a corporation capable of taking or not, or how uncertain the objects may be, provided there be a discretionary power vested anywhere, over the application of the testator\u2019s bounty to those objects, or whether the corporate designation has been mistaken. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the intention sufficiently appears on the bequest, it will be held valid. <em>Witman </em>v. <em>Lex, </em>17 Serg. &amp; R. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The general rule is that where either a corporation or a natural person is so identified by the name and description in ' the will, as applied to the facts and circumstances, as to distinguish such person or corporation from all others, such person or corporation shall take the bequest in the same manner as if no discrepancy had appeared. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Boston Asylum, </em>7 Met. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Where the name and description in a legacy, when applied to the facts, lead to a reasonable belief that they apply to some one person, and there is no other person to whom they can with any probability apply, then much slighter evidence will be sufficient to prove that that person was intended in the designation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The general rule certainly is that the intent of the testator is to govern in the construction, but it is the intention expressed by the will and not otherwise. To get at the intention expressed by the will, every clause and word are to be taken into consideration, because one clause is often modified and explained by another. Every implication, as well as every direct provision, is to be regarded. And further, as a will must necessarily apply to persons and things external, any evidence may be given of facts and circumstances which have any tendency to give effect and operation to the words of the will; such as the names, descriptions, and designations of persons, the relations in which they stood to the testator, the facts of his life, etc. If in the matter of description there is a mistake,\u2014that is, if there is no one who corresponds to the description in all particulars, hut there is one who corresponds in many particulars, and no other who can be intended,\u2014such person will take. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">If the will applies definitely to two or more persons, so that either would be entitled to take under the will but for the existence and claim of the other, then paroi evidence is admissible to prove which was intended. When that proof is supplied, the will operates, by its own force and terms, to give the property to that one, as if such person had been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u2022only one named or described. The evidence does not create the gift, but simply directs it. When the name or description used in the will does not designate with precision any person; but, when the circumstances come to be proved, so many of them concur as to indicate that a particular person was intended, and no similar conclusive circumstances appear to distinguish and identify any other person,\u2014the person thus .shown to be intended will take.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">W, by will, among other legacies, bequeathed as follows : \u201c To the Marine Bible Society I give \u00a71,000.\u201d There was no such society at the date of the will or at the time of its probate. There had existed some time previously a society by the name of the Boston Young Men\u2019s Marine Bible Society which had been dissolved or become extinct before the death \u25a0of the testator, the meetings of which he had, during his lifetime, occasionally attended, and to the funds of which he had \u2022contributed. The court says: <em>\u201c </em>This misdescription is a slight \u25a0one. There is no other society claiming to be the society intended under this description, and there are various facts introduced and tending to identify this society as the one designated by the testator to receive this legacy. If a testator \u2022errs in the name of the legatee, but sufficiently identifies the person or corporation, such error does not defeat the legacy.\u201d Swinb. Wills, pt. 7, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Where legatees are mentioned in a will by names which they never in point of fact had, yet they will take upon its being proved that the testator intended them. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>3 Cush. 362, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">A leading case \u2014 or one that is entitled to be considered such on account of the eminence of the judge announcing the \u2022opinion\u2014upon the subject of charitable bequests, and of a recent date, is that of <em>Domestic </em>&amp; <em>F. Miss. Society\u2019s Appeal, </em>30 Pa. 425, as is also that of <em>Cresson\u2019s Appeal, </em>Id. 437. The former case decides that a legacy to the missions and schools of the Episcopal church about to be established at or near\u2019 Port Cresson upon the western coast of Africa is a good charitable bequest to the Domestic &amp; Foreign Missionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United. States of America, by whom the mission at Port Cresson was-established, and upon whom it is dependent for support; and. that in case of a charitable bequest it is immaterial how vague,, indefinite, and uncertain the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty may be, provided there is a discretionary power vested in. someone over its application; that the law regards the substance of the gift, and, in f\u00e1vor of charity, vests it in the party capable of taking it, in whose ease it was given; and that paroi evidence is receivable to show the situation in which the testator stood towards the objects of his charity, and to designate who were intended by the will to be the-recipients of his bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In the latter case paroi evidence was received to show that-a bequest to the \u201cKefuge for Decayed Merchants \u201d was-intended for a charitable society incorporated under the name-of the Merchants\u2019 Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">I shall attempt no enumeration of the objects which have been adjudged charitable. They are almost innumerable. It is not necessary to do so in this case. If the legatees under this will are designated with sufficient accuracy, and if the objects of the testatrix\u2019s bounty are sufficiently ascertained, or are capable of being ascertained, so that the bequests may be beneficially applied, there can be no question as to the charitable nature of the bequests, except as to the bequest to the= \u201c trustees or managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks.\u201d This bequest must fail. The Philadelphia Waterworks are-not a public charity. The bequest is not good at common law, because there is no such corporation as the Trustees or Managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks, and there are no-fiduciary managers of said works. The only managers of the-works are its legal owner, the city of Philadelphia, and it is-not, to be presumed that the coi'poration styled the Oity of Philadelphia was intended to be the object of the testatrix\u2019s bounty. Trustees are never intended as the beneficial objects of bounty. They are intended as the fiduciaries for others than themselves. They control and manage interests or estates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>:not for their personal benefit, but for the benefit of others. .In this bequest the words \u201ctrustees\u201d and \u201cmanagers\u201d were \u2022intended to have substantially the same signification, and were intended to describe persons acting in fiduciary relations. The city of Philadelphia sustains no such relation either to the waterworks or to the persons using the water supplied by them. The city is the absolute owner of the works; it manages the works as its other property, and taxes the property-holders of the city for the use of the water supplied to them. 'The case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>WilKams, </em>Amb. 651, does not support the city\u2019s claim in this case. In that case, John Williams, by his will, taking notice that the town of Chepstow was much in want of good spring water, and that there was a subscription some time since set on foot for bringing the same to the town, but by some misunderstanding was dropped, gives \u00a31,000, to arise by a sale of his real estate, for the' purpose of bringing spring water from St. Arvins, or elsewhere, to the town of Chepstow, for the use of the inhabitants forever, which is to be laid out by his trustees and executors in bringing the said water to the said town and making conduits and reservoirs; and gives \u00a3200, if wanting, and directs a sum to be left in the Bank of England, or an estate bought with it, which will bring in \u00a310 a year, to keep the waterworks in good order. Clearly this was a gift for a charity. It was, says the court, a gift for a general public use, which extended to the poor as well as the rich. Ho money was exacted for the use of the water. Ho tax was imposed in order to furnish the supply. The testator\u2019s estate was to receive no return in consideration of his bounty. The testator furnished the water freely for the use of all the inhabitants of Chepstow. The city \u25a0of Philadelphia does not furnish, by means of her waterworks, water to the inhabitants of that city, to the poor as well as to the rich, freely and without charge, and is not, therefore, in this respect, the object of a charitable bequest. A corporation \u25a0owned by the State, and supported by a public tax or from government funds, is not the object of a charitable bequest, nor would a corporation belonging to a city, nor a corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>owned by private individuals for supplying any article, however necessary, for which supply a compensation was demanded, be the object of a charitable bequest. The Philadelphia Waterworks are simply property belonging to the city,, and are no more a public charity than a horse or a street car,, or a fire engine owned, controlled, and managed by the city.. I therefore decide that the bequest in the testatrix\u2019s will to-the trustees and managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks is-invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In view of the principles hereinbefore stated, and the decisions hereinbefore referred to, do the Orphan Society of\u2019 Philadelphia, the Indigent Widows\u2019 and Single Women\u2019s Society, and the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society, answer with sufficient certainty in designation or description the objects intended by the testatrix, in her will and codicil thereto, as the \u201c trustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania; \u201d the \u201c trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania,\u201d and the- \u201c trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">I will first consider the claim of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia to the bequest made in the will to the \u201ctrustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d The designation of the asylum mentioned in the will, and that of the society claiming the fund, is not in all respects the same. The latter takes under a devise or bequest,, not to trustees, but directly in its corporate name, which is the Orphan Society of Philadelphia. If otherwise entitled to the benefit of the fund, the bequest to the trustees instead of to the corporation direct in its corporate name would not, in my opinion, be fatal to the claim. It would in either case be the corporation intended to be benefited, and not the representatives of the corporation. Two things are certain from the consideration of this will, viz. : the testatrix meant that none of her heirs at law should derive any benefit from her estate, and that her estate should be applied to what she corn sidered public charities; and she has attempted to designate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>corporate agencies through which her charity should be administered. If she really meant the corporations claiming, and there be sufficient proof in the case, either from inspection of the will or otherwise, her intention must prevail notwithstanding a mistake in their designation. I do not regard the difference in designation in itself as sufficient to exclude the claimant from the benefit of the fund if it answers the description of the bequest. The material inquiry is, Is the description of the two\u2014that is to say, is the purpose, object, and character of the two\u2014the same, or so identical as to exclude the idea of uncertainty? The testatrix intended to make an incorporated institution, the object and purpose of which was to benefit or support orphans, her agent in the distribution of her bounty for the benefit or support of orphans. An asylum may be a society, and a society may be an asylum. It is the thing, the corporate being, and not the name of the thing or corporate being, which is material. It is in proof that the claimant was commonly called the Orphans\u2019 Asylum, and it is conceived that there cannot be, in reason, any material distinction between an orphan asylum and an orphan society, when either is regarded or spoken of or meant to be described as an institution for the protection or relief of the unfortunate; and this is one of the definitions of an \u201c asylum,\u201d given by Webster, with examples, as an asylum for the poor, for the deaf and dumb, and, he might have added, for orphans.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">An incorporated society is an institution. It may be for many purposes. It may be for business, for religious or charitable objects. The purposes for which it is established or instituted will determine its character. If it is a society for orphans, or an orphan society, the general usage, as well as the proper understanding of the term, would determine its character as that of a society for the protection or relief of orphans. An orphan asylum has no other character; nothing else is descriptive of it. There is no orphan asylum in Philadelphia whose corporate name answers the designation in the testatrix\u2019s will nearer than\u2014or as near, in my opinion, as\u2014that of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia. I doubt if there are any an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>swering. the description so near. The few other orphan asylums referred to in the cause appear to be denominational or class in character. It would have been more satisfactory, if it could have been done, had proof been made that the testatrix had personal knowledge of some particular institution for the benefit of orphans. The omission of this proof, however, ought not to be considered as evidence that she had no knowledge or information of any institution of that character in the city of Philadelphia, an\u2018d of the orphan society in particular. That which was generally known among the friends of the institution may have been known to her personally, and the institution therefore may have been -designated by her by its popular rather than by its corporate name. In her extreme want of charity towards her relatives, in not providing for \u201c those of her own house,\u201d\u2014which high authority has declared to be worse than infidelity,\u2014she seems, nevertheless, to have wished to devote her estate to objects which she considered charitable. There is no other claimant to this bequest, although, by order of the court, publication of notice to all corporations . desiring to claim the same has been made in a paper called the Legal Intelligencer, published in the city of Philadelphia. Considering the length to which courts have gone in order to establish charitable bequests, and that, if the claim of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia is disallowed, the bequest of the testatrix for the benefit of orphans must fail,\u2014whatever may be my private opinion of the propriety and wisdom of the action of the testatrix in disposing of her property as she has done by her will, as a judge, recognizing the decisions of courts in analogous cases, I am constrained to give effect to this bequest, and to decide in favor of the claim thereto made by the Orphan Society of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The same reasoning will apply to the claim of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society. Its designation is not that employed by the testatrix in her will. There is little in common between them; the one is the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia, and the other is the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society. There is no society or asylum in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Philadelphia answering the designation in the will. It is, however, evident from the will itself that the testatrix meant, by her bequest to the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia, a bequest for the benefit, protection, or support of mariners. Does the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society sufficiently answer the description of a marine society, and such a marine society as the testatrix meant; and did she mean it? If it does not so answer, and if she did not mean it, her bequest to the \u201ctrustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia \u201d must fail; for there is no other claimant to it, and there is no other society proved to exist that can take the \"bequest. Webster defines the word \u201c marine,\u201d as an adjective, \u25a0pertaining to the sea, transacted at sea. \u201c Marine,\u201d as a noun, lie defines to be a soldier that serves on board of a ship and fights in naval engagements. He defines marines to be a body of troops trained to do military service on board of ships. Also the whole navy of a kingdom or state. Again, the whole \u2022economy of naval affairs, comprehending the building, rigging, \u2022equipping, navigating, and management of ships of war in \u25a0engagements. He defines \u201ca mariner\u201d to be a seaman or \u25a0sailor,\u2014one whose occupation is to assist in navigating ships. He defines \u201ca seaman\u201d to be a sailor, a mariner,\u2014a man whose occupation is to assist in the management of ships at sea. He says naval skill is the art of managing a fleet, particularly in an engagement; \u201c a very different thing from seamanship. Hothing is more common than to speak of our naval marine and our commercial marine.\u201d The term \u201c marine \u201d is not exclusively appropriate to either. .It is common to both. It will be observed that the object of the testatrix was to bestow a charity, the recipients of which should be mariners. All the other institutions or societies mentioned or referred to in this cause, having any relation to or connection with the terms \u25a0\u201cmarine\u201d or \u201cseamen,\u201d were either governmental or beneficial, and cannot therefore be considered as objects for charitable bequests or public charities. Section 2 of the charter of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society is as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201c \u00a7 2. The object of this corporation is to promote the social and moral improvement of seamen at home or abroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">It is therefore a charitable corporation or institution. NT ow,. although the designation of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society is not the same as that used by the testatrix in th&amp; codicil to her will, to wit, the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania,\u2014yet, as there is no other claimant of the bequest, nor any other institution in Philadelphia of a charitable character answering to tliedeseription of a marine asylum, which must mean an asylum or society for the benefit, protection, or support of mariners- or seamen, whether naval or commercial; and as it appears-from the charter and the reports of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society that it does meet the description of a marine asylum,\u2014that is, that it is an institution for the benefit-of mariners or seamen; and inasmuch as a court of equity will not allow a charity to fail if it can reasonably be applied,\u2014 I am of opinion, notwithstanding the absence of proof of any general or special knowledge on the part of the testatrix of' the existence of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society,, that said society is entitled to the bequest, in the codicil, to the- \u201c trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State-of Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The evidence discloses the existence of no institution or corporation in the city of Philadelphia answering the designation of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania. The name of St. Ann Widows\u2019 Asylum, appears in one of the directories of the city of Philadelphia, made one of the exhibits in this cause. \u00a1Nothing is known of it, however, from the evidence, other than its name, which, would seem to indicate that it is denominational in character. It is not a claimant of the bequest. In a list of some of the-benevolent institutions of the city of Philadelphia, made an exhibit in the cause, there appears to be in that city an institution the corporate name of which is Penn Asylum for Indigent Widows and Single Women of the City of Philadelphia,, which was incorporated in the year 1852, six years after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>will was made which contains the bequest. Of course the testatrix could not intend this corporation, and it has not appeared and claimed the bequest. The Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Society, incorporated in 1819, is the only charitable institution or corporation that has appeared and claimed the bequest to the trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of' Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania. James Bayard, a witness examined in the cause, speaking of the claimant, says \u201c I am well acquainted with the Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Asylum of Philadelphia,\u2014have known it about fifty years.\u201d He also says: \u201c In common parlance this institution was called the Widows\u2019 Asylum. Unless it was for some specific business purposes, I never heard it called by the corporate name in common parlance.\u201d He also states that single women were admitted into the institution, and that single women had as much right as widows; that it was not exclusively a widows\u2019 society; that he could not say what proportion of single women and widows had been admitted at any time since its institution; and that its charity extended as well to single women as widows. He also states that members of his family and intimate friends were managers of the institution, and that the name given it by his family and friends in common conversation was the Widows\u2019 Asylum. The rule for the application of charities is that, where a charity is given to any object by special designation or description, and that-designation or description equally applies to two or more objects, the charity will fail from the want of certainty as to the particular object intended; but that which would be otherwise uncertain in such a case may be rendered reasonably or absolutely certain by paroi evidence indicating the particular charity intended. Of this description of evidence would be the proof of the testator\u2019s relation to the particular institution, if an institution be the object of the charity; the name by which, one of the institutions, if there were more than one claiming, was commonly called; and any other circumstance tending to-show the particular charity intended. In the forty-seventh, annual report of the managers of the Indigent Widows and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Single Women\u2019s Society, for the year 1863, which I find among the exhibits in the cause, is the following: \u201c The storm which has broken over our unhappy country has as yet been unfelt \u2022within the walls of-the society\u2019s asylum.\u201d Again: \u201cMost of the applicants are deserving gentlewomen, who have fallen into \u25a0poverty in the decline of life, and whose education has taught them to shrink from dependence on individual charity.\u201d In their twenty-eighth annual report, for the year 1844, is the following: \u201c This society is founded for the relief of aged and \u2022indigent women. It recognizes no sectarian preferences. The only requisites for participation in its charities are advanced age, destitution, and meritorious character.\u201d Again: \u201c It is especially designed to provide an asylum for those whose earlier lives have heen passed in the more refined walks of life, and whom experience therefore has not inured to the struggle of penury.\u201d As the testatrix, in her bequest to the trustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia, must have meant to hestow a charity upon orphans, and in her bequest to the Marine Asylum of Philadelphia must have meant to \"bestow a charity for the benefit of seamen, so in her bequest to the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia she must have intended a charity in favor of widows. The society claiming the bequest does not answer the designation of the asylum mentioned in the will; but the charity answers the description \u2022of the charity intended by the will, unless the participation of single women in the charity administered by the claimant renders the description dissimilar. I cannot suppose that a \u2022charity including that mentioned in the will, but more extensive in its benefits, and extended to an equally meritorious nlass of persons of destitute condition, especially as the charity is or may be given to the corporation by its popular, and not its corporate, designation, can have that effect. For these and ihe additional reasons assigned in reference to the other charitable bequests hereinbefore considered, I shall decree the Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Society of Philadelphia -entitled to the bequest to the \u201c trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of the city of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>I have not overlooked the fact that each one of these bequests-to intended charitable institutions has been directed, in the will and codicil, to be applied to the institutions or corporations respectively. This form of bequest, however, I regard as no more or less than a direction that the benefits of the bequests shall be enjoyed by the classes of persons respectively for whose benefit those institutions or corporations-exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">I am aware that I have in this opinion gone quite far enough in the application of well-recognized equitable principles to charitable uses. It would not have been a matter of regret to me if I had been able to arrive at different conclusions. There is nothing in' the will of Amy Doughten, with, respect to these charitable bequests, at the expense of her relatives in blood, that meets the approval of my judgment. Her example in this respect I would not commend as worthy of imitation ; and nothing but a sense of duty, which compels-me to follow the law as expounded by courts of equity, has caused me to give an interpretation to the provisions of her will and the codicil thereto by which her heirs at law are excluded from the benefit of sharing her estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
