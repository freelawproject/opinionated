W. Green, 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">II. The defendant is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice, and is therefore not affected by the equitable circumstances charged in the bill, even if in fact they existed as \u2022charged. See <em>New York Chemical Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>2 Halst. Eq. 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-10\">An assignee of a chose in action takes it subject to all the \u25a0equity of the original obligor or debtor at the time, and not to latent equity residing in a third person against the obligee \u2022or assignor. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lylburn, </em>2 Johns. Ch. 441.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-11\">Where a mortgagee, at the time of taking his mortgage, receives from a judgment creditor holding a previous judgment against the mortgagor a release of the lien of his judgment from the mortgaged premises, so as to give him a-priority of lien, and the mortgagee fails to file and have his Telease noted on the record of the judgment,\u2014the release is inoperative against a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>assignee of the judgment without notice of the existence of the release. <em>Mellon's Appeal, </em>96 Pa. 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-12\">III. The complainant is an entire stranger to this alleged \u25a0\u25a0agreement, and if it were fully proved he can take nothing-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>under it, because there is neither mutuality nor privity of contract. <em>Colyear </em>v.

Johnson </em>for complainant, in opposition to the-motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">The dissolution of injunctions is largely a matter of judicial discretion to be determined by the nature of the particular case under consideration. A dissolution does not necessarily follow upon the coming in of the answer denying the-allegations of the bill upon which the injunction issued; and the court may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, refuse a dissolution and continue the injunction to the hearing, where-the circumstances of the case seem to demand this course. <em>Chetwood </em>v. Brittan, 1 H. W. Green, 438; <em>Irick </em>v. <em>Black, </em>2 C. E. Green, 189; <em>Firmstone </em>v. <em>De Camp, </em>2 C. E. Green, 309; High, Inj. p. 528, \u00a7 899.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">Especially will a judicial discretion be exercised where-fraud is the gravamen of the bill; or where it is apparent to-the court that a dissolution of the injunction would result in greater injury and hardship than its continuance to the hearing;, or where it is apparent that, by the dissolution, complainant would lose all the benefit which would otherwise accrue to him should he finally succeed in his cause. <em>Chetwood, </em>v. <em>Brittan, </em>and <em>Firmstone </em>v. <em>De Camp, supra; Attorney General </em>v. <em>Oakland County Bank, </em>Walker, Ch. 90; High, Inj. pp. 528, 529, \u00a7 899.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-9\">The equities existing between' the assignor and assignee of a chose in action not negotiable attend the title transferred to a subsequent assignee for value and without notice; the latter takes the exact position of his vendor. The supposed distinction between latent equities, so called, and those existing between the original parties to the instrument, have been repudiated. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>22 N. Y. 535. (In this case the doctrine as to latent equities laid down in the ease of <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lylburn, </em>2 Johns. Ch. 441, is examined and. repudiated.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-10\">The assignee of a mortgage, although a <em>bona fide </em>holder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>takes the same subject to all defenses existing between the original parties. <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Disborough, </em>47 N. Y. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-6\">One who takes an assignment of a mortgage takes it subject, not only to any latent equities that exist in favor of the mortgagor, but also subject to the like equities in favor of third persons. <em>Schafer </em>v. Reilly, 50 N. Y. 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">A <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of a judgment from an assignee takes the same subject to any equities between the judgment creditor and his assignee. <em>Cutts </em>v. Guild, 57 N. Y. 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-8\">The assignee of two single bills given in consideration of an assignment, to be thereafter made, of an interest under a patent,\u2014the obligees having after obtaining the bills refused to make the stipulated assignment,\u2014takes them subject to the equities affecting them in the hands of the obligees. <em>Robinson </em>v. Jefferson, 1 Del. Ch. 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-9\">The assignee of a bond takes it subject to all the equities as between the original parties. <em>Oliver </em>v. Lowery, 2 Harrington, 467.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A1j\">The records in the recorder\u2019s office were public, open to the inspection of the complainant; and if, instead of examining them, he chose to rely upon loose declarations of others, or the general understanding of people attending a public sale, he alone must suffer by his folly.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Title to lands, and liens thereon, are not to be affected by such declarations or understandings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Timothy Slaughter, as the assignee of the purchase money mortgage executed by Garner and wife, has a right under the law of this State to prosecute his suit of <em>scire facias </em>to judgment, and under proper proceedings thereon to cause the said lands to be sold for the payment of his mortgage debt, notwithstanding the sale and sheriff\u2019s deed to Foxwell, mentioned in his bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The motion to .dissolve the preliminary injunction and dismiss the bill is therefore granted; and the complainant must pay the costs in this cause in three months, or attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Let a decree be drawn accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
