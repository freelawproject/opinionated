Mrs. -Barrett was not arrested, but a friend voluntarily entered into recognisance for her appearance at the next sessions. A bill of indictment was preferred and found by the grand jury, but on her trial before the traverse jury she was acquitted, and the prosecutor, Graff, ordered to pay the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-13\">On the trial of this case, the plaintiff showed a deed to Daniel Barrett, her husband, for a house and lot in Pittsburgh, and that he died intestate, leaving her and eight children surviving.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-14\">On the trial the defendant asked the instruction of the court upon several points, the 5th of which was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-15\">\u201c If the jury believe the evidence of the case on the part of the defendant, there are such reasonable grounds of suspicion proved as would constitute probable cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-16\">The court below (Williams, J.) refused to answer the point as requested, but referred the question to the jury. None of the evidence for the defendant was contained in the paper-book.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-17\">The jury found a verdict in favour of the plaintiff of $500, and judgment was entered upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-18\">The defendant removed the cause to this court, and assigned that the court erred in refusing to answer defendant\u2019s fifth point as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-19\"><em>J. Mellon </em>and <em>P. O. </em>Shannon, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APN\">cited and relied on Laughlin <em>v. </em>Clawson, 3 <em>Casey </em>328.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-20\"><em>Pleniken, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b477-21\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b478-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Armstrong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATI\">This was an action on the case brought by Fanny Barrett against Philip Graff for malicious prosecution, and we dre asked by the plaintiff in error to reverse the judgment for the single reason, as alleged, that the court below erred in refusing to charge that, \u201c If the jury believe the evidence in the cause on the part of the defendant, there is such reasonable ground of suspicion proved as would constitute probable cause.\u201d And this is attempted to be sustained on the authority of Laughlin <em>v. </em>Clawson, 3 <em>Casey </em>328. It receives, however, no support from that case. <em>There </em>the Court of Common Pleas regarded the testimony of the prosecutor as furnishing sufficient evidence of probable cause if believed, and yet refused to give a binding instruction. Here, if we are to judge from the facts so far as stated in the charge, the court could not have believed, much less have been justified in giving the instruction demanded in Laughlin <em>v. </em>Clawson. There, legal advice had been sought by the prosecutor, Here, he clothed himself with no such precaution.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">But a more grave objection lies to the reversal of this judgment. Not a particle of the evidence 'on the part of the defendant, and on which the point rests, has been returned. And in its absence no amount of' discernment could enable us to say the answer of the court was erroneous. And the only advantage a report of this case can have, is to repeat, if that can be necessary, that where the error depends upon a consideration of the evidence, such evidence should be made a part of, and returned with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
