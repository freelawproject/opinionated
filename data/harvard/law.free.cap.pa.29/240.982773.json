O\u2019Brien &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\">R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co. were merchants in the city of Erie, and failed in business in September, 1856. Three <em>fi. fas. </em>were issued against them, upon which their personal property was sold. The sale extended through several days, and was finally completed October 11, in the forenoon. The proceeds of the sale overpaid the three <em>fi. fas. </em>about $90, which surplus money was in the sheriff\u2019s hands. The <em>fi. fas. </em>already mentioned, as well as those hereinafter mentioned, were returnable to the first Monday in November, 1856. On the afternoon of the 11th October, <em>fi. fa. </em>in favour of William Boyd was put in the sheriff\u2019s hands, upon which he levied upon the surplus moneys in his hands, and upon a small amount of personal property not before levied on. On the 13th October, the <em>fi. fa. </em>of R. G. Herron, the appellant, was put in the sheriff\u2019s hands, upon which he made the same levy as upon Boyd\u2019s writ. On the 14th October Duggan &amp; Berry placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands <em>fi. fa. </em>in their favour, upon which levy was made upon the small amount of personal property before referred to, but not upon the surplus money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">On the 23d October the sheriff sold the property levied upon for $28.75, and at the return of the writ brought that and the surplus money levied on into court for appropriation, and John W. Douglass, Esq., was appointed auditor to make distribution. The main difficulties in the case arose from some collateral matters in connexion with Herron\u2019s execution, the facts of which are as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-13\">On the 27th September, 1856, Herron brought suit before a justice of the peace against O\u2019Brien &amp; Co., and on the 3d of October, 1856, recovered a judgment against them by default for $74.46, and costs. The same day <em>exit </em>execution and return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>\u201c nulla bona.\u201d </em>October 6, Herron took a transcript, and filed it in the Common Pleas October 7, 1856. October 13, 1856, this <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued and levied. On the same day (October 13, 1856), O\u2019Brien &amp; Oo. entered bail for an appeal to the Common Pleas. This appeal was never perfected. No transcript was taken or filed by defendants.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANkX\">November 3, 1857,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">O\u2019Brien &amp; Co., defendants, claimed the surplus money before mentioned, and they and Duggan &amp; Berry both claimed that Herron\u2019s execution became void upon the entering bail for the appeal, and the last-named parties claimed the money, after the payment of Boyd\u2019s execution of about $18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">The auditor appropriated sufficient of the surplus money to pay Boyd\u2019s and Herron\u2019s <em>fi. fas., </em>and the whole of the money made from the sale of the personal property, $28.75, to Duggan &amp; Berry\u2019s <em>fi. fa., </em>it having no levy on the money, and the others had, \u2014 leaving a surplus in the sheriff\u2019s hands unappropriated of $26.71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">To the auditor\u2019s report Herron, Duggan &amp; Berry, and O\u2019Brien excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">The\u2019 court (Galbraith, P.) decreed the money from the sale of the personal property to Boyd\u2019s <em>fi. fa. </em>sufficient to satisfy it, and the remainder to the <em>fi. fa. </em>of Duggan &amp; Berry, and the surplus money from former sales in the sheriff\u2019s hands to the defendants, O\u2019Brien &amp; Oo., disregarding entirely Herron\u2019s <em>fi. fa., </em>which decree he assigns as error, and from it appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-10\"><em>Gtrant, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWf\">referred to Davis <em>v. </em>Ward, <em>Philad.

And submitted the case on the paper-book, without argument.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-11\">No appearance for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"AxQ\">by Lewis, 0. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmJH\">This is not a controversy between lien creditors, but a contest between a creditor justly entitled to payment, and the debtor who unjustly withholds it. In such a contest the policy of the law is to appropriate the debtor\u2019s assets to the payment of his debts, unless he brings himself within one of the exceptions provided by statute. The exemption laws preserve from execution a certain amount of property supposed to be necessary for the comfortable existence of the debtor and his family; but the surplus money levied on in this case is not within the letter or spirit of these laws. The Act of 16th June, 1836, expressly authorizes the seizure of coin, or bank notes in payment of debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>except where such money is raised by execution <em>at the suit of the </em>debtor, or is in his <em>personal possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In this case it was raised by the execution of another creditor, and was not in the personal possession of the debtor. It was therefore justly and legally liable to be taken in execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">But it seems that Richard G. Herron obtained a judgment before a justice, issued an execution thereon, which was returned u no goods,\u201d and filed a transcript in the Common Pleas, by virtue of which he issued a <em>fi.fa., </em>and levied on the money in question. After the transcript was filed in the Common Pleas, but within the twenty days allowed for an appeal, R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co., the debtors, entered bail for an appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace; but they never filed the appeal in the Common Pleas. By the terms of the Act of Assembly, the appeal is \u201c effectual\u201d if the transcript be \u201cfiled in the prothonotary\u2019s office on or before the first day of the next term of the Common Pleas, after entering such bail as aforesaid.\u201d As between debtor and creditor, the failure to enter the transcript within the period prescribed by law rendered the appeal entirely ineffectual. It is not necessary to express an opinion on the effect of entering bail for an appeal in giving one creditor a preference over another. It is sufficient to say that the debtor himself can gain no advantage, either by his own fraud or his own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The appellant is entitled to be paid out of the surplus money. The decree of the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Erie is reversed, and it is further decreed that the money in court be distributed according to the report of the auditor. It is further decreed that the costs be paid by Richard O\u2019Brien and P. Grace, doing business under the name of R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
