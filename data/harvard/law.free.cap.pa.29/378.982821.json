And on the trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered two notes, dated 13th November, 1848, by Deeds to Foster and Marchand, admitted to be <em>genuine; </em>and also two others by same and Lippincott to Mary Deeds, dated 2d June, 1849, for the purpose of showing by comparison that the paper 1st June, and the due-bill of 3d September, 1849, were not signed by Deeds, the plaintiff. To the admission of these papers the defendant objected, but the court overruled the objections, and admitted them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-12\">The jury found for the plaintiff \u00a7407.37, and judgment was rendered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-13\">The defendant removed the cause to this court, and assigned that the court erred in admitting the several notes above stated, for the purpose of impeaching the genuineness of the papers given in evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-14\"><em>Marchand </em>and Laird, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5m\">Handwriting, in this state, cannot be proved or disproved by mere comparison: Vickroy <em>v. </em>Skelly, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>372: unless in the case of a public officer, so long dead that better proof cannot be had: Callan <em>v. </em>Gaylord, 3 <em>Watts </em>323: and for corroboration: Bank <em>v. </em>Whitehill, 10 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>110; Baker <em>v. </em>Hains, 6 <em>Wh. </em>284; Bank <em>v. </em>Jacobs, 1 <em>Penn.

Such evidence seldom falls under the suspicion of being manufactured for the occasion, and is but little apt to give rise to collateral issues. It is therefore always preferred as evidence in chief to a mere comparison of the proposed writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>with other writings proved to he of the same person. This sort of comparison is not allowed as a means of getting the proposed writing before the jury; but it is a perfectly legitimate way of attacking such a-writing as false or forged, especially when there is other evidence casting suspicion upon it. But then great care is to be taken that the exemplar, or standard, which is to be used as a test of genuineness, be itself genuine, and not manufactured \u25a0for that purpose. When its genuineness is admitted, as were those offered in this instance, there can be no difficulty. We say they were admitted to be genuine, because two of them were expressly so, and the others were impliedly so, by the objection being confined to the use proposed to be made of them.</p>\n<p id=\"ADhg\">The writing that is to be judged, and that to be used as a standard, go together before the jury, and they may make the comparison for themselves. If the parties think it important, they are entitled to call experts, examined and approved as such by the court, and get them to aid the jury in the comparison, by giving their opinion as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">These principles are very well presented by Mr. Greenleaf, in 1 <em>Ev. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 579-582, and 3 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 106; and the cause was tried in accordance with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
