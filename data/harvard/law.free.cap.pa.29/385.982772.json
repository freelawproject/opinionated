After her father\u2019s death, Mary intermarried with Thomas Gaddis, and by him had issue several children. He died, leaving her his widow. In 1846, or 1847, she was married to Andrew McClelland, the plaintiff in this suit, and by him had issue several children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">The defendants, to sustain the issue on their part, offered in evidence the deed of Mary McClelland one of the plaintiffs, to Richards one of the defendants, for the property in dispute, to be followed by evidence that at the time of making the deed and for some time past, McClelland and wife were not living together, and that he neglected and refused to provide for his family. That Mary McClelland had received from Richards the full amount of the purchase-money. To this the plaintiff objected on the ground that the deed is void, the husband not having joined in the execution of it; and that the whole evidence is irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">The court below sustained the objection, and overruled the evidence. To this the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff; and thereupon the defendant sued out this writ of error, and assigned that the court erred in sustaining the objection to the defendant\u2019s offer, and in overruling the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>\u25a0J.
