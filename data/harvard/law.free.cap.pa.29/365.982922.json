Gray made an affidavit of defence, setting forth \u201cthat sometime in the year 1853 Jones &amp; Co., of Pittsburgh, applied to him to become an accommodation endorser and acceptor of negotiable paper, for the benefit of said firm, to be discounted for them at the Merchants\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Pittsburgh, to an amount not exceeding $25,000; at their request he did, at sundry times, between that time and the 1st of July, 1855, endorse and accept their negotiable hills and notes for their accommodation, to an amount unknown to him, but which he was informed and believed did not exceed that sum; and that the new notes and bills, from time to time presented for his endorsement or acceptance, were for the purpose and would be applied to the meeting and taking up prior acceptances and endorsements. That the said Jones &amp; Co., fraudulently and in collusion with some person or persons unknown to defendant, did not apply the same to the said purpose. That this defendant had no interest in the said partnership of Jones &amp; Co., nor in the proceeds of said negotiable paper, but only endorsed and accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the same for their accommodation. To which affidavit of defence the plaintiffs filed the following exceptions: \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">1. The affidavit is not sufficiently direct and positive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">2. It is too general, especially in not identifying the paper to which defendant\u2019s objections apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">3. The allegations, assuming- them all to be true, do not impeach the title of the holders of the bills in suit, nor cast upon them the burden of proving that they took them in the usual course of business for value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">4. The affidavit is bad, because of duplicity, uncertainty, and inconsistency, and the admission in the latter part, that defendant does not know under what circumstances the paper was put in circulation, nullifies the preceding insinuation that it might have been or was done collusively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">The court, on hearing, sustained the exceptions, and entered judgment for the plaintiffs, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, for \u00a1$8178.56, December 29, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">The plaintiff thereupon sued out this writ, and assigned for error, that the court below erred in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-12\"><em>C.

Still it was negotiable paper, and the presumption of law is that the endorsee received it <em>bona fide, </em>in due course, and for a valuable consideration. To put him to proof of his title the defendant must make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, that the bill was obtained by undue means, as by fraud, felony, or force, or that it Avas lost: 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>445; 6 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>221; 6 <em>Barr </em>168; 7 <em>Barr </em>476. Mere want or failure of consideration is not enough, as Avas satisfactorily shown by Judge Sergeant in the first named of the above cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">But it is said the affidavit discloses a case of fraud, similar to that which in Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Boggs &amp; Kirk, 4 <em>Casey </em>294, was held sufficient to shift the burthen of proof on to the shoulders of the plaintiff. We do not think so. That was a case of cheating with false pretences, which is a fraud that the law denounces as a crime, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>for which the guilty party may be punished with the penitentiary, and the paper in suit there was obtained in the perpetration of that crime. It was as if it had been stolen. But here the acceptances sued on were voluntarily made in pursuance of a precedent contract, and for the purpose of giving negotiability to the bills. The acceptor expected them to pass by the endorsement of Jones &amp; Co., and held himself out to the world as responsible for them into whosesoever hands they might come. The affidavit does indeed allege that, according to the contract between the parties, the proceeds of the acceptances were to be applied to the taking up of prior notes and acceptances of Gray, and that Jones &amp; Co. were guilty of a breach of that contract, for they did not so apply the proceeds. The fraud consisted in misapplying the proceeds of the paper, but that in the very nature of the case imparted no taint to the paper itself. The purpose for which the bills were made and put into circulation, was to furnish Jones &amp; Co. with funds to be applied according to their contract with Gray. That was an honest and fair purpose. How could the purchaser of the bills be expected to have any knowledge of the private agreement between the original parties ? And if he had, how could it be expected that he would see to the application of the funds he paid for the bills ?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">It was for Gray himself rather than for the purchaser to look to this, and if he was content to confide in Jones &amp; Co. he has no reason or right to charge the consequences of his over-confidence against the endorsee. To permit an acceptor to set up such a breach of confidence against an endorsee of negotiable paper \u2014 a breach or fraud if you please so to call it, occurring after the rights of the endorsee have fully vested \u2014 would be against the plainest principles of equity as well as subversive of the commercial law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">To require the holder in such a case to prove the consideration, would, we think, \u201c be putting a clog on the circulation of negotiable securities, which would tend to impair their use and employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We are therefore of opinion that there was nothing in the affidavit of defence which tended to impeach the plaintiff\u2019s title, or to rebut the presumption which the law makes in his favour, and therefore that the judgment was well entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
