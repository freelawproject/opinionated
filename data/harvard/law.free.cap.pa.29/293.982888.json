C. Walker, of Erie, for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-18\">Portions of the claim were collected, from time to time, and remittances made to the plaintiffs in New York, up to the 26th day of May, 1843, when a settlement took place between Galbraith &amp; Graham, on part of the plaintiffs, and S. C. Walker, and on that day paid Galbraith &amp; Graham $144.93, and gave a new note, payable to the plaintiffs, for $418.11, being the balance due on the original claim. Walker paid Galbraith &amp; Graham, September 12, 1843, $317 on the note, and paid John Galbraith, Esq., on the 27th day of March, 1848, $138.14, the balance of the note. The defendants, by letter, dated June 14, 1843, informed the plaintiffs that they had adjusted the claim against Mr. Walker, by <em>talcing other </em>securities, <em>nothing said about any money having been paid by Mr. Walker to them. </em>On the 27th February, 1847, Galbraith wrote the plaintiffs, \u201cFor the claim against Walker a number of small notes, &amp;c., were transferred as collateral, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>what amount, or how much has been collected on them, I have not been able as yet to ascertain with precision, but have the way all clear now, so that I can ascertain, and will do so as soon as possible, and inform you, and have that closed up, Mr. Walker is now here, came yesterday, and, in a day or two, with his assistance, can ascertain how the matter stands, and shall go at it.\u201d On the 9th of July, 1847, Galbraith again wrote to the plaintiffs that he had not seen Walker, that Graham was absent, consequently was unable to give the desired information in relation to the Walker claim. July 25, 1847, Galbraith issued a writ of foreign attachment, McCoon &amp; Sherman <em>v. </em>S. C. Walker, upon a note dated 26th May, 1843, for $418.11, and attached property of Walker, which suit was not prosecuted to judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">On the 25th day of February, 1852, Galbraith and Lane remitted to the plaintiffs $156.40, on the claim against Walker, leaving, at that time, a balance due to plaintiffs of nearly $600 on the Walker claim. In the spring or summer of 1852, the plaintiffs placed their claim in the hands of Marshall &amp; Yincent for collection. An amicable action was agreed to be entered, which agreement was made on January \u2014, 1853, but not filed until 5th December, 1853. The defence set up by the defendants was the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">On the trial, defendants requested the instruction of the court on the following points :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">1. \u201c That the commencement of this suit, as shown by the record, is the 5th December, 1853, and all claims or causes of action against the firm of Galbraith &amp; Graham, more than six years prior to that date, are barred by the statute of limitations, and the plaintiffs cannot recover in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">2. \u201c That the letter of 27th February, 1847, read by plaintiffs, contains a distinct notice to the plaintiffs of the dissolution of the firm of Galbraith &amp; Graham, and all claims for moneys collected by Graham or Galbraith &amp; Graham are barred at any time after six years from that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">3. \u201cThatthe letters of John Galbraith, of the 27th February, 1847, or at any time afterwards, do not take the case out of the statute of limitations as to the firm of Galbraith &amp; Graham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">4. \u201c That the collection of the balance of the money due from Walker, and paying it over by the firm of Galbraith &amp; Lane, has no operation to take the case out of the bar of the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">5. \u201c That on the whole evidence of plaintiffs, if taken as true, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, the claim having been barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\">The court (Dbrrickson, J.) charged the jury as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-14\">The cases of McDowell <em>v. </em>Potter, 8 <em>Barr </em>189; Foster <em>v. </em>Jack, 4 <em>Watts </em>334; Derrickson <em>v. </em>Cady, 7 <em>Barr </em>31, are directly in point.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3L\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>November 3, 1857,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">Upon the other hand, it is contended that the cases of Agnew <em>v. </em>Fetterman, 4 <em>Barr </em>56, and Downey <em>v. </em>Garard, 12 <em>Harris </em>52, conflict with McDowell <em>v. </em>Potter, Foster <em>v. </em>Jack, and Derrickson <em>v. </em>Cady. We think they do not, that those cases all can easily be reconciled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">The jury found for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">The plaintiff sued out this writ and assigned the charge of the court for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-8\"><em>Marshall, for </em>plaintiff in error</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-9\"><em>Lane </em>and <em>Thomson, </em>contr\u00fc.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMvr\">The case is clearly within the principle decided in 15 <em>Wendell </em>302, 4 <em>Barr </em>58, and 12 <em>Harris </em>52, which is, that the statute begins to run in favour of an attorney from the time money is collected.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"AmK\">by Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahi\">We think that this action ought to be treated as commenced to November Term, 1852, for that is the agreement of the parties. Within six years before (27th February, 1847), Galbraith had written to the plaintiffs, expressing his ignorance of the state of the case, informing them that collaterals had been placed in the defendant\u2019s hands, but not saying that any payment had been made to them, and promising to ascertain and inform <em>them </em>farther. In July he wrote again that he was still without information, and promising to obtain and communicate it. Long before that his partner had collected the most of the claim, and Galbraith is in law chargeable with a knowledge of this, and therefore he must be treated as not revealing it when called upon, but promising to do so, and not until then, at least, could the statute of limitations begin to run. We are not very sure that Graham is a party appearing to this suit; but however this may be, the letters of Galbraith are evidence against his late firm, if he had power to act for both in settling up the business, and the statute had not already run when they were written. He seems to have thought that he had such power. Besides this, the balance of the claim collected and paid over by Galbraith, in 1848, shows that the matter in which he and his partner were employed, was not terminated until then; for the dissolution of their partnership did not dissolve their relation to their client. The plaintiffs could look to them both for the duty confided to them both. For partial collections made and communicated to their clients, perhaps the statute would run from the time of the notice. But without this, the statute would not run until the case was terminated by complete success or failure, or until the termination of the relation of attorney and client in the given case: 4 <em>Watts </em>334.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Judgment reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
