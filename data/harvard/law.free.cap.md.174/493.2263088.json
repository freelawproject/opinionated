For several years he had raced at Pimlico, also at Havre de Grace and Timonium. Pimlico held two events a year, the spring meeting lasting twelve days, and the fall meeting thirteen days. It is further shown that Hullcoat did not race at Pimlico in the fall of 1937, his connection with the fall meeting having been limited to attendance as a spectator on \u00f3ne or two occasions. When racing horses at such meetings, whether at Pimlico or elsewhere, Hullcoat maintained quarters at some hotel or rooming-house convenient to the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Section 157 of article 75 of the Code, providing that no person shall be sued out of the county in which he resides until he has been returned non est on a summons issued therein, is qualified to the extent that \u201cany person who resides in one county but carries on any regular business, or habitually engages in any avocation or employment in another county, may be sued in either county, whether before a justice of the peace or in a court of law or equity * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The word \u201cavocation\u201d was not used in the motion for judgment of <em>non pros, </em>and its omission is urged by ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>pellant in support of the demurrer. Therefore, the narrow question presented by the demurrer is whether that word and the word \u201cemployment,\u201d as they appear in the statute, were used synonymously. If the words were so used, it is conceded that the court\u2019s action in overruling the demurrer was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">, In support of his contention that the word \u201cavocation\u201d was not so used, appellant relies, first, upon the fact that the words are used in the statute disjunctively. He also places reliance upon the literal meaning of the word \u201cavocation,\u201d signifying a calling away, and cites decisions from many other jurisdictions to support the contention that the word has an entirely different meaning from employment, and it must be admitted that some of the authorities to which he refers tend to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The words appear to have first been incorporated in the statute by virtue of chapter 456 of the Acts of 1888, since which time they have remained unchanged, and although the section in question has been considered by this court in many decisions, we are aware of none and are referred to none bearing directly upon the point in question. In many of our adjudicated cases, the motion included the word \u201cavocation,\u201d while in others it was omitted, yet in considering them the court apparently made no distinction between the two classes. An apt illustration of this is found in the very recent case of <em>Woodcock v. Woodcock, </em>169 Md. 40, 179 A. 826, where Judge Mitchell, speaking for this court, said (page 827) :</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u201cBriefly, the plea set forth the residence of the respective parties to the suit; alleged that the defendant had continuously resided in Wicomico County; that he had not engaged in any regular business or employment in Baltimore City; that the sheriff or coroner had not returned a \u2018non est\u2019 on a summons in said county against him; that he was not, therefore, subject to process in .any civil action in equity of the nature of the case against him, out of the county of his residence, and prayed that the return of the sheriff upon the writ of subpoena issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>from the Baltimore court against him be quashed, and that the original bill of complaint be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">See, also <em>Gemundt v. Shipley, </em>98 Md. 657, 57 A. 12; <em>Chappell v. Lacey, </em>77 Md. 172, 173, 26 A. 499; <em>Carter v. Reardon-Smith Line, </em>148 Md. 545, 129 A. 839; <em>National Bank v. Steele, </em>143 Md. 484, 122 A. 633; <em>Ginsberg, Pleading at Law in </em>Maryland, p. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">This to our minds is strongly indicative of the fact that, in dealing with the section, this court considered that the word \u201cavocation\u201d was used as a synonym for the word \u201cemployment.\u201d Moreover, from examples which lexicographers give of its use, the statement that in the nineteenth century it often signified \u201cemployment\u201d seems not unwarranted. See <em>Godwin, The Enquirer; Sydney Smith; Macaulay\u2019s Essay on Warren Hastings; Buckle\u2019s History of Civilization.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">This view also finds support in many of the earlier dictionaries, and those of modern times gives its variant meaning as \u201cvocation\u201d or \u201ccustomary employment.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; </em>1 <em>Century Dictionary, </em>1889, p. 396; 1 <em>Oxford Dictionary, </em>1880, p. 586; <em>Funk &amp; Wagnails\u2019 New Standard Dictionary; </em>1 <em>New Century Dictionary, </em>p. 92. See, also, 1 <em>Words and Phrases, </em>First Series, p. 654; 1 <em>Words and Phrases, </em>Third Series, p. 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">From these considerations, we are of the opinion that the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In view of this conclusion, the correctness of the court's action in granting the motion for judgment of <em>non pros. </em>becomes apparent, in view of the evidence to which we have previously made reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
