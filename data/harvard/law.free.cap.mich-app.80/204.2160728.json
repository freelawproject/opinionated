J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGq\">The Supreme Court vacated our earlier disposition of this case, 68 Mich App 337; 242 NW2d 574 (1976), and remanded the case back to this Court for reconsideration in light of <em>People v Atkins, </em>397 Mich 163; 243 NW2d 292 (1976). 399 Mich 834 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Defendant Mata was found guilty of delivery of heroin in violation of MCLA 335.341(l)(a); MSA 18.1070(41)(l)(a) on the testimony of a paid police informant. The issue which was before this Court in our earlier decision was whether the trial judge clearly erred in concluding that no promises of leniency were made to the witness for his testimony. We concluded that the trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The <em>Atkins </em>opinion dealt with three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\"(1) Whether reversal is required because the trial court did not <em>sua sponte </em>instruct the jury that the testimony of an addict-informer was to be received with care and caution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">\"(2) Whether the uncorroborated testimony of an addict-informer is insufficient as a matter of law to make a jury-submissible issue on defendant\u2019s guilt; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">\"(3) Whether the jury was misled by a failure to disclose the possibility of future favorable treatment for the addict-informer testifying against defendant.\u201d 397 Mich at 167.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">As to the first issue, the Court held that where the defendant\u2019s strategy was to put the witness \"on trial\u201d, there would be no error in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>give a special cautionary instruction. The record in the instant case discloses the following instruction and subsequent discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\"In weighing the testimony and determining the credibility of all the witnesses in the case, you should take into consideration the interest or lack of interest of each witness in the outcome of the case. You should take into consideration the manner in which the various witnesses have given their testimony upon the witness stand, the opportunity that they or any of them may have had for observation or knowledge of the subject matter about which they testified, their honesty, their memory, their capacity and understanding, probability or improbability of their statements, and their bias or prejudice, if any, as shown by the evidence in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">\"(In the absence of the jury, the following proceedings were had:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\"THE COURT: While the jury was still in the jury box and before it had retired to commence its deliberations, the Court called counsel for both sides to the bench and asked if there were any objections to the charge of the Court or any further requests for instructions which either counsel desired to present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\"At that time, the Court understood that counsel both stated that they had no further instructions and no objections to the charge as stated; is that correct, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\"MR. MARTIN <em>[defense attorney]: </em>That\u2019s correct, your Honor, on behalf of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The record discloses no request by the defendant for a special cautionary instruction. As in <em>Atkins, </em>the defense strategy in the instant case was to attack the credibility of the informant-witness. As in <em>Atkins, </em>we find no reversible error in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">As to the second <em>Atkins </em>issue, the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\"We hold that the credibility of an addict-informer, like that of an accomplice, is a jury question, and that the jury may convict on such testimony alone.\u201d 397 Mich at 172.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>As to the third <em>Atkins </em>issue, the Court stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\"However, it is one thing to require disclosure of facts (immunity or leniency) which the jury should weigh in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility. It is quite another to require 'disclosure\u2019 of future possibilities for the jury\u2019s speculation. Indeed, if a prosecutor were required to volunteer that, although there was no agreement, he intended to recommend some sort of consideration for a witness because the witness was testifying in this and other cases or had corrected his past misdeeds, could this not be viewed as vouching for that witness\u2019s credibility? The focus of required disclosure is not on factors which may motivate a prosecutor in dealing subsequently with a witness, but rather on facts which may motivate the witness in giving certain testimony. Of the latter, this jury was made well aware by means of the thorough and probing cross-examination by defense counsel.\u201d 397 Mich at 174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As in <em>Atkins, </em>there has been no showing of an actual undisclosed agreement or promise made by the prosecution to the witness for leniency or other reward. While it is clear that the paid informant-witness in the instant case had an expectation of consideration for his cooperation, we believe that the jury was made well aware of the facts motivating the witness through the thorough cross-examination and closing argument of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In his concurring opinion in <em>Atkins, </em>Justice Levin wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\"Although the record does not support a conclusion that there was an agreement, the probability is that there was a tacit understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\"I question the usefulness of a distinction between the 'disclosure of facts (immunity or leniency) which the jury should weigh in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>and ' \"disclosure\u201d of future possibilities for the jury\u2019s speculation\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\"A statement by an accomplice-informer witness that no promise has been made to him is misleading although no positive promise has been made if he has a reasonable expectation of leniency or other reward. The statement is not wholly true as it conceals the witness\u2019s expectations, expectations fostered by the practice of granting concessions to accomplice-informer witnesses. The apparent purpose of knowing concealment and a failure to correct the record is to mislead the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\"If there is an agreement with a prosecution witness, it must be disclosed to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\"If there is no agreement and charges of law violation have been or could be lodged against the witness or sentencing has been deferred, and in similar cases the prosecutor has refrained from prosecuting or has granted or sought charge reduction or leniency in sentencing for witnesses who assisted the prosecution, those facts and their significance should be fully disclosed and explained to the jury.\u201d 397 Mich at 177-183.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In <em>People v Crawl, </em>401 Mich 1; 257 NW2d 86 (1977), Justice Levin cites <em>Atkins </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\"Such disclosure should * * * be full and complete to avoid misleading the jury.\u201d 401 Mich at 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">At defendant Mata\u2019s trial, the jury was made aware that the paid informant witness had been able to avoid prosecution for past crimes, that the prosecutor\u2019s office had previously dismissed several criminal charges against the witness which involved a variety of crimes, that the witness was a paid informant, that the witness was presently facing several pending felony charges, that the witness was acquainted with some members of the prosecutor\u2019s staff, that the witness was \"not look<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing forward to going to prison\u201d, and that the witness had previously gone along with \"deals\u201d worked out between his attorney and the prosecutor. In his closing argument the defense attorney contended that the prosecution witness had committed perjury, that the witness \"is like a traveling minstrel, a traveling minstrel with a guitar or a \u2014 he sings a song and he gets a reward. Most of the time it\u2019s money. This time it\u2019s freedom from prison.\u201d In his rebuttal the prosecutor stated in part: \"We\u2019ve got the detectives. They watched him do it, Watched Tom [the paid informant witness]. We\u2019ve got Tom\u2019s testimony, nothing else. Tom is in jail today. He came over here \u2014 fortunately, they didn\u2019t leave his jail clothes on him. Cases are still going against him, B and E\u2019s, to be tried very soon.\u201d We believe that this record contains a full and fair disclosure of the \"facts which may motivate the witness\u201d in giving his testimony. We do not believe the jury was misled by the witness\u2019s denial that he expected some deals to be made in those pending cases. We therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-7\">V. J. Brennan, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b224-8\">M. J. Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\"><em>(concurring). </em>I concur in the result reached by the majority principally because I cannot conceive how to reasonably implement for trial courts the unworkable mandate of <em>People v Atkins, </em>397 Mich 163; 243 NW2d 292 (1976), which condemns itself out of its own text. High court decisions which arrive through a sometimes tortuous dialectic process at a pronouncement of new legal principles should not be cast on lower courts to apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Our decision in <em>Mata </em>was released April 5, 1976. The following July the Supreme Court decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>People v Atkins. </em>The issue in <em>Atkins </em>for which we are ordered to reconsider <em>Mata </em>is \"whether the jury was misled by a failure to disclose the possibility of future favorable treatment for the addict-informer testifying against defendant\u201d. 397 Mich at 167. The <em>Atkins </em>Court discusses the issue in the context of a Federal \"trend\u201d. Can there be any doubt that requiring a cautionary instruction on the basis of an informer\u2019s subjective expectations is innovative?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Although the Court set forth broad rules, it made no application of those rules in the case before it. The distinction between \"reasonable expectations\u201d and \"future possibilities\u201d is nebulous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the present case, one Thomas Cooper testified at trial that he did not receive any promises in exchange for his testimony or work as an informant, nor did he expect any deals. At the evidentiary hearing, held to determine if any <em>promises </em>of leniency had been given, the following exchange took place between Cooper and defense counsel on redirect examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\"Q Can you explain to me the difference of hoping the case would be favorably disposed of and having an expectation that the case would be disposed of favorably?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\"A Well, since I don\u2019t have a dictionary with me, I can\u2019t define the two words for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\"Q Okay. A few minutes ago you stated that at the time you stated in the Mata trial \u2014 at the time you testified under oath that you did not expect some deals to be made in the future in those cases, that that statement was not true. Now, in regards to Mr. Den-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ton\u2019s cross-examination, you\u2019re saying that at the time you made that statement, the statement was true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\"A The statement is true as it reads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\"Q It was true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\"A If you read the words, the statement is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\"Q Okay, let\u2019s try again. On direct examination you stated that at the time you testified in the Mata trial, that you did not expect any deals to be made in the future in your pending cases; that that statement was not true. Then on cross-examination, you stated, 'Oh, my testimony in the Mata case was true.\u2019 I\u2019m asking you again, on direct examination, at the time you testified in the Mata case that you did not expect any deal in the future, was that testimony true at the time or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\"A The statement is true as it reads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\"Q Was it true at the time that you made it in January 25 of 1974; was it true then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\"A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">\"Q So these assurances, these representations by the Vice Squad, the statement by Officer Newvine or Shobert that Brady Denton had said your cases wouldn\u2019t be disposed of until after you had testified in these cases, that didn\u2019t lead you to expect that there might be a deal in the future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">\"A There was no promise of any deal in the future, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">\"Q Did that lead you to expect that there might be a deal in the future? 'Everything is going to be stopped in your cases pending your testimony in these narcotics cases, and then we\u2019ll take care of you, Mr. Cooper.\u2019 That does not lead you to expect a deal in the future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">\"A No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">The difficulty is apparent from the above exchange. If there is a logical inference that a reasonable expectation of leniency has resulted from contact with the prosecutor, <em>Atkins </em>appears to require the prosecutor and the trial judge (if it comes to his attention) to disclose such fact to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Was the prosecutor required to disclose to the jury that Cooper had a \"reasonable expectation of leniency\u201d despite Cooper\u2019s testimony to the contrary? The majority opinion in <em>Atkins </em>does not require disclosure of \"future possibilities\u201d, but appears to require disclosure of \"reasonable expectations\u201d. At the evidentiary hearing, Cooper said that he hoped that he would receive leniency. If no promises of leniency had been made, is disclosure by the prosecutor of the witness\u2019s reasonable expectations possible?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">What is leniency? Is leniency a plea bargain? Is leniency a prosecutor\u2019s recommendation of probation or of a sentence in the county jail, a recommendation to the Michigan Training Unit, a specific recommendation for a minimum term of years? What is reasonable? Is it in the light of how the witness has been treated in the past? Is it reasonable to assume that charges being held in abeyance will be dropped? Reasonable to whom; to the prosecutor, to the witness, to the defense attorney, to the trial judge?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Should this play within a play unfold before the jury or should we add to the <em>Robinson </em>hearings, the <em>Tucker </em>hearings, the <em>Walker </em>hearings, the <em>Luck-Farrar </em>hearings, the <em>McCoy </em>hearings,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> etc., an <em>Atkins-Mata </em>hearing where the question of a witness\u2019s \"reasonable expectation of leniency\u201d can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>be thrashed out? Who determines, and when, if a false impression has been given? Does the prosecutor rise in the middle of the defense attorney\u2019s cross-examination and offer his unsworn impressions as an officer of the court? How does he discharge his \"affirmative duty\u201d to the jury? If there is a particular practice in a given county, is that to be shown to the jury? How? By testimony of \"expert\u201d defense and prosecution attorneys? By probation and parole officers? By clerks and written records?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">If I were called upon to implement an <em>AtkinsMata </em>rule of procedure, I would suggest the following and declare it to be prospective in application:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">1. If a prosecution witness, whether an informer, accomplice, addict, co-conspirator or other person having an existing motivation to bargain with the police or prosecutor concerning charge(s) or sentence pending against him,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> gives testimony implicating another, he is presumed to have testified with a reasonable expectation of some form of leniency. In such cases the court shall so instruct if, but only if, requested by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">2. If the prosecutor asserts that the witness has no reasonable expectation of leniency, the trial judge shall conduct a hearing in the absence of the jury wherein \"both sides should be given the opportunity to develop the record with respect to the fairness of such a proposed instruction\u201d, <em>Atkins, supra, </em>p 171, and the trial judge shall make an appropriate ruling thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Obviously if the above procedure had been applicable to the trial of Carlos Mata, counsel\u2019s acquies<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>cence in the trial court\u2019s instructions would require affirmance. To hold otherwise would impose an obligation of awareness on the part of the trial court that a Federal \"trend\u201d would later emerge to become Michigan precedent requiring the giving of an unrequested cautionary instruction \u2014 -an intolerable burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> The majority here mentions, but does not analyze, another <em>Atkins </em>imponderable \u2014 \"expectation of consideration\u201d. If we follow the direction in which Justice Levin is leading, consideration is apparently the key word. <em>See People v Crawl, </em>401 Mich 1, 34, 35; 257 NW2d 86 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Justice Levin <em>(concurring) </em>in <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 179 writes:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\"We all begin with the same premises.

He has the same duty of disclosure regarding reasonable expectations, as opposed to promises, of leniency or other rewards for testifying.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> <em>People v Robinson, </em>390 Mich 629; 213 NW2d 106 (1973), <em>People v Tucker, </em>19 Mich App 320; 172 NW2d 712 (1969), <em>aff'd, </em>385 Mich 594; 189 NW2d 290 (1971), <em>aff'd </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974), <em>People v Walker (On Rehearing), </em>374 Mich 331; 132 NW2d 87 (1965), <em>People v Farrar, </em>36 Mich App 294; 193 NW2d 363 (1971), <em>Luck v United States, </em>121 US App DC 151; 348 F2d 763 (1965), <em>People v McCoy, </em>392 Mich 231; 220 NW2d 456 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> This may not necessarily require that a warrant be issued on complaint or an information or indictment be pending and should be broadly construed by the trial court to include the investigative process if such process has evolved to a point where the witness has been focused upon as a potential defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
