The question of state law certified for our determination is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">Whether an insurance company has a duty to defend and/or indemnify its insured in an action alleging injury from exposure to lead paint where the insurance policy excludes coverage for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">bodily injury which results in any manner from the discharge, dispersal, release, or escape of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">a) vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic liquids or toxic gasses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">b) waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">The certified facts disclose that on September 14, 1990, the Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) issued a Deluxe Homeowners Policy to Reverend D. Paul Sullins and Patricia H. Sullins (Sullinses). Under the heading \u201cLosses We Do Not Cover,\u201d the policy contained the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">We do not cover bodily injury or property damage which results in any manner from the discharge, dispersal, release, or escape of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>a) vapors, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, toxic liquids or toxic gasses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">b) waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">On November 15, 1990, Allstate issued an endorsement to the policy adding liability coverage to the Sullinses\u2019 rental properties, including the property located at 30 South Fulton Avenue in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In July, 1993, Esther Ames, a tenant residing in the Sullinses\u2019 rental property and mother of Deonta Ames, filed a complaint against the Sullinses in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City; the complaint alleged that Deonta Ames, her infant child, sustained injuries from ingesting lead paint at the 30 South Fulton Avenue property. The Sixth Count of the Complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">3. ... the Defendant ... allowed said paint [containing lead pigment] to chip and flake thereby rendering the dwelling unsafe____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">4. ... the infant ingested and consumed paint containing lead and lead pigment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">5. That the injuries, illness and infirmities of the infant Plaintiff were due to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">a) The violation by the Defendant of ... City Code ... requiring every dwelling ... to be fit for human habitation and of the Rules ... prohibiting the use of paint for interior painting of any dwelling unit unless such paint is free from any lead pigment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">d) ... in failing to undertake suitable means to eradicate the aforesaid danger caused by the flaked condition of the paint____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-14\">7. That as a result thereof and of the ingestion and consumption by the infant Plaintiff, of the paint in the dwelling, the infant Plaintiff contracted and was caused to suffer lead poisoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">Allstate thereafter filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Plaintiffs in the <em>Ames </em>suit allege that due to the dispersal or release of toxic lead paint particles at the 30 S. Fulton Avenue property, Plaintiff Deonta Ames contracted lead poisoning____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">Because the facts alleged in the Complaint in the <em>Ames </em>suit establish indisputably that the alleged injury to Deonta Ames fell within an express exclusion in the policy, Allstate, as a matter of law, has no duty to provide a further defense to the Sullinses in the <em>Ames </em>suit, or to indemnify them for any judgment, settlement or other costs in that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In Maryland, insurance policies, like other contracts, are construed as a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions. <em>Cheney v. Bell National Life, </em>315 Md. 761, 766-67, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989). Words are given their \u201ccustomary, ordinary, and accepted meaning,\u201d unless there is an indication that the parties intended to use the words in a technical sense. <em>Id., see also Chantel Associates v. Mt. Vernon, </em>338 Md. 131, 142, 656 A.2d 779 (1995). \u201cA word\u2019s ordinary signification is tested by what meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb v. Utica Mutual, </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993). If the language in an insurance policy suggests more than one meaning to a reasonably prudent layperson, it is ambiguous. <em>Collier v. MD-Individual Practice, </em>327 Md. 1, 607 A.2d 537 (1992); <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas., </em>302 Md. 383, 488 A.2d 486 (1985). A term which is clear in one context may be ambiguous in another. <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 74, 517 A.2d 730 (1986); <em>Bentz v. Mutual Fire, </em>83 Md.App. 524, 537, 575 A.2d 795 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Where terms are ambiguous, extrinsic and parol evidence may be considered to ascertain the intentions of the parties. <em>Cheney, supra, </em>315 Md. at 766-67, 556 A.2d 1135. \u201cMaryland does not follow the rule, adopted in many jurisdictions, that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, \u201cif no extrinsic or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>parol evidence is introduced, or if the ambiguity remains after consideration of the extrinsic or parol evidence that is introduced, it will be construed against the insurer as the drafter of the instrument.\u201d <em>Id.; see also, e.g., Collier, supra, </em>327 Md. at 5-6, 607 A.2d 537; <em>Mut. Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. v. Vollmer, </em>306 Md. 243, 251, 508 A.2d 130 (1986); <em>St Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 193-96, 438 A.2d 282 (1981); <em>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 435, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980); <em>Aragona v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins., </em>281 Md. 371, 375, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Our cases hold that an insurer has a duty to defend its insured if there is a potentiality that the claim may be covered by the policy; that obligation is ordinarily determined by the allegations in the underlying tort action. If the plaintiff in the tort suit alleges a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend where the potentiality exists that the claim could be covered by the policy. In this regard, to determine whether there is a potentiality of coverage, we look to the policy, the complaint, and extrinsic evidence, if any is adduced. <em>See Aetna v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 108, 651 A.2d 859 (1995); <em>Chantel Associates, supra, </em>338 Md. at 141, 656 A.2d 779; <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 407-08, 347 A.2d 842 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The terms in the exclusion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201ccontaminants\u201d and \u201cpollutants,\u201d are susceptible of two interpretations by a reasonably prudent layperson. By one interpretation, these terms encompass lead paint; by another interpretation, they apply only to cases of environmental pollution or contamination, and not to products such as lead paint. Since no extrinsic evidence appears in the record at this time to clarify the intentions of the parties in using these terms, the policy must be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>against Allstate as the drafter of the policy. <em>Cheney, supra, </em>315 Md. at 766-67, 556 A.2d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">While lead is clearly \u201ctoxic,\u201d a reasonably prudent layperson may not view lead as a \u201cchemical.\u201d Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cchemical\u201d as \u201ca substance (as an acid, alkali, salt, synthetic organic compound) obtained by a chemical process, prepared for use in chemical manufacture, or used for producing a chemical effect.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>384 (1981) [hereinafter <em>\u201cWebster\u2019s </em>\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Similarly, a reasonably prudent layperson may not generally think of lead as an \u201cirritant.\u201d Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cirritant\u201d as \u201csomething that irritates or excites\u201d and \u201cirritated\u201d as \u201croughened, reddened, or inflamed.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1197. There is nothing before us to indicate that lead \u201cirritates\u201d or that it is generally considered an \u201cirritant.\u201d <em>Cf. A-1 Sandblasting &amp; Steamcleaning Co. v. Baiden, </em>53 Or.App. 890, 632 P.2d 1377 (1981), <em>aff'd, </em>293 Or. 17, 643 P.2d 1260 (1982) (paint in common understanding is not generally thought of as an irritant). <em>Contra, St. Leger v. American Fire and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>870 F.Supp. 641 (E.D.Pa.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">A reasonably prudent layperson may, however, consider lead to be a \u201ccontaminant.\u201d Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201ccontaminant\u201d as \u201csomething that contaminates\u201d and \u201ccontaminate\u201d as \u201cto soil, stain, corrupt, or infect by contact or association\u201d or \u201cmake inferior or impure by mixture.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 291. Thus, the term \u201ccontaminant\u201d may encompass lead. <em>See, e.g., U.S. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Bourbeau, </em>49 F.3d 786, 788 (1st Cir.1995); <em>St. Leger, supra, </em>870 F.Supp. at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Similarly, a reasonably prudent layperson may consider lead to be a \u201cpollutant.\u201d Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cpollutant\u201d as \u201csomething that pollutes\u201d and \u201cpollute\u201d as \u201cto make physically impure or unclean.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1756. The term \u201cpollutant\u201d may reasonably include lead paint. <em>See, e.g., U.S. Liab. Ins. Co., supra, </em>49 F.3d 786; <em>St. Leger, supra, </em>870 F.Supp. 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>A reasonably prudent layperson may also interpret the terms \u201ccontaminant\u201d and \u201cpollutant\u201d as <em>not </em>including lead paint. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed a lower court\u2019s holding that the term \u201cpollutant,\u201d was ambiguous as applied to a lead paint poisoning claim. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_h\">We conclude that an insured could reasonably have understood the provision at issue to exclude coverage for injury caused by certain forms of industrial pollution, but not coverage for injury allegedly caused by the presence of leaded materials in a private residence. There simply is no language in the exclusion provision from which to infer that the provision was drafted with a view toward limiting liability for lead paint-related injury. The definition of \u201cpollutant\u201d in the policy does not indicate that leaded materials fall within its scope. Rather, the terms used in the pollution exclusion, such as \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201cdispersal,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cescape,\u201d are terms of art in environmental law which generally are used with reference to damage or injury caused by improper disposal or containment of hazardous waste.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. McFadden, </em>413 Mass. 90, 595 N.E.2d 762, 764 (1992) [hereinafter <em>\u201cMcFadden </em>\u201d]. In <em>U.S. Liab. Ins. Co., supra, </em>49 F.3d 786, the court held that lead paint is unambiguously a \u201cpollutant\u201d where the paint, stripped from the outside of a building, contaminates the surrounding soil. Distinguishing <em>McFadden, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">Most importantly, <em>McFadden </em>was not an environmental pollution case. <em>McFadden </em>concerned personal injury caused by the <em>presence </em>of lead in a household. This case concerns injury to property caused by the alleged negligent <em>discharge </em>of lead paint onto property. The latter is a classic example of \u201cpollution\u201d\u2014the discharging of a harmful substance onto land\u2014while the former is most demonstrably not. An objectively reasonable person simply would not ascribe the word \u201cpollution\u201d to the presence of lead paint in a house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 789; <em>accord General Acc. Ins. Co. of America v. Idbar, </em>163 Misc.2d 809, 622 N.Y.S.2d 417, 419 (Sup.Ct.1994); <em>Genera</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>li-U.S. Branch v. Caribe Realty, </em>160 Misc.2d 1056, 612 N.Y.S.2d 296 (Sup.Ct.1994). Some courts have held that products, despite their toxic nature, are not \u201cpollutants\u201d or \u201ccontaminants\u201d when used intentionally and legally. The North Carolina Court of Appeals held that styrene resin used to resurface a floor was not a pollutant, but \u201ca raw material used ..! in [the] normal business activity of resurfacing floors.\u201d <em>West American Ins. v. Tufco Flooring, </em>104 N.C.App. 312, 409 S.E.2d 692, 698 (1991), <em>review denied, </em>332 N.C. 479, 420 S.E.2d 826 (1992); <em>cf. Hydro Systems, Inc. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>717 F.Supp. 700 (C.D.Cal.1989), <em>aff'd, </em>929 F.2d 472 (9th Cir.1991) (styrene discharged into atmosphere a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the pollution exclusion; not a \u201cproduct\u201d within \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion). Similarly, a federal district court held that 88% formic acid used to determine whether a carpet was suitable for dyeing was not a pollutant. <em>Regent Ins. Co. v. Holmes, </em>835 F.Supp. 579, 582 (D.Kan.1993); <em>see also Karroll v. Atomergic Chemetals Corp., </em>194 A.D.2d 715, 600 N.Y.S.2d 101 (App.Div.1993) (pollution exclusion clause does not apply to action by bulldozer operator accidentally sprayed with sulfuric acid); <em>cf. Sargent Constr. Co. v. State Auto Ins. Co., </em>23 F.3d 1324 (8th Cir.1994) (meaning of \u201cpollutant\u201d ambiguous with regard to muriatic acid used to prepare a concrete floor); <em>Demakos v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>205 A.D.2d 731, 613 N.Y.S.2d 709 (1994) (cigarette smoke which allegedly seeped into tenant\u2019s premises from pool and billiard club in basement was a \u201cpollutant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The court in <em>Pipefitters Welfare Educ. Fund v. Westchester Fire, </em>976 F.2d 1037 (7th Cir.1992), said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">The terms \u201cirritant\u201d and \u201ccontaminant,\u201d when viewed in isolation, are virtually boundless, for \u201cthere is virtually no substance or chemical in existence that would not irritate or damage some person or property.\u201d Without some limiting principle, the pollution exclusion clause would extend far beyond its intended scope, and lead to some absurd results. Take but two simple examples, reading the clause broadly would bar coverage for bodily injuries suffered by one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>slips and falls on the spilled contents of a bottle of Drano, and for bodily injury caused by an allergic reaction to chlorine in a public pool. Although Drano and chlorine are both irritants and contaminants that cause, under certain conditions, bodily injury or property damage, one would not ordinarily characterize these events as pollution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><em>Id. </em>(pollution exclusion bars coverage for tort suit alleging discharge of 80 gallons of oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls). <em>But see Crabtree v. Hayes-Dockside, Inc., </em>612 So.2d 249 (La.Ct.App.1992) (polyvinyl chloride dust, a plastic powder used to make pipes, leaked from bagging process into atmosphere causing personal and property injuries was an \u201cirritant or contaminant\u201d because it caused irritation and product label warned of possible irritation). Therefore, just as a reasonably prudent layperson might not consider Drano to be a \u201cpollutant\u201d or \u201ccontaminant,\u201d so might a reasonably prudent layperson not consider lead paint to be a \u201cpollutant\u201d or \u201ccontaminant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The history of the pollution exclusion supports this conclusion. Before 1966, standard general comprehensive liability policies covered damages \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d Because the courts\u2019 interpretations of this language were varied and overly broad, the insurance industry, in 1966, changed the language to \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d <em>See Bernhardt v. Hartford Fire Ins., </em>102 Md.App. 45, 51, 648 A.2d 1047 (1994). Again, the courts interpreted the language broadly, mandating coverage even for intentional discharges of pollutants in the course of ongoing business operations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>Morton Int'l, Inc. v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>134 N.J. 1, 629 A.2d 831, 850 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 2764, 129 L.Ed.2d 878 (1994), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">Foreseeing an impending increase in claims for environmentally-related losses, and cognizant of the broadened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>coverage for pollution damage provided by the occurrence-based, CGL policy, the insurance industry drafting organizations began in 1970 the process of drafting and securing regulatory approval for the standard [\u201csudden and accidental\u201d] pollution-exclusion clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><em>Id. </em>The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cThe insurer\u2019s primary concern was that the occurrence-based policies, drafted before large scale industrial pollution attracted wide public attention, seemed tailor-made to extend coverage to most pollution situations.\u201d Commentators attribute the insurance industry\u2019s increased concern about pollution claims to environmental catastrophes that occurred during the 1960s____ Other commentators observe that the insurance industry, concerned about public reaction to environmental pollution, desired to clarify and publicize its position that CGL policies did not indemnify knowing polluters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\"><em>Id.; see also </em>Joshua E. Rosenkranz, Note, <em>The Pollution Exclusion Clause Though the Looking Glass, </em>74 Geo.L.J. 1237, 1251 n._73 (1986). The \u201csudden and accidental\u201d pollution exclusion clause denied coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqn\">bodily injury arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release, or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids, or gasses, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water; but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release, or escape is sudden and accidental; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\"><em>Bernhardt, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 51-52, 648 A.2d 1047. The exclusion was intended to eliminate coverage for damages from pollution of the environment. <em>Molton, Allen &amp; Williams, Inc. v. St. Paul F. &amp; M. Ins., </em>347 So.2d 95, 99 (Ala.1977); <em>Thompson v. Temple, </em>580 So.2d 1133, 1134 (La.Ct.App.1991); <em>Continental Cas. v. Rapid-American, </em>80 N.Y.2d 640, 593 N.Y.S.2d 966, 609 N.E.2d 506, 512 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Once again, courts\u2019 interpretations of the language varied and, in 1985, the industry adopted the \u201cabsolute pollution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>exclusion\u201d which denied coverage for \u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, release, or escape of pollutants\u201d and defined \u201cpollutant\u201d as \u201cany solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalies, chemicals and waste.\u201d <em>Bernhardt, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 49, 52, 648 A.2d 1047. Since the terms \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release, or escape\u201d are environmental terms of art, the \u201cinto or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water\u201d language in the former exclusion was merely redundant. Thus, there is \u201cno indication that the change in the language was meant to expand the scope of the clause to non-environmental damage.\u201d <em>West American, supra, </em>409 S.E.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">That the industry\u2019s intention was to exclude only environmental pollution damage from coverage is further evidenced by the use of the words \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201cdispersal,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d \u201cescape,\u201d \u201ccontaminant,\u201d and \u201cpollutant.\u201d These are terms of art in environmental law, <em>Essex Ins. Go. v. Avondale Mills, Inc., </em>639 So.2d 1339, 1341 (Ala.1994); <em>McFadden, supra, </em>595 N.E.2d 762; <em>Continental Cas., supra, </em>593 N.Y.S.2d at 973, 609 N.E.2d at 513; <em>West American, supra, </em>409 S.E.2d at 699, and are used by Maryland courts to refer to environmental exposure. <em>Am.

That supports our conclusion that a reasonably prudent layperson may interpret the terms \u201cpollution\u201d and \u201ccontamination,\u201d in the circumstances of the case now before us, as <em>not </em>encompassing lead paint, a product used legally and intentionally. Since the terms \u201cpollution\u201d and \u201ccontamination\u201d suggest more than one meaning to a reasonably prudent layperson, they are ambiguous and must be construed against Allstate, the drafter of the policy. <em>E.g., Collier, supra, </em>327 Md. 1, 607 A.2d 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The federal district court\u2019s holding in <em>St. Leger, supra, </em>870 F.Supp. 641, that lead paint is unambiguously a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the pollution exclusion, conflicts with both <em>McFadden </em>and our holding here. The court in <em>St. Leger </em>relied on an unpublished opinion and federal statutes, neither of which is persuasive under Maryland law in determining the meaning of terms to a reasonably prudent layperson. Nevertheless, the conflict in judicial opinions regarding whether lead paint is a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the pollution exclusion remains.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Some courts hold that the existence of conflicting judicial interpretations of insurance policy terms is evidence of ambiguity, while others hold such conflict is not conclusive. <em>See generally </em>Charles C.

Stapp, Inc., </em>278 Ala. 209, 177 So.2d 102, 105 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The court in <em>Cohen </em>reasoned that where several appellate courts, construing the same policy language, denied coverage and several others granted coverage, the conflict in judicial opinion \u201citself creates the inescapable conclusion that the provision in issue is susceptible to more than one [reasonable] interpretation.\u201d <em>Cohen, supra, </em>432 A.2d at 599. The New York Court of Appeals noted, however, that \u201cIt is ... for this Court to say, as a matter of law, whether reasonable men may reasonably differ____\u201d <em>Breed, supra, </em>413 N.Y.S.2d at 356, 385 N.E.2d at 1283 (quoting <em>Hartigan v. Casualty Co. of Amer., </em>227 N.Y. 175, 124 N.E. 789, 790 (1919)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">Surely we would be abdicating our judicial role were we to decide such cases by the purely mechanical process of searching the nation\u2019s courts to ascertain if there are conflicting decisions. The law of Pennsylvania is that we must find an ambiguity only where the policy is <em>reasonably </em>susceptible of differing interpretations. Thus, whether other courts have reached varying conclusions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>meaning of a policy is only relevant where the various meanings ascribed are reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Lower Paxton Tp., supra, </em>557 A.2d at 400 n. 4; <em>see also Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies v. Ex-Cell-O Corp., </em>702 F.Supp. 1317, 1323 n. 7 (E.D.Mich.1988) (\u201cConflicting judicial interpretations may indeed be some evidence of ambiguity. But if the policies are unambiguous, conflicting judicial interpretations do not prevent [the court] from so finding.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We hold that conflicting interpretations of policy language in judicial opinions is not determinative of, but is a factor to be considered in determining the existence of ambiguity. In interpreting an insurance policy, we must follow the rules of contract construction set out in part II of this opinion. However, if other judges have held alternative interpretations of the same language to be reasonable, that certainly lends some credence to the proposition that the language is ambiguous and must be resolved against the drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We find that the pollution exclusion clause does not remove Allstate\u2019s duty to defend the Sullinses in the underlying lead paint poisoning action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the duty to indemnify, we find that if liability is established at the trial in the District Court, the pollution exclusion, of itself, on the present state of the record, would not insulate the insurer from indemnifying its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\n<em>QUESTION OF LAW ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">.
