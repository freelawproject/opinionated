Under that section, an injured claimant who has received an award of workers\u2019 compensation is entitled to request additional compensation if the modification of the award \u201cis applied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment.\u201d We issued our writ of certiorari to determine whether an award of a claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (hereinafter \u2018WCC\u201d) against his or her employer as a sanction for the employer\u2019s bringing frivolous proceedings constitutes compensation within the meaning of the above quoted provision of \u00a7 9-736. We shall hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Viola M. Stevens, the claimant, worked in the stock room at a Rite-Aid pharmacy. On March 12, 1981, a box came down a ramp in the stock room, and when Ms. Stevens attempted to stop it, she accidentally injured her neck, back and left shoulder. Those injuries, their extent, the necessary treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ment therefor, and the amount of workers\u2019 compensation for them, have all been subjects of the ensuing litigation. We set forth a chronology of that litigation:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">March 12, 1981 Ms. Stevens was injured on the job at Rite-Aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">April 9, 1981 The WCC ordered Rite-Aid and its insurer (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cRite-Aid\u201d) to pay temporary total disability payments of $74.00 per week beginning on March 15, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">February 4, 1982 The WCC ruled that Ms. Stevens was temporarily totally disabled from March 13, 1981 to April 15, 1981, and again from September 14, 1981, to December 12, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">May 13, 1982 Rite-Aid\u2019s motion for rehearing was granted, but the Commission reaffirmed its previous order.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">September 27, 1983 The WCC denied temporary total compensation to Ms. Stevens for various dates, but found that Ms. Stevens had sustained a permanent partial disability under \u201cother cases,\u201d amounting to 10% industrial loss of use of her body as a result of the injury to her neck and left shoulder on March 12, 1981; accordingly, the WCC ordered permanent partial compensation in the amount of $74.00 per week for a period of 50 weeks beginning December 13, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">August 29, 1985 Upon Ms. Stevens\u2019 request, and after a hearing, the WCC determined that her condition had worsened, and her disability, which previously had been a loss of use of her body of 10%, had increased to 16% loss of use. The WCC ordered the equivalent of 30 additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>weeks of compensation. Rite-Aid sought judicial review of this order [\u201cAppeal # 1\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">December 9, 1986 A jury trial of Appeal # 1 was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and consistent with the jury\u2019s findings, a new order was entered which determined that Ms. Stevens had sustained a 13% loss of use of her body and reduced the supplemental award to 15 additional weeks of compensation. The net result of Appeal # 1 was a reduction in the amount of compensation by $1,110.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">November 17, 1987 Another WCC hearing was held<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to determine if Ms. Stevens\u2019 need for a myelogram<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was causally related to her injury; to determine if Rite-Aid could deduct the $1,110 overpayment from the payment of medical expenses;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and to determine if attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded against Rite-Aid for a frivolous proceeding. The Commission found for Ms. Stevens on all three issues, and, pertinent to this appeal stated, \u201cthe ... employer and insurer are hereby assessed and shall pay to claimant\u2019s counsel ... an attorney fee in the amount of $150.00 and shall pay $125.00 costs unto this Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>pursuant to Section 57 of Article 101.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> [\u201cAttorney\u2019s Fees Award # 1\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">December 4, 1987 Rite-Aid sought judicial review of this decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City [\u201cAppeal #2\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">May 25, 1988 The WCC ordered Rite-Aid to pay for a cervical fusion for Ms. Stevens and to reimburse claimant\u2019s counsel \u201cfor cost to obtain medical records\u201d [\u201cAttorney\u2019s Fees Award #2\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">June 13, 1988 Rite-Aid sought judicial review of the May 25, 1988 order [\u201cAppeal # 3\u201d]. During the pendency of this appeal Rite-Aid refused to pay for the cervical fusion surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">October 4, 1988 The WCC found that Rite-Aid\u2019s refusal to pay for the cervical fusion was unreasonable and ordered Rite-Aid to pay for the surgery, plus a $350 fee to claimant\u2019s attorney [\u201cAttorney\u2019s Fees Award # 3\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">October 13, 1988 Rite-Aid voluntarily dismissed Appeal # 2, and filed an appeal from the October 4, 1988 order [\u201cAppeal #4\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">December 6, 1988 Ms. Stevens underwent the cervical fusion surgery. Rite-Aid did not pay for the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">February 7, 1989 Appeal # 3 was tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The WCC\u2019s order was affirmed, and Rite-Aid ordered to pay for the cervical fusion and the attorney\u2019s fees awarded on May 25, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">March 6, 1991 Rite-Aid voluntarily dismissed Appeal #4.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">October 18, 1991 Ms. Stevens filed issues with the WCC seeking additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">July 12, 1993 Rite-Aid pleaded the affirmative defense of limitations. The WCC found that Ms. Stevens\u2019 claim was not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>July 30, 1993 Rite-Aid\u2019s appeal of the July 12, 1993 ruling [\u201cAppeal # 5\u201d] was heard by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City which reversed the WCC and found the claim to be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">December 30, 1994 The Court of Special Appeals affirmed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">When Ms. Stevens sought to reopen her case before the WCC and to obtain additional workers\u2019 compensation on October 18,1991, approximately six years had passed since she had last received payments of either temporary total or permanent partial disability benefits. Thus, unless the awards of attorney\u2019s fees by the WCC on November 17,1987, and on October 4, 1988, or the award of costs on November 17, 1987, and on May 25, 1988, constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d as described in \u00a7 9-736, her claim for additional compensation benefits was untimely since it was not \u201capplied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment\u201d as required by \u00a7 9-736.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The WCC\u2019s orders of November 17, 1987, and October 4, 1988, were both expressly ordered under the provisions of Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u00a7 57. Costs; attorney\u2019s fees. If the Commission or the court before which any proceedings for compensation or concerning an award of compensation have been brought, under this article, determines that such proceedings have not been so brought upon reasonable ground, it shall assess the whole cost of the proceedings upon the party who has so brought them, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. No person shall charge or collect any compensation for legal services in connection with any claims arising under this article, or for services or treatment rendered or supplies furnished pursuant to \u00a7 37 of this article, unless the same be approved by the Commission. When so approved, such fee or claims shall become a lien upon the compensation awarded, but shall be paid therefrom only in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>fixed by the Commission. Upon application of any party in interest, the Commission shall have full power to hear and determine any and all questions which may arise concerning legal services rendered in connection with any claim under this article and may order any attorney or other person receiving the same, to refund to the person paying the same, any portion of any charge for legal services which the Commission may, in its discretion, deem excessive. Orders of the Commission regulating payments and refunds for legal services may be enforced in the courts of this State, or may be appealed from in like manner as awards for compensation under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In 1991, however, pursuant to the general code revision process, Art. 101, \u00a7 57 was split into two separate provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 9-731 and 9-734 of the new Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The first sentence of Art. 101, \u00a7 57 became \u00a7 9-734, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u00a7 9-734. Frivolous proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">If the Commission finds that a person has brought a proceeding under this title without any reasonable ground, the Commission shall assess against the person the whole cost of the proceeding, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The second and third sentences of the former \u00a7 57 are now codified at \u00a7 9-731:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u00a7 9-731. Fees for legal services, funeral expenses, and medical services, supplies, or treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">(1) Unless approved by the Commission, a person may not charge or collect a fee for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">(i) legal services in connection with a claim under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">(ii) medical services, supplies, or treatment provided under Subtitle 6, Part IX of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>(iii) funeral expenses under Subtitle 6, Part XIII of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">(2) When the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a fee shall be paid from an award of compensation only in the manner set by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Code Revisor\u2019s notes make clear that with one minor exception, the split of Art. 101, \u00a7 57 was not intended to have substantive effect on either of the resulting sections, \u00a7\u00a7 9-731 or 9-734.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Although both the November 17, 1987, and the October 4, 1988, orders were expressly entered under the authority of \u00a7 57, there was no express indication by the WCC of which sentence was intended to authorize the awards. The May 25, 1988, order contained no express statement that the award was predicated on \u00a7 57 or any other statutory provision. Therefore, we must infer from the circumstances, under which current statute the Commissioner would have intended to make the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The November 17, 1987, award was made specifically in response to Ms. Stevens\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a result of the frivolous proceeding. The award stated: \u201cthe ... employer and insurer are hereby assessed and shall pay to claimant\u2019s counsel ... an attorney fee in the amount of $150.00 and shall pay $125.00 costs unto this Commission, pursuant to Section 57 of Article 101.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The May 25, 1988, order was not explicit in its statutory basis, but the inference is clear from the transcript of the proceedings that the Commissioner intended to punish the employer and insurer for a proceeding brought in bad faith. The award was made solely to claimant\u2019s counsel as a result of his being forced unnecessarily to obtain medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The October 4, 1988, order awarded $350 directly to claimant\u2019s counsel specifically as attorney\u2019s fees due to Rite Aid\u2019s refusal to pay for Ms. Stevens\u2019 cervical fusion surgery despite the WCC\u2019s previous order that they should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It is clear from our review of the transcripts and orders of the WCC that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs were imposed as sanctions against the employer and insurer under what is now \u00a7 9-734 and not as fees for services rendered to Ms. Stevens.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Having determined that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded in this case were awarded exclusively as punishment for Rite-Aid\u2019s malfeasance, and in accordance with \u00a7 9-734, we must next determine if such an award is compensation within the meaning of \u00a7 9-736, the \u201creopening\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Our inquiry begins with an examination of the \u201creopening\u201d provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 9-736. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u00a7 9-736 Readjustment; continuing powers and jurisdiction; modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\"><em>(b) Continuing powers and jurisdiction; </em>modification.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">(1) The Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>(2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Commission may modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the last <em>compensation </em>payment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">This case requires us to determine the content of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d. We start in the definitions section of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 9-101, where the General Assembly has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u00a7 9-101. Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\"><em>(a) In </em>general.\u2014In this title the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\n<em>(e) Compensation.\u2014</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">(1) \u201cCompensation\u201d means the money payable under this title to a covered employee or the dependents of a covered employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">(2) \u201cCompensation\u201d includes funeral benefits payable under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Faced with a similar statutory definition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this Court in <em>Chanticleer Skyline Room, Inc. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 319</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>A.2d 802 (1974) found that the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d should be parsed into three separate inquiries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201c1. Is the payment ... a money allowance?<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">2. Is the payment provided for in the article?<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">3. Is it \u2018payable to an employee\u2019?\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuV\"><em>Chanticleer, </em>271 Md. at 698, 319 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In <em>Chanticleer, </em>the Court determined that all three questions could be answered affirmatively. Therefore, the Court held that the payment of attorney\u2019s fees ordered in that case was \u201ccompensation,\u201d and, as a result, the statute of limitations did not bar reopening the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In the instant case, the first two questions derived from <em>Chanticleer </em>are easily resolved. First, the attorney\u2019s fees in question are a payment of money, thus satisfying the first test. Second, the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs are authorized by law in this title in \u00a7 9-734, regarding frivolous proceedings. The only remaining question is whether the attorney\u2019s fees awarded in this case are \u201cpayable to an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\"><em>Chanticleer </em>is an important precedent for this case, not only for the insight it gives us in reading the definition in \u00a7 9-101(e), but also because it involved the question of whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees was' \u201cpayable to an employee\u201d and thus constituted \u201ccompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In <em>Chanticleer, </em>the claimant sought to reopen her claim in December of 1971. The last payment for her 30% permanent partial disability was made to her on February 23, 1966. Had that been all, her claim would have been time barred; however, the WCC had also directed that the claimant\u2019s attorney be allowed a $500 counsel fee to be paid \u201cfrom the closing weeks of compensation due the claimant,\u201d but not until a pending appeal had been decided. That payment of attorney\u2019s fees was made on June 15,1970. This Court was asked to decide if the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees was \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the reopening provision. Our predecessors determined that if an award of attorney\u2019s fees met the criteria of the second and third sentences of Art. 101, \u00a7 57, in that they were approved by the WCC, made a lien against compensation and were payable only as directed by the Commission, the fees would be deemed \u201cpayable to the employee,\u201d and thus would satisfy the third prong of the test for \u201ccompensation.\u201d Because the attorney\u2019s fees in <em>Chanticleer </em>were granted in accordance with the second and third sentences of Art. 101, \u00a7 57, now \u00a7 9-731, they were compensation and the reopening in December of 1971 was not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As we have determined above, in this case the attorney\u2019s fees and costs were awarded as a sanction against Rite-Aid for its frivolous proceedings before the WCC under \u00a7 9-734. The attorney\u2019s fees in this case do not fit the <em>Chanticleer </em>model as they are not owed by the claimant to her attorney, but rather they are to be received from the opposing party. The attorney\u2019s fees were specifically not to be paid from the compensation awarded and did not constitute a lien against Ms. Stevens\u2019 compensation. Instead, they were to be paid directly by Rite-Aid to claimant\u2019s counsel. It is absolutely clear that these attorney\u2019s fees and costs were not \u201cpayable to an employee\u201d and therefore, not compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The statutory scheme thus divides awards of attorney\u2019s fees into two classes: compensatory attorney\u2019s fees awarded under \u00a7 9-731 and attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>under \u00a7 9-734.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Chanticleer </em>determined that compensatory attorney\u2019s fees awarded under \u00a7 9-731 are also compensation as defined in \u00a7 9-736. We hold that attorney\u2019s fees awarded as a sanction under \u00a7 9-734 are <em>not </em>\u201ccompensation\u201d under \u00a7 9-736. The indirect benefit to Ms. Stevens of her counsel receiving an award of attorney\u2019s fees does not transform the award into compensation. We are compelled under the plain meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 9-736, 9-101(e), and 9-734 to hold for Rite-Aid in this matter. The general rule of liberal construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not applicable to the limitations provision of \u00a7 9-736. <em>Montgomery County v. McDonald, </em>317 Md. 466, 472, 564 A.2d 797, 800 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Because the attorney\u2019s fees awarded in this case are not \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-736, Ms. Stevens\u2019 motion to reopen her case is time barred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>JUDGEMENT AFFIRMED.

Section 9-731 is the general attorney\u2019s fees provision and it is intended to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">\"... prohibit the dissipation of an employee's compensation through the payment of excessive legal fees <em>out of the award </em>by giving the Commission the power to regulate when and how much remuneration an attorney who represents a claimant in [workers'] compensation litigation is to receive from the employee for legal services rendered to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-13\"><em>Chanticleer Skyline Room, Inc. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 699-700, 319 A.2d 802, 805 (1974) (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">. The reopening provision exists, typically, but not exclusively, <em>see Stevenson v. Hill, </em>170 Md. 676, 185 A. 551 (1936) (reopen provision may be used to introduce new evidence), for situations in which a claimant\u2019s condition degenerates, entitling the claimant to increased benefits. Maryland\u2019s reopening provision has been described as \"one of the widest reopening provisions in the country.\u201d Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>155 (2d ed. 1993). Judge Rodowsky\u2019s opinion for this Court in <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 154, 428 A.2d 447, 449-50 (1981), gives an excellent review of the history of \u00a7 9-736.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\">. The <em>Chanticleer </em>court was construing the definition of \"compensation\u201d found at Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 67(5), \"the money allowance payable to an employee or to his dependents as provided for in this article....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b626-12\">. Under the language applicable when <em>Chanticleer </em>was decided, this test was for \"money allowance.\" Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 67(5). The recent recodification has simplified this to \"money.\u201d \u00a7 9-101(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b626-13\">. The 1991 code revision changes this from \"article\" to \u201ctitle,\u201d but the meaning is still to constrict the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d to payments provided pursuant to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. \u00a7 9-101(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b626-14\">. There has been no relevant change in the requirement that compensation be payable to an employee. \u00a7 9-101(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. The Court of Special Appeals pointed out additional evidence that the legislature intended two classes of attorney\u2019s fees, compensatory and those awarded as a sanction, in the legislative history of yet another section of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Article, \u00a7 9-728. This section assesses penalties for late payments of an award of compensation. The original purpose clause of the bill provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\"For the purpose of requiring that a certain percentage of a workmen's compensation award be <em>given in addition to </em>the award if the award is not paid within a certain time. (Emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Prior to adoption this was changed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\"For the purpose of providing that a certain <em>penalty shall be paid </em>to a ... claimant, etc. (Emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Judge Getty, speaking for the Court of Special Appeals, opined, and we agree, that this clearly shows a legislative intent to distinguish penalties from compensation. <em>Stevens v. Rite-Aid Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 636, 643, 651 A.2d 397, 401 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
