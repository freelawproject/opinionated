The Montgomery County Association of Realtors form contract that the Flaxes signed included an addendum entitled \u201cNotice of Purchaser\u2019s Right to Property Condition Disclosure Statement or Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>claimer Statement.\u201d The addendum included language accurately quoting the requirements of \u00a7 10-702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">Purchaser is advised that under Maryland law (Real Property Article, \u00a7 10-702), he is entitled to receive from Seller a written residential property condition disclosure statement ... or a written residential property disclaimer statement---- Seller must deliver the completed disclosure or disclaimer statement to the Purchaser on or before the Purchaser\u2019s entering into a contract of sale____ <em>If the disclosure statement is delivered by the Seller later than three (3) days after the Seller enters into a contract of sale with the Purchaser, the contract is void. </em>A Purchaser who does not receive the disclosure statement on or before the execution of a contract by the Purchaser has the unconditional right, upon written notice to the Seller or Seller\u2019s agent, to rescind the contract of sale at any time before the receipt of the disclosure statement or within five (5) days following receipt of the disclosure statement and to the immediate return of any deposit. However, a Purchaser\u2019s right to rescind the contract terminates if not exercised before making a written application to a lender for a mortgage loan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">(emphasis added). The Flaxes did not provide, and the Romms did not request, a disclosure or disclaimer statement before signing the contract. The day after the parties executed the contract, the Romms\u2019 buyer-broker, Anita Tauber, delivered a blank disclosure statement to the Flaxes and requested that they complete the form. The Flaxes never provided the required disclosure or disclaimer statement and refused to allow inspection of the property, as required by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">On February 24, 1994 the Romms\u2019 attorney requested, in writing, that the Romms be allowed to inspect the property. The Flaxes\u2019 attorney responded, on March 4, 1994, that the Flaxes\u2019 failure to provide a disclosure or disclaimer statement rendered the contract void. On March 17, 1994, the Romms filed a complaint and a motion for summary judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking specific perfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>manee of the contract and money damages. The Flaxes answered that their failure to provide a disclosure or disclaimer statement rendered the contract void. A circuit court judge, on July 1,1994, denied the Romms\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Flaxes thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment which circuit court Judge Durke G. Thompson granted on December 12, 1994; he held that the failure of the Flaxes as sellers to provide the required disclosure or disclaimer statement rendered the contract void. The Romms appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before argument in that court, we granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\u201cIn construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). We start by examining the language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>We are not constrained, however, by the \u201cthe literal or usual meaning\u201d of the terms at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 517 A.2d 730. \u201cA dictionary is a starting point in the work of statutory construction, but not necessarily the end.\u201d <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 606, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990). \u201c[WJhere a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Tucker, supra, </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d 730. In construing statutory language, we seek to avoid results which are \u201cillogical,\u201d \u201cunreasonable,\u201d or \u201cinconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 516, 525 A.2d 628 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">At issue here is the meaning of the term \u201cvoid\u201d in the context of its usage in \u00a7 10-702(g)(l) of the Real Property Article. Section 10-702(b) and (e) require the seller of single family residential real property to complete and deliver to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>purchaser a disclosure or disclaimer statement on or before entering into a contract of sale. Section (g)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aana\">(g) <em>Ejfeet of failure to deliver a </em>statement.\u2014(1) If the disclosure statement is delivered later than 3 days after the vendor enters into a contract of sale with the purchaser, the contract is void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1981) defines \u201cvoid\u201d as \u201ca: of no legal force or effect\u201d and \u201cb: VOIDABLE.\u201d Since the term \u201cvoid\u201d is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning and is therefore ambiguous, we must examine it in the context of the entire statute to ascertain the legislative intent and to avoid an unreasonable result. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d 730; <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Brown, </em>334 Md. 650, 659, 640 A.2d 1142 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">What is now section 10-702 originated at the 1993 session of the General Assembly as House Bill 1210 and Senate Bill 707. The House Bill, as amended, was signed by the Governor and became effective on January 1, 1994, as ch. 640 of the Acts of 1993. According to its title, the bill was intended, in part, \u201cFOR the purpose of requiring a vendor of certain real property to deliver to a purchaser a certain disclosure statement or disclaimer statement,\u201d and \u201cFOR the purpose of ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>providing that a purchaser has a right to rescind a contract of sale of real property under certain circumstances.\u201d The bill, therefore, created rights of rescission in purchasers of real property, but not sellers. Section (g)(2) allows purchasers to rescind contracts at certain times; sections (f) and (g)(3) limit purchasers\u2019 rescission rights; and section (j) limits waiver of purchasers\u2019 rights. <em>See supra </em>note 1. There is no evidence of a legislative intent to grant sellers a right of rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The Flaxes\u2019 proposed interpretation of the statute conflicts with the clear legislative intent to require sellers to deliver a disclosure or disclaimer statement and to grant rescission rights to purchasers only. If \u201cvoid\u201d is read to mean \u201cof no legal force or effect,\u201d the statute would effectively grant sellers of real property a right of rescission and allow them to benefit from their failure to comply with the law. The Attorney General said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">[I]t is hard to see why a law intended to aid buyers would victimize the unwary buyer by giving a seller who entered a contract without delivering a statement the great advantage of three risk-free days to look around for a better offer; the seller could then deprive the buyer of the benefit of the bargain simply by doing nothing, if \u201cvoid\u201d were read literally-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">79 Op-Att\u2019y Gen.-, 6 n. 5 [Opinion No. 94-017 (March 11, 1994) ]. In other words, if \u201cvoid\u201d is read to mean \u201cof no legal force or effect,\u201d where a seller enters into a contract without providing the required statement, the seller may rescind the contract by refusing to deliver the statement for three days. Thus, to so read the term \u201cvoid\u201d literally is inconsistent with the legislative intent to grant rescission right to purchasers only.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Indeed, it would also transform real estate contracts, signed before delivery of a disclosure or disclaimer statement, into option contracts exercisable by sellers only. Provisions, such as the statute at issue here, which render contracts \u201cnull and void\u201d if some performance is not rendered, \u201cseldom mean[] what [they] appear[ ] to say. Generally, what is meant is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the duty of one of the parties shall be conditional on\u201d the other party\u2019s performance. <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 761 at 517-18 (1960). Here, the purchaser\u2019s duty to perform under the contract is conditioned on the seller\u2019s providing the required statement. If \u201cvoid\u201d is read to mean \u201cof no legal force or effect,\u201d \u201cthe contract would in effect be an option contract,\u201d the option being held by the seller. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf he concludes that the contract is not to his advantage, all that he needs to do is to withhold [the required statement]; whereupon the contract becomes \u2018null and void\u2019 and incapable of enforcement by either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Corbin continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">Accompanying factors, on which interpretation must always be largely dependent, will almost always show that the parties did not use \u201cnull and void\u201d with such a meaning. The provision is put in to limit the duty of the- [purchaser]; ... it is not to give a loophole of escape from the contract to the [seller]. It is meant that the [purchaser]\u2019s duty is conditional on the return performance, that if [the required statement] is not [prepared] he himself does not have to [perform].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\"><em>Id. </em>Since there is no evidence that the legislature intended to create a new class of option contracts, an interpretation of the term \u201cvoid\u201d to mean \u201cof no legal force or effect\u201d is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We have refused to interpret \u201cnull and void\u201d provisions of contracts literally where to do so would allow one party to frustrate enforcement of a contract by preventing a condition precedent. <em>Brewer v. Sowers, </em>118 Md. 681, 86 A. 228 (1912), concerned an option contract which provided that the agreement would become \u201cnull and void\u201d if the purchaser did not make payment by a certain date. The purchaser made several attempts to pay, but the seller avoided collecting. This Court, refusing to interpret the terms \u201cnull and void\u201d to mean \u201cof no legal force or effect,\u201d granted specific performance to the purchaser, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">To deny Sowers [buyer] relief under such circumstances on the ground that the balance of the purchase money was not actually paid by the time named in the agreement, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>not only be without precedent, but contrary to every principle of justice and equity which are supposed to control Courts of Equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 686, 86 A. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Again, in <em>Kimm v. Andrews, </em>270 Md. 601, 313 A.2d 466 (1974), we refused to read the terms \u201cnull and void\u201d literally where a seller failed to show the property boundaries to the purchasers as required by the contract. The seller\u2019s failure simply relieved the purchasers of their obligation to tender payment on the closing date, but did not bar the availability of specific performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Similarly, in <em>Twining v. National Mortgage Corp., </em>268 Md. 549, 302 A.2d 604 (1973), Mrs. Twinning, a mortgagor, argued that a mortgage contract was void because it was never delivered to National Mortgage, the mortgagee, as required by the contract. We disagreed and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">This provision obviously was intended as a shield for the protection of National Mortgage and not as a sword for the use of Mrs. Twining against National Mortgage. It would be an odd rule of law that would permit Mrs. Twining to avoid liability here because National Mortgage failed to insist upon performance of a provision obviously meant for its protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 555, 302 A.2d 604; <em>see also Stewart v. Griffith, </em>217 U.S. 323, 329, 30 S.Ct. 528, 54 L.Ed. 782 (1910) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018void\u2019 means voidable at the vendor\u2019s election____\u201d); <em>United States v. New York &amp; P.R.S.S. Co., </em>239 U.S. 88, 93, 36 S.Ct. 41, 60 L.Ed. 161 (1915) (\u201cEven when a statute in so many words declares a transaction void for want of certain forms, the party for whose protection the requirement is made often may waive it, \u201cvoid\u201d being held to mean only voidable at the party\u2019s choice.\u201d); <em>Archway Motors, Inc. v. Herman, </em>37 Md.App. 674, 687, 378 A.2d 720 (1977); 79 Op.Att\u2019y Gen., <em>supra; cf. Daugherty v. Kessler, </em>264 Md. 281, 285, 286 A.2d 95 (1972) (\u201cCourts have used the words \u2018void,\u2019 \u2018voidable,\u2019 \u2018invalid\u2019 and \u2018unenforceable\u2019 imprecisely, and when they say an oral contract is void, usually do not mean it except to a limited extent.\u201d); <em>Chapman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>v. Ford, </em>246 Md. 42, 52, 227 A.2d 26 (1967); 13 A.L.R. 4th 927 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Interpreting \u201cvoid\u201d to allow a seller to avoid a contract by refusing to comply with the law would be inconsistent with prior cases of this Court. We presume that the legislature is aware of our decisions, <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 152 n. 8, 626 A.2d 946 (1993), and construe enactments in derogation of the common law strictly. <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 335, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980). Since there is no clear evidence of a legislative intent to alter the common law, we conclude that the legislature did not intend for \u201cvoid\u201d to be interpreted literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">A literal interpretation of the term \u201cvoid\u201d would grant sellers a right of rescission, allow them to benefit from noncompliance with the duty to prepare a disclosure or disclaimer statement, create a new class of option contracts, and alter the common law. These results are unreasonable and inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intention in passing \u00a7 10-702. We, therefore, hold that the term \u201cvoid\u201d in Maryland Code \u00a7 10-702(g)(1) of the Real Property Article was intended to mean \u201cvoidable at the option of the purchaser\u201d and, thus, does not render a residential real estate contract void when the seller fails to deliver a disclosure or disclaimer statement as required by the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY WITH </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\n<em>DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE APPELLANT; COSTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT AND IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">.
