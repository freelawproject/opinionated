We hold that a temporary suspension of a driver\u2019s license under \u00a7 16-205.1 does not constitute \u201cpunishment\u201d under the law of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article provides for the temporary suspension of a driver\u2019s license if a driver who is under reasonable suspicion of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol either (a) refuses to take a breath or blood test to determine the alcohol concentration of his or her blood or (b) takes a test and has a blood alcohol concentration (\u201cBAC\u201d) of 0.10 or more. \u00a7 16-205.1(a), (b). If the driver refuses to take a test, his or her driver\u2019s license is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>suspended for 120 days for a first offense and one year for a subsequent offense. \u00a7 16-201.1(b)(l)(i)(2). If the driver takes the test and has a BAC above 0.10, his or her driver\u2019s license is suspended for 45 days for a first offense or 90 days for a subsequent offense. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(l). The driver may request an administrative hearing. \u00a7 16-205.1(f). At this hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) may modify the suspension or issue a restricted license if the driver did not refuse to take a test, has not had a license suspended under \u00a7 16-205.1 in the past five years, has not been convicted of driving while intoxicated in the past five years, and is required to drive in order to work or to attend an alcohol treatment program. \u00a7 16-205.1(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">On April 25, 1994, Ernest Jones, Jr. was arrested on the charge of driving while intoxicated. A breath test taken shortly after his arrest and with his consent determined that his BAC was 0.27. On August 31, 1994, an ALJ suspended Jones\u2019s license for 30 days pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1. The ALJ modified the maximum 45 day suspension after finding that Jones needed to drive for purposes of alcohol education and employment and because Jones had no prior convictions for driving while intoxicated. After considering that Jones previously had received probation before judgement twice for driving while intoxicated, the ALJ declined to issue Jones a permit restricted to work and alcohol education purposes and imposed a straight 30-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In a trial before the District Court sitting in Montgomery County on November 15, 1994, Jones was found guilty of driving while intoxicated. Jones appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, where he filed a motion to dismiss the prosecution contending that to prosecute him for driving while intoxicated after his driver\u2019s license had already been suspended for the same reason constituted double jeopardy. The circuit court (McKenna, J.) agreed and dismissed the prosecution against Jones. The State contends before us that the administrative suspension of Jones\u2019s license to drive does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>not bar a subsequent prosecution of Jones for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, \u201cnor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Its protection against double jeopardy applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794-96, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062-64, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). Specifically, it \u201cprotects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1897, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989). Since neither party contends that the administrative suspension of Jones\u2019s license constituted a \u201cprosecution,\u201d the imposition of criminal sanctions against Jones for driving while intoxicated violates the Double Jeopardy Clause only if it constitutes a second punishment. Of course, to be subjected to a second punishment requires the imposition of a first punishment. Therefore, prosecuting Jones for driving while intoxicated only puts him in jeopardy a second time if the suspension of Jones\u2019s license under \u00a7 16-205.1 constituted a \u201cpunishment\u201d within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Under our prior cases, \u00a7 16-205.1 was not understood as imposing \u201cpunishment.\u201d In those decisions, we focused on whether the proceeding was criminal or civil in nature. If civil in nature, the proceedings would not have implicated the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Andresen, </em>281 Md. 152, 155, 379 A.2d 159 (1965) (\u201cIn order for the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment ... to be applicable, it would be necessary for this to be a criminal proceeding.\u201d); <em>see In re John P., </em>311 Md. 700, 537 A.2d 263 (1988) (finding that proceedings resulting in loss of visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>rights or custody of child were civil in nature and were not double jeopardy); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>308 Md. 219, 223, 517 A.2d 1111 (1986) (holding that lawyer\u2019s double jeopardy claim was \u201cinapposite, because lawyer discipline proceedings are not criminal proceedings\u201d). Under this mode of analysis, \u00a7 16-205.1 would not constitute a \u201cpunishment\u201d within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Since 1989, however, the Supreme Court has revised its test for determining when \u201cpunishment\u201d is inflicted under the Double Jeopardy Clause. In the court below and in his brief to this Court, Jones argues that three recent Supreme Court decisions mandate the circuit court\u2019s finding that \u00a7 16-205.1 imposes \u201cpunishment.\u201d These cases are <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989), <em>Austin v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993), and <em>Department of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994). This appeal presents the first occasion where we directly address a Fifth Amendment double jeopardy challenge to a civil sanction since the Supreme Court decided <em>Kurth Ranch. </em>For this reason, and because both parties raise different contentions as to the mode of analysis used by the Supreme Court in these three cases, it is necessary to examine each of the cases in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In <em>Halper, </em>the Supreme Court held that a civil penalty imposed upon Halper as a result of his violation of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-3731, constituted \u201cpunishment\u201d to the extent that the penalty exceeded the government\u2019s loss and actual costs in enforcing the act. <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 447-52, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-04. Halper was convicted of 65 separate violations of the criminal false claims statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, each involving a demand for $12 in reimbursement for medical services worth only $3. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 109 S.Ct. at 1895-96. After Halper was incarcerated and fined under the criminal statute, the government sought to hold Halper additionally liable for a $2,000 civil penalty for each of the 65 violations. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 109 S.Ct. at 1896. In contrast to this $130,000 penalty, the government\u2019s direct loss was $585, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>its expenses in prosecuting and investigating Halper were estimated by the trial court at $16,000. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 452, 109 act at 1895-96, 1903-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The government first argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply because the proceedings were civil in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 446-47,109 S.Ct. at 1900-01. The Court found that \u201cthe labels \u2018criminal\u2019 and \u2018civil\u2019 are not of paramount importance,\u201d and \u201cthe determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The Court next dealt with the contention that the civil liability imposed on Halper was not punishment because its purpose was to provide a remedy for the government\u2019s costs of investigating and prosecuting false claims. <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02. Noting that \u201cpunishment serves the twin aims of retribution and deterrence,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901, the Court stated that \u201c \u2018[r]etribution and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 539 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1874 n. 20, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). Therefore, \u201ca civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court relied upon the \u201c \u2018tremendous disparity\u2019 between the Government\u2019s actual damages and the civil penalty authorized by the Act\u201d in holding that the $130,000 liability could not be fairly seen as solely remedial. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 109 S.Ct. at 1903-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The rule in <em>Halper, </em>however, does not require an exact balancing of a law\u2019s remedial purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 449,109 S.Ct. at 1902 (\u201cWe acknowledge that this inquiry will not be an exact pursuit.\u201d). The Court noted that \u201cthe process of affixing a sanction that compensates the Government for all its costs inevitably involves an element of rough justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The focus is upon whether the statute may be \u201cfairly\u201d said to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>remedial, <em>id. </em>at 448,109 S.Ct. at 1901-02, or whether the civil penalty bears a \u201crational relation\u201d to the government\u2019s remedial goal. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. Therefore, <em>Halper </em>announced \u201ca rule for the rare case,\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]he rule is one of reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although <em>Halper </em>specifically addressed the remedial and punitive nature of civil fines, its actual holding was phrased in more general terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">We therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In <em>Austin, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause should be applied to <em>in rem </em>civil forfeiture proceedings. <em>Austin, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2812. The Court determined that such procedures must comport with the requirements of the Eighth Amendment because they impose \u201cpunishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this finding, the Supreme Court used <em>Halper\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cpunishment\u201d under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define \u201cpunishment\u201d for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at -,---, 113 S.Ct. at 2806, 2811-12. The Court stated that \u201c[w]e need not exclude the possibility that a forfeiture serves remedial purposes to conclude that it is subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines Clause. We, however, must determine that [the forfeiture] can only be explained as serving in part to punish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2806.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">In determining the purposes served by civil forfeitures, the Court first looked at the historical uses of forfeitures, finding that \u201cforfeiture generally and statutory <em>in rem </em>forfeiture in particular historically have been understood, at least in part, as punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at--, 113 S.Ct. at 2810. The Court then turned to the specific forfeiture provisions at issue, and found \u201cnothing in these provisions or their legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>to contradict the historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In examining the provisions at issue, the Court specifically noted provisions in the forfeiture statute focusing on the culpability of the property owner, such as an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d defense and tying the forfeiture directly to the commission of a drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2810-11. The Court also used the legislative history to demonstrate that the civil forfeiture provisions were punitive in nature, and that Congress had passed them after finding that traditional sanctions were inadequate. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court rejected the government\u2019s argument that the sanctions were remedial, finding that the forfeited property was not itself dangerous and that there was no connection between the amount recovered via civil forfeiture and the government\u2019s costs in enforcing the drug laws. <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In finding that the civil forfeiture law constituted \u201cpunishment\u201d the Court re-stated <em>Halper\u2019s </em>holding that \u201c \u2018[a] civil sanction that cannot fairly be said <em>solely </em>to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to understand the term.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2812 (quoting <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02) (emphasis in Austin). Thus, \u201c[i]n light of the historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment, the clear focus of \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) on the culpability of the owner, and the evidence that Congress understood these provisions as serving to deter and to punish, we cannot conclude that forfeiture under [these provisions] serves solely a remedial purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the Court held that a \u201ctax\u201d on illegal drugs imposed after those drugs were seized by law enforcement and taxing the drugs at more than eight times their market value imposed \u201cpunishment\u201d under the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1948. In that case, six members of the Kurth family were arrested and convicted for cultivating marijuana on the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>farm. <em>Id. </em>at--, 114 S.Ct. at 1942. The family also settled a civil forfeiture action with the county attorney, agreeing to forfeit $18,016.93 in cash and equipment. <em>Id. </em>In a third proceeding, the Montana Department of Revenue sought to collect almost $900,000 in taxes on the confiscated marijuana, hash tar, and hash oil. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 1942-43. The Kurths filed a petition for bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy Court determined that Montana\u2019s Dangerous Drug Tax Act authorized an assessment of $181,000 against the Kurths, but that this assessment constituted double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014, 114 S.Ct. at 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The Supreme Court agreed that the drug tax was a second \u201cpunishment\u201d that was forbidden by the Double Jeopardy Clause. In finding that the tax was imposed as punishment, the Court noted that \u201cwhile a high tax rate and deterrent purpose lend support to the characterization of the drug tax as punishment, these features, in and of themselves, do not necessarily render the tax punitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1947. The Court rested its holding on two main conditions. First, the Court noted that \u201cthis so-called tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime. That condition is \u2018significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of revenue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Constantine, </em>296 U.S. 287, 295, 56 S.Ct. 223, 227, 80 L.Ed. 233 (1935)). Second, although the tax \u201cpurports to be a species of property tax ... it is levied on goods that the taxpayer neither owns nor possesses when the tax is imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1948. Based upon these factors, the Court found that \u201c[tjaken as a whole, this drug tax is a concoction of anomalies, too far-removed in crucial respects from a standard tax assessment to escape characterization as punishment for the purpose of Double Jeopardy analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The Court declined to find that the tax statute had a remedial purpose because \u201ctax statutes serve a purpose quite different from civil penalties, and <em>Halpef </em>s method of determining whether the exaction was remedial or punitive \u2018simply does not work in the case of a tax statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1950 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting)). In addition, Montana presented no claim that its assessment \u201ceven remotely approximates the cost of investigating, apprehending, and prosecuting the Kurths, or that it roughly relates to any actual damages that they caused the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The State and Jones raise conflicting contentions as to the proper application of <em>Halper, Austin, </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch. </em>The State argues that <em>Halper </em>provides the relevant test, that <em>Austin, </em>as an Eighth Amendment decision, is inapplicable to the instant case, and that <em>Kurth Ranch </em>is a narrow decision that is limited to tax cases. Consequently, the State argues that <em>Halper </em>applies, and \u00a7 16-205.1 is only \u201cpunishment\u201d if the defendant can demonstrate that it was imposed solely for punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Relying heavily on the opinions of those <em>dissenting </em>in <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>Jones argues that <em>Kurth Ranch </em>has dramatically expanded the reach of the double jeopardy clause. He also argues that <em>Kurth Ranch </em>applies here because the suspension is conditioned on the commission of a crime, because the legislature had punishment in mind when it passed the statute, and because the license suspension cannot be neatly divided between its possible punitive and remedial goals. Finally, Jones argues that \u00a7 16-205.1 does not further the remedial goal of removing unsafe drivers from the road. As a result, Jones argues that the suspension of his license cannot be justified solely as remedial, and that it can only be described as \u201cpunishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">In our opinion, neither party\u2019s contentions are entirely correct. <em>Halper, Austin, </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>are all relevant authority for the determination we must make. We note, however, that <em>Halper </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the two decisions dealing with the Double Jeopardy Clause, dealt with governmental overreaching on a scale which is simply not present in this case. The 30-day driver\u2019s license suspension to which Jones was subjected is in no way as severe as the $130,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>f\u00edne at issue in <em>Halper </em>or the drug \u201ctax\u201d imposed on illegal goods at eight times their \u201cmarket\u201d value at issue in <em>Kurth Ranch. Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 438, 109 S.Ct. at 1896; <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1942-43. Whatever its ills, \u00a7 16-205.1 obviously does not present an abuse of governmental authority of the magnitude presented in <em>Halper </em>or <em>Kurth Ranch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Although the severity of the sanction imposed by \u00a7 16-205.1 is one element in the balance that we must ultimately draw, the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d analysis goes beyond the severity of the imposed sanction. While <em>Halper, Austin, </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>do not provide a tidy formulaic approach through which a result may be obtained by simply plugging in relevant facts, they provide the means by which we must analyze the issue before us. Our analysis begins as mandated in <em>Halper: </em>\u201cthe determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve.\u201d <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02. <em>Halper </em>conducted this particularized assessment for civil fines, <em>Austin </em>conducted such an assessment for civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures, and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>conducted such an assessment for a \u201cdrug tax.\u201d Here, we must conduct a particularized assessment of the purposes served by a law suspending a driver\u2019s license when tests show that he had been driving with a BAC exceeding a statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">As an initial matter, the Supreme Court has made it clear that whether a sanction constitutes punishment is not to be determined from the defendant\u2019s perspective. <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 447 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1901 n. 7. \u201cOn the contrary, ... for the defendant even remedial sanctions carry the sting of punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In finding that the administrative license suspension was punishment, the circuit court below mentioned several times the extent to which a defendant\u2019s livelihood may depend upon driving or the importance of a driver\u2019s license to a defendant. While this may be true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and while a defendant surely feels the \u201csting of punishment\u201d upon the suspension of his or her license, we are here concerned with inquiring whether the statute serves the purposes of \u201cpunishment\u201d within the specialized meaning of the Fifth Amendment. And for those purposes, the defendant\u2019s personal viewpoint is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The central question before us is whether this application of \u00a7 16-205.1 can \u201cfairly\u201d be said only to serve a non-punitive purpose. <em>See Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1945, 1948; <em>Austin, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2812; <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02. After examining the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Halper, Austin, </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>we believe our own analysis appropriately proceeds along three axes. First, the statute at issue must be placed within historical context. We must examine prior uses of license suspension to determine whether they have been generally understood as punitive or non-punitive. Second, with this historical understanding in mind, we must turn to \u00a7 16-205.1 itself, and examine its language, structure, and, to some degree, the legislature\u2019s intent. As a result of this examination, we must determine whether \u00a7 16-205.1 evidences a purpose different from the historical understanding given to similar statutes. Finally, if \u00a7 16-205.1 serves both punitive and non-punitive purposes, we must determine whether the non-punitive purposes alone fairly justify the sanction imposed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">We turn first to the common understanding of license revocations and the purposes that they serve. <em>Austin </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>demonstrate the two different ways in which this historical analysis may frame our examination of the purposes served by \u00a7 16-205.1. In <em>Austin, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed <em>in rem </em>forfeitures under both English and American common law since the 18th Century to determine that forfeitures have historically been recognized as punishment. <em>Austin, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2806-10. Then, finding \u201cnothing in these provisions or their legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>history to contradict the historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment,\u201d the Court concluded that the provisions at issue could only be explained as serving, at least in part, a punitive purpose. <em>Id. </em>at-,-, 113 S.Ct. at 2810, 2813.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the Court approached the same question from the opposite direction. The Court first noted that taxes are typically designed to raise revenue rather than to serve punitive goals: \u201cWhereas fines, penalties, and forfeitures are readily characterized as sanctions, taxes are typically different because they are usually motivated by revenue-raising rather than punitive purposes.\u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at--, 114 S.Ct. at 1946. The Court then proceeded to delineate the differences between the \u201cdrug tax\u201d and typical, non-punitive taxes, and concluded that \u201c[t]aken as a whole, this drug tax is a concoction of anomalies, too far-removed in crucial respects from a standard tax assessment to escape characterization as punishment for the purpose of Double Jeopardy analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1948. Taken together, <em>Austin </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>demonstrate that \u00a7 16-205.1 should be presumed to serve the purposes generally served by license suspensions unless the section is different from other license suspensions in some way that negates this presumption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">We find that license suspensions generally serve remedial purposes. This conclusion is drawn from the purposes served by licensing systems themselves, <em>i.e. </em>to protect the public from unscrupulous or unskilled operators who would otherwise engage in the licensed activity. For example, Maryland requires a license before practicing any one of a wide range of professions in which there is potential to cause injury to consumers through negligence or malfeasance. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>McLCode (1989, 1995 Repl.) \u00a7\u00a7 2-801, 3-302, 4-301, 5-301, 6-301, 7-301, 9-301, 10-206, 11-401, 12-301, 13-301, 14-301, 15-301,16-301,17-301 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article. Similarly, a license or certificate of inspection must be procured before operating certain types of businesses. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1992, 1994 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 3-401, 7-301, 9-301, 12-201 of the Business Regulation Article (requiring inspection certificate or license to operate amusement attraction, collection agency, employment agency, or pawn shop).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To ensure a licensee\u2019s capability, a licensee must typically meet certain standards before obtaining a license, such as achieving a certain level of education or passing an examination. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 3-303 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article (requiring both education and examination before obtaining an architect\u2019s license). To ensure that the public is protected, licensing systems also typically require licensees to meet certain standards of conduct, and a license may typically be suspended or revoked when a licensee acts improperly. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 4-314(a) of the Business Occupations <em>&amp; </em>Professions Article (providing for denial of license to barber, reprimand of licensee, or suspension or revocation of license to barber if licensee uses license fraudulently, is incompetent, is habitually intoxicated, or fails to meet sanitary standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">From the licensee\u2019s perspective, it is certainly true that suspension or revocation of a license may feel like \u201cpunishment.\u201d A licensing system\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is to prevent unscrupulous or incompetent persons from engaging in the licensed activity. To this end, revocation or suspension of a license clearly prevents a wrongdoer from further engaging in the licensed activity, at least temporarily.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Both our own cases and those from other courts support this conclusion. For example, we have consistently found that disbarment proceedings against an attorney guilty of misconduct are not conducted to punish the attorney but to protect the public from attorneys who are not fit to practice. <em>See Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Sugarman, </em>273 Md. 306, 313-18, 329 A.2d 1 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 974, 95 S.Ct. 1397, 43 L.Ed.2d 654 (1975) (tracing history of this rule back to Lord Mansfield of the House of Lords); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 535, 325 A.2d 718 (1974) (agreeing that, in disbarment proceedings against attorney, \u201c\u2018the primary purpose is not to punish an offender; it is protect the public against members of the bar who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the relationship of the attorney and client\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>In re Pennica, </em>36 N.J. 401, 177 A.2d 721, 730 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Disciplinary proceedings for other professional licensees have been viewed in the same way. <em>See, e.g., Loui v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>78 Hawaii 21, 889 P.2d 705, 709-13 (1995) (finding that one-year revocation of license to practice medicine was designed to protect public from unfit physicians and was not punishment under Double Jeopardy Clause); <em>Schillerstrom v. State, </em>180 Ariz. 468, 885 P.2d 156, 158-59 (Ariz.App.1994) (finding that revocation of license to practice as chiropractor was not \u201cpunishment\u201d because purpose of revocation was to protect public and maintain standards in profession).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In addition, we have concluded that suspension of a driver\u2019s license in at least one circumstance serves remedial goals, although the Double Jeopardy Clause was not at issue in that case. In <em>Rentals Unlimited v. Administrator, </em>286 Md. 104, 405 A.2d 744 (1979), we found that a statute allowing the MVA to suspend the license and registration of any person against whom a foreign judgement has been rendered served</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the remedial purpose of protecting the public from the reckless operation of vehicles by financially irresponsible drivers by assuring that operators and owners of vehicles against whom judgements might be entered on account of negligent driving, are financially able to pay damages---To accomplish that purpose fully, the MVA must be authorized to suspend the license and registration of any financially irresponsible vehicle owner or driver....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 110, 405 A.2d 744. Other courts have similarly treated the suspension of a driver\u2019s license as a remedial measure. <em>See, e.g., Butler v. Dept. of Public Safety &amp; Corr., </em>609 So.2d 790, 796 (La.1992) (concluding that \u201ca driver\u2019s license suspension is a remedial measure which attempts to protect society from the hazards posed by drunk drivers by removing the driving privileges of those who have been convicted of driving while intoxicated\u201d). In general, therefore, we find that procedures through which licenses are suspended or revoked have a remedial purpose: that of preventing, at least temporarily, a wrongdoer from engaging in an activity when there is reason to believe that they may perform the activity unsafely.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">We next examine \u00a7 16-205.1 itself, to determine whether an administrative license suspension under this section demonstrates a purpose different from that served by license suspension proceedings in general. Jones raises four arguments based on the structure and legislative history of \u00a7 16-205.1 as to why this statute should be found to serve punitive purposes. First, Jones notes that the license suspension is conditioned upon the commission of a crime. Second, Jones notes that the statute provides no basis for concluding in every case that the driver is presently unsafe or that recidivism is likely. Third, Jones argues that the legislature intended \u00a7 16-205.1 to have a punitive effect when the section was passed. Finally, Jones argues that the maximum penalties imposed by \u00a7 16-205.1 are so high that the section must have a punitive purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">We find nothing in the language and structure of the statute itself to show that \u00a7 16-205.1 serves a purpose differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ent from any other license suspension. The fact that the sanction imposed by \u00a7 16-205.1 is conditioned upon committing acts which also constitute a crime does not provide evidence that it serves a punitive purpose. In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the fact that \u201cthis so-called tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime\u201d was significant in finding that the drug tax only served punitive goals. <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1947. However, this factor was significant because it differentiated the \u201cdrug tax\u201d both from \u201ctaxes with a pure revenue-raising purpose\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cmixed-motive taxes that governments impose both to deter a disfavored activity and to raise money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, since taxes are not typically imposed upon criminal activities, this factor provided evidence that the drug tax only served punitive purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In contrast, license suspensions or revocations are commonly predicated upon activities that are also illegal. <em>See, e.g., Sugarman, supra, </em>273 Md. at 313-18, 329 A.2d 1 (finding willful assistance in evasion of income taxes to be grounds for disbarment of attorney); <em>Frank, supra, </em>272 Md. at 535, 325 A.2d 718 (finding attempted bribery to be grounds for disbarment of attorney); <em>see also Loui, supra, </em>889 P.2d at 705 (finding kidnapping and attempted sexual abuse to be grounds for revocation of license to practice medicine); <em>Schillerstrom, supra, </em>180 Ariz. at 470-71, 885 P.2d at 158-59 (finding submission of false bills to be grounds for revocation of chiropractor\u2019s license). Since revocation or suspension of a license often occurs when the licensee acts in some way harmful to the public, it should not be surprising that the licensee\u2019s actions are sanctionable under the criminal justice system. This does not, however, mean that the license suspension seeks to \u201cpunish\u201d the offender. When facts supporting a criminal sanction also reveal that allowing a licensee to keep his or her license would endanger the public, revocation or suspension of a license is fully in accord with a remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Jones\u2019s second argument, that \u00a7 16-205.1 is punitive because there is no basis for finding that Jones is an unsafe driver, is also without merit. Jones relies heavily upon <em>Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Vehicle Admin. v. Mohler, </em>318 Md. 219, 567 A.2d 929 (1990), where we found that a single conviction for driving while intoxicated did not justify a finding that a driver was \u201cunsafe\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-206 of the Transportation Article. In that case, however, we also noted that \u201cthe statutory development shows that the legislature meant to attach distinct meanings to \u2018unsafe,\u2019 \u2018unfit,\u2019 and the two \u2018habitual categories\u2019 \u201d in \u00a7 16-206. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 567 A.2d 929. The question before us now is not whether Jones is an \u201cunsafe\u201d driver within the meaning intended by the legislature for \u00a7 16-206. Rather, the question before us is whether \u00a7 16-205.1 fairly serves the purpose of removing drunk drivers from Maryland\u2019s roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Nothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause requires that a statute operate with any specific degree of particularity. For double jeopardy purposes, an inquiry is made into the statute\u2019s <em>purpose, </em>not its breadth. If the class of individuals who fail or refuse to take breath or blood tests have an increased probability of driving while intoxicated, \u00a7 16-205.1 can fairly be said to serve the remedial purpose of maintaining safety on the public highways.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In finding that \u00a7 16-205.1 can fairly be said to serve this remedial purpose, we note that Jones was given probation before judgement for driving while intoxicated <em>twice </em>before he was stopped for driving while intoxicated in the instant case. As we see it, it is not unreasonable for the State to fear that drivers such as Jones may drive while intoxicated in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In contrast to Jones\u2019s characterization of \u00a7 16-205.1, we think that this section and its application contain features consistent with a remedial purpose. If the defendant requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>a hearing, the ALJ can in some circumstances modify the suspension period based upon the petitioner\u2019s need to drive for purposes of employment or alcohol treatment. The form used by the ALJ in making findings of fact at this hearing specifically notes that the ALJ must weigh \u201cthe adverse effect upon the petitioner\u2019s need to drive for employment or alcoholic prevention purposes versus the State\u2019s need to maintain safety on the public highways.\u201d Thus, the ALJ must specifically consider the remedial purpose behind \u00a7 16-205.1 in making the appropriate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The fact that the suspension period may only be modified for offenders who have suffered neither a license suspension nor a drunk driving conviction in the past five years is not indicative of a punitive purpose. One can equally view the availability of a modification period for such \u201cfirst offenders\u201d as an attempt to lessen the \u201csting of punishment\u201d for the group of drivers who the legislature thought would be least dangerous if allowed to continue driving. Similarly, elimination of this modification period for recidivists is consistent with the remedial goal of keeping the more dangerous drivers off the roads. The terms of \u00a7 16-205.1 provide no indication that it serves punitive, as opposed to remedial, purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">There is no merit to Jones\u2019s contention that the legislature\u2019s intent and the severity of the sanction imposed by \u00a7 16-205.1 demonstrate that this section only serves punitive, rather than remedial, purposes. We note that the Supreme Court in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>examined these factors, but only with a qualification: \u201cWe begin by noting that neither a high rate of taxation nor an obvious deterrent purpose automatically marks this tax a form of punishment.\u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1946. The Court, however, did note that \u201ca high tax rate and deterrent purpose lend support to the characterization of the drug tax as punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1947. In this case, these factors at best support an argument that \u00a7 16-205.1 furthers both punitive <em>and </em>remedial goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Jones argues that the changes made to \u00a7 16-205.1 in 1989 demonstrate that the legislature intended the section to have punitive effect. Jones particularly notes that the 1989 revisions to \u00a7 16-205.1 included providing for longer license suspensions and reducing the discretion of AL Js to modify the length of a suspension period. These changes, however, merely evidence a legislative intent to suspend more drivers who drive while intoxicated for longer periods of time. These features of \u00a7 16-205.1 do not indicate whether the suspensions were intended to punish the drivers or were intended to keep potentially dangerous drivers off the road for a longer period of time and with greater certainty. The changes cited by Jones are consistent with either a remedial or punitive purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">On the other hand, the State places undue reliance on previous statements from this Court about the purposes of the drunk driving laws. The State correctly notes that \u201c[w]e have consistently recognized that the statutory provisions enacted to enforce the State\u2019s fight against drunken driving ... were enacted for the protection of the public and not primarily for the protection of the accused.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 464, 597 A.2d 939 (1991). The \u201cprotection of the public,\u201d however, may be advanced through the imposition of either remedial <em>or </em>punitive sanctions. In addition, our previous statements about the general purposes of the drunk driving laws <em>in toto </em>are of little help in determining the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the specific provisions before us here. Our prior pronouncements on the general purposes of the drunk driving laws, therefore, are of little help.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Turning to the legislative history itself, we find that it demonstrates that both punitive and remedial purposes motivated the legislators in enacting the amendments that created \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s administrative per se license suspension provisions. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 561, 570, 622 A.2d 199 (1993), the Court of Special Appeals conducted the same examination of legislative intent that we conduct here, and determined that \u201cthe bill [enacting the current version of \u00a7 16-205.1] appears to have a two-pronged purpose\u2014first, to deter effectively those who would drive drunk, and second to reduce fatalities caused by those drunk drivers who drive while awaiting criminal adjudication.\u201d We find no reason to disagree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The administrative per se license suspension law was first proposed in 1988, after the General Assembly established a Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving because \u201c[t]he problem of drunk and drugged driving is of continuing concern to the citizens of the State of Maryland.\u201d Joint Resolution No. 15 of the Acts of 1988, <em>quoted in Shrader, supra, </em>324 Md. at 460, 597 A.2d 939. As we noted in <em>Shrader, </em>the goals with which this Task force was charged included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(1) Examining methods of increasing the effectiveness of the remedies currently available for combatting drunk and drugged driving;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(2) Examining remedies developed by other states and jurisdictions to deal with the problem of drunk and drugged drivers; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">(3) Recommending changes and additions to current laws and regulations dealing with drunk and drugged drivers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\"><em>Id., quoted in Shrader, supra, </em>324 Md. at 460, 597 A.2d 939. As an initial matter, we note the emphasis on \u201cremedies\u201d in the Task Force\u2019s goals, although we cannot give much weight to the use of the word \u201cremedy\u201d by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In an interim report issued in 1988, the Task Force recommended that an \u201cadministrative per se law\u201d be enacted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhK\">which would provide \u201cfor the prompt suspension of the driver\u2019s license of an individual who, upon being detained by a police officer on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or while intoxicated, either: 1) Refused to take a BAC [blood alcohol concentration] test; or 2) Submitted to the BAC test, and the results exceeded a statutorily defined limit.\u201d Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving, Interim Report to the General Assembly at 6 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>Shrader, supra, </em>324 Md. at 460, 597 A.2d 939. As Jones correctly notes, the Task Force\u2019s Interim Report to the General Assembly emphasizes that the administrative suspension law \u201cestablishes an administrative process and penalty that is separate and distinct from any criminal process and penalty,\u201d that \u201cthe administrative process generally provides a sure penalty,\u201d and that \u201cproponents claim that administrative per se is an effective deterrent to drunk driving.\u201d Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving, Interim Report to the General Assembly at 11-12. This language supports finding some punitive intent in proposing the administrative per se license suspension law, although we place no greater reliance on the use of the word \u201cpenalty\u201d here than we place on the use of the word \u201cremedy\u201d in the statement of the Task Force\u2019s goals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In <em>Shrader, </em>we outlined the steps taken by the General Assembly following the issuance of the Task Force\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvR\">In 1989, the General Assembly enacted the administrative per se law recommended by the Task Force, rewriting \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article to allow a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license to be promptly suspended for suspected drunken driving if the person refused a test for blood alcohol concentration. Ch. 284 of the Acts of 1989. The legislative history of Chapter 284 (House Bill 556) indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>that the General Assembly\u2019s desire for swift and certain action against drunk drivers was balanced with concern for the administrative needs of the MVA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><em>Shrader, supra, </em>324 Md. at 464, 597 A.2d 939. Jones notes that in hearings before the House Judiciary Committee on House Bill 556, some witnesses testified as to the deterrent effects of the administrative license suspension law. The Court of Special Appeals quoted some of this same testimony in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>95 Md.App. at 570, 622 A.2d 199, to support its conclusion that the administrative suspension law serves both remedial and punitive purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court of Special Appeals also quoted from a report on House Bill 556 prepared by the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office titled \u201cPositive Aspects of Administrative Per Se.\u201d This report noted the deterrent effect of the proposed law, but also noted that it could lead to a reduction in fatal crashes and other remedial results. This report discussed the remedial purposes served by the proposed law, noting that \u201c[sjpeedy [ajdministrative sanctions would help the offender to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the offense and the sanction that would otherwise be weakened by lengthy delays,\u201d that \u201cEi]t takes drunk drivers off the roads and it would save lives,\u201d and that \u201c[qjuick Administrative Hearings could identify an individual who may be a problem drinker and result in alcohol treatments sooner than the delays caused by the court trial.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>95 Md.App. at 569-70, 622 A.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Without ascribing overriding importance to any particular piece of legislative history, we conclude that it is most likely that the legislature had both remedial and punitive purposes in mind when it amended \u00a7 16-205.1 in 1989. In assessing the importance of these various indicia of legislative intent, we must not place too much emphasis upon the casual use of words such as \u201cpunish,\u201d \u201cdeter,\u201d or \u201cremedy.\u201d The Supreme Court has not treated the labels attached to a statute by the legislature as strong indicators of that statute\u2019s purpose. In <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the Court characterized its use of such labels as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>HaVper </em>thus decided that the legislature\u2019s description of a statute as civil does not foreclose the possibility that it has a punitive character. We also recognized in <em>Halper </em>that a so-called civil \u201cpenalty\u201d may be remedial in character if it merely reimburses the government for its actual costs arising from the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1945. As used in <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the purposes ascribed to a statute by the legislature are at best <em>evidence </em>of the purposes a statute may fairly be said to serve.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Our review of the legislative history of House Bill 556 leads us to conclude that two main goals motivated the legislature: the punitive goal of deterring future offenders and the remedial goal of removing suspected drunk drivers from the road. Therefore, although it is not possible to quantify how much weight should be given to the legislature\u2019s intent, it did generally intend that \u00a7 16-205.1 serve both remedial and punitive purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Finally, we disagree with Jones\u2019s contention that the sanctions imposed by \u00a7 16-205.1 are sufficiently severe that they provide evidence that it imposes punishment. While in <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the Supreme Court did use the severity of the sanction imposed by the \u201cdrug tax\u201d as evidence that the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>was punitive, it noted that \u201c[a] significant part of the assessment was more than eight times the drug\u2019s market value\u2014a remarkably high tax.\u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1946. Jones argues that \u201cthe license suspension penalty is devastating to many drivers.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While this may be true, we are unable to find either the 45-day or one-year maximum suspensions provided by the statute to be \u201cremarkably high.\u201d To the contrary, we agree with the Supreme Court of Ohio that the interests advanced in removing drunk drivers from the highways \u201care of such a nature and importance to society in general that the inconvenience occasioned by the temporary suspension of driving privileges pales by comparison.\u201d <em>City of Columbus v. Adams, </em>10 Ohio St.3d 57, 461 N.E.2d 887, 890 (Ohio 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Having determined (1) that license suspensions typically serve remedial purposes, (2) that \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s language and structure are consistent with the remedial purpose of removing-potentially dangerous drivers from the highways, and (3) that the legislature intended that \u00a7 16-205.1 serve both remedial and punitive purposes, we now consider whether the suspension of Jones\u2019s license can be justified solely by the remedial purposes served by the statute, or whether the suspension can only be explained if a portion of the license suspension is \u201cpunishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Jones argues that under <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>our inquiry must end with our finding that \u00a7 16-205.1 serves both punitive and remedial purposes because this finding mandates a conclusion that \u00a7 16-205.1 is \u201cpunishment\u201d for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. We disagree. In <em>Halper, </em>the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Court examined a statute that served both punitive and remedial goals and determined that if the remedial goals by themselves justified the sanction imposed, then the statute did not impose a \u201cpunishment\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy. <em>See Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02. In our opinion, <em>Kurth Ranch </em>and <em>Austin </em>have not altered the <em>Halper </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It is true that the Supreme Court did not apply the <em>Halper </em>test in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>and <em>Austin. </em>We believe that the <em>Halper </em>test was not used in these cases because no remedial justification was found sufficient to justify <em>any </em>application of the statutes at issue in those cases. In <em>Austin, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the government\u2019s arguments that the <em>in rem </em>forfeiture served remedial goals. <em>Austin, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 113 S.Ct. at 2811-12. The Court found that there was nothing criminal or dangerous in possessing the property that was seized, so the seizure removed no dangerous or illegal items from society. <em>Id. </em>In addition, there was no correlation between any penalty imposed under the statute and any damages incurred by the government or the cost of enforcing the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The Court\u2019s treatment of the non-punitive justifications for Montana\u2019s drug tax in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>was similar. The Court rejected the argument that the tax served revenue-raising purposes because it was \u201ctoo far-removed in crucial respects from a standard tax assessment to escape characterization as punishment.\u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1948. Montana never asserted that the drug tax served the remedial goals of recouping damages or the costs of investigation or prosecution. <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s treatment of the asserted non-punitive justifications given in <em>Austin </em>and <em>Kurth Ranch </em>leads us to conclude that in those cases, the asserted non-punitive purposes were not sufficient to justify <em>any </em>application of the statutes at issue. In contrast, we have found that \u00a7 16-205.1 serves the legitimate remedial purpose of removing potentially dangerous drivers from the Maryland highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Conducting the analysis laid out in <em>Halper, </em>we find that the remedial purpose of maintaining safety on the public highways amply justifies the maximum 45-day license suspension that \u00a7 16-205.1 may impose upon a driver who fails a blood or breath test. In reaching this conclusion, we note that the <em>Halper </em>analysis \u201cwill not be an exact pursuit\u201d and that determining whether a sanction is justified by its underlying remedial purpose \u201cinevitably involves an element of rough justice.\u201d <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 449, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. It is for this reason that the Supreme Court in <em>Halper </em>declined to perform an exact balancing of the asserted remedial and punitive purposes served by the statute in that case. The Court simply asked whether the statute may be \u201cfairly\u201d said to be remedial, <em>id. </em>at 448,109 S.Ct. at 1901-02, or whether the civil penalty bore a \u201crational relation\u201d to the government\u2019s remedial goal. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. It is also for this reason that the Court described <em>Halper </em>as \u201ca rule for the rare case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not find it unreasonable for the State to remove, for a 45-day period, the driver\u2019s license of someone who has failed a breath or blood test. The justification of keeping drunk drivers off the highways is sufficient to find a reasonable or \u201cfair\u201d connection between the remedial purpose and the length of the license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Finally, Jones argues that the question of whether the entire sanction is fairly justified solely by remedial purposes is a question of fact that must lie within the discretion of the trial court. In <em>Halper, </em>the Supreme Court left to the trial court \u201cthe discretion to determine on the basis of such an accounting [of the government\u2019s damages and costs] the size of the civil sanction the Government may receive without crossing the line between remedy and punishment.\u201d <em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 449, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. Such an approach, however, is not necessary here. <em>Halper </em>dealt with a potentially open-ended sanction and a remedial purpose resting upon underlying factual questions that will differ in each case: <em>i.e., </em>the expenditures and damages suffered by the government as a result of each false claim. <em>See id. </em>In contrast, \u00a7 16-205.1 provides upper limits to the suspension period and its remed\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>al justification is the State\u2019s interest in maintaining safety on the highways. This justification will not vary from case to case, as would a calculation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We find that no factual issue is presented for which we must remand or defer to the trial court. Because the maximum 45-day suspension that could have been imposed upon Jones can be justified solely by \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s remedial purposes, the ALJ could not have issued any sanction against Jones that would constitute \u201cpunishment\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. As a result, there was no factual finding for the trial court to make with respect to the remedial purposes justifying \u00a7 16-205.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Nor is Jones\u2019s prosecution for driving while intoxicated barred by Maryland\u2019s common-law prohibition against double jeopardy. It is true that under Maryland\u2019s common law a defendant cannot be \u201cput in jeopardy again for the same offense\u2014in jeopardy of being convicted of a crime for which he had been acquitted; in jeopardy of being twice convicted and punished for the same crime.\u201d <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 347, 577 A.2d 795 (1990); <em>see State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 489, 659 A.2d 876 (1995). We need not decide, however, whether Maryland\u2019s common law contains a double-punishment analysis similar to that used in <em>Halper, Kurth Ranch, </em>and <em>Austin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">It is unnecessary to decide that question at this time because Maryland\u2019s double jeopardy protection can be overridden by statute. \u201cThe rule against double jeopardy in Maryland is not established by the Constitution of the State but derives from the common law. The rule may be amended by the Legislature and a statute which is inconsistent with its common law scope and effect will prevail.\u201d <em>Ford v. State, </em>237 Md. 266, 269, 205 A.2d 809 (1965). Thus, if we accepted Jones\u2019s assertion that the legislature intended to punish him under \u00a7 16-205.1, we would be constrained to find that the statute overruled the common-law double jeopardy protection, if any, to the extent of \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>JUDGEMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. In <em>Halper, </em>the Court did not directly address the historical or general purposes served by civil fines. The Court, however, did review prior cases that found that civil fines serve remedial purposes. <em>See Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 442-46, 109 S.Ct. at 1897-1901 (reviewing, in particular, <em>Helvering v.

The revocation of a license may seem more obviously remedial than a license suspension, since, once a license is revoked, the unscrupulous operator is banned from the licensed activity indefinitely. A license suspension, on the other hand, only prevents the operator from engaging in the activity for a limited period of time. We do not believe, however, that the Constitution requires the legislature to impose the most severe sanction (and hence require the licensee to feel the sharp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>est \u201csting of punishment\u201d) before the legislature\u2019s actions can be justified as remedial in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. The sole issue before us is whether \u00a7 16-205.1 constitutes punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, we need not decide whether \u00a7 16-205.1 is overbroad under either the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, although we note that such a challenge is unlikely to succeed. <em>See, e.g., Illinois v. Batchelder, </em>463 U.S. 1112, 103 S.Ct. 3513, 77 L.Ed.2d 1267 (1983) (upholding Illinois's implied consent law against a due process challenge).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\">. The dual nature of such pronouncements is amply demonstrated by <em>Willis v.

As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>the Court \u201crecognized in <em>Halper </em>that a so-called civil \u2018penalty\u2019 may be remedial in character.\u201d <em>Kurth Ranch, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. In his concurrence to <em>Halper, </em>Justice Kennedy outlined the dangers that would result from relying too closely on the legislature to determine the purposes served by a particular statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">Today's holding, I would stress, constitutes an objective rule that is grounded in the nature of the sanction and the facts of the particular case. It does not authorize courts to undertake a broad inquiry into the subjective purposes that may be thought to lie behind a given judicial proceeding____ Such an inquiry would be amorphous and speculative, and would mire the courts in the quagmire of differentiating among the multiple purposes that underlie every proceeding, whether it be civil or criminal in name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\"><em>Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 453, 109 S.Ct. at 1904 (citations omitted). Although the use of legislative intent in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>makes it clear that we must give <em>some </em>weight to the legislature\u2019s ascribed purposes, we keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to determine what purposes the statute may <em>fairly </em>be said to serve, not simply the purposes that some legislators or commentators desired the statute to serve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b323-10\">. We only examine the maximum potential punishment insofar as it may be relevant in discerning the purposes served by the statute as a whole.
