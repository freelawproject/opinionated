A federal injunction to stay state criminal proceedings is an extraordinary remedy. Cf. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>City of Jeannette, </em>319 U. S. 157; <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U. S. 123. In addition to the considerations normally attending an application for such relief, a serious question of standing is presented on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>motion, in that it appears that the movants themselves are not being prosecuted in the Mississippi courts. On the record before us the motion for a stay injunction pending appeal is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-5\">Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Frankfurter concur in the denial of a stay solely on the ground that the three movants are not themselves being prosecuted or threatened with prosecutions in Mississippi and they therefore reach no other questions.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
