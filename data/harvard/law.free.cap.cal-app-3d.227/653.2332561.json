(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 211.) A special circumstance allegation that the murder occurred while Bolter was in the commission of a robbery was found to be true. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i).) In a separate nonjury trial, the lower court determined Bolter had suffered a prior serious felony conviction. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, 1192.7, subd. (c).) The court sentenced Bolter to 25 years to life for murder, plus 5 consecutive years for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">In an earlier unpublished opinion this court affirmed the judgment against Hikes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hikes, </em>Feb. 28, 1989, G007349.) Bolter seeks reversal of the judgment against him on the grounds of lack of jury unanimity in entering the verdict, jury misconduct, insufficiency of the evidence, denial of his motion for severance, instructional error, and prosecutorial misconduct. Alternatively, Bolter argues the punishment imposed is disproportionate to his culpability and his codefendant\u2019s sentence, and requests the conviction be reduced to second degree murder. We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Patricia Clayton was a prostitute and a drug user. Her circle of friends consisted largely of narcotics addicts who subsisted through a variety of criminal activities. The jury found two of these individuals killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The events surrounding the murder unfolded as follows: Bolter and Hikes were arrested February 24, 1987, after they ran from an Orange County sheriff\u2019s deputy who suspected they were about to rob a liquor store in a shopping center. When the deputy first spotted them, Bolter was driving a red Mazda RX-7; Hikes was his passenger. The deputy found Bolter in the rear of a soft drink delivery truck parked behind one of the stores. Hikes was discovered cowering beneath a bush on a muddy hillside behind the shopping center.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The deputies impounded the Mazda, which contained contraband, including drug paraphernalia. It was registered to Clayton, but had not been reported stolen. The vehicle did not appear to have been hot-wired. During trial, Bolter\u2019s attorney essentially conceded his client hid the keys in a store in the shopping center, but no evidence was ever offered to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Police contacted Clayton\u2019s parents because the registration gave their address. Mr. and Mrs. Clayton knew their daughter\u2019s love for the Mazda was one positive constant in her life. She took extremely good care of the automobile. While Clayton allowed others to drive it, she usually rode along with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Since their daughter\u2019s telephone had been disconnected, Mr. and Mrs. Clayton went to her apartment to see if something was amiss. When no one answered the door, the Claytons entered with their key. The darkened apartment was not tidy, but nothing appeared out of the ordinary until Mr. Clayton looked in a bedroom closet: There he found his daughter\u2019s bludgeoned body.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The prosecution presented evidence establishing the following facts: No one had broken into Clayton\u2019s apartment. Signs of a struggle were evident in a hallway leading to the bedroom, however. The bedroom door lock had been forced violently, and a trail of blood and matted carpet led from the hall to the bedroom closet. Blood spatters, nicks, and scuff marks were also present on the hallway walls. A throw rug covered a large bloodstain on the hallway carpet; bedding in the master bedroom concealed a bloodstain there. Small fragments of wood were scattered throughout the apartment, and several were removed from the victim\u2019s hair and gaping wounds in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>head. Apart from a great deal of blood, there was also a quantity of vomit in the closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The evidence suggested Clayton attempted to barricade herself in her bedroom but had been beaten in the hallway and dragged from there to the bedroom closet. Bloodstains suggested the body had to have been moved by two persons by picking it up at both ends. Clothes piled outside the closet indicated a space had been made on the floor for her. Blood spatters on the closet walls above her head, as well as indentations, suggested she was also beaten there. The most likely weapon was a piece of scrap construction firewood. It was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Clayton did not carry a purse. She generally dressed in men\u2019s clothing, carrying valuables in her pants pockets. Clayton\u2019s pockets were turned out. There was no cash, and her car keys were missing. Cocaine and morphine were in her system at the time of death, which a coroner\u2019s investigator estimated was early in the morning on February 23. Other evidence suggested the early evening of Sunday, February 22 might be more likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Blood spatters were found on the lower right leg of the jeans Hikes was wearing at the time of his arrest. The spatter pattern was consistent with that of the stains on the walls in Clayton\u2019s hallway. The blood in both locations was also consistent with Clayton\u2019s type, but it was not consistent with either Hikes\u2019s or Bolter\u2019s blood, with one exception. A larger bloodstain in the knee area of Hikes\u2019s Levis contained elements consistent with both his and the victim\u2019s blood and could not have been completely contributed by either of them. Stains consistent with the victim\u2019s blood were also found on a blue shirt left in a hamper at a house Bolter frequently shared with his girlfriend and her mother and brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">No fingerprints belonging to either defendant were found in the victim\u2019s apartment. There was some evidence that the scene had been wiped to eliminate prints.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">According to neighbors, Clayton arrived home during the afternoon of February 22 in a Cadillac with an older man. The evidence suggested he was a prostitution client. At that time Clayton\u2019s car was not in the driveway where she usually parked. The jury could have surmised it was parked near her usual stand on Harbor Boulevard in Anaheim or Garden Grove.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Clayton was next seen arriving home at approximately 4:30 p.m. the same day driving her own car and in the company of Hikes and Bolter. Other than by her killers, Clayton was never seen alive again.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Neighbors noticed the victim\u2019s car was gone several hours later, but heard no unusual sounds from her apartment. Although Clayton usually left the bathroom light on all night, it was not on the night of February 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Clayton had been in contact with Bolter for several weeks before her death. Bolter\u2019s girlfriend was Karen Tomka, Clayton\u2019s friend and a fellow drug user. In early February, Clayton and Tomka drove to Northern California to pick up Bolter upon his release from prison. Several days later, Tomka herself was incarcerated in Los Angeles. Bolter actively sought her release on bail. But he had no car and was short of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Clayton planned to drive Bolter to the jail on Saturday, February 21, but was unable to do so. Bolter spoke with Tomka by telephone on that date and, presumably, the following afternoon as well. A 20-minute collect call from Sybil Brand Institute was made to Tomka\u2019s parents\u2019 home while Bolter was there, approximately three hours before Bolter and Hikes were seen entering the apartment with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Before noon on Sunday, February 22, Hikes took his estranged wife\u2019s car keys. He returned them to police officers she summoned to assist her.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Bolter, presented a number of witnesses to his whereabouts on February 22 and February 23. A waitress at a restaurant saw Bolter on February 22 sometime between 4:30 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. He was alone. At 8 p.m. he arrived at the home of friends where he spent the night. On February 23 Bolter and Hikes visited an acquaintance in Perris. They arrived between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. and stayed until 11 p.m. At midnight they went to the same home where Bolter had spent the previous evening and they returned to Perris at approximately 3 a.m. on February 24. Those who saw Bolter on February 23 did not see Clayton\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Defense experts testified the blood on Hikes\u2019s trousers contained a higher concentration of morphine than the victim\u2019s autopsy blood. Defense counsel argued this indicated the spatters on Hikes\u2019s pants came from the victim\u2019s syringe during the process of clearing blood from the needle during or after an injection of narcotics. But there were several arguable flaws in the defense experts\u2019 results. A control sample from Hikes\u2019s jeans without a blood spot was lost when a container broke during testing, and only one blood spot was tested. Also, a prosecution criminalist using more sensitive equipment and multiple samples from the pants was unable to duplicate the defense finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">I. Unanimity of the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Without citing any supporting authority, Bolter contends the lower court erred by failing to adequately investigate an alleged attempt by one juror to recant her guilt phase verdict thereby rendering it less than unanimous. This contention is not supported by the record or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The facts relevant to the issue are as follows: during the trial\u2019s penalty phase the court received two notes from Juror Baker. The first note reflected Baker had \u201cdefinite concerns about this trial\u201d and the jury\u2019s prior \u201cdecision.\u201d Baker asked to speak with the judge or give him a \u201cmore detailed note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Upon inquiry outside the presence of the other jurors, Baker submitted the second note which said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping for is reassurance that we made the right decision concerning the robbery/special circumstance charges against Duke Bolter, [fl] We as the jury spent alot [sz'c] of time reading and re-reading the instructions provided by you during deliberations. I am having a very hard time staying convinced that we understood and applied the instructions correctly, [fl] I get very little sleep on the nights prior to reporting to court. Would it be at all possible to speak with you confidentially?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Because of Juror Baker\u2019s concerns, the court suggested and counsel agreed to settle the issues that were to be determined at the penalty phase. The prosecutor withdrew the request for the death penalty as to Hikes and moved to strike the special circumstance as to Bolter. The motion was granted. The court discharged the jurors, explaining, \u201c[w]hat happened was Miss Baker indicated to us that she . . . felt unsettled about her verdict, and it was understandable because of the peculiarity of the law regarding the difference between special circumstance robbery and murder and felony murder where there\u2019s a robbery and murder and then the taking of property thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">First, Bolter\u2019s argument that the communications from Juror Baker reflected misgivings about the first degree murder verdict, in addition to reservations concerning the felony murder special circumstance finding, is not well taken. There was never any question Baker\u2019s reservations concerned the finding on the special circumstance as to Bolter. During the proceedings involving Baker\u2019s notes, Bolter\u2019s counsel acknowledged he \u201cchose to argue guilt or innocence without explaining the law on special circumstances intent, and . . . that obviously was a mistake . . . because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>it\u2019s confusing law\u2014[the] difference between first degree felony murder and special circumstances . . . .\u201d Neither counsel nor the court felt Ms. Baker\u2019s communications warranted inquiry into her feelings about the verdict of guilt. Such determination was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Second, even assuming Baker did express misgivings about the jury\u2019s murder verdict against Bolter, the lower court lacked jurisdiction to reconvene the jury and direct them to continue their deliberations on guilt once the trial\u2019s penalty phase had begun.  \u201c \u2018Once a \u201ccomplete\u201d verdict has been rendered per [Penal Code] section 1164 [i.e., a verdict that has been received and read by the clerk, acknowledged by the jury, and recorded] and the jurors discharged, the trial court has no jurisdiction to reconvene the jury regardless of whether or not the jury is still under the court\u2019s control [citation]. However, if a complete verdict has not been rendered [citations] or if the verdict is otherwise irregular [citations], jurisdiction to reconvene the jury depends on whether the jury has left the court\u2019s control. If it has, there is no jurisdiction [citations]; if it hasn\u2019t, the jury may be reconvened [citations].\u201d\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 597 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350], quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 845, 855 [202 Cal.Rptr. 448]. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonillas </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 757, 770-771 [257 Cal.Rptr. 895, 771 P.2d 844].)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 584 expressed two reasons for this rule. \u201cFirst, in cases in which the jury renders a complete verdict, the rule is designed to protect the verdict as an operative fact. . . . \u2018 . . The office of a juror is discharged upon the acceptance of his verdict by the court.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] [ij] Second, <em>in all cases\u2014and therefore </em>fundamentally\u2014the rule is designed to guarantee a fair trial, controlled by the court and shielded from outside influences . . . . . Once freed, the jurors can properly discuss the case with the district attorney and the People\u2019s witnesses, they can read about it in the media and they can entertain \u201cfacts\u201d or opinions about it from any source <em>(Id. </em>at p. 597, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Here, the jury unquestionably returned a complete verdict at the end of the trial\u2019s guilt phase. When polled as to their verdicts and findings, all 12 jurors, including Baker, gave affirmative responses to inquiries about Bolter\u2019s guilt of murder in the first degree and the finding of true as to the special circumstance accompanying that charge. Accordingly, the clerk entered the verdicts and findings. The only irregularity in the verdict, if it can be called that, was Juror Baker\u2019s subsequent expression of misgivings. Assuming the verdict was irregular, the question posed is whether the trial judge still had jurisdiction to resubmit the issue of Bolter\u2019s guilt to the jury. The answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>In capital cases, as this one was until the prosecution withdrew its request for the death penalty against Hikes and requested the court strike Bolter\u2019s felony murder special circumstance, the jury remains within the court\u2019s control after the initial guilt phase is completed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668, 701 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonillas, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 773.) Accordingly, the court generally has jurisdiction to reconvene the jury to correct an incomplete or irregular verdict. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">But an exception to this rule exists where the court has already commenced the trial\u2019s penalty phase. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1959) 171 Cal.App.2d 362 [340 P.2d 679], the jury returned a verdict of guilty to a charge of murder, but failed to specify the degree as required by Penal Code section 1157. After the penalty phase commenced and evidence was introduced, the court requested the jury deliberate further on the degree of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In reducing the defendant\u2019s conviction to second degree murder, the Court of Appeal stated: \u201cWhen during the trial of the issue of penalty the court endeavored to \u2018correct\u2019 the verdict on \u2018guilt\u2019 what was done was, in point of fact, a resubmission to the jury of the issue of degree. In a very essential way this was a retrial of the issue of guilt in violation of the specific provision of [former] Penal Code, section 190.1, that, \u2018the issue of guilt shall not be retried by such jury.\u2019 Furthermore, it was a retrial of the issue of guilt after the jury had heard much evidence, inadmissible on that issue, and damaging to appellant . . . .\u201d (171 Cal.App.2d at pp. 369-370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonillas, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 757, the Supreme Court reviewed <em>Hughes, </em>criticizing the opinion\u2019s reference to the jury\u2019s \u201c \u2018release\u2019 \u201d after returning a \u201ccomplete\u201d verdict at the end of the trial\u2019s guilt phase. Nonetheless, <em>Bonillas </em>approved the decision\u2019s holding. \u201cOn the specific facts of the case, i.e., that the penalty phase trial had commenced and evidence admissible only at the penalty phase had been introduced, the court\u2019s statement was correct in substance. The guilt phase verdict was required to be treated as complete and the guilt portion of the trial ended when the jury began considering the penalty phase evidence, inadmissible at the guilt phase.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 774.) In <em>Bonillas, </em>the Supreme Court concluded the procedural events in <em>Hughes </em>compelled the same result as when a jury is discharged: \u201cIt was, rather, the commencement of the penalty phase trial and the receipt of penalty phase evidence which had the <em>same effect </em>as a discharge: the \u2018incalculable and irreversible\u2019, effect of exposing the jury to improper influences. Thus, the guilt phase ended when the penalty phase commenced, and it was thereafter too late to permit the jury to complete its guilt phase verdict.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 774.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Here, after the trial\u2019s penalty phase began the lower court lost its ability to shield the jury from improper influences relating to the issue of guilt. The penalty phase included the introduction of evidence on Bolter\u2019s earlier commission of an armed robbery and character witnesses. While, unlike <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 362, the statutes covering capital cases no longer provide the \u201cissue of guilt shall not be retried\u201d (former Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.1), that is not controlling. The objectives of each phase, including the issues and evidence to be considered, are still different. .  For example, while the jury is instructed at the guilt phase it \u201cmust not be influenced by mere . . . sympathy\u201d (CALJIC No. 1.00), the use of that instruction during the penalty phase could be error under certain circumstances. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1247, 1256 [248 Cal.Rptr. 817, 756 P.2d 204]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 777 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Therefore, we reject Bolter\u2019s claim the lower court erred by failing to further investigate juror Baker\u2019s misgivings concerning her verdict on the trial\u2019s guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">II.- VIL<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Sonenshine, Acting P.
