J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJe\">Charged with the attempted murder of Cong Phan, defendant Tien Minh Vu appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 192, subd. (a), 664<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2). Accompanying firearm use (\u00a7 12022.5) and great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7) allegations were found to be true. Defendant makes various contentions of instructional, evidentiary and sentencing error. We generally reject his arguments or, if error, conclude it was not prejudicial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The events in this case arise out of the somewhat volatile relationship between defendant, his girlfriend Hang Nguyen and Nguyen\u2019s husband, Hai Vu (no relationship to the defendant).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beginning in early 1988, Nguyen began moving back and forth between her husband\u2019s home and defendant\u2019s apartment. The arrangement was not amicable. There was an altercation between defendant and Vu at a Vietnamese market in late June followed by various threats, counterthreats and perceived threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">On July 20, Vu asked the eventual victim, Cong Phan, to accompany him to defendant\u2019s apartment to pick up Nguyen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Vu, he had arranged with defendant to pick up Nguyen at that time. According to defendant and Nguyen, Vu\u2019s arrival was unexpected. Nguyen did not want to go with Vu but agreed to do so in order to avoid a confrontation. She told defendant to come over to Vu\u2019s apartment later.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">After about 15 minutes, defendant went to Vu\u2019s apartment armed with a handgun. When defendant knocked and announced himself, Vu was fearful of a fight and refused to answer the door. Defendant saw Cong Phan talking with friends outside a neighboring apartment and told him to tell Vu to let him in. Phan replied it was defendant\u2019s business, not his. Defendant then asked Phan to accompany him to the alley adjacent to the apartment building so they could talk. As the two men entered the alley, defendant turned, pulled the handgun from his pants pocket and fired a single shot which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>struck Phan in the neck.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At about the time he was shot, Phan heard defendant say, \u201cDon\u2019t oppose me\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t approach me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Defendant was arrested a short time later. The .25-caliber pistol used to shoot Phan was found nearby. He admitted the shooting but said it was in self-defense. At trial, he claimed to have heard someone call out to \u201cTake a gun and grenade out\u201d as he stood at the door to Vu\u2019s apartment. Fearing violence, he started to leave the apartment building. Defendant denied asking Phan to come to the alley to talk with him. He asserted instead that Phan followed him into the alley along with another man. Defendant told Phan, \u201cDon\u2019t approach me.\u201d He again heard someone refer to \u201ctak[ing] a gun out.\u201d Fearing he would be shot, he turned and shot Cong Phan.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The defense sought to introduce the testimony of a psychologist, Dr. Faye Girsch. Girsch proposed to testify in general terms about the effects of stress and expectancy on perception. Although Girsch was not prepared to offer an opinion on the facts of this case, her testimony was designed to show that defendant\u2019s actual perception of events may have differed from reality due to stress and preconceived expectations about what might happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The court ruled the testimony inadmissible. It first noted that \u201c[t]he phenomena of stress, perception and expectancy and those matters or studies relied on to give opinions in that area do not appear to the court to be sufficiently reliable or valid to permit such expert testimony.\u201d The court also questioned Dr. Girsch\u2019s credentials because she was basing her testimony on her reading about the work of others rather than her own independent research. Finally, the court suggested there was no prejudice to the defendant because counsel could argue the same factors Girsch was going to present in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Defendant relies principally on <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 351 [208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709, 46 A.L.R.4th 1011] in support of his contention that the testimony should have been admitted. In <em>McDonald, </em>the Supreme Court approved the admission of expert testimony to educate the jury on psychological factors which affect eyewitness identification. The effect of stress and expectations on perception was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>among the factors about which the expert proposed to testify. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusions in <em>McDonald, </em>we cannot agree with the first reason offered by the trial court to support the exclusion of Dr. Girsch\u2019s testimony. If experts can testify about the effects of expectations and stress on a witness\u2019s perception for the purpose of showing that an identification may have been mistaken, similar testimony is also admissible to show the perceptions of a defendant claiming self-defense may also have been affected by expectations and stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>McDonald </em>also casts doubt on the second reason offered by the trial court. The Supreme Court noted that the expert\u2019s testimony in that case \u201cwould have related primarily to matters of fact: the <em>contents </em>of eyewitness identification studies reported in the professional literature . . . .\u201d (37 Cal.3d at p. 366, italics in original.) This is precisely the sort of testimony Dr. Girsch was attempting to provide. While it is true the expert in <em>McDonald </em>had done some experimental research on the subject himself <em>(id. </em>at p. 361), his testimony was not limited to his personal studies.  Where an expert seeks to provide factual testimony\u2014as distinguished from opinion testimony\u2014the primary measure of his or her qualifications should be the ability to understand the factual material and interpret it for the jury. Where an expert is asked to interpret studies or research in a particular field, it is not necessary that the expert has personally conducted similar studies or research.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The trial court\u2019s suggestion that the exclusion of the evidence would not prejudice defendant was presumably meant to indicate that counsel was free to argue to the jury the possible effects of stress and expectancy. While this may be true, a lawyer\u2019s argument standing alone is not an adequate substitute for a similar argument based on factual testimony by an established expert explaining to the jury the results of professional research. It is that testimony which would allow counsel to make a forceful argument applying the testimony to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We therefore conclude Dr. Girsch\u2019s testimony was admissible in this case. It was relevant, principally, because defendant claimed he honestly believed Cong Phan was trying to hurt him. The research Dr. Girsch sought to refer to would have supported defendant\u2019s argument that stress and expectations caused him to honestly perceive a threat where no threat was intended or apparent to others at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Here, however, the jury found the defendant guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter, rejecting a charge of attempted murder. Relying on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>theory of imperfect self-defense (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]), they necessarily accepted defendant\u2019s testimony that he believed himself threatened, but concluded such belief was not objectively reasonable. Thus, while we believe the court erred in excluding the evidence, the jury\u2019s verdict convinces us that the error did not prejudice defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Defendant suggests Dr. Girsch\u2019s testimony also supported his argument that he <em>reasonably </em>believed he was in danger. He asserts the excluded evidence would have shown\u2014or at least supported an argument\u2014that reasonable people with prior expectations and subject to stress make reasonable mistakes. Even if defendant were correct, however, we do not think it is reasonably probable admission of the testimony would have affected the verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) This is not a case in which the defendant saw the victim do something which he misinterpreted as a threatening move. Defendant came to Hai Vu\u2019s apartment armed with a handgun. The victim, Cong Phan, and an independent witness testified that defendant told Phan to meet him in the alley. Defendant\u2019s contrary testimony was impeached by his prior inconsistent statement to police. While historical events may have caused defendant to perceive Cong Phan as a threat, we think it is highly unlikely that the jury would have found such a belief to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Work, J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> Because of the identical last names, we depart from our usual practice and refer to Tien Minh Vu throughout this opinion as \u201cdefendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-12\">There was some evidence to indicate Vu and Phan had been drinking before arriving at defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> A doctor testified based on the entrance and exit wounds that Phan must have been falling or trying to get away from defendant at the time he was shot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 810.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
