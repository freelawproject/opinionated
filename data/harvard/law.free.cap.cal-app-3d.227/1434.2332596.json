(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (2); 286, subd. (c); 288, subd. (b); 288a, subd. (c), 289, subd (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allegations that he used a knife during all but one of the offenses and inflicted great bodily injury during four of the crimes were found true. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.3, 12022.8.) The court determined that defendant was sane when he committed the offenses. Sentenced to 557 years in state prison, he raises numerous issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The published portion of this opinion addresses two issues. We consider whether defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when an undercover officer met with him in the jail visiting room in hopes of obtaining incriminating statements regarding defendant\u2019s efforts to dissuade the victims from testifying. The meeting had been arranged by an inmate who disliked defendant and wanted to obtain damaging evidence against him. On his own, and unknown to law enforcement, the inmate set up a jailhouse encounter so defendant could meet the inmate\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d who would take care of the job of \u201csilencing\u201d the victims. When the inmate informed the district attorney\u2019s office of the planned meeting, it was decided that an undercover officer would attend as the inmate\u2019s friend. At the meeting, defendant made incriminating statements which were introduced against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">We also determine whether the term \u201csexual organ\u201d in section 288a, California\u2019s oral copulation statute, includes a man\u2019s scrotum as well as his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">On May 8, 1987, defendant lured two runaway girls, Michelle, aged 12, and Heather, aged 14, into his hotel room where he forced them to commit numerous sexual acts with him and with each other. On June 2, 1987, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>enticed another runaway girl, Lucille, aged 16, to come to a hotel room and forced her to commit numerous sexual acts with him. After he was arrested, defendant told an officer that he believed Lucille was 18 and that she consented to have sex with him. He admitted they engaged in two acts of intercourse and one act of oral copulation. Defendant acknowledged staying at a hotel with Michelle and Heather but denied any sexual activity occurred. Additional facts will be discussed in detail in our analyses of defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Prior to trial, defendant moved to prevent the introduction of evidence concerning statements he made to an undercover officer while in custody because of these charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Defendant alleged that, in obtaining these statements, police violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel guaranteed by the federal constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A hearing was held which disclosed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Frank S., an informant for federal prosecutors in two other states, met defendant while both were incarcerated in the Sacramento County Jail. From the outset, S. did not like defendant. After learning that defendant was in custody on charges of raping several minors, S. set out, on his own, to obtain incriminating information from him. Defendant confessed to S. and talked to him and other inmates about dissuading the victims from testifying, either by using a \u201cGodfather-type routine\u201d of mutilating animals, or by personal threats, or by whatever it took. Defendant boasted of Mafia connections and offered to pay $5,000 for someone to intimidate the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>When S.\u2019s charges were resolved, he decided to inform on defendant. S. had not done so earlier because he did not want it to appear that he was seeking leniency with respect to the crimes charged against him. While awaiting a court appearance, S. told a deputy sheriff that he had to speak with someone from the district attorney\u2019s office about defendant\u2019s attempt to intimidate witnesses. This message was brought to the attention of the deputy district attorney assigned to prosecute defendant. In order to determine \u201cwhether any plan had been set in motion that would jeopardize the three young girls who were the victims in these cases and to be able to stop any harm from coming to them,\u201d the prosecutor arranged for an investigator to meet with S. The investigator was told not to ask anything about defendant\u2019s pending charges but simply to \u201cget information about the deal [the proposal to silence the prosecuting witnesses] for the protection of the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">After being informed that \u201che would receive no deals\u201d for the information he had concerning defendant\u2019s effort to convince the victims not to testify, S. told the investigator that defendant had confessed. According to S., defendant stated, \u201cI know I\u2019m guilty. You know I\u2019m guilty. I have to get this [defendant\u2019s pending case] taken care of.\u201d By this, defendant meant the witnesses had to be \u201csilenced\u201d or persuaded not to testify. At the conclusion of the meeting, the investigator did <em>not </em>instruct S. to seek additional information from defendant. According to S., \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any game plan laid out for it, there was no listen for this and look for that and that type of thing.\u201d In fact, S. no longer was in the same cell as defendant, and the district attorney\u2019s office made no arrangements for S. to \u201cget closer\u201d to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Nevertheless, S. continued on his own to talk with defendant about the proposal to deal with the victims. As his trial drew closer, defendant became \u201cvery adamant about wanting somebody to contact [the victims]\u201d and asked S. if he knew of anyone who could do the job. Unknown to the district attorney\u2019s office or any law enforcement officer, S. \u201carranged\u201d with defendant for one of S.\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d to \u201ctake care of [defendant\u2019s] problem.\u201d He then brought this to the attention of the district attorney\u2019s office. When the investigator asked why S. had made such an arrangement in view of the fact that the investigator had never suggested such a course of action, S. replied, \u201c[W]ell, I thought we may be able to send an officer in or you could send someone in to pretend that they [szc] were like my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">When the prosecutor heard about this development, he and undercover officer Donald Simonds spoke with S. \u201cto find out what [defendant] had told [S.] and what [S.] had told [defendant] concerning the friend who was to meet with him.\u201d Again, S. was told he would not benefit from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>cooperation. S. stated he would tell defendant that his \u201cfriend\u201d would visit defendant on October 5, and it was decided that Simonds would pose as this friend. Thereafter, S. informed defendant that the previously arranged meeting would occur on October 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The meeting between defendant and Officer Simonds took place in the visiting room of the jail and was surreptitiously tape recorded. After a brief introduction in which defendant confirmed that Simonds was the friend he was expecting, defendant asked whether Simonds was a \u201ccop.\u201d When Simonds replied in the negative, defendant displayed a handwritten note through the glass partition. The note stated: \u201cAll I\u2019ll need for you to do, would be to convince a couple of witnesses (teenaged girls) to change each of their stories, and admit that no crime was comitted [s/c]. <em>How you convince them is up to you </em>all they need to do is contact my attorney, admit to him that no crime was comitted [svc], and sign a statement to that effect, then testify in court that no crime took place, when jury trial arrives. I have each of their names, addresses, phone numbers, schools they go to, family members [sic] names, parents [sz'c] place of employments [sic], and other information. Once contract is fullfilled [s/c], and I am certain you have completed this transaction, you will recieve [sic] a fee of 2,500.00 hand delivered from an associate of mine from New York.\u201d (Italics in original.) Another note displayed by defendant listed certain books which would aid in establishing his bona fides as a purported member of the Mafia.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">After Simonds finished reading the notes, he and defendant discussed their contents, with Simonds repeatedly attempting to have defendant expand on exactly what he wanted done with the victims. Simonds also questioned defendant about how \u201cbad\u201d he wanted \u201cthis favor done\u201d and how Simonds would get the information he needed to track down the victims. After the conversation, defendant was searched, and two torn papers were found. Simonds identified them as the notes defendant displayed to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Defendant testified that S. told him a private detective would visit him to assist in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude both Officer Simonds\u2019 testimony concerning the jail house meeting, including defendant\u2019s efforts to silence the victims, and the tape recording of defendant\u2019s conversation with the officer. The court found that S. was not a police agent; that the \u201cpurpose of the state\u2019s activities with respect to these matters was to protect the safety of these witnesses and not to obtain incriminating information with respect to the underlying charges;\u201d that \u201c[w]ith respect to the defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Simonds, the only purpose of contact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>ing the defendant was fortunately just a minute purpose of determining whether the witnesses were at risk and their safety was in jeopardy;\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere was no interrogation concerning the underlying charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Citing <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) <em>ill </em>U.S. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199] and its progeny, defendant contends that the admission of the tape recording and Officer Simonds\u2019 testimony violated his Sixth Amendment rights. He argues that the state knowingly exploited an opportunity to confront him without counsel being present when the prosecutor took the \u201caffirmative step\u201d of having S. arrange the jailhouse conversation with Officer Simonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The law is as follows: When on his or her own initiative, rather than at the state\u2019s behest, an informant obtains incriminating information from an accused, there is no unlawful interference with a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to representation free of governmental intrusion. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 264, 270 [65 L.Ed.2d 115, 100 S.Ct. 2183]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitt </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 724, 742-743 [205 Cal.Rptr. 810, 685 P.2d 1161]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(4th Cir. 1983) 708 F.2d 132, 135-137; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malik </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 680 F.2d 1162, 1165.) However, when a government agent, including an informant acting at the state\u2019s request, deliberately elicits incriminating statements from a represented defendant, this action impairs the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the \u201cincriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are inadmissible at the trial of those charges, . . .\u201d <em>(Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 159, 168-174, 180 [88 L.Ed.2d 481, 106 S.Ct. 477]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 269-273 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 121-124]; <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, supra, 377 </em>U.S. at pp. 204-207 [12 L.Ed.2d at pp. 249-251].) This is true even if the incriminating information is obtained during the state\u2019s investigation of other, uncharged crimes. <em>(Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 180 [88 L.Ed.2d at pp. 498-499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On several occasions, the United States Supreme Court has reexamined what constitutes a deliberate elicitation of incriminating statements within the meaning of <em>Massiah. </em>The court in <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, supra, </em>474 U.S. 159 [88 L.Ed.2d 481] broadly interpreted this term. It held that the Sixth Amendment imposes upon the state \u201can affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 171 [88 L.Ed.2d at p. 493].) Thus, in the view of the <em>Moulton </em>court, the Sixth Amendment is violated whenever the state knowingly exploits any opportunity to confront the accused without counsel being present. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 176 [88 L.Ed.2d at p. 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In <em>Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 436 [91 L.Ed.2d 364, 106 S.Ct. 2616], our high court backed away from the broad pronouncement of <em>Moul</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number><em>ton. </em>In <em>Kuhlmann, </em>the police placed a confidential informant into the accused\u2019s cell, instructing the informant not to ask the accused any questions but to listen for any statements he might make concerning the charges pending against him. Although this would appear to be a deliberate exploitation of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel present, the court held that incriminating statements made to the informant were admissible. The court explained: \u201c[A] defendant does not make out a violation of [the Sixth Amendment] right simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported [the defendant\u2019s] incriminating statements to the police. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating statements.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 459 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 384-385]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 560 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Defendant suggests that the <em>Kuhlmann </em>\u201c \u2018listening post\u2019 exception to the Sixth Amendment\u201d is not applicable to this case. He argues: \u201cThere was <em>affirmative </em>action on the part of the prosecutor to have informant [S.] affirmatively communicate with [defendant] and arrange for the surreptitious meeting with the undercover police officer. There was <em>affirmative </em>action in bringing [defendant] down to meet with the undercover officer.\u201d (Italics in original.) Defendant misrepresents the record. The testimony of both S. and the district attorney\u2019s investigator indicates that the idea to inform on defendant was S.\u2019s alone. The state did not direct S. to act as an informant or to elicit incriminating statements from defendant. This evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that S. was not acting as an informant for the state. Moreover, the state did not direct S. to arrange the surreptitious meeting with an undercover law enforcement officer. S. did so on his own. When he told the district attorney\u2019s investigator of the arrangement he had made, she expressed surprise and asked him why he had done so since the investigator never suggested that he take such action. Granted, after he spoke with the prosecutor and Officer Simonds, S. told defendant when the previously arranged meeting would take place. However, we see no appreciable difference between this and the state\u2019s action in <em>Kuhlmann. </em>In that case, the state took the affirmative step to place an informant in a position to listen for the accused to volunteer incriminating remarks. Here, S.\u2019s step in telling defendant the date of the meeting which S. already had arranged on his own, not at the government\u2019s behest, merely placed Officer Simonds in the position to listen for defendant to make incriminating remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Thus, in our view, the dispositive issue is whether Simonds merely listened to defendant\u2019s statements or deliberately elicited them.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>The tape recording of the meeting reveals the following: After a brief introduction in which he confirmed that Officer Simonds was the visitor he expected, defendant asked if Simonds was a \u201ccop.\u201d When Simonds replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d defendant on his own initiative displayed two notes on the glass partition, one of which detailed defendant\u2019s request that Simonds convince the victims to change their stories. Up to this point, Simonds had done nothing to deliberately elicit incriminating statements from defendant. He took no action beyond merely listening for what defendant might say concerning the plan to convince the victims not to testify. Accordingly, both the notes and Officer Simonds\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s display of the notes and the subsequent seizure thereof were admissible. <em>(Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, 477 </em>U.S. at p. 459 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 384-385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">However, after reading the notes, Simonds began to ask a number of questions designed to have defendant elaborate on his request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In repeatedly querying defendant about his proposal to silence to victims, including questions concerning the contents of the notes defendant displayed to him, Officer Simonds clearly undertook a course of conduct deliberately designed to elicit incriminating statements from defendant. In doing so, Simonds violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to exclude the tape recording of the conversation and Officer Simonds\u2019s testimony about his discussion with defendant after the notes were displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>However, the harmless error test enunciated in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065] applies to <em>Massiah </em>violations. <em>(Milton </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 371, 372 [33 L.Ed.2d 1, 3-4, 92 S.Ct. 2174].) In reviewing <em>Massiah </em>error, \u201cWe need not determine whether the jury in fact relied on the tainted evidence in reaching a verdict. We need only conclude that \u2018it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that if the jury had not considered\u2019 the tainted evidence \u2018its verdict would have been the same.\u2019\u201d <em>(LePage </em>v. <em>State of Idaho </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 851 F.2d 251, 253, quoting <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497, 503, fn. 6 [95 L.Ed.2d 439, 447, 107 S.Ct. 1918].)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">As previously noted, up until the time that defendant displayed the notes to Simonds, the officer had done nothing deliberately designed to elicit incriminating statements from defendant. Thus, the notes were properly admitted into evidence. The tape recording and the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the subsequent discussion were cumulative and added nothing of substance to the properly admitted, and highly incriminatory, notes. Accordingly, we conclude that admission of the tape recording and Simonds\u2019s testimony concerning events which occurred after the notes were displayed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Even assuming, arguendo, that Officer Simonds violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by appearing at the visiting room of the jail, introduction of the notes displayed by defendant, coupled with error in admitting the tape recording and Officer Simonds\u2019s testimony, would still be harmless. The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was truly overwhelming. While the victims were somewhat unclear on the precise number of crimes committed, they were definite in their identification of defendant and in their testimony that he committed numerous forcible sex crimes against them. This testimony was corroborated in many ways. For example, Lucille was observed fleeing half-naked from the hotel room. She appeared to be hysterical. Defendant admitted to an officer that he had sexual activity with Lucille and had been present in the hotel room with Heather and Michelle. The bedsheets bore stains resembling blood and fecal matter. A knife was found at the scene of that crime, and other knives were found in defendant\u2019s room at another hotel. Medical testimony revealed the genital areas of Michelle and Heather had been seriously traumatized with lacerations and vaginal bleeding, including an injury consistent with Heather\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201ctook the knife and he ran it down [her] chin all the way down to [her] vagina and stabbed [her] down there [in her vagina].\u201d Moreover, the crimes were so distinctive that the testimony of Lucille and the account of Michelle and Heather corroborated each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Upon this record, any error relating to the jailhouse meeting was harmless. It is clear to us beyond a reasonable doubt that if the jury had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>heard the evidence concerning defendant\u2019s effort to dissuade the victims from testifying, its verdicts would have been the same\u2014based on the overwhelming evidence against him, defendant would have been convicted of the multiple sex crimes which he now contests on appeal. <em>(LePage </em>v. <em>State of Idaho, supra, </em>851 F.2d at p. 253 [corroborated eyewitness testimony renders <em>Massiah </em>violation harmless].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of forcible oral copulation as to Heather and two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct as to Michelle based upon the following facts: He forced Michelle to lick his scrotum while he made Heather suck his penis. Then, he ordered the girls to switch positions and forced Heather the lick his scrotum while Michelle orally copulated his penis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the information nor the prosecutor at trial specified whether any of the counts was based on defendant compelling the victims to lick his scrotum. However, the People do not dispute defendant\u2019s assertion that this episode resulted in convictions of two counts of forcible oral copulation committed against Heather and two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct involving Michelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Defendant contends one count of oral copulation and one count of lewd and lascivious conduct must be reversed. His argument is twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">First, he asserts that \u201cmerely changing the location of copulation that occurs on the same organ, without interruption, cannot constitute separate offenses.\u201d In support of this contention, defendant \u201cmaintains that a man\u2019s scrotum <em>and </em>penis constitute the male \u2018sexual organ\u2019 for purposes of section 288a. Accordingly, any uninterrupted act of copulating different parts of a man\u2019s \u2018sexual organ\u2019 constitutes but a single offense.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The flaw in defendant\u2019s argument is that the acts were not uninterrupted. Rather, they were separated in time and by a change in position. It is now settled that an accused may be convicted for multiple, nonconsensual sex acts of an identical nature which follow one another in quick, uninterrupted succession. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 327-334 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078].) The initial sex crimes involving oral copulation of defendant\u2019s penis and the licking of his scrotum were completed when defendant ordered Michelle and Heather to stop and switch positions. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 329-330.) Therefore, separate sex crimes occurred when defendant forced the girls to recommence sucking his penis and licking his scro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>turn, thus compelling them to endure new, unconsented sex acts. <em>(Ibid.) </em> It is equally clear that an accused may be separately punished for sex acts of the same nature committed during a single encounter. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 335-338; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 550-554 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) Where \u201c \u2018[n]one of the sex offenses was committed as a means of committing any other, none facilitated commission of any other, and none was incidental\u2019 to any other, section 654 [which protects against multiple punishment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [does] not apply.\u201d <em>(Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 336, quoting <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 553-554.) Such was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Moreover, the trial court reasonably could infer that, in committing the separate sex acts against the victims, defendant had independent objectives other than his own sexual gratification. Over a period of many hours, defendant compelled the victims to do a variety of degrading sex acts, including forcing them to kiss and orally copulate each other. \u201c[T]he \u2018essential guilt\u2019 of sex offenses lies in \u2018the outrage to the person and feelings of the victim ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 330, quoting \u00a7 263.) Under the facts here, it can be inferred that, with each new sex act, defendant had the independent intent and objective to degrade the victims and to further enhance the physical pain, emotional suffering and humiliation they experienced from his repeated violations of their persons. Accordingly, defendant was properly convicted and sentenced for each of these separate sex acts. (See <em>Harrison, supra, </em>at p. 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In his reply brief, defendant takes a different tack in challenging the sufficiency of evidence to support separate convictions and punishment for the oral copulation of his penis and the licking of his scrotum. While adhering to his view that \u201c[o]ral copulation of the penis, which reasonably construed includes the scrotum for purposes of section 288a, . . .\u2019\u2019he takes the inconsistent, fallback position that \u201c[i]f the scrotum is not included as part of the penis, . . . then only the penis may constitute \u2018the sexual organ\u2019 under section 288a, . . .\u201d and \u201ccopulation of the scrotum could not possibly be punished under section 288a because it is not a sexual organ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">As to Michelle, defendant\u2019s act of forcing her to lick his scrotum was charged as a violation of section 288, subdivision (b), alleging that he committed a lewd and lascivious act \u201cto wit, oral copulation with Michelle [], a child under the age of fourteen years, . . .\u201d Defendant does not raise any issue of defective pleading as to this charge. Since the act of forcing Michelle to lick his scrotum constituted lewd and lascivious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>conduct under section 288 whether or not that act constituted oral copulation under section 288a (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 355-356 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595]), the evidence is sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction under section 288, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">As to Heather, the licking of defendant\u2019s scrotum was charged as forcible oral copulation. Section 288a defines oral copulation as \u201cthe act of copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ or anus of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">To determine whether defendant\u2019s act of forcing Heather to lick his scrotum constituted oral copulation of his \u201csexual organ\u201d within the meaning of section 288a, we must apply fundamental rules of statutory construction.  Our role as an appellate court is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420]; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) In ascertaining legislative intent, a court must look to the language of the statute and \u201caccord words their usual, ordinary, and common sense meaning based on the language used and the evident purpose for which the statute was adopted.\u201d <em>(In re Rojas </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 155 [151 Cal.Rptr. 649, 588 P.2d 789]; <em>Valladares </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 362, 368 [267 Cal.Rptr. 57]). In doing so, we must \u201cpresume that the Legislature did not intend absurd results.\u201d <em>(In re Head </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 223, 232 [228 Cal.Rptr. 184, 721 P.2d 65].) Accordingly, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we must adopt the reasonable meaning and reject that which would lead to an unjust and absurd result. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 583, 605 [268 Cal.Rptr. 399, 789 P.2d 127]; <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 15 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843].) Even if the language of the statute is unambiguous, it \u201c \u2018should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pieters, supra, </em>at pp. 898-899, quoting <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 102, 133 [145 Cal.Rptr. 674, 577 P.2d 1014], citations omitted, internal quotation marks omitted.) \u201cThus, \u2018[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 899, quoting <em>Lungren, supra, </em>at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">With these principles in mind, we conclude that the term \u201csexual organ\u201d contained in California\u2019s oral copulation statute (\u00a7 288a), as applied to males, refers not only to the penis, but also includes the scrotum.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">This conclusion is compelled by the usual, ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201csexual organ.\u201d While we can envision little dispute over the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>ing of the word \u201csexual,\u201d we turn to the dictionary in the interest of thoroughness. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) defines \u201csexual\u201d as \u201crelating to the male or female sexes or their distinctive organs or functions . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 2082.) Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (5th ed. unabridged Lawyers\u2019 Ed. 1982) states that \u201csexual\u201d means \u201c[r]elating to sex; erotic; genital.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1279.) An \u201corgan,\u201d as defined in Stedman\u2019s, is \u201cany part of the body exercising a specific function . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 992.) Similarly, Webster\u2019s states that an \u201corgan\u201d is \u201ca differentiated structure [i.e., a specialization of <em>parts </em>or organs] in an animal . . . adapted for the performance of some specific function and <em>grouped with other structures sharing a common function into </em>systems.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict., <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 630, 1589, italics added; see also Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dict. (1973) at p. 808 [defining \u201corgan\u201d as \u201cbodily <em>parts </em>performing a function or <em>cooperating in an activity,\u201d </em>italics added].) In a male, the sexual function is performed not by the penis alone, but also by other parts grouped together to comprise the male reproductive system, including the scrotum. The primary sex glands, i.e. gonads, are the testes. (Stedman\u2019s Medical Dict., <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 601, 1431; Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict., <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 977, 2362.) The scrotum is the cutaneous pouch containing the testes and parts of the spermatic cords which contain the excretory ducts of the testes. One of the important functions of the scrotum in the reproductive process is to regulate the temperature of the testes for optimum production - of sperm. (See Gray, Anatomy of the Human Body (30th American ed. 1985) at pp. 1549, 1550-1551; Stedman\u2019s Medical Dict., <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 1267.) Since the penis, the testes and the scrotum function together to carry out the reproductive function, each is considered by the aforesaid authorities to be part of the male sexual organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Even without resort to these dictionary definitions, one does not have to be a urogenital expert to recognize that the penis is not the only part of the sexual organ within the male reproductive system. As a matter of common sense, a penis without the testes and scrotum is like a flintlock rifle without a flint and flash powder or a bow without a string and arrow. Thus, in the male, the usual, ordinary meaning of the term \u201csexual organ\u201d refers to \u201cthe scrotum, testicles, and penis.\u201d (Schmidt, Attorneys\u2019 Dict. of Med. and Word Finder (1990) at pp. G-35, S-96.; see also Gray, Anatomy of the Human Body, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 1548-1552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">It is this common meaning which courts are compelled by law to adopt in construing the legislative purpose for, and scope of, section 288a. <em>(In re Rojas, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 155; <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84, 91 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Moreover, to do otherwise would result in an absurd construction of the statute, an outcome which courts are not at liberty to reach. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number><em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 898-899; <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735.) It has long been recognized that section 288a proscribes unlawful <em>oral-genital </em>contact. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 84, 88 [238 P.2d 158].) The gravamen of the offense is the revulsion and harm suffered by one who is forced to unwillingly touch his or her mouth to the genitals of another. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 330.) To suggest that in enacting section 288a the Legislature intended to proscribe the coupling of the mouth with a penis but not with a scrotum is, in our view, an absurd proposition. Such a construction clearly would not effectuate the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s claim, there is nothing in the \u201chistorical usage\u201d of the term \u201csexual organ\u201d in section 288a, or in the language of its predecessor statute, which suggests that as to males the Legislature intended the term to apply only to the penis. Section 288a originally was added to the Penal Code in 1915 to address \u201csex perversions\u201d and provided: \u201cThe acts technically known as fellatio and cunnilingus are hereby declared to be felonies and any person convicted of the commission of either thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than fifteen years.\u201d <em>(In re Lockett </em>(1919) 179 Cal. 581, 583 [178 P. 134]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrell </em>(1916) 31 Cal.App. 793 [161 P. 995].) In declaring this section unconstitutional, the California Supreme Court concluded that \u201c \u2018it is by no means certain what acts the legislature intended to characterize as the crime of <em>\u201cfellatio.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Lockett, supra, </em>179 C. at p. 589, quoting <em>Carrell, supra, </em>at p. 795.) In light of this holding, it cannot now be said that the Legislature originally intended that a section 288a act of sex perversion on the male body applied only to oral copulation of the penis. Thereafter, the Legislature repealed this section and enacted a new section 288a \u201cprohibiting sex perversions\u201d and providing: \u201cAny person participating in the act of copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ of another is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not exceeding fifteen years.\u201d (Stats. 1921, ch. 848, \u00a7 2, p. 1633.) Nothing in this language suggests that the Legislature intended to depart from the common meaning of the term \u201csexual organ\u201d and to limit the offense, as performed on a male, to oral copulation of the penis. If the Legislature had so intended, it could have said so.  In interpreting section 288a, courts must keep in mind the fact that in outlawing oral copulation with the \u201csexual organ\u201d of another, the Legislature was \u201cprohibiting sex perversion.\u201d Forcing a person to unwillingly lick one\u2019s scrotum seems to us to constitute the type of \u201csex perversion\u201d that the Legislature was seeking to prohibit by enacting section 288a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>The fact that the Legislature used the singular term \u201csexual organ,\u201d as well as the anus, does not compel a conclusion that the crime of oral copulation performed on a male applies only to the penis and anus. Section 7 provides that, as to words used in the Penal Code, \u201cthe singular number includes the plural, and the plural the singular; ...\u201d \u201cThe rule of construction enunciated in section 7 is no mere rubric\u2014it is the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 585, 593 [250 Cal.Rptr. 635, 758 P.2d 1165].) Thus, to the extent practicable, we must interpret the singular phrase \u201csexual organ\u201d in section 288a to be consistent with the plural term \u201csexual organs.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such a construction is practical and appropriate because, as noted in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pages 946, 2082, the term \u201csexual organ\u201d often is used in the plural to refer to the genitalia, i.e., \u201cthe organs of the reproductive system; <em>esp\\ </em>the external genital organs.\u201d (Italics in original.) This plural interpretation of the term \u201csexual organ\u201d is the only one which is consistent with the apparent intent of the Legislature in enacting section 288a and does not result in an absurd construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We are mindful of the principle that where a statute is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, it must be construed in favor of defendant. <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>442 U.S. 100, 112 [60 L.Ed.2d 743, 754]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1145-1146 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306].) However, for the reasons stated above, we conclude that, as to males, limiting the term \u201csexual organ\u201d to the penis is not a reasonable interpretation of section 288a. Accordingly, this construction must be rejected in favor of the only reasonable interpretation, namely that the term \u201csexual organ\u201d in section 288a includes a man\u2019s scrotum as well as his penis. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 898-902; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 599; <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1145-1146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Defendant was properly convicted under section 288a for his act of forcing Heather to lick his scrotum.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>III-XVI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The judgment is reversed in part with directions to the trial court to (1) reduce the sodomy conviction (count XLVIII) to attempted sodomy, for a consecutive term of three years, and strike the ancillary section 12022.3 use enhancement; (2) strike the great bodily injury enhancement ancillary to count XXXVIII; (3) prepare a new abstract of judgment setting forth defendant\u2019s sentence, 546 years in state prison; and (4) forward a certified copy of the abstract to the Department of Corrections.

Asserting that S. was unavailable to testify at trial, the prosecutor moved to introduce the transcript of S.\u2019s prior testimony. The motion was taken under submission. A ruling was never made, and the prosecutor abandoned his effort to bring this evidence before the jury.

Defendant said they were. Simonds then asked for more information about the girls and indicated that he was not that interested in getting money for the job; rather, he was hoping to get an introduction, presumably to a high-ranking Mafioso. Defendant said it could be arranged. Simonds asked when he would get the information about the girls. Defendant replied, \u201cAs soon as someone delivers something to you, when you\u2019re more certain, you come back here and pay me a visit.\u201d Simonds asked who the girls were, but defendant did not want to say because he thought the conversation was being taped.

I shall explain why this is not an absurd result, as the majority holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">In part II, the majority undertakes to define the male sexual organ as that term is used in section 288a. Essentially that definition is of the entire male reproductive system, comprising the penis, the scrotum and testes together with the internal workings thereof. I observe at the outset that section 288a since its inception has never used the words reproductive system to define sexual organ. Nor does the majority\u2019s definition withstand historical scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The initial California statute passed in 1915, Penal Code section 288a, criminalized \u201c[t]he acts technically known as fellatio and cunnilingus.\u201d (Stats. 1915, ch. 586, \u00a7 1, p. 1022.) This statute was found to be unconstitutional not because the word fellatio failed to describe the prohibited conduct but because it was not in the English language as required by former article IV, section 24 of the California Constitution, its usage was not in the common parlance and it was therefore uncertain in meaning to a person of common understanding, presumably those persons who might be expected to violate the section. <em>(In re Lockett </em>(1919) 179 Cal. 581 [178 P. 134].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Lockett </em>court recognized that when foreign words had by usage become anglicized and were readily understood by reference to \u201clexicons,\u201d \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>interests of decency, courts should sanction such words, euphemistically employed to describe offenses against morality, thus avoiding the bald nastiness involved in the use of the vernacular, . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 583.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The word fellatio, while sufficiently euphemistic, had not become sufficiently anglicized that it was a part of the English language with a meaning acquired by such use. The <em>Lockett </em>court observed the word \u201cdoes not occur in any of the English dictionaries in common use\u201d (at pp. 584-585), but was used and defined only in works such as Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary, Dorland\u2019s American Illustrated Dictionary, Havelock Ellis\u2019s \u201cStudies in the Psychology of Sex,\u201d and Krafft-Ebing\u2019s \u201cPsychopathia Sexualis.\u201d The common man, not being exposed to such literature could not be expected to know what conduct was proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">While modesty of the times doubtless prevented the Legislature from defining the crime more clinically,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> presumably such members of the Legislature in 1915 had access to the medical texts and literature available to the courts if not the man of common understanding. It is reasonable to assume that to avoid the \u201cbald nastiness involved in the use of the vernacular\u201d <em>(In re Lockett, supra, </em>179 Cal. at p. 583), the Legislature \u201ceuphemistically employed\u201d fellatio to describe this offense against morality. In such texts and dictionaries of that era, the term itself had a definitive meaning and that was oral stimulation, euphemistically speaking, of the penis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Since its original enactment in 1915, section 288a has been amended or reenacted 15 times.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In 1921 the statute was rewritten to prohibit sex perversion, defined as \u201cthe act of copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ of another . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1921, ch. 848, \u00a7 2, p. 1633.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Parsons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>(1927) 82 Cal.App. 17, 19 [255 P. 212], the court rejected a contention that the new statute was vague, uncertain or indefinite. Any person who participated in the proscribed conduct was guilty of the offense, whether as an active or passive participant, thereby putting to rest the active passive concern of the <em>Lockett </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Initially, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Angier </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 417 [112 P.2d 659], the term \u201ccopulation\u201d was construed narrowly: \u201cA mere kiss or lick of the private organ, even though lewdly done (Pen. Code, [ \u00a7 ] 288), is not a copulation.\u201d The court arrived at this conclusion by assessing the meaning of the term copulation, stating \u201c[t]he word copulation has never had the meaning of mere contact. It has always had the significance of the verb, to \u2018couple\u2019, which ... is derived form the Latin <em>copulare, </em>which is translated \u2018to couple, join, unite, band or tie together.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 419.) That view was subsequently repudiated even by its own author <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 84, 88 [238 P.2d 158]), the court acknowledging the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Angier, supra, </em>did not comport with the legislative intent of section 288, subdivision (a). \u201c[W]e were led into a discussion of the significance of the word \u2018copulate.\u2019 While that discourse was philologically correct it was calculated to lead to the erroneous doctrine that the use of the word in section 288a signifies a legislative intent that an offender of the statute is guilty only when he has committed the repulsive act of sex perversion. Such was not the purpose of the lawmakers or the intention of this court. A person is guilty of violating the statute when he has placed his mouth upon the genital organ of another.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Consensual oral-genital contact was decriminalized by our Legislature in 1975. (Stats. 1975, ch. 71, \u00a7 10, p. 134.) The conduct now prohibited by the statute depends on the status of the participants, i.e., minors or prisoners, or the use of force by a sexual aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The present statute, Penal Code section 288a, retains the 1921 definition of oral copulation: \u201c(a) Oral copulation is the act of copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ or anus of another person.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 1299, \u00a7 5, p. 4595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Despite the numerous amendments and revisions made to section 288a, the Legislature has continued to leave the word sexual organ undefined in such section. The defendant contends, not implausibly, that, as to a male sexual organ, section 288a refers to the penis. The People, in an argument accepted by the majority, urge the statute refers to all external genitalia, the penis, the testicles and the scrotum.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The Legislature was free to use \u201cgenitalia\u201d or such similar term in lieu of \u201csexual organ\u201d but chose not to do so. In Penal Code section 311.3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>subdivision (b)(1), the sexual exploitation of children statute, sexual conduct is copiously defined, among other listed conduct, as \u201c[s]exual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital or oral-anal, . . .\u201d The sexual battery statute, Penal Code section 243.4 criminalizes the touching of \u201can intimate part of another person.\u201d \u201cIntimate part\u201d, is defined by section 243.4, subdivision (f)(1), as the \u201csexual organ, anus, groin, or buttocks of any person, and the breast of a female.\u201d The term \u201cprivate parts\u201d which is certainly euphemistic enough, is employed in the indecent exposure statute, which makes it a crime for any person to wilfully and lewdly \u201c[e]xposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314). I think it reasonable to assume that persons of common understanding know what private parts are. If the term were private part, there might be some uncertainty but with private parts, an all-encompassing term, there is no uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Unless it can be said that sexual organ means genitalia as used in section 288a, defendant\u2019s assertion has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The historical derivation of section 288a and the usage of sexual organ in that section strongly suggests that as to a male, the statute refers to the penis. As noted, the original statute proscribed \u201cfellatio,\u201d from the Latin <em>fellare, </em>to suck, and while there may have been some initial uncertainty as to its meaning as to whether both passive and active conduct was included, the term referred to the penis and it was so defined in the dictionaries and treatises current at the time of original enactment as well as present day dictionaries. Nowhere is such term defined to cover oral-scrotal contact. The subsequent statutes describe the conduct as \u201coral copulation.\u201d Copulation normally involves penile-vaginal contact. <em>Oral </em>copulation by its terms suggests the replacement of either the penis or vagina with a mouth. <em>People </em>v. <em>Angler, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 417, focused on the word \u201ccopulating\u201d in determining (at p. 419) that licking or kissing the \u201cprivate organ\u201d was not proscribed: \u201cThe word copulation has never had the meaning of mere contact. It has always had the significance of the verb \u2018to couple.\u2019 \u201d The cases which distinguished or criticized <em>Angier </em>did not expand the organs capable of being assaulted, but expanded the manner of the assault, i.e., licking or osculating (kissing) were proscribed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cline </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 989, 992-993, fn. 2, 996 [83 Cal.Rptr. 246]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.2d at p. 88.) A man does not copulate with his scrotum but with his penis. \u201cOral\u201d copulation, when referring to the male body, as a matter of common sense, involves oral contact with a penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The Legislature has devised an elaborate structure of penal sanctions for various types of sexually-oriented conduct. The forcible lick or kiss of a scrotum could violate section 288, lewd and lascivious conduct, if the victim were under the age of 14 or section 243.4, sexual battery. I conclude such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>conduct, however, is not oral copulation. At best the Legislature\u2019s choice of the term \u201csexual organ\u201d is ambiguous, in light of the historical derivation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In construing ambiguous statutes, we have certain well-defined rules. The provisions of the Penal Code \u201care to be construed according to the fair import of their terms, with a view to eifect its objects and to promote justice.\u201d (\u00a7 4.) They \u201c \u2018are to reach no further in meaning than their words; no person can be made subject to them by implication; and all doubts concerning their interpretation are to preponderate in favor of the accused.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tisdale </em>(1880) 57 Cal. 104, 107 [57 Cal. 104].) Where the language of a statute is reasonably susceptible of two constructions the statute must be construed in favor of defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1145-1146 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306]; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 100, 112 [60 L.Ed.2d 743, 754, 99 S.Ct. 2190].) Under such construction, the male sexual organ, within section 288a, refers to the penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The majority holds this result is \u201cabsurd,\u201d citing to <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420], and <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299]. These two cases enunciate the rule of statutory construction that the language of an unambiguous statute will not be given a literal meaning if such a construction would result in absurd consequences not intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The rule sought by the majority is summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 585 [250 Cal.Rptr. 635, 758 P.2d 1165], at page 599: \u201cThe rule of statutory interpretation that ambiguous penal statutes are construed in favor of defendants is inapplicable unless two reasonable interpretations of the same provision stand in relative equipoise, i.e., that resolution of the statute\u2019s ambiguities in a convincing manner is impracticable. [Citations.]\u201d (See also <em>People v. Alday </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 392, 395 [110 Cal.Rptr. 617, 515 P.2d 1169].) The position of the majority is that it is not reasonable that \u201csexual organ\u201d when referring to a male means \u201cpenis.\u201d But the Legislature has constructed an intricate, almost byzantine, maze of laws criminalizing sexual depradations (see generally 2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crimes Against Decency and Morals, \u00a7 760 et seq.), and often the definitions seem arbitrary. Had the Legislature sought to prohibit more than \u201cfellatio\u201d and \u201ccunninlingus\u201d when it enacted the 1921 statute, it could easily have done so. The fact that reasonable minds may differ on this question suggests the answer, that each interpretation of the statute is equally plausible, and therefore defendant should not have to guess which is the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>The majority cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078], at page 330, that \u201cThe gravamen of the offense is the revulsion and harm suffered by one who is forced to unwillingly touch his or her mouth to the genitals of another.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1450.) <em>Harrison </em>did not so hold, did not involve oral copulation but digital penetration and concerned the propriety of multiple convictions, a wholly different issue. The issue here is the definition of the offense, not the nature of the harm sought to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The majority turns the history of the statute on its head. When the Legislature rewrote the statute in 1921 to avoid the holding in <em>In re Lockett, supra, </em>179 Cal. 581, it was no doubt reluctant to \u201cstain the pages\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carrell, supra, </em>31 Cal.App. at p. 795) of the Statutes of California with an explicit list of the conduct to be proscribed. But the modesty of that era cannot be used as a shield today to obscure what this case is about: Since it was within the power of the Legislature to specify with exactitude the conduct to be proscribed, the defendant is entitled to a reversal as he has tendered an alternate, reasonable construction of the statute, that sexual organ in section 288a denotes the penis only.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 16, 1991.
