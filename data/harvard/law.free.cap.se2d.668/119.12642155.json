LEMONS.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether Virginia Baptist Homes, Inc.'s (\"VBH\") property known as \"The Glebe\" in Botetourt County is exempt from local property taxation under Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings Below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. VBH and The Glebe, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   VBH is a non-stock, not-for-profit corporation that was organized by the Baptist General Association of Virginia in 1946 to provide a home for aged Baptists in Virginia. In 1976 the General Assembly designated VBH as a tax-exempt corporation under Chapter 668 of the Acts of Assembly that was originally codified in the Virginia Code as \u00a7 58-12.45 and is now codified as \u00a7 58.1-3650.33.1984 Acts ch. 675. Specifically, the General Assembly exempted VBH from personal and real property taxes so long as the property is \"used in accordance with the purpose for which [VBH] is classified,\" pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time that VBH was designated a tax-exempt corporation, its sole purpose was to establish and provide retirement communities for the elderly. From 1946 until now VBH has never had another purpose other than operating the retirement homes for the aged. Its Articles of Incorporation still lists its only purpose as operating its four retirement homes for the elderly. While the language in VBH's Articles of Incorporation has been revised and altered over the years, VBH's only purpose of providing and operating retirement communities has not changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1998, The Glebe, Inc. (\"TGI\") was formed as a non-stock, not-for-profit corporation with VBH as its sole member. VBH's Articles of Incorporation were amended to show TGI as one of the corporations it supports. VBH purchased real property in Botetourt County upon which a new retirement community, called \"The Glebe,\" was to be built. The Glebe, like VBH's other three retirement communities, is a \"continuing care retirement community\" with three levels of care: independent living, assisted living, and nursing care. As a resident's health care needs change, he or she may move to a different level of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order for The Glebe facility to be built, VBH loaned $1.3 million to TGI, at a 5% interest rate, to be repaid beginning in the year 2016. VBH also loaned TGI $3.3 million, with no interest, to be repaid starting in the year 2036. VBH gave TGI approximately $4.5 million of benevolent funds from its other retirement communities and its ministry. Collectively, this money represented approximately 14% of the cost of building The Glebe facility. The remaining $55.3 million were borrowed through tax-exempt bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   TGI began to market The Glebe in 2003. As of the date of trial in March 2007, TGI had spent approximately $3.6 million in advertising and marketing. Advertisements that ran from 2003 to 2005 emphasized that The Glebe was a \"resort\" community or \"resort-style retirement living.\" The advertisements emphasized luxury amenities, such as \"[v]aulted ceilings,\" \"[r]ich hardwood cabinets,\" \"[s]pacious rooms,\" and \"stunning views of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A feasibility study prepared for TGI prior to construction showed that the median sales price in TGI's primary and secondary geographic market areas in 2003 was $138,400. In contrast, the entrance fees for The Glebe in 2003 ranged from $98,150 for a single person in a one bedroom, one bathroom apartment to $249,260 for a couple in the largest 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom cottage. In addition to the entrance fee, residents at The Glebe must also pay monthly charges. In 2003, these monthly charges were projected to range from $1,743 to $3,628 for residency\n   alone. The residents are charged additional fees for ancillary charges such as telephone, Internet, housekeeping, and dining services, and may be charged additional fees if moved to assisted living or health care center units. The feasibility study showed that in TGI's primary and secondary geographic market areas, only 24.3% of people age 65 or older were income eligible to be admitted to The Glebe in 2002, and projected that only 31.5% would be income eligible in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Terms of the tax-exempt bonds issued required TGI to guarantee that 70% of its residents would have sufficient funds to pay for their care. As a result, TGI requires an applicant to fill out a confidential financial statement and go through a screening process to be admitted. Initially, applicants would not be considered unless they were calculated to be able to pay for all of their lifetime care. The calculation of a resident's ability to pay is based on his actuarial life, his holdings, and his income. Because of this requirement, only about 20% of the age-eligible population could be admitted. As of 2006, TGI changed its policy so that an applicant could be admitted if his financial forecast indicated that he would run out of assets within two years of the end of his life expectancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If a resident in one of VBH's three facilities in Culpeper, Newport News, or Richmond outlives his assets, VBH provides direct financial assistance to that resident. From 1999 to 2005, VBH provided approximately $5.6 million in financial assistance to residents in those communities. In contrast to VBH's other facilities and with the possible exception of one resident, VBH and TGI currently offer no financial assistance or gratuitous care for those applicants who do not meet the financial requirements to be admitted to The Glebe. There are two charitable funds developed for TGI. One has a balance of approximately $51,000 and the other approximately $15,000. Those funds come from various charitable gifts, bequests, and donations; however, they are not currently being utilized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Randall Robinson (\"Dr.Robinson\"), the president of VBH and TGI, testified that although TGI could not accept residents regardless of their ability to pay, TGI plans to do so in the future. Dr. Robinson testified that VBH was committed to building an endowment to help people enter The Glebe facility, and that VBH was already conducting an ongoing fundraising campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no requirement that a resident or staff member of The Glebe adhere to any religious belief. The Glebe includes a chapel, but as one of VBH's witnesses testified \"[t]hat chapel is a meditation chapel and it's for prayer and meditation.\" However, weekly services are held by visiting clergy in The Glebe's Botetourt Room, which holds more people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2005, Botetourt County (\"the County\") issued real estate tax bills to VBH charging a total of $7,591.50 in real estate taxes for the tax year 2005 arising from its ownership of The Glebe. VBH appealed the assessments to the County Commissioner of Revenue. The County Commissioner denied the appeal, finding that The Glebe did not qualify as property used \"by [VBH] exclusively for religious or benevolent purposes\" under Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B). VBH requested that the Commissioner state in writing the facts and law supporting his conclusion. The Commissioner did not reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The County filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Botetourt County, seeking a declaration that VBH and TGI are subject to taxation by the County and that each lacks entitlement to tax exemption for The Glebe. VBH answered the complaint and filed a demurrer the same day, arguing that the County was \"attempting to undermine the ... General Assembly's designation that property used by VBH is exempt from taxation\" under Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B). The County responded by filing a motion for summary judgment, and VBH filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the demurrer, the County's motion for summary judgment, and VBH's cross-motion. Following a bench trial, the trial court held that \"VBH and its operations of The Glebe in Botetourt County do not satisfy the requirements necessary to be exempt from property taxes pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 58.1-3650 and [Code] \u00a7 58.1-3650.33.\" VBH appeals the trial\n   court's judgment on nine assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. The trial court erred in ruling that VBH's property known as The Glebe is not exempt from local property taxes despite the tax exemption by designation granted by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The trial court erred in holding that The Glebe property is not used exclusively for religious or benevolent purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3. The trial court erred in ruling that the principle of strict construction prevented it from applying the exemption found in Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   4. The trial court erred in holding that the dominant purpose of the property known as The Glebe does not immediately and directly promote VBH's religious and benevolent purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   5. The trial court erred in holding that by amending its articles of incorporation to reflect its operations in a parent-subsidiary structure, VBH fundamentally changed its purpose and no longer serves the benevolent purposes that led the General Assembly to grant the exemption to VBH's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   6. The trial court erred in not granting VBH's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   7. The trial court erred in not granting VBH's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   8. The trial court erred in holding that VBH does not subsidize the cost of care at The Glebe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   9. The trial court erred in rejecting the evidence regarding VBH's commitments to providing direct financial assistance as The Glebe matures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II.

Knowing that VBH's only purpose was to provide and manage retirement facilities for the aged, the General Assembly designated VHB as a \"religious and benevolent\" organization that was tax-exempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33. Therefore, because the General Assembly designated VBH as a \"religious and benevolent\" organization, it follows that the General Assembly considered VBH's operation of retirement communities for the elderly, its only purpose, to be both religious and benevolent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In 1976 when the General Assembly granted VBH tax-exempt status by designation, its articles of incorporation provided in part that VBH could:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [S]olicit sufficient funds, establish and maintain an institution where aged, indigent and infirm men and women may be provided with a comfortable home gratuitously or upon such other conditions as may be prescribed by the management from time to time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Since 1976 there have been some changes in the language of various corporate documents.

The articles of incorporation of The Glebe state, in pertinent part, that its purpose \"is to provide elderly persons with housing facilities and services specially designed to meet their physical, social and psychological needs, and to promote their health, security, happiness and usefulness in longer living.\" The Glebe's by-laws provide in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The objectives for which this Corporation are operated are: ...

Therefore, the only question to be answered is whether The Glebe, in fact, operates a retirement community for the elderly on a nonprofit basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There is no evidence in this record that The Glebe provides any service other than operating a retirement community for the elderly.

The County argues on appeal that The Glebe does not operate on a nonprofit basis as required by Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.

Giving deference to the legislative designation, we hold that The Glebe is used exclusively for a religious purpose.

It is undisputed that since 1976 the General Assembly has provided by designation a tax exemption to Virginia Baptist Homes, Inc. as a religious and benevolent organization. Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(A). This exemption, however, is expressly qualified and limited by the plain provisions of Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B), which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   owned by the Virginia Baptist Homes, Inc. and\n   <em>\n    used by it exclusively for religious or benevolent purposes on a nonprofit basis,\n   </em>\n   as set forth in subsection A. of this section, is hereby determined to be exempt from taxation, State and local, including inheritance taxes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Emphasis added). At issue here is whether a particular property in Botetourt County,\n   known as \"The Glebe,\" used for a \"continuing care retirement community\" and owned by Virginia Baptist Homes qualifies for the tax exemption provided in this subsection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In my view, the majority incorrectly construes the 1976 legislative designation under Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(A) that Virginia Baptist Homes is a \"religious and benevolent organization\" entitled to a tax exemption as also serving to establish \"that the General Assembly considered [Virginia Baptist Homes'] operation of retirement communities for the elderly, its only purpose, to be both religious and benevolent.\" If this were so, then it would not have been necessary for the General Assembly to include in Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B) the qualification that the exemption would apply only to the property of Virginia Baptist Homes \"used by it exclusively for religious or benevolent purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See Lynchburg Div. of Soc.

The general policy in this Commonwealth is to tax all property. The General Assembly, however, may establish tax exemptions and impose restrictions or conditions upon the exemptions. When exemptions are established they are to be strictly construed so that exemption from taxation is the exception, thus placing the burden upon the taxpayer to establish that it comes within the terms of the exemption.\n   <em>\n    Mariner's Museum v.

Clearly, the provision of free or subsidized housing and care to the elderly would qualify as a benevolent purpose under Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B). However, in the present case the trial court factually determined that \"all\n   residents at [T]he Glebe pay 100 percent of the cost of their care\" and \"the property is not used to house the indigent.\" The trial court's finding in this regard is amply supported by the record. Indeed, the use of the actuarial requirements to limit admission to The Glebe effectively demonstrates that Virginia Baptist Homes does not operate the property to confer a gratuitous benefit to the needy. Accordingly, The Glebe is not used for a benevolent purpose so as to promote the essentially charitable purpose of Virginia Baptist Homes as stated in its Articles of Incorporation in 1976, which state the purpose to be: \"To solicit sufficient funds, establish and maintain an institution where aged, indigent and infirm men and women may be provided with a comfortable home gratuitously or upon such other conditions as may be prescribed by the management from time to time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The focus of the analysis then turns to the critical issue whether The Glebe is used for a religious purpose as contemplated by Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B). The trial court determined that the use of this property did not qualify as promoting a religious purpose essentially upon finding that The Glebe is open to all potential residents \"regardless of religious beliefs or lack thereof,\" the staff is not required to practice or adhere to any specific religion, and the chapel on the property is not used for specific religious services, but rather for independent meditation or prayer.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

These factual findings are supported by the record. Moreover, nothing in the record in this case would support a conclusion that Virginia Baptist Homes' exclusive, or even primary, purpose for developing and using The Glebe was to provide for the spiritual needs of the prospective residents or to provide housing and care to deserving individuals in fulfillment of a faith-based mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, in the final analysis, the issue becomes whether the provision of housing for the elderly in and of itself qualifies as a religious purpose as contemplated by Code \u00a7 58.1-3650.33(B) in the particular use of The Glebe by Virginia Baptist Homes. Even if it is assumed that the provision of housing for the elderly may be motivated by a religious purpose, it is self-evident that not all properties which provide care for the elderly are used for a religious purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this particular case, as demonstrated above, The Glebe is essentially operated as a business enterprise in which the residents purchase their desired housing and care. Undoubtedly, The Glebe functions to provide a worthwhile and beneficial means by which elderly individuals may secure housing, lifetime care and, indeed, the benefit of the association with their peers. Nevertheless, it simply cannot reasonably be said that such involves a religious purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court finding that The Glebe is not used exclusively for religious or benevolent purposes and, thus, is not subject to the tax exemption granted to Virginia Baptist Homes in 1976.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <a href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fr2-2\" name=\"fr2-2\">\n    2.\n   </a>\n   <em>\n    See Yakima First Baptist Homes, Inc. v.
