McCULLOUGH\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A jury convicted Amanda Marie Thomas of felony child abuse and neglect and sentenced her to serve seven years in prison. The trial court imposed a sentence of ten years, and suspended three of those years upon certain conditions. Thomas contends that the ten-year sentence imposed by the court does not conform to statutory requirements, specifically Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-295 and 19.2-295.2, and that the sentence imposed by the trial court improperly extended the maximum sentence fixed by the jury. We conclude that the trial court's sentencing order, as drafted, does not comply with Virginia law. Therefore, we reverse and remand for entry of a new sentencing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following her conviction for felony child abuse and neglect, a jury fixed a maximum sentence of seven years in prison, along with a fine. At a sentencing hearing several months later, the trial court sentenced Thomas to serve ten years in prison, with three years suspended. The Court's order provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    SENTENCES\n   </strong>\n   the defendant to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Incarceration with the\n   <strong>\n    Virginia Department of Corrections\n   </strong>\n   for the term of:\n   <strong>\n    Ten (10) years.\n   </strong>\n   The total sentence imposed is\n   <strong>\n    Ten (10) years.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   After\n   <strong>\n    Seven (7) years\n   </strong>\n   are served, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSPENDS\n   </strong>\n   the balance of\n   <strong>\n    Three (3) years,\n   </strong>\n   upon the following condition(s):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Supervised Probation.\n   </strong>\n   The defendant is placed on probation to commence upon her release from incarceration, under the supervision of a Probation Officer for\n   <strong>\n    Three (3) years,\n   </strong>\n   or unless sooner released by the court or by the Probation Officer.

The court was further required, under the authority of Code \u00a7 18.2-10, to impose a linked suspended term of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The order as written, however, did not specify that the additional time was imposed pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2. Furthermore, the period of post-release supervision imposed by the trial court was not \"under the supervision and review of the Virginia Parole Board.\" Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2(B). Conceptually, the purpose of the post-release period of supervision, and the suspended term of incarceration that accompanies it, is distinct from the punishment imposed for the commission of a crime. The purpose of post-release supervision is not punishment.
