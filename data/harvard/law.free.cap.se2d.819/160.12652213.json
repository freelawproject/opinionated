Code \u00a7 15-51-40 (Supp. 2017) as it relates to an unwed father's right to share in the proceeds of the settlement of a wrongful death action arising out of a child's tragic death during delivery. Because we find evidence supporting the finding of the probate court that the father failed to reasonably support or otherwise provide for the needs of the child, we reverse the order of the circuit court and reaffirm the ruling of the probate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lauren Murphy and Mark Collins met in July 2011 while working together at Wal-Mart. They were both unmarried, but dating other people. They became romantically involved in August 2011, around the time Murphy ended her relationship with Jeremy Fields. Their intimate relationship continued until early October 2011, when Murphy informed Collins she was pregnant. According to Collins, Murphy told him at the time she \"did not think\" Fields was the father because of a previous health diagnosis Fields had received. Collins assured Murphy he would be an active father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The pair soon broke up, however. Murphy reunited with Fields, and Collins pursued another relationship. Murphy then advised Collins that Fields was her child's father, and listed Fields as the father at her initial pre-natal doctor's visit in November 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2011, Collins and Murphy attended the first trimester ultrasound together. Although the evidence is conflicting, Collins claims he desired to continue supporting Murphy's pregnancy, but she blocked his calls and prohibited him from attending further medical appointments. It is undisputed Collins did not attend any more appointments. Nor did he pay or offer to pay for any pre-natal care, although there is evidence Murphy was covered by Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 12, 2012, Murphy delivered a baby girl, Tynslee. Tragically, Tynslee died about an hour after her birth. Murphy listed Fields as the father on Tynslee's birth and death certificates, and in the obituary. Collins, unaware Murphy had gone to the hospital, learned of Tynslee's death from his sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July, Murphy and Collins met and agreed to split the cost of a DNA paternity test, which ultimately proved Collins was Tynslee's father. After being appointed personal representative for Tynslee's estate, Murphy brought a wrongful death and survival action against Tynslee's medical providers for malpractice. Murphy listed both Fields and Collins as Tynslee's possible father in her August 2012 petition to be appointed\n   personal representative, although Fields was later dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2014, the circuit court approved partial settlement of the wrongful death and survival action. Murphy then petitioned to deny Collins any interest in the wrongful death proceeds, relying on \u00a7 15-51-40, which governs allocation of the proceeds in a wrongful death action, and authorizes a parent to move to deny or limit another parent's interest in the proceeds. The probate court granted the petition, ruling in a thoughtful written order that the greater weight of evidence established Collins had failed to provide Tynslee reasonable support or otherwise provide for her needs within the meaning of \u00a7 15-51-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Collins appealed the probate court order. The circuit court reversed the probate court, reasoning the statute required Collins only to provide reasonable support during Tynslee's minority, which it interpreted as the time between her birth and death. Given the brevity of Tynslee's life, Collins' uncertainty at the time he was her father, and finding Tynslee's medical costs had been borne by Medicaid, the circuit court found there was no evidence supporting the ruling of the probate court. The circuit court succinctly ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the statute, the period of time relevant to the Court's determination of whether Appellant Collins provided reasonable support for the needs of his daughter was during her \"minority.\" In this case, Tynslee's minority was a period that consisted of mere minutes to hours between her birth and her death, during which time emergency medical care was being administered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Probate Court found that the burial, funeral, memorial and legal expenses and time spent in pursuit of the wrongful death action constituted \"unusual necessities\" under S.C. Code \u00a7 63-5-20 ( [A] ) which, if not provided by the statutory beneficiary, would justify the divestment of proceeds. This court finds that none of these were incurred within the statutorily-defined relevant time period under S.C. Code \u00a7 15-51-40. Therefore, evidence of the failure to pay these expenses is not evidence which reasonably supports the findings of the Probate Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Murphy appeals this ruling, challenging the circuit court's interpretation of \u00a7 15-51-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because a proceeding under \u00a7 15-51-40 is an action at law, we must affirm the probate court's factual findings unless no evidence supports them.\n   <em>\n    In re Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493658\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/315/356/#p361\">\n    315 S.C. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493658,493618\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/434/254/\">\n    434 S.E.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (1993).

The plain language of \u00a7 15-51-40 allows the probate court, upon motion, to deny or limit wrongful death proceeds a parent would otherwise be entitled to for the wrongful death of a decedent if the court determines two elements by the greater weight of the evidence: that the parent (1) failed to reasonably provide support for the decedent as defined in S.C.

As used in this section \"reasonable support\" means an amount of financial assistance which, when combined with the support the member is reasonably capable of providing for himself or herself, will provide a living standard for the member substantially equal to that of the person owing the duty to support. It includes both usual and unusual necessities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063-5-20\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 63-5-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (Supp. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The probate court found Tynslee's pre-natal and birth-related medical expenses were usual necessities, none of which Collins paid or offered to pay, even after his paternity was established. The circuit court disagreed, finding there was no necessity to pay the medical expenses because they were covered by Medicaid, there was no evidence of any unpaid medical bills, and Medicaid has not sought reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We agree with the probate court. Collins is able-bodied and capable of earning a livelihood; he works for a major corporation. Although the record is silent about whether Collins had health insurance benefits that could have covered his child's medical expenses, that silence results from Collins' own: he never spoke up to ask what he could do to contribute, content to rely on Medicaid. The \"reasonable support\" \u00a7 63-5-20 speaks of is the obligation of the parent-not the government-to provide financial assistance to one's child. The law imposes a duty on parents to pay their children's reasonable and necessary medical expenses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trident Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903368\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/317/346/#p352\">\n    317 S.C. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903368\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/317/346/#p352\">\n    454 S.E.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (Ct.

Code \u00a7 63-3-530(A)(14) (2010) (empowering the family court \"to order support of a spouse or child, or both, irrespective of whether they are likely to become a public charge\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The record is not entirely mute, though. In her wrongful death settlement petition, Murphy agreed to satisfy any outstanding medical bills and Medicaid liens, and to withhold $3,331.50 in trust to pay them. The order of the circuit court granting her petition, and approving the settlement, required Murphy, individually and as personal representative of Tynslee's estate, to pay any such liens out of the settlement\n   proceeds. From this we infer and find there were outstanding medical expenses Tynslee incurred that Collins did not pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patton v.

We note, though, that the family court may order child support to include \"the providing of necessary shelter, food, clothing, care, medical attention, expenses of confinement,\n   <em>\n    both before and after the birth\n   </em>\n   , the expense of educating his or her child and other proper and reasonable expenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063-3-530\">\n    S.C.

App. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The circuit court erred in reading into \u00a7 63-5-20(A) a requirement that the necessities be incurred during the child's minority. We hold the term \"minority\" as used in \u00a7 15-51-40 does not limit or affect the duty \u00a7 63-5-20 imposes on parents to provide for their child's necessities. To rule otherwise would insulate a parent from liability not only for a minor child's funeral and burial expenses, but also for pre-natal care. Such a result would undercut the clear legislative intent to the contrary expressed in similar statutes addressing parental support obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C. Code \u00a7 63-3-530 (2010) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063-9-310\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 63-9-310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(5)(b) (Supp. 2017) (noting unwed father's consent to or relinquishment of child for adoption required when, inter alia, \"the father paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on the father's financial ability, for the support of the child or for expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the birth of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses.\"). Statutes addressing similar subjects should be similarly construed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beaufort Cty. v. S.C. State Election Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875706\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/395/366/#p371\">\n    395 S.C. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875706\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/395/366/#p371\">\n    718 S.E.2d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (2011) (\"[I]t is well settled that statutes dealing with the same subject matter are\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   and must be construed together, if possible, to produce a single, harmonious result.\"). The legislature meant to parallel, not distort, the parental support obligations found in other statutes. We do not think by amending \u00a7 15-51-40 as it did, the legislature meant to endorse some notion that a parent has no legal obligation of support for a child's expenses except those incurred after birth but before death, a notion\n   that has no support in our statutory law nor in the reality of how responsible parents act. We therefore hold the probate court correctly found the greater weight of the evidence showed Collins failed to reasonably support Tynslee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.\n     <em>\n      Needs of Decedent\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This brings us to the second element: whether Collins failed to \"otherwise provide for the needs\" of Tynslee during her minority. The circuit court found that, due to Tynslee's short life and Collins' lack of certainty during it that he was her father, there was no evidence he failed to provide for her needs while she was alive. To reach this conclusion, the circuit court reached beyond the plain language of \u00a7 15-51-40 and implied an exception excusing Collins from compliance. In essence, the circuit court transported \u00a7 63-5-20's \"just cause or excuse\" provision to the second element of the \u00a7 15-51-40 test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We understand how the circuit court could have arrived at this result, but find the route unwarranted. And this is where the significance of the 1994 and 1996 amendments to \u00a7 15-51-40 enacted in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   comes into view, and how the mischief the changes aimed to avoid spotlights legislative intent. The 1994 amendment stated that upon motion a parent could be divested of wrongful death proceeds \"in the event of the wrongful death of a minor\" if the parent failed to provide reasonable support and \"has otherwise not provided for the needs of the decedent.\" Note the 1994 amendments applied only in the event of a minor's wrongful death, and did not limit the parent's obligation to provide for his child's needs to the period of minority. The 1996 amendments, however, expanded the divestment provision from \"minor\" decedents to any \"decedent having died intestate.\" It retained the reasonable support element incorporating \u00a7 63-5-20, but recast the second element to require proof that the parent \"did not otherwise provide for the needs of the decedent during his or her minority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The 1996 amendment fixed a potential problem embedded in the 1994 amendment, which applied only to minor decedents. If the decedent was an adult, the 1994 amendment did nothing\n   to strip an absent and non-supporting parent's right to share the wrongful death proceeds, the same windfall the statute allowed in\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The 1996 revision closed this loophole, but the circuit court's interpretation would reopen it. Using the circuit court's construction, if the father of an adult child whom he had not supported had died intestate by wrongful death, \u00a7 15-51-40 would not bar or limit the father's right to the wrongful death settlement proceeds as long as he could show\n   that, during the child's minority, he had no knowledge he was the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We therefore hold \u00a7 15-51-40's final phrase, \"did not otherwise provide for the needs of the decedent during his or her minority,\" means what it says, and contains no exception excusing compliance, including lack of knowledge of paternity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roschen v. Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907508\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/337/#p339\">\n    279 U.S. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907508\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/337/#p339\">\n    49 S.Ct. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907508\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/337/#p339\">\n    73 L.Ed. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1929) (\"[T]here is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\") (Holmes, J.). When, as here, the words of the statute are plain and reflect legislative intent unambiguously, we must enforce them according to their terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cabiness v. Town of James Island\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873242\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/393/176/#p192\">\n    393 S.C. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873242\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/393/176/#p192\">\n    712 S.E.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (2011). It was up to the General Assembly to weigh a father's interest in these situations and strike the balance. A father may suffer profound loss in such circumstances, but \u00a7 15-51-40 nevertheless limits the father's right to compensate for the loss out of wrongful death proceeds. Because evidence supports the probate court's finding Collins did not provide for Tynslee's needs during her life, however brief, we uphold the probate court's ruling as to the second element of \u00a7 15-51-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We reverse the order of the circuit court and affirm the probate court's ruling denying Collins any interest in the wrongful death proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   SHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
