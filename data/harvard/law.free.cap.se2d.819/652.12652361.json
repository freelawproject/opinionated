BERNARD GOODWYN\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal of a judgment from the Court of Appeals, we consider whether the Court of Appeals erred when it held that multiple mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, imposed for multiple convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), are required to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 1, 2016, Botkin was indicted by a grand jury of the Circuit Court of Scott County, for two counts of possession of a firearm within ten years of having been convicted of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Botkin's possessions were alleged to have occurred on two separate occasions in November 2015. Botkin pled guilty to both charges and the circuit court held a sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth argued that under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), each of Botkin's convictions was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of two years, and that each of those mandatory sentences was required to run consecutively with any other sentence, including each other. Botkin disagreed and argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) allowed the two mandatory minimum sentences imposed under that statute to run concurrently with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 16, 2017, the circuit court entered an order sentencing Botkin to five years for each violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), with three years suspended on each sentence. The circuit court ordered that the sentences run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth appealed the concurrent sentences to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the ruling of the circuit court. In a published opinion,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Botkin asserts that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) did not proscribe the circuit court's discretion to run his two sentences concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under his first assignment of error, Botkin argues that the Court of Appeals erred because it \"focus[ed] on only part of the language in the last sentence of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), instead of the entire sentence.\" He claims that when Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) states that the mandatory minimums \"for violations of this section\" are to run \"consecutively with any other sentence,\" the circuit court still has discretion to run sentences concurrently for multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). In other words, he asserts that sentences for violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) need only be served consecutively with sentences for violations of other statutes. He argues that had the legislature intended multiple sentences for multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) to run consecutively, it \"could easily have stated that the mandatory minimum may not be run concurrently with any other sentence or with any other violation under 'this section.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that the Court of Appeals did not err because Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A)\"unambiguously requires that two mandatory minimum sentences be served consecutively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Statutory interpretation presents a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%20538\">\n    284 Va. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20S.E.2d%20638\">\n    733 S.E.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We noted that the phrase used in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-255.2(B) and 18.2-308.1 demonstrates instances in which \"the General Assembly has directed that a mandatory minimum sentence not be run concurrently with any other punishment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20S.E.2d%20638\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 expressly limits its requirement that sentences run consecutively to sentences received for the primary felony, this Court concluded that multiple mandatory minimum sentences \"imposed pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 may be run concurrently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 545,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20S.E.2d%20638\">\n    733 S.E.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the case at bar, however, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) does not limit its requirement that sentences run consecutively. Unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A)'s requirement that mandatory minimum sentences be served consecutively applies, without limitation, to \"any other sentence\" imposed. The plain meaning of \"any other sentence\" is one or more remaining sentences, \"without limitation or restriction,\" thereby including another mandatory minimum sentence received pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). In other words, \"any\" means \"any.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To give the statute Botkin's preferred construction would require this Court to read \"any other sentence\" as \"any other sentence, other than the mandatory minimums imposed under this Code section,\" and this Court cannot construe a statute to mean what it does not state. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , \"any other sentence\" indicates a legislative intent that \"a mandatory minimum sentence not be run concurrently with any other punishment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%20538\">\n    284 Va. at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20S.E.2d%20638\">\n    733 S.E.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) requires that mandatory minimum sentences run consecutively, and does not limit that requirement, the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the mandatory minimum sentences for Botkin's two convictions for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) must be served consecutively, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Remand for new sentencing based on\n   </em>\n   Graves\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under his second assignment of error, Botkin argues the Court of Appeals erred when it \"remanded this case to the circuit court to impose two consecutive sentences\" based on\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   . He argues that\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because that decision analyzed Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and not Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), and found Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to be ambiguous and an anomaly. Botkin asks this Court to \"reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals to remand this case to the circuit court 'pursuant to one of two mandatory minimum terms,' \" and to affirm\n   the circuit court's decision to run his sentences concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2009, this Court adopted the following rule of law to \"ensure that all criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed\n   <em>\n    in violation\n   </em>\n   of the prescribed statutory ranges are treated uniformly without any speculation\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [A] sentence imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because the character of the judgment was not such as the [C]ourt had the power to render. Thus, a criminal defendant in that situation is entitled to a new sentencing hearing. This common law rule of jurisprudence will eliminate the need for courts to resort to speculation when determining how a jury would have sentenced a criminal defendant had the jury been properly instructed or had the jury properly followed correct instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Rawls v.

Because the circuit court imposed sentences that were \"in violation of [the] prescribed statutory range\" when it ordered Botkin's sentences be served concurrently instead of consecutively, the sentences were \"not such as the [circuit court] had the power to render,\" and are void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Rawls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20213\">\n    278 Va. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20544\">\n    683 S.E.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To avoid speculation as to how the circuit court would have sentenced Botkin had it correctly interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), Botkin is entitled to a new sentencing hearing on both sentences upon remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed as to its interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Mandatory minimum terms of confinement ordered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) must run consecutively with any other sentence, including other mandatory minimum terms ordered pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). Because Botkin's sentences were run concurrently, we will vacate those sentences and remand this case to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand to the Circuit Court of Scott County for resentencing consistent with this Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides, in pertinent part,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and to a mandatory minimum term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction under the provisions of this section.
