The defendant a druggist without experience in dealing in spectacles alleged that he had ordered goods of the plaintiffs on their representation that they had sold such outfits to another druggist in a similar neighborhood to the defendant\u2019s and that that druggist had sold large quantities of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">The court, Thayer, P. J., charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">[This is a suit brought to recover the price of certain goods sold and delivered. The defendant relies upon an alleged rescission of the contract on his part, which he attempts to justify by proof that he was induced to buy them by misrepresentation made to him by the plaintiffs, who sold them. The alleged misrepresentation consisted, according to the defendant\u2019s statement, in the plaintiff\u2019s representing that he had sold similar goods to Mr. Ogden. The evidence is that although the plaintiff had not sold precisely these goods to Mr. Ogden, he had sold him somewhat similar goods \u2014 smoked eyeglasses it turned out to be.] [1] [At any rate, after receiving the goods and keeping them, as the defendant did, from the 17th of March to the 28th of June, it was too late for him then to rescind the contract upon such an allegation as that. If he intended to rescind the contract he ought to have acted sooner. If he had returned them immediately, or within a reasonable time, after receiving the goods, there might have been at least some color for such a defense. But as matter of law, I instruct you that his offer to return the goods was entirely too late, and therefore he is responsible to the plaintiffs.] [2]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>January 18, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $38.25.

It was an order to the plaintiffs signed by the defendant for certain goods which were actually delivered, which the defendant accepted and part of which he sold. He undertook to rescind the contract, on the ground that it was induced by representations which he alleges were false and fraudulent. When this action was brought by the plaintiffs to recover the value of the goods sold, the fraud so alleged was set up as a defense to its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Two assignments of error cover the entire charge of the court to the jury, in which the court instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s offer \u201cto return the goods was entirely too late and, therefore, he is responsible, to the plaintiffs.\u201d The charge is very brief. No reasons are given for the conclusions reached by the trial judge and we are, therefore, left to gather them from the testimony as it was developed in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>If no fraud was practiced upon the defendant by the plaintiffs, the conclusion reached by the trial judge is undoubtedly correct. The goods were sold on the 15th day of March, 1894, and were returned or offered to be returned on the 28th of June following, the defendant having in the meantime sold some of the goods and, in order to restore the status quo, having purchased from other persons what was sufficient, in his opinion, to make good the amount sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The question of \u201cwhat is a reasonable time or undue delay, when the facts are not disputed, is, as is well settled, a question of law to be determined by the court: \u201d Leaming v. Wise, 73 Pa. 173; Morgan v. McKee, 77 Pa. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">If the contract, however, were based upon a fraud practiced upon the defendant, he could rescind it within a reasonable time, after the discovery of the fraud; and, if his testimony is to be believed, he rescinded the contract and offered to return the goods immediately after the discovery of what he alleged to be the fraud practiced upon him by the plaintiffs. It is manifestly certain, therefore, that the trial judge in the court below eliminated the question of fraud entirely from the case. Was he justified in so doing? It has been very often held by the Supreme Court and this court that \u201c when the execution of an instrument has been obtained by means of a fraud or where there has been an attempt to make a fraudulent use of the instrument in violation of a promise or agreement made at the time the instrument was signed and without which it would not have been executed, parol evidence could be given to prove the fraud, though it contradict the instrument; \u201d but in such a case \u201cthe evidence must be clear, precise and indubitable \u2014 not indubitable in the sense that there must be no opposing testimony but in the sense that it must carry a clear conviction of its truth : \u201d Honesdale Glass Co. v. Storms, 125 Pa. 268, and numerous cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Admitting that the representations complained of amounted to a fraud of which the law will take cognizance, was the evidence of it sufficient to be submitted to the jury? We think not. It was sufficient in quantity, having the two witnesses necessary to establish the fraud; but, after a careful reading of all the testimony upon the subject, we are clearly of the opinion that the witness who was called to corroborate the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u25a0 was vague and uncertain in his testimony; and, taking all of the testimony upon the subject together, it fails to meet the requirements herein set forth. Whether these considerations influenced the trial judge in failing to submit to the jury the question of fraud, we cannot, of course, determine. It may be that other considerations moved him.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In Southern Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U. S. 247, it was held that \u201c In order to rescind a contract for the purchase of real estate on the ground of fraudulent representation by the seller, it must be established by clear and decisive proof that the alleged representation was made in regard to a material fact; that it was false; that the maker knew that it was not true; that he made it in order to have it acted on by the other party and that it was so acted on by the other party to his damage and in ignorance of its falsity and with a reasonable belief that it was true.\u201d The rule is not essentially different as to personal property. Were the representations as to the sale ,to Ogden of a material fact? Admitting that the defendant acted upon those representations, did he do so to his detriment or damage ? These are questions which naturally suggest themselves as legitimately raised by the evidence but which need not be definitely answered, in view of the reasons heretofore given which may have influenced the court below in withholding the question of fraud from the jury and which, in our opinion, wa\u00e1 a sufficient justification for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
