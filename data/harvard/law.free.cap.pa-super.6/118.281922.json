The point and answer are as follows: \u201c1. There is nothing in the facts which took place antecedent to the making of the contract in writing or in its procurement' to avoid it or to vary the terms of it. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that point. You will understand from that, as has already been said in your hearing, that we have eliminated from this case all that, took place prior to the signing of this agreement, what was said and done prior to the time the agreement was executed, to wit: July 7th, I think, and you have nothing to say about that. We-have said that that does not effect the solution of this case, and, therefore, counsel have not turned their attention to that in their argument, because we took occasion to say in the early stage of the argument that in our judgment it has nothing to do with this case. Although we admitted it, in our opinion the proofs did not come up, to the requirements of the law, and, therefore, it is to be disregarded by the jury.\u201d (2) In answer to plaintiff\u2019s second point, which point and answer are as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>2. If the jury believe that the plaintiff performed his part of the written contract in good faith, and to the best of his ability, he was illegally discharged. <em>Answer: </em>I have already said that to you in substance and I affirm that point.\u201d (3) In answer to plaintiff\u2019s third point, which point and answer are as follows: \u201c 3. Unless there was fraud, or bad faith, or gross inattention on the part of the plaintiff in his performance of the written contract, he was illegally discharged. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that point. I have already virtually so said in my charge to you.\u201d (4) In answer to defendant\u2019s fourth point, which point and answer are as follows: \u201c 4. If the jury find that the contract in suit was executed by the defendants on the promise and agreement of the plaintiff that at the time of the execution of the paper he had a flint glass business that netted him $600 profit, which profit the defendant would receive, that he had an established business as a glass dealer amounting to from $40,000 to $60,000 a year, the benefit of which the defendants would have and that he could sell the entire product of the defendant\u2019s factory, and if they further find that without these representations the contract would not have been made, then the plaintiff cannot recover if these promises and agreements have not been fulfilled by him. <em>Answer: </em>I disaffirm that proposition, gentlemen. I refuse to submit to you those considerations that are involved in this point. If the point had said that these representations were false, then I might have affirmed it. But there would bo no proof, in my judgment, in the case which would justify you in concluding that they were untrue. So I refuse the point and submit the case to you under the suggestions which I have already made.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\"><em>J. Frank F.

The plaintiff entered upon his duties under the contract and continued to perform them until December 1, 1894, when he was discharged by the defendants. In May, 1895, he found other employment. He subsequently brought this suit for wages for the interval between December 1, 1894, and May, 1, 1895, under the agreement, and recovered a judgment for the amount of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">At the trial, the defendants, to justify their discharge of the plaintiff, alleged that he was negligent in the performance of his duties. On this subject testimony was introdnced by both parties. This question was submitted to the jury who, by their verdict, exonerated the plaintiff from the charge. The principal ground of complaint here, however, is that the court below erred in withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the testimony as to what took place prior to the execution of the agreement, which, the appellants argue, induced them to sign the contract. It is alleged that at a meeting between the directors of the defendant company and the plaintiff, a few days before the writing was executed, he stated that he had a flint glass trade from which he derived an annual profit of $600; that he sold, as a glass broker or jobber, from $40,000 to $60,000 worth of glass annually, and that all of this together with his Philadelphia office would be turned over to the advantage of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>fendants, if he engaged with them. But when-they asked him to guarantee that he would make a certain amount of sales for them \u2014 that he would sell the product of their factory \u2014 he positively refused to do so; and the written agreement, which he submitted some days afterward, was signed by the defendants without other guaranty or assurance than is contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The representations of the plaintiff related to his business standing and experience, and may or may not have been true. Nothing was shown on the trial which necessarily disproved them, unless the disappointed expectations of the defendants be accepted as such proof. But the vital point is that they formed no part of the contract made by the parties. This appears by the testimony of the defendants themselves. It may be that the defendants, in making the contract, were influenced by the plaintiff\u2019s representations ; but there is no evidence of falsehood, fraud or promise by which they were induced to close the bargain. At most the alleged representations by the plaintiff were designed to impress the defendants with a belief in his ability to sell their product; but he declined to bind himself to do this, and the stipulation that he would do so was excluded from the writing. Under these circumstances the learned trial judge was right in ruling that nothing was shown which would justify the jury in modifying the written contract; and that all the \u25a0preliminary negotiations were presumed to be merged in the written agreement. We are now asked to say, substantially, that the court below erred in excluding from the consideration of the jury that which the parties themselves excluded from their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The appellant\u2019s argument is based on the assumption that there was a contemporaneous parol agreement on the faith of which the writing was executed and without which it would not have been signed, and authorities are cited for the proposition that \u201c where there has been an attempt to make a fraudulent use of the instrument in violation of a promise or agreement made at' the time the instrument was signed and without which it would not have been executed,\u201d this may be shown by parol, even if by doing so the whole contract will be set aside. This is a correct statement of the law. But the difficulty with the appellant\u2019s case is that it fails to show any contemporaneous-agreement, or any agreement,.other than that embodied in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>writing; and therefore there was nothing to which this proposition could apply. There was here no use of the instrument, or any attempt to use it, for any other purpose than the one for which it was intended, or in violation of any condition or representation upon which it was procured. The representations referred to did not constitute an agreement, promise or condition of any kind, and were, therefore, properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">What has been said sufficiently covers the matters complained of in the first and fourth specifications. The second and third specifications were not pressed at the argument; they were properly abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
