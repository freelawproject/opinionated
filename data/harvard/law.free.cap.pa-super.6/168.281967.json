Before Atjdehreid, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-9\">The facts sufficiently appear in the charge of the court below, which is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\">As I understand the undisputed facts in this case, they are briefly these: On the 18th of February, 1890, the firm of Harrington &amp; Goodman in this city packed up and shipped to a man named W. B. Robinson, at Tyler, Texas, a case of dry goods, of the value of $430.69. These goods were forwarded to Robinson by the hands of the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company, to which they were delivered on the date before mentioned. That company gave to the shippers, Harrington &amp; Goodman, a shipping receipt, in which the package containing the goods is described and specified by reference to the marks upon it, W. B. Robinson, Tyler, Texas, via St. Louis. [The goods seemed to have reached St. Louis in good order, and to have been passed on from that point to Tyler, Texas, by the Pacific Express Company. On their arrival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>at Tyler a party named A. J. Michell, who for a long time prior to that date had been conducting business at Tyler as a sort of general agent for the consignee named in the receipt, went to the agent of the express company, and directed the reshipment of the goods to Dallas, Texas, to the firm of Mich-ell &amp; Co. The Pacific Express Company forwarded the goods to Dallas per his request.] [9] They were received by Mich-ell &amp; Co., who have since failed to pay for them, except to the extent of $50.00. [It does not seem to be disputed that A. J. Michell had been W. B. Robinson\u2019s agent at Tyler, an agent charged with various general and extensive powers. It appears from his own testimony that he was in the habit of receiving all goods consigned by express or freight to Robinson, of keeping a bank account in Robinson\u2019s name and of honoring drafts drawn on Robinson at that point. His powers, as you see, were very, very extensive. He was practically, as I recall the testimony which was read from his deposition, Robinson\u2019s alter ego at that point, with authority to do pretty much all that Robinson could himself if he were there.] [10] The firm of Harrington &amp; Goodman failing to collect from Robinson or from Michell &amp; Co. the full value of the goods embraced in this shipment, have sued the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company for the value of the consignment, charging it as carrier with the value of the goods committed to it, but which it has since failed to deliver or to return to the consignors. The defense, I take it, is of the following character: It is asserted, in the first place, on behalf of the defendant, that it is not a common carrier of goods, but that its position is that of a forwarder. It claims to be a corporation which receives and forwards goods, taking upon itself the expense of transportation, for which it receives a compensation from the owners of the goods, but it has no concern in the vessels or wagons or cars by which the goods are transported, and no interest in the freight as freight. [It claims, therefore, that it not to be regarded as a common carrier, but as a mere bailee for hire. It stands on the doctrine of law that a bailee for hire, of the character of forwarder, is not bound, as is a common carrier, to deliver the goods committed to its care for transportation safely, at all events, except in a case where such safe delivery has been made impossible by the act of God or of the public enemy, but is bound only to perform its duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>transportation with care and fidelity, and show that any loss of the goods which may have arisen, has arisen not through its default or through the default of its servants- On that proposition of law the defendant claims to be excused from any liability to the plaintiffs in this case, because, it is said, it has used due care and diligence in the handling and delivery of the plaintiffs\u2019 goods.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">Another point of its defense is that it has complied with the contract made between it and the firm of Harrington <em>&amp; </em>Goodman, in this, that since the intention of the firm of Harrington &amp; Goodman was that the goods should be delivered to A. J. Michell, although the consignment was made to Robinson, Michell was the real party to whom it was intended the goods should be delivered, and that as he did get the goods, it is discharged. Failing that, it stands upon the point that Michell was Robinson\u2019s agent to receive these goods, and that the course of Robinson\u2019s dealings through Michell at Tyler, had been such as to justify it and its agents (not only as to Robinson, but as to all parties dealing with Robinson through them) in the belief that Michell had the authority to receive the goods, or to cause them to be forwarded to some other party at some other point. That I understand to be the defense outlined by the counsel for the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company. [Besides this, it claims, and I think the claim is one to which you must pay great attention, that Harrington &amp; Goodman have ratified the delivery of these goods to Michell &amp; Co. by accepting a payment on account of their price from Michell, and by&gt; failing to complain of that misdelivery until nearly twenty months had elapsed after the date of the consignment of the goods.] [12]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">[It is my opinion, and I charge you as matter of law, that under the terms of the contract entered into between the consignors and the transportation company, as evidenced by the shipping receipt and the bill of lading, it was the duty of the transportation company to deliver that case of dry goods to Mr. Robinson at Tyler, Texas, or show a good excuse for not having done so, that excuse being something other than negligence on their part or on the part of their employees or agents in the delivery of the goods. It lies on the transportation company to show that it was not negligent, and that under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of the case, its employees did all that prudent, reasonable, conunonsense business men would have done to insure a proper delivery to the proper person of the goods which it received from these plaintiffs. It is for you to determine whether they have done that, whether they have performed their full duty in delivering these goods.] [13]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">[If you believe that the goods in question were delivered to a person especially authorized by the consignee or by the consignee\u2019s general course of dealing with him, to receive these goods, and that the reshipment of the goods to Dallas, Texas, was within the powers of Michell, as evidenced by the course of dealing, to which he has testified, between himself and Robinson, then you must find a verdict for the defendant.] [14]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">[In determining whether or not these parties were negligent, you have a right to take into consideration the fact that Harrington &amp; Goodman, after the delivery of these goods, corresponded with Michell &amp; Co., and received money 'from them, and treated them just as if they had been the parties to whom the consignment had originally been made.] [15]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">[If, on the other hand, you are of the opinion that the\u2019Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company was negligent in making the delivery in Tyler, Texas, and in reshipping the goods to the new consignees named by Michell, viz., Michell &amp; Co., at Dallas, Texas, if you believe that there was nothing in the course of dealings between Robinson and the express agents at Tyler to warrant the belief that Michell had authority to give the order for the reshipment which he then gave, your verdict must be for the plaintiff,] [16] and the verdict in their favor must be for the amount of the bill of goods, 1430.60, with interest from April, 1890, less the #50.00 which have since been paid by Michell &amp; Co., and which counsel for the plaintiffs have agreed shall be credited upon tliis claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">I have been requested by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to charge you as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">1. Under the receipt offered in evidence, the defendant is responsible, as a common carrier, for the through carriage of the case of dry goods from Philadelphia to Tyler, Texas. <em>Answer : </em>That point I refuse. [17]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">2. Under the bill of lading offered in evidence, the defendant is responsible, as a common carrier, for the through car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>riage of the case of dry goods from Philadelphia to Tyler, Texas. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. [18]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">8. If the jury believe, under the evidence, that the defendant agreed to carry said case of dry goods from Philadelphia to Tyler, Texas, the defendant is responsible for the through carriage of said goods and the delivery thereof to W. B. Robinson. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">4. The defendant had no right, without plaintiffs\u2019 authority, to deliver to any other person than W. B. Robinson. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm, with this qualification: It was their right to deliver the goods either to <em>W. </em>B. Robinson, or W. B. Robinson\u2019s duly authorized agent, and,- if you find that Michell was Robinson\u2019s duly authorized agent to receive the goods or to order their reconsignment and reshipment to another point, your verdict must be for the defendant. [19]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">fi. The misdelivery of the case of dry goods, or the delivery to the wrong person, is not a \u201closs, detriment or damage,\u201d within the meaning of the words in the following provision of the receipt, to wit: \u201c It is further stipulated and agreed that in case of any loss, detriment or damage, done to or sustained by any of the property herein receipted for, during such transportation, whereby any liability or responsibility shall or may be incurred, that company alone shall be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same maybe at the time of the happening thereof,\u201d and said provision in the receipt is no answer to plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case. <em>Answer: </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">6. The misdelivery of the said case of drygoods, or the delivery to persons not entitled to receive it, is not a \u201c loss \u201d or \u201c damage \u201d within the meaning of the words in the third condition of the bill of lading, to wit: \u201c No carriers shall be liable for loss or damage not incurred on its own road. . . . Claims for loss or damage must be made in writing to the agent at point of delivery promptly after arrival of the property, and if delayed for more than thirty days after the delivery of the property, or after due time for the delivery thereof, no carrier hereunder shall be liable in any event.\u201d And said condition is no answer to plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">7. The third condition of tire bill of lading which provided that \u201c Claims for loss or damage must be made in writing to the agent at point of delivery promptly after the arrival of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>erty, and if delayed for more than thirty days after the delivery of the property, or after due time for the delivery thereof, no carrier hereunder shall be liable in any event,\u201d is binding, if at all, upon the consignee only and not upon the shipper. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">8. The third condition of the bill of lading quoted in the seventh point, if it does apply to the shipper, is an unreasonable condition. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">9. The defendant must deliver the bill of lading at or near about the time the goods were received for transportation in order to claim the benefit of the provisions of the third condition in the bill of lading. <em>Answer : </em>That point I refuse. It was the right of the plaintiffs in this case to ask for a bill of lading, and if they did not do it, it was their own fault. [20]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">10. As the goods shipped to W. B. Robinson, February, 1890, were delivered to Michell in April, 1890, and no bill of lading or copy thereof was delivered or handed to plaintiffs until September, 1891, the defendant cannot claim the benefit of the provisions of the third condition of the bill of lading. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">11. If the defendant relies upon the third condition of the bill of lading, quoted in the seventh point, it thereby affirms that the bill of lading is the contract between the parties to this suit. <em>Ansiver : </em>That point I affirm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">12. The acceptance of any payment on account by the plaintiffs, from the person or persons, to whom the goods were wrongfully delivered, is no bar to this suit against the carrying company, but the amount so received goes in reduction of damages. <em>Answer : </em>That point I affirm. Although I will add this qualification, that it seems to me that the receipt of money on account of the price of these goods from the parties in whose hands the goods came after their reconsignment from Tyler, Texas, is evidence to show a ratification and approval of the delivery which was made by the defendant to Michell &amp; Co. [21]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">13. Under all the evidence in this case, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. [22]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-11\">I have been requested by the defendant to charge you as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-12\">1. The defendant\u2019s contract in respect of the goods in question required it only to carry said goods promptly and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>to-East St. Louis, and there promptly'to deliver them in good order and condition to the next carrier on their route to destination, exercising reasonable care and prudence in the selection of the next succeeding carrier. If defendant has done this, it cannot be held responsible for damage to or loss of the said goods happening beyond East St. Louis, or for the failure on the part of the carrier or carriers beyond East St. Louis to fulfil their obligations in respect of the said goods. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. I regard the duty of the defendant in this case to be that it should deliver the goods not to East St. Louis only, but to Tyler, Texas. That was the destination fixed by their contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">2. Plaintiffs having accepted without' question the benefits of what they claim to be an unauthorized delivery of the goods in question, knowing at the time that the goods were delivered to other than the consignee, are estopped from disputing the propriety of such delivery. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. I do not regard their collection of the sum, which it is admitted they received from Michell &amp; Co., to amount to an estoppel, but I regard the receipt of that money, and the attempt to collect more from Michell &amp; Co. as extremely strong evidence that the delivery made, as has been described by the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company, or their subagents at Tyler, was ratified and approved by the plaintiffs in this case. [23]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">3. Plaintiffs having failed to notify the defendant until a year and a half after the delivery of the goods in question at the terminus to other than the consignee, and having known all that time that such delivery was made to other than the consignee, if'defendant, owing to such failure to so notify, was misled to its injury to believe the said delivery was proper, plaintiffs are estopped from asserting that such delivery was erroneous. <em>Answer: </em>That point I will refuse, but I regard their failure for a year and a half after the delivery of the goods to a person other than the consignee named in the shipping receipt, to notify the transportation company of such misdelivery extremely strong evidence that the plaintiffs concurred in that delivery and ratified the act of the defendant in giving the goods to Michell &amp; Co. [24]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">4. Plaintiffs having recognized, as the party to whom the goods ought to have been delivered,, the party who actually did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>receive them, by writing him for payment and accepting from him part payment therefor, are estopped from claiming that said goods were delivered to the wrong party. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. I do not regard such acts as an estoppel; but, as I have already said, in my opinion, that is very strong evidence of an acquiescence in the delivery which was made by this defendant to Michell &amp; Co., and a ratification of what the transportation company did in fulfilling its contract, or an acceptance of the act of the defendant company as a complete fulfilment and discharge of their contract of transportation. [25]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">5. By the -terms of the contract of shipment as claimed by plaintiffs herein, it is provided that \u201c claims for loss or damage must be made in writing to the agent at point of delivery promptly after arrival of the property, and if delayed for more than thirty days after the delivery of the property, or after due time for the delivery thereof, no carrier hereunder shall be liable in any event; \u201d and, as this provision is binding upon plaintiffs and they have failed to show a compliance therewith, they are not entitled to recover any damages for alleged loss of, or damages to, the goods in question. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">6. Under the provisions of the contract of shipment in question, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, and your verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>That point I refuse. I think I have charged you as fully as the case warrants, and I shall leave the matter in your hands. It is your duty to render a fair verdict. Let not the fact that the defendant is a corporation influence you in this matter. You are sworn to try the case on the law and the evidence. [If you believe that the defendant company performed its contract to transship these goods to Robinson, at Tyler, Texas, negligently, that a reshipraent to Dallas, under a reconsignment to Michell &amp; Co., was a thing, which, under the circumstances, no reasonable, sensible, ordinary, everyday, commonsense man would have done, then your verdict must be for the plaintiffs for the amount which they have claimed; but, if you believe that, the defendant company, or its agent, the Pacific Express Company, did just what any reasonable, commonsense, everyday business man would have done under the circumstances, and that they were not guilty of negligence, then your verdict must be for the defendant.] [26] And so, if you believe that the plaintiffs have acqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>esced in the delivery made and have accepted what the defendant did as a fulfilment and discharge of its contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

And the error consists in presenting to the jury one view only of the evidence, and that the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>wliicli defendants relied upon to prove ratification and in neglecting entirely to present the plaintiffs\u2019 view; and in throwing the weight of the judicial opinion entirely in favor of defendant. This is error: Larzelere v. Tiel, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 109; Minick v. Gring, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">The judge referred to the acceptance of payment on account as evidence only of ratification, and strongly intimated to the jury that, in his opinion, that was all it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">He did not notice the plaintiffs\u2019 position that they had a right to accept money for their goods from any person who wrongfully came into possession of them, and they were not bound to rely for payment in full from a person who might be without responsibility, and who resided several hundred miles away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">Nor did he call attention to the fact that the carrier had never notified plaintiffs of the delivery; nor that the carrier had received all he was entitled to receive by having the amount paid on account deducted from the damages he would otherwise have been obliged to pay.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-8\"><em>Chas. </em>Heebner, with him <em>J. Claude </em>Bedford, for appellee.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3p\">It is submitted that the appellants have no just ground for complaint as to the trial of this cause in the court below. What the Superior Court (see 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 282) indicated as errors in the former trial were remedied in this latest trial; the so-called bill of lading was admitted in evidence, and the facts in the case were submitted to the jury and submitted fairly for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">It is admitted that these goods were carried \u201csafely, promptly, and properly \u201d to destination, and there was no attempt to show that defendant had a \u201cline\u201d or \u201croute \u201d extending to destination, Tyler, Tex., and, in point of fact, it did not have such \u201cline\u201d or \u201croute.\u201d The defendant is distinctly a forwarding company, holding itself out as such, and known as such, not having anj&gt;- road or owning or controlling any motive power, but having special facilities for accomplishing the expeditious movement of freight. The engagement in this receipt is by express words to forward. The word \u201cforward\u201d has a distinct, well-recognized meaning in contracts for the transportation of goods, and all the terms of this shipping receipt show plainly that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the word \u201cforward \u201d in it was used there in its well-known and legal sense. See Mullarkey v. R. R. Co., 9 Phila. 114, and Express Co. v. Bank, 69 Pa. 394. See also plaintiff\u2019s argument in report of the former hearing, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 384.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACeU\">December 13, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AGjs\">Beaver, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">When this case was before us nearly a year ago, we sent it back, in order to allow the bill of lading furnished by the defendant to the plaintiffs to be received in evidence, and also that the facts relating to the delivery of the goods by the der fendant to the consignee might be submitted to the jury. Both of our directions were observed in the trial of the cause. A verdict was found by the jury for the defendants, upon which judgment was entered and from which the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The record shows twenty-eight assignments of error, but the first eight of these were practically withdrawn at the argument as not having been made in accordance with our rules. The material questions in the case related to the delivery of the goods shipped by the plaintiffs to the consignee at the place of destination, and the effect of the receipt of a portion of the value of the goods by the plaintiffs from a person other than the consignee. The consideration of these questions involves others which are, for the most part, collateral and incidental. The main point in the case was the delivery to Miehell, as the agent of the consignee, and the reshipment of the goods by his direction to a point other than the place of destination. The facts in regard to this delivery were in the main fairly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The plaintiffs make their principal argument on the twenty-second assignment of error which involves the refusal of the court to affirm the point that \u201c under all the evidence in this case, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs.\u201d It is difficult to see how the court could have affirmed this point, in view of our directions in Goodman v. Transportation Company, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 282, in which we say that \u201c the facts should have been submitted to the jury,\u201d referring to the facts in relation to the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The only question in the case is as to the manner in which those facts were so submitted.- All of the plaintiffs\u2019 points, except the first, second, ninth and thirteenth, were affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>absolutely or with proper qualifications. How tbe plaintiffs could consistently ask the court to say that \u201c under the receipt offered in evidence, the defendant is responsible as a common carrier for the through carriage of the case of dry goods from Philadelphia to Tyler, Texas,\u201d we cannot understand, their whole contention being that the receipt was merged in the bill of lading, nor can we see how the court could have affirmed a like proposition in regard to the bill of lading, when the receipt itself provides that \u201c the acceptance of this receipt for goods, made subject to the provisions of the bill of lading of this company, makes this an agreement between the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company and carriers engaged in transporting said goods and all parties interested in the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The receipt and bill of lading, taken together, constituted the contract between the parties. No request was made of the court to determine as a matter of law whether the contract between the parties made the defendants common carriers or merely forwarders, and indeed, under the facts of the case, the question was of little practical importance. There is no denial of the fact that the goods were safely transported and delivered at Tyler, Texas. The real question, as we have already intimated, was, were they properly delivered? The trial judge in the court below, however, evidently treated the contract of the defendant as that of a common carrier, and charged the jury that \u201c it was the duty of the transportation company to deliver that case of dry goods to Mr. Robinson at Tyler, Texas, or show a good excuse for not having done so, that excuse being something other than negligence on their part or on the part of their employees or agents in the delivery of the goods.\u201d The court below did not impose any duty upon the plaintiffs of showing negligence on the part of the defendant; but, on the other hand, made it incumbent upon the defendant to show that it was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Taking the charge as a whole, in connection with the answers to the points of both plaintiffs and defendant, we can see no substantial error. The plaintiffs\u2019 side of the case was presented to the jury quite as favorably for them as they had a right to ask or expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
