The tenant could have moved the building and defalked the cost or he could have surrendered possession, or if retaining possession he is only entitled to.deduet the rental value of the building unmoved from what it would have been if moved. An affidavit is defective which does not allege such difference of rental value as the measure of tenant\u2019s damages.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b57-11\">Argued Oct. 13, 1897.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzJ\">Appeal, No. 94, Oct.

Farrell, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says, that he -is the defendant in the above case, that he has a just and legal defense to the entire claim of the plaintiff of the following nature and character, to wit: The plaintiff in his statement filed has not set forth the full and entire agreement between him and the defendant. At and before the time when defendant agreed to rent the premises in question the plaintiff expressly promised and agreed that said candy store should be on the said boardwalk, and if the said boardwalk should be moved out towards the ocean, as was then contemplated, that he, the plaintiff, would move the said store out to the new boardwalk; that this promise and agreement on the part of the plaintiff was relied on by the defendant and induced him to lease the premises in question; that the season for business at said place is during the months of July and August; that on or about the-day of June, 1896, the said boardwalk was moved out about one hundred and fifty feet from the said store of defendant; that the plaintiff, though often requested, neglected and refused to move defendant\u2019s store out to said boardwalk, and even refused to allow defendant to do so at his own expense; that in consequence of the neglect of the plaintiff to move said store out to said boardwalk the defendant\u2019s business was ruined and destroyed, and by reason thereof he lost in his business more than $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">Defendant, relying on the promise and agreement of the plaintiff to move said store out to the new boardwalk, if erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>during the term of his lease, paid to the plaintiff the sum of $200, on account of the said rent, on January 18, 1896, that said boardwalk was moved out at the season when the business of the defendant just .commenced, and that defendant was not able to secure at that time any other store. That the business of said store depended on its being situate on the boardwalk solely, that after the boardwalk was moved out, and all other candy stores were moved out to it, the defendant\u2019s store remained about 150 feet back in its old position, and was. inaccessible to the people passing along the said boardwalk, and was worthless to defendant, who by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to move said store out to the said boardwalk as agreed, suffered damages to the amount of $1,000, which he will .claim against the plaintiff at the trial, and ask for a certificate in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">S. Morris Wain, being duly affirmed, says that he is the atorney for defendant in the above case; that defendant recently moved from Philadelphia to Atlantic City, where he now resides; that deponent wrote plaintiff\u2019s attorney .to wait a few days until he could find defendant\u2019s address and -to write plaintiff, who also lived in Atlantic City, for the address of defendant; that in consequence of a letter from plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which is hereto attached, deponent makes this affidavit for defendant, who is out -of fhe city; that the above affidavit is true to the best of his information and belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">\u2022 \u25a0 <em>Error assigned </em>was making absolute .the plaintiff\u2019s rule\u2019-for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWn\"><em>S.

But if he remains in possession he must render the price thereof, according to his agreement.

Certainly a sweeping assertion that defendant \u201c suffered damages to the extent of one thousand dollars,\u201d unsupported by any detail showing how the amount is computed or in what manner it was suffered, is insufficient: McBrier v. Marshall, 126 Pa. 390; Hopple v. Bunting, 3 W. N. C. 472; Sitgreaves v. Griffith, 2 W. N.

All the statements therein contained are, of course, based upon information and belief. Technically there should have been an averment of an expectation on the part of the defendant to prove the facts thus stated. The affidavit, however, is in itself so faulty that it is not necessary to rely upon this technicality to affirm the judgment of the court below. Admitting, that the covenant on the part of the plaintiff to move the building occupied by the defendant to the board walk thereafter to be erected was a part of the agreement for the lease of the building, and admitting also the failure of the plaintiff to comply with his agreement, after notice and request by the defendant, two courses were open to the defendant. He could have moved the building, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and defalked the cost of moving it from the amount of the rent, or he could have surrendered the possession, or offered to surrender it, and have relieved himseLf from the payment of the rent, or he could have retained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>possession and deducted from the rent the difference between the rental value of the store room as it would have been, if the stipulations of the agreement as alleged by him had been complied with, and its rental value as occupied by him: Peterson v. Haight, 3 Wharton, 150; Warner v. Caulk, 3 Wharton, 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The allegation in the affidavit of the amount of damages sustained by the defendant \u201c by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to move the store out to the boardwalk \u201d is vague and ttncertain. This estimate of damages was evidently -based upon supposed loss of trade out of which prospective profits were to be realized. This is not a proper measure of damages in such a case. The rule laid down in Fairman v. Fluck, 5 Watts, 516, based upon Schuylkill Navigation Co. v. Thoburn, 7 Sergeant &amp; Rawle, 411, which is a leading case, is that the measure of damages for the breach of such a covenant as this on the part of the landlord \u201c ought to be the difference 'between the worth of the premises in the condition in which they remained and that which they would have been in, had the landlord\u2019s covenant been performed; or, in other words, so much less as they would have rented for without the covenant.\u201d The defendant makes no effort to inform the court as to the difference in rental value between the store as it was to be under the covenant alleged by him, and the store as it was during his tenancy. The affidavit of defense was, therefore, insufficient, and the court was clearly justified in making absolute the rule for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
