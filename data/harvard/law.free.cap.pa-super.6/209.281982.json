Before Brubaker, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\">It appears from the record that John E. Gouchenauer made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. At the time the assignee made his appraisement, Gouchenauer said to him that he wanted none of the personal property and he then made no claim to have any real estate appraised to him under the deed of assignment, but he subsequently said to the assignee that he wanted $300 out of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The appraisement of the assignor\u2019s property amounted to $779.25 of whieh $537.50 was real estate, and $241.75 personal property. The assignee made public sale of the' personal property, and sold the same for $207.67, of whieh amount John E. Gouchenauer became purchaser to the amount of $68.60, with the understanding, that when the assignor received his $300 exemption he would pay the assignee for the goods purchased by him, the assignor, at the public sale. No other or further claim was ever made by the assignor from the assignee. The real estate was subsequently sold by plaintiff under a judgment antedating the assignment, and the proceeds amounted to about $278. After the vend. ex. had issued, and some two years from the time of the assignment, the defendant claimed from the sheriff the $300 debtor\u2019s exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">The court discharged the rule. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was discharging rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-8\"><em>Charles I. </em>Landis, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-9\"><em>W.

It seems unnecessary to discuss this proposition; for, even if it were to be conceded, the defendant would be left in no better position. The fi. fa. issued on December 12,1895, and the land was condemned. It was not until after the vend, ex. had issued, a year later, that the claim was made. These facts bring the case within the well settled rule that the claim must not be unnecessarily delayed until costs have been incurred which otherwise might have been readily avoided. The case cannot be distinguished from Moore v. McMorrow, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Order affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
