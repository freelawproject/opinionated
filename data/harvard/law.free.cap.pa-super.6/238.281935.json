Intentions in such cases are not the subject of inquiry. The court can only inquire into the legal effect of admitted facts.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b264-9\">Argued.

This demurrer -was overruled by the court below, with leave, whereupon the defendant filed an affidavit of defense; upon which the plaintiff took a rule for judgment, which rule the court discharged and an exception was taken thereto by the plaintiff under the act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-12\">From the plaintiff\u2019s statement the following allegations appear :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-13\">Henry K. Wampole, the defendant, was the lessee under a lease for a factory building from James A; Weir, landlord, for one year from February 1, 1895, at the rent of $100 per month (reduced by the parties to $75.00 per month).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Tbe premises were sold by the sheriff: as of the landlord, Weir, to the building association, a mortgagee, the plaintiff herein, and the lease was assigned by Weir to the plaintiff,, after the sheriff\u2019s deed was acknowledged. After that assignment, Wampole paid the rent, $75.00 per month, to the building association for several months, and, afterwards, on August 26, 1896, gave written notice to tbe association that he wished the lease discontinued after the expiration of the current term (February 1, 1897), the lease containing a provision for renewal until notice should be given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">He paid the rent up to and including that due October 1, 1896, but refused to pay that falling due November 1,1896, $75.00, and it was for that amount that this suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">To the statement, the defendant filed a special demurrer, and the court overruled it with leave, etc. He then filed an affidavit of defense which was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">That he is the defendant in the above entitled cause and has a just and true defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, of the following nature and character, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">That at the time the lease was entered into by him with James A. Weir, on February 1, 1895, there was a mortgage executed by the said James A. Weir, against the said demised premises, dated September 1, 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">That on March 24,1894, a judgment.was entered against the said James A. Weir, and that the said premises were sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, to tbe plaintiff, on the 2d day of March, 1896, and a deed therefor made by the sheriff to the said plaintiff, dated March 7, 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">That the said defendant occupied said premises together with his partner, Frank Y. Wireman, for a few months, but the said Henry K. Wampole and Frank Y. Wireman dissolved partnership, and that deponent left said premises at least three months prior to the date of said sheriff\u2019s sale, so that when the said sale was made he was no longer in possession of said premises, and the rent for said premises had been paid by Frank Y. Wireman to James A. Weir, the then owner of the building, and accepted by him, and subsequent to the sale he paid it to plaintiff, who thereby accepted said Wireman as their tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-12\">Your deponent did not know that said premises had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sold at sheriff\u2019s sale to the No. 2 Assistance Building &amp; Loan Association, or to any one, until five months subsequent to said sale, to wit: on the 20th day of August, when the agent of plaintiff called upon him and informed him of these facts, and he thereupon, being unadvised as to his rights, paid to said agent of plaintiff the sum of #25.00, and which was the only sum paid by your deponent to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">Your deponent did not pay this under the lease, or because he was bound by the lease, but because at that time he thought he might have been responsible for the occupancy of the premises by his previous partner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">That thereupon, or a few days thereafter, to wit: on the 26th of August, he notified the plaintiff that he was not responsible under said lease and wished it discontinued. Such notice was not intended as, nor did it convey, any agreement or undertaking to be responsible under said lease or any engagement that he was so responsible, but that, on the contrary, your deponent neither made any agreement to become responsible under said lease, and never occupied said premises or paid any rent to the plaintiff under said lease. He has always repudiated any obligation to be bound by said lease and still does. There was never any agreement between him and the plaintiff either by any communication or contract, verbal or written, whereby he agreed to be or become the tenant of said plaintiff, or be bound by the provisions of the said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">All of which your deponent believes to be true, and therefore avers and expects to be able to prove upon the trial of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to enter judgment against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-8\"><em>J. H. </em>Sloan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avf\">It is submitted that, even if there had not been an assignment of the lease to the plaintiff, it had a right as sheriff\u2019s vendee to affirm the lease under the Act of June 16, 1836, sec. 119, P. L. 755, which gives the same remedies to recover rent as the defendant in the execution had. See 1 Pepper &amp; Lewis\u2019 Dig. title \u201c Execution,\u201d page 1993, sec. 164, and authorities cited. It is unnecessary, however, to consider tins aspect of the question in view of the assignment of the lease by the defendant in the execution to this plaintiff.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Afr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>December 13, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-2\"><em>J. Campbell </em>Lancaster, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2O\">There is but a narrow question of law raised by the facts in this case, and that is whether the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755, par. 119 (1 P. &amp; L. Dig. pp. 1993-4, par. 164), has altered the rule of the common law as to the effect upon a tenant under a lease, by reason of the sale of the leased premises under an incumbrance antedating said lease. See on this point Funk v. Voneida, 11 S. &amp; R. 109, particularly the opinion of Mr. Justice Duncan, on page 112, citing the cases of Levett v. Withrington, 1 Lutw. 97 ; Maule v. Ashmeade, 20 Pa. 482; Jackson &amp; Gross on Landlord and Tenant, par. 1015.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-3\">While there are no cases on this doctrine precisely, the theory is borne out in Duff v. Wilson, 69 Pa. 316, in which it was held that there could be no recovery against the surety of a lessee, where the demised premises had been sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale under a mortgage antedating the lease.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AuG\">Beaver, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The error complained of by the appellant is the refusal of the court below \u201c to enter judgment against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\u201d The grounds upon which this refusal was based are not given and we are left, therefore, to seek them in the plaintiff\u2019s statement and the defendant\u2019s affidavit of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Appeals under the provisions of the act of April 18,1874,, P. L. 64, have not been favored by the Supreme Court. From Griffith v. Sitgreaves, 81* Pa. 378, one of the earlier cases, to Paine v. Kindred, 163 Pa. 638, the decisions have been practically uniform. We may say, in the language of the latter' case:: \u201cWe do not mean to interfere where rules for judgment have-been discharged in the lower courts in doubtful and uncertain cases, but only in such as are very clear and free of doubt.\u201d' But where there is a case clear and free of doubt our duty is: not doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s statement shows it clearly entitled to the rents,, accruing subsequent to the sheriff\u2019s sale, under the lease from Wier to Wampole, in accordance' with the provisions of the-119th section of the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755. Doe&amp; the affidavit of defense, giving the fullest effect to its statements,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>raise any issue of fact between the plaintiff and the defendant ? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The plaintiff, as is admitted by the defendant, gave notice subsequently to the sale of its claim for rent, which was in effect an exercise of its option to make him its tenant. The defendant practically admitted the claim by paying part of the rent. He endeavored to limit or modify the effect of this payment by stating the reasons which influenced him to make it. These, however, were based entirely upon mental states and processes which could not, in the nature of the case, be given in evidence on the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">His acknowledgment of the lease and of his obligation thereunder are further shown by the notice given by him to the plaintiff, in accordance with the terms of the lease, of his desire to have it discontinued after the expiration of the then current year. What his intention may have been in giving this notice is not the subject of inquiry. We can only inquire as to the legal effect of the admitted fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">There can be no question as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover: Menough\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. &amp; S. 432. It was not only the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale but was the assignee of the lease. The defendant admitted its right to the rent by a payment in part and by doing such acts under the lease as Avere inconsistent with the claim of non-liability thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Under the statement and affidavit of defense, there are no facts for a jury and, as we view the laAv of the case, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The decree of the court below is, therefore, reversed and judgment is uoav directed to be entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant for such sum as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the court below why such judgment should not be so entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">A motion for reargument was made which Avas refused.</p>\n<author id=\"b268-10\">Pee Cueiam,</author>\n<p id=\"A9v\">January 18, 1898:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\u201c The effect on the lease of the sale under a prior incumbrance \u201d was not overlooked in the consideration of the case nor in the opinion filed therein. It is expressly stated that \u201c The plaintiff\u2019s statement shows it clearly entitled to the rents accruing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>subsequent to the sheriff\u2019s sale under the lease from Weir to Wampole in accordance with the provisions of the 119th section of the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755.\u201d It is further considered in the latter part of the opinion, in which it is stated: \u201c There can be no - question ,as to the' plaintiff\u2019s right to recover: Menough\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. &amp; S. 432 (1843). It was not only the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale but was the assignee of the lease. The defendant admitted its right to the rent by a payment in part and by doing such acts under the lease as were inconsistent with the claim of nonliability thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">Duff v. Wilson, 69 Pa. 316, has no possible application here. In that case the sheriff\u2019s vendee elected to disaffirm the lease and took possession of the premises, thereby evicting the tern ant, but Mr. Justice Shakswood distinctly says that \u201cThe purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale might have affirmed- the lease and required the rent to be paid to him, as assignee of the reversion.\u201d The purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under an incumbrance prior to the lease can affirm or disaffirm the lease at his pleasure. In this case the building association chose to affirm it and hold the defendant as its tenant and, in effect, exercised its option by demanding the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The whole case was fully considered and all the points raised in the original hearing sufficiently met in the opinion already filed. The motion for the reargument is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
