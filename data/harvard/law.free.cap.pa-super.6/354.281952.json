(3) In holding as follows : \u201c The contract was in reality a conditional sale, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the law allows these contracts to be clothed in the dress of bailments, and sustains them as such in the interest of both the vendor and vendee.\u201d (4) In holding that \u201cthe penalty for nonpayment is a redelivery of the organ to the vendor, and the repossession is a discharge of the penalty. The vendor could have proceeded against the defendant for the overdue instalments ; he saw fit, however, to take the other remedy; either was complete in itself, and the plaintiffs in default could collect the money or retake the organ. The two remedies were not cumulative; they could not adopt both unless it was plainly expressed in the contract, or a necessary implication from its terms.\u201d (5) In holding that \u201c at the end of the term, if the payments were made, the organ was the property of the defendant, without the further payment of a penny.\u201d (6) In holding that \u201c taking back the organ in default of payments was a rescission of the contract, and an end of any personal obligation on the part of the lessee.\u201d (7) In holding that \u201c the defendant says she returned the organ because she was unable to make the payments. This was a privilege as well as a duty under her contract. In default of any monthly payment the said lessee agrees to redeliver said organ to the party of the first part. Even if this provision was made for the protection of the lessors, and they alone could take advantage of it, still, as they accepted the organ, as alleged in the affidavit, it was a redelivery under the terms of the lease, because of default in payments.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>Chapman </em>Chapman, with them <em>Joseph </em>Fornance, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvI\">This affidavit does not set out any agreement between plaintiffs and defendant, either to accept said organ as a partial or a total satisfaction. It can be presumed that there was no such agreement, otherwise it would have been set out, and it is therefore the more necessary for affiant to set out the facts on which she bases her statement, that she \u201c verily believes \u201d the plaintiffs accepted said surrender in full satisfaction. Her averment of acceptance by plaintiffs, without anything to show how, when, or in what manner, is a statement of a legal conclusion, and insufficient: Bank v.

Here we are required to construe the agreement as between the original parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The form of the contract is one of hiring or bailment, but the parties evidently intended that the event should be an absolute purchase: Seanor v. McLaughlin, 165 Pa. 154. In construing this contract and in determining the rights and liabilities under it, we must look not so much to form as to substance and intention. The plaintiff under the form of a lease, in effect, sold to the defendant an organ on certain expressed conditions. Payment was to be made in periodic instalments covering a specified period. These instalments were called rent, but as between the original parties they were in fact payments on account of the purchase money. On the failure to pay any instalment the defendant agreed to redeliver the chattel to the plaintiff. On a failure so to deliver the plaintiff had the right to reposses himself of the chattel, should he so desire. In this case the defendant fell into default and did not immediately redeliver to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not exercise his right to take possession but allowed subsequent defaults to occur, and did not at any time during the running of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tract repossess himself of the chattel. The only construction that can reasonably be placed upon this course of action is that the plaintiff extended the time for the payment of the instalments.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">At the expiration of the time when all the instalments should have been paid, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the total ampunt stipulated by the contract to be paid with interest. Failing to immediately demand this,'the organ seems to have remained with the defendant for a considerable time. Being unable to discharge the balance of her indebtedness she avers \u201c That she surrendered and delivered said organ to said plaintiffs on or about July 31, 1893.\u201d This was a right as well as an obligation under the conditions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The affidavit contains the further averment: \u201c That at the time of the return to said plaintiffs of said organ the same was worth more money than the balance of the contract price.\u201d She further avers that <em>\u201c </em>She believes and expects to be able to prove that said plaintiffs accepted said organ in full settlement and satisfaction of any claims they might have against her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">While the affidavit might have been more specific in detail, yet we are satisfied that the averments are sufficiently set forth to prevent the entry of judgment, and we do not regard it as necessary at this' stage of the cause to do more than indicate our views of the contract as above expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The order of the court below discharging the rule for judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
