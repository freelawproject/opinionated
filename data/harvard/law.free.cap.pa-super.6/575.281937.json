The defense was, that the defendant, a policy holder, having paid all assessments due up to the time, surrendered a policy, which surrender was accepted by agreement of the company and promises given for the return of the premium note. The court below left the question to the jury as to whether such an agreement or surrender or cancelation was made, and whether all assessments for which the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>was liable at the time of such cancelation had been paid by her to the company.

(4) In admitting testimony on behalf of the defendant purporting' to show a surrender of the policy to the company, and that the company canceled the policy and relieved insured from all liability thereafter. (5) In admitting evidence on behalf of defendant tending to show that the policy was sent to the company and that the defendant received a notice from the company saying that the policy would be canceled as soon as the assessments were paid, and that the assessments were paid. (6) In admitting evidence, under objection, on the part of the defendant, to show that defendant had received a letter from the officers of the company, dated June 7, 1876, signed by the secretary; the purpose of the offer being to show that on June 7, 1876, assessment No. 2 was made by the company; to be followed by a notice from the company showing that the policy would be canceled on the payment of the assessments up to that date.

Hite, 94 Pa. 394. The secretary of an insurance company is the proper organ of communication between the company and the assured. It was clearly within the scope of his authority to inform the assured of the cancelation of her policy, either upon failure of the assured to comply with the condition'upon which it was issued and for the nonperformance of which the company had reserved the right to cancel it, or by agreement between the company and the-assured. If the policy was in fact canceled, there can be no recovery of the assessments on the premium note given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>defendant, unless she, were liable for losses sustained by the company prior to such cancelation: Columbia Insurance Co. v. Masonheimer, 76 Pa. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The defendant became a member of a Mutual Fire Insurance Co., and, upon notice of an assessment upon her premium note to pay losses, she surrendered her policy to the agent from whom she had received it and requested it to be canceled. It was sent by the agent to the company for cancelation. The secretary acknowledged its receipt for cancelation, and the defendant was informed by the agent that it had been canceled. She subsequently received notice of two assessments, in one' of which there was a statement of assets and liabilities, showing abundance of assets for the payment of liabilities, with the assurance that, upon the payment of these assessments, the premium note would be returned, and she released from all further claims. These assessments were paid by her to the attorney designated by the company to receive them. -Upon this state of facts, the court below was asked to say that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for the full amount of an assessment authorized by the court of common pleas of Schuylkill county, to be laid, nearly ten years after the payment of the assessments last mentioned by the defendant. It is not surprising that the court refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The charge of the court, in submitting the case to the jury, is clear, full and fair. The only part of it with which the appellants find fault, is that in which the only question in the case which was submitted to the jury is stated by the court as follows: \u201c The only question submitted to you and the only grounds upon which you could find for the defendant is this : Did the directors of the company cancel her policy ? If they did not so act, then she continued to be a member and was liable to assessment. If you find that the proper authorities of the company did cancel her policy, then you will say that she is relieved Norn liability under its terms, provided it is proved by the defendant that all the losses that had occurred down to the date of that cancelation had been paid, i. e., realized by the compamn When I say \u2018 paid,\u2019 I do not mean that the company had actually passed the money over to the person or persons who had the loss, but that the company had realized from its members, including Mrs. Lichtenwalner, what they were bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>to pay to satisfy all those losses. If the defendant has not shown that she, Mrs. Lichtenwalner, had paid to the company her share'of all the losses that were incurred down to the period when the policy was canceled, if it was canceled, then you will say that she still remained liable, notwithstanding the action of the directors in attempting to give her free and cancel her policy.\u201d In this there was no error. The jury was allowed to deal with but two facts, namely, the cancelation of the defendant\u2019s policy and her nonliability at the time of such cancelation, by reason of the fact that the company had collected assessments with which, or had the means, to pay losses for which she was liable as a member of the company at the time. As to these questions we cannot say that there was no evidence to go to the jury. If the issue had rested upon the surrender of the poliej'- and the acknowledgment of its receipt for cancelation, there might have been some question in regard to it, but the acceptance by the defendant of the proposition contained in the notice of January 11, 1877, and the payment by her of assessments Nos. 2 and 3, which notice contained a statement of the assets and liabilities of the company justified the jury in reaching a conclusion not only that an agreement was thereby made for the cancelation of the policy but that the defendant also discharged the obligation to her co-members by such payments. There can be no doubt that, under this state of facts, if her property had burned down, she would not have been entitled to recover for its loss.from the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The failure of the company to return the premium note and the fact that the receiver found it among its assets, when he took charge of them, amounts to nothing, if the agreement of cancelation was made, as found bjr the jury. As was said by Mr. Justice Trunkey in Akers v. Hite, supra, \u201c The plaintiff has no more right to collect an assessment on this note than on those which had actually been returned on like terms.\u201d The first, second and third assignments of error \u00e1re overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In the fourth,'fifth and sixth assignments, which relate to thte admission of evidence, we can see no error. The testimony was relevant and entirely competent. It went to the root of the case, namely, the cancelation of the defendant\u2019s policy, and, under the authorities which we have cited herein was, we think, properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
