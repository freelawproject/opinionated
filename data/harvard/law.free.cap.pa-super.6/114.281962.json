L. 271, provided that the proper affidavit is made within fifteen days. Such order is interlocutory and is neither a final judgment nor an order in the nature thereof, and an independent appeal does not lie. Yost v. Davison, 5 Pa.

On July 26, 1897, appeal filed and entered. On September 27,1897, a rule was granted to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for the reason that defendant had failed to make the affidavit required by the Act of July 14, 1897, P. L. 271. On October 11,1897, the court dismissed the rule under consideration, provided the proper affidavit is made within fifteen days from date. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was to the order of the court, dismissing the rule to show cause why appeal should not be dismissed, based on the admitted fact that the appellant did not make the affidavit required by law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-11\"><em>W.

Davison, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 469, and the cases there cited, and needs no discussion. The order appealed from is neither a final judgment nor an order in the nature of a final judgment, but is interlocutory, and from it an independent appeal does not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The appeal is quashed at the cost of the appellant and the record remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
