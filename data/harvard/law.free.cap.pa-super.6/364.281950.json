The court, Dunn, P. J., allowed the accountant credit for $400 theretofore paid to the heirs of Samuel Fitler, deceased, in pursuance of a family settlement, and awarded the balance, only $76.01, to the administrator of Samuel Fitler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">Other'facts appear in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1) In dismissing the exception taken by the appellant to the adjudication, which was as follows: \u201c The court erred in not regarding the judgment obtained by David Fitler against Sarah Fitler as final and conclusive between the parties.\u201d (2) In permitting accountant, under objection from appellant, to submit evidence in support of the following offer of accountant\u2019s counsel: Mr. Gerber: \u201c I propose to prove by cross-examination of this witness, and by such other evidence as may be produced hereafter, that Sarah Fitler, the administratrix in this estate, paid to the heirs of Samuel Fitler, out of the personal funds in her hands, as administratrix of the estate of George Fitler, deceased, the sum of $400; that that sum was paid on account of the distributive shares of the four heirs of David Fitler (Samuel Fitler), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that said sum was paid prior to the recovery of judgment in this suit, and on a bond given by George Fitler to Samuel Fitler, which said bond was surrendered to the said Sarah Fitler at the time that the said $400 was paid or else an indorsement, made on it whatever it is. This for the purpose of not disputing the judgment in the court of common pleas, but for the purpose of showing partial distribution of the fund in the hands of Sarah Fitler, the administratrix and accountant, now before the court. It is also further proposed to prove by evidence to be produced hereafter, that tender of the whole amount of tire money arising from the personal property of George Fitler, was made to the said heirs of Samuel Fitler, and a release requested from them, and it was refused ; said tender being made either in the fall of 1890 or the fall of 1891.\u201d (7) In dismissing the seventh exception taken by the appellant to the adjudication of the court below, which was as follows: \u201c The estate of Samuel Fitler, deceased, is not before the court and it is error to determine what the sons did or did not do at this time.\u201d (9) In deciding as a matter of law that the $400 paid by the defendant to the four sons of Samuel Fitler, deceased, should be allowed to her in full, which decision is as follows: \u201cWe find as a matter of law that the accountant is liable for the sum of $478.51, less $400 paid to David, John, William and Franklin Fitler. That the balance of the fund for which she is liable, after deducting the fees of the clerk of the orphans\u2019 court, must be paid to David Fitler, administrator of Samuel Fitler, deceased, on account of judgment March Term, 1895, No. 281.\u201d (11) In finding as a fact that there were no creditors of the estate of Samuel Fitler, which finding of fact is as follows : \u201c Creditors of their deceased father (Samuel Fitler) could call upon them as executors, de son tort, but there are no creditors of Samuel Fitler to complain.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\"><em>S.

He evidently lost sight of the fact that no letters of administration were taken out on this estate until February 18,1895, and that the statute of limitations of the creditors against the estate did not begin to run until then. In fact there are still remaining over three years\u2019 time for them to present their claim: Marsteller v. Marsteller, 93 Pa. 350; Levering v.

Gerber, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AWF\">Wickham, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Samuel Fitler died in 1879. At the time of his death, his son George owed him $2,000, secured by four bonds of $500 each. George died in 1884 leaving the bonds unpaid. His widow, Sarah, took out letters of administration on his estate, and in September, 1887, filed her first and final account showing a balance nominally in her hands of $478.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">When the usual proceedings to make formal distribution were had in the orphans\u2019 court, the administratrix proved that she had, by way of anticipation, paid to David, John, William, and Franklin Fitler, at their joint request, each $100, about the year 1890. These, her husband\u2019s brothers, were the only persons entitled as the heirs of Samuel Fitler, and as there were no creditors of his estate, they might legally divide it without administration. \u201cNo doubt the personal estate of a decedent vests in the administrator, but in trust for creditors and heirs or legatees. The mere legal estate passes to the administrator, the equitable descends upon the parties entitled to distribution. If there be no creditors, the heirs have a complete equity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>property, and if they choose, instead of taking letters of administration, to distribute it by arrangement made and executed amongst themselves, where is the principle which forbids it ? \u201d Walworth v. Abel, 52 Pa. 370 ; Weaver v. Roth, 105 Pa. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">At the time these payments were made, the heirs surrendered to Sarah one of the bonds, because of the money paid them, and gave her another for services rendered her husband\u2019s mother during the last years of her life. The debt was thus reduced to $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In 1895, David Filler took out letters of administration on the estate of Samuel, his father, and brought suit in the common pleas for the $1,000 against Sarah Fitler and her children, heirs of George, with a view' evidently to obtain a lien on George\u2019s real estate. He succeeded only in securing judgment against Sarah as administratrix, having delayed too long in instituting proceedings to reach the land. This judgment was presented in the orphans\u2019 court by David, who claimed that Sarah should be required to pay thereon the whole amount of the balance of $478.51 shown by her account. The learned auditing judge very properly, as we think, held that the $400 advanced earlier should be regarded as a partial distribution, and that therefore only the sum of $78.51 remained actually unpaid. This amount, less the clerk\u2019s fee, was awarded to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">To have sustained David\u2019s contention would have resulted in compelling George\u2019s administratrix to pay the $400 twice to the heirs of Samuel, and made her liable for $878.41 instead of the true balance shown by her account.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">But it is contended, for the appellant, that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the court in holding that there were no creditors of Samuel\u2019s estate to whom David as administrator might be liable. We think the circumstances amply warranted the learned auditing judge\u2019s conclusion. Samuel died May 29, 1879, and no letters of administration were taken out on his estate until February 18,1895, and it does not appear that they were issued at the instance of any creditor. So far as we can see, they were secured by David merely to qualify himself to bring suit against George\u2019s estate. It is not likely that if Samuel were indebted, at the time of his decease, his creditors would have permitted his estate to go unadministered for nearly six<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>teen years. The audit of Sarah\u2019s account took place on February 8, 1897, nearly eighteen years after Samuel\u2019s death. In the absence of any evidence or even intimation, at the audit, that any unpaid debts existed against Samuel\u2019s estate, the learned auditing judge, looking at all the circumstances, rightly assumed that they constituted prima facie proof that there were no such debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The appellant\u2019s position that Sarah purchased the two bonds from the heirs is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We have carefully considered all the assignments of error, in connection with the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel, and deem none of them tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Decree affirmed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
