Brown, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and saj^s that he is the defendant named in the above case, and that he has a just, true, full and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of the following nature and character, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-11\">\u201c That it is true that the defendant employed the plaintiff to perform certain paper hanging in the defendant\u2019s premises, named in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, and on the terms and conditions therein set forth, but that the said work was done in an unworkmanlike manner, and that the material furnished was of an inferior quality, and not in accordance with his contract with the plaintiff therefor, and that soon after said work was done, said paper faded and became loosened from the wall. By reason of which the defendant has suffered damages in an amount at least equal to the sum claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">The court made absolute the rule for judgment and damages were assessed for $320.58.

Jones, 132 Pa. 462; Johnson v. Fitzpatrick, 27 W. N. C. 250.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-\">November 19, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>Frank P. </em>Prichard, with him <em>Thomas S. </em>Gates, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2q\">\u2014The vague and evasive averments of the affidavit are insufficient to carry the case to a jury. A reference to three cases is ample to justify this seemingly obvious contention: Server v. Heppe, 11 Montg. 171, Bank v. Miller, 179 Pa. 412 and Bonneville v. Hamilton, 18 C. C. Rep. 31.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-6\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">This action was brought to recover a balance alleged to be due for papering five houses. The affidavit, of defense alleges \u201c that the said work was done in an unworkmanlike manner,\u201d without specifying how, or in what respect it was unworkmanlike <em>; \u201c </em>that the material furnished was of an inferior quality, and not in accordance with his contract,\u201d without alleging that the plaintiff contracted to furnish paper of superior quality or setting forth what the contract was; and \u201c that soon after said work was done, said paper faded and became loosened from the wall,\u201d without alleging that this was in consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s unskillful workmanship or of his failure to use such materials as he was bound by his contract to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Upon these allegations the defendant bases another, namely, that he has \u201c suffered damages in an amount equal at least to the sum claimed by the plaintiff \u201d without specifying, otherwise than as we have stated, how he was damaged. We are of opinion that the affidavit was wholly insufficient to prevent judgment. If the paper faded and loosened from the walls in consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s unskillful workmanship, or of his use of improper materials, this fact might, and should, have been distinctly averred and not left to mere inference: Peck v. Jones, 70 Pa. 83. The first two averments are not sufficiently specific. We repeat in this connection what we said in Port Kennedy Slag Works v. Krause, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 622 and what has been said in many earlier decisions of this court and of the Supreme Court: \u201c An affidavit of defense should state the facts specifically and with sufficient detail to enable the court to say whether they amount to a defense, and to what extent they amount to a defense, and also to inform the plaintiff with some degree of certainty what will be interposed to defeat his claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
