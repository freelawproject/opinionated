J.</author>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">This appeal presents the question whether the grantor of a trust deed, who had notice that her property was being sold at a trustee\u2019s sale under the Oregon Trust Deed Act (OTDA), may later challenge that sale on the sole ground that the trustee\u2019s notice of sale did not correctly identify the beneficiary of the trust deed. <em>See </em>ORS 86.771 (setting forth the required contents of a notice of sale).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we conclude that the trial court in this case correctly understood ORS 86.797 to preclude such a challenge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The following facts are undisputed. In 2007, Janine DiGregorio borrowed $999,900, for which she executed a note that was secured by a trust deed on property located in Happy Valley, Oregon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the trust deed, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as a nominee for the lender, First Horizon Home Loans, a division of First Tennessee Bank, N.A. (First Horizon), is listed as the beneficiary. The deed lists First American Title Insurance Company as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The trust deed was recorded in the public records. In addition, there were two later assignments of the trust deed, both of which were recorded in the public records. First, in 2010, MERS assigned any beneficial interest in the trust deed to the lender, First Horizon. Then, in 2012, First Horizon assigned the trust deed to Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (Bayview), who was also the holder and servicer of the note.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bayview, also in 2012, appointed a successor trustee, Quality Loan Service Corporation (QLS). That appointment was recorded in the public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In 2010, DiGregorio went into payment default on the note secured by the trust deed. In 2012, at Bay view\u2019s direction, QLS issued and recorded a notice of default and election to sell; DiGregorio received that notice. Also in 2012, the trustee\u2019s notice of sale was recorded, mailed, served at the property, and published in the newspaper. That notice provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cReference is made to that certain deed made by MICHAEL P DIGREGORIO &amp; JANINE M DIGREGORIO, as Grantor to FIRST AMERICAN TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY, as trustee, in favor of MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, INC., AS NOMINEE FOR FIRST HORIZON HOME LOANS, A DIVISION OF FIRST TENNESSEE BANK, N.A., as Beneficiary, dated 12/28/2007, recorded 12/31/2007, in official records of CLACKAMAS County, Oregon in book / reel / volume number fee / file / instrument / microfile / reception number 2007-108452, covering the following described property situated in said County and State * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">(Boldface and capitalization in original.) It also, among other things, gave the legal description and address of the property to be sold, identified QLS as the trustee and gave QLS\u2019s mailing address, and set forth the date, time, and place where the sale of the property would occur. The notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>did not identify Bayview as the then-current beneficiary of the trust deed. Although DiGregorio received the notice, she took no action in advance of the sale. At the trustee\u2019s sale on September 10, 2012, Bayview was the successful bidder. Thereafter, QLS issued and recorded a trustee\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Following the sale, in 2013, Bayview filed an action against DiGregorio for forcible entry and detainer (FED) to recover the property. DiGregorio separately filed an action for declaratory relief against Bayview, seeking a declaration \u201cvoiding, and invalidating the non-judicial foreclosure and sale of [the property] because the Notice of Sale is invalid.\u201d Specifically, DiGregorio claimed that the nonjudicial foreclosure was invalid because the trustee\u2019s notice of sale had listed MERS, as nominee for First Horizon, as \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d However, according to DiGregorio, \u201cneither MERS nor First Horizon was the \u2018beneficiary\u2019 when the Notice of Sale was executed.\u201d The trial court granted Bayview\u2019s motion to consolidate the two actions and, thereafter, Bayview filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In the motion, Bayview asserted that it was entitled to summary judgment for two reasons. First, it asserted that, because DiGregorio had undisputedly received full notice of the trustee\u2019s sale, in light of ORS 86.797, she could not bring a collateral challenge to the nonjudicial foreclosure based on her assertion that the notice of sale had not listed the current beneficiary. Second, Bayview argued that, in any event, the notice of sale, by naming the beneficiary listed in the trust deed, had complied with the requirements of ORS 86.771. The trial court agreed that, even if the beneficiary was not properly identified in the notice of sale, her claims were barred in light of ORS 86.797. Accordingly, it entered a judgment in favor of Bayview on all of DiGregorio\u2019s claims, and awarded Bayview a general judgment of restitution of the property that had been sold in the nonjudicial foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On appeal, DiGregorio asserts that the trial court erred in granting Bayview\u2019s motion for summary judgment. She argues that, because the trustee\u2019s notice of sale was \u201cdefective,\u201d ORS 86.797 does not bar her claim. As it did before the trial court, Bayview argues, in response, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>DiGregorio received notice of the trustee\u2019s sale and ORS 86.797 prevents her from challenging the nonjudicial foreclosure based on her sole assertion that the notice of sale had not listed the current beneficiary. <em>See </em>ORS 86.771(1) (a trustee\u2019s notice of sale must list \u201cthe names of the grantor, trustee and beneficiary in the trust deed, and the mailing address of the trustee\u201d). It also argues that the trustee\u2019s notice of sale complied with ORS 86.771(1) by identifying the name of the beneficiary as originally listed in the trust deed. We agree with Bayview that, in light of ORS 86.797, DiGregorio cannot bring a post-sale challenge based on her assertion that the trustee\u2019s notice of sale does not correctly identify the beneficiary. Thus, we do not address whether the notice of sale\u2019s identification of the beneficiary complied with the requirements of ORS 86.771(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Pursuant to ORS 86.797(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">\u201c[i]f, under ORS 86.705 to 86.815 [(the OTDA)], a trustee sells property covered by a trust deed, the trustee\u2019s sale forecloses and terminates the interest in the property that belongs to a person to which notice of sale was given under ORS 86.764 and 86.774 or to a person who claims an interest by, through or under the person to which notice was given. A person whose interest the trustee\u2019s sale foreclosed and terminated may not redeem the property from the purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale. A failure to give notice to a person entitled to notice does not affect the validity of the sale as to persons that were notified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">According to Bayview, under the plain text of that statute, once a trustee\u2019s sale occurs, the rights of any person who received notice of the sale are \u201cwholly extinguished\u201d and such a party may not challenge the validity of the sale after it is completed. DiGregorio, for her part, points out that the language of ORS 86.797 is conditional: \u201cThe use of the word \u2018if to begin the statutory provision renders ORS [86.797] expressly conditional, whereby \u2018the trustee forecloses and terminates the interest in the property that belongs to a person to which notice of sale was given\u2019 is dependent upon satisfaction of the antecedent clause \u2018[i]f, under ORS 86.705 to [86.815], a trustee sells property covered by a trust deed.\u2019\u201d (Second brackets in DiGregorio\u2019s brief.) She asserts that, because the trustee\u2019s notice of sale did not correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>identify the beneficiary of the trust deed, the trustee did not sell the property \u201cunder ORS 86.705 to 86.815\u201d and, therefore, ORS 86.797 does not bar her from bringing her post-sale challenge. In other words, it is DiGregorio\u2019s contention that failure to strictly comply with a single provision of the OTDA (that the trustee\u2019s notice of sale list the name of the \u201cbeneficiary in the trust deed\u201d) renders ORS 86.797 inapplicable and the trustee\u2019s sale invalid. Bayview contends that the statute does not mandate strict compliance with every provision of the OTDA for the trustee\u2019s sale to be valid. <em>Cf. Wolf v. GMAC Mortgage, LLC, </em>276 Or App 541, 546, 370 P3d 1254 (2016) (declining to resolve whether ORS 86.797 \u201crequires strict compliance with every provision of the OTDA before a person\u2019s property interests will be terminated by a trustee\u2019s sale\u201d). Thus, the issue we must resolve in this case is whether a purported failure to identify the beneficiary in the trust deed in the trustee\u2019s notice of sale means that a trustee did not sell property covered by a trust deed \u201cunder ORS 86.705 to 86.815.\u201d We agree with Bayview that ORS 86.797 does not mandate strict compliance with every provision of the OTDA for a trustee\u2019s sale to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">ORS 86.797 \u201cestablishes the legal effect of a trust deed foreclosure sale on those to whom notice\u201d of the sale has been given. <em>NW Property Wholesalers, LLC v. Spitz, </em>252 Or App 29, 34, 287 P3d 1106 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013). That is, the person\u2019s interest is foreclosed and terminated and that person may not \u201credeem the property from the purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale.\u201d ORS 86.797(1). The clause \u201cunder ORS 86.705 to 86.815\u201d in ORS 86.797 is merely descriptive of the type of sale to which the statute\u2019s provisions apply\u2014 that is, sales conducted by a trustee under the OTDA. As long as the sale is of the type described, the provisions of ORS 86.797 apply. And, contrary to DiGregorio\u2019s contention, the text of the clause at issue does not create substantive requirements or suggest that strict compliance with <em>every </em>provision of the OTDA is required before a person\u2019s property interests may be terminated by a trustee\u2019s sale. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (we resolve issues of statutory interpretation by beginning with the text and context of the statute and considering the statute\u2019s legislative history if appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>We further observe that the text of ORS 86.797 specifically carves out provision of notice under ORS 86.764 and ORS 86.774 as a requirement to the finality of a foreclosure. Its provisions specifically apply to foreclose and terminate only the interests of \u201ca person to which notice was given\u201d under those statutes. <em>See also NW Property Wholesalers, 252 </em>Or App 29 (discussing the notice requirements of <em>former </em>ORS 86.740 (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.764 (2013), and <em>former </em>ORS 86.750 (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.774 (2013)). It also specifically states that a \u201cfailure to give notice to a person entitled to notice <em>does not </em>affect the validity of the sale as to persons that were notified.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature\u2019s decision to specifically carve out the provision of notice under ORS 86.764 and ORS 86.774 as affecting the validity of a trustee\u2019s sale implicitly undermines the notion advanced by DiGregorio that <em>any </em>defect in the foreclosure process undermines the foreclosure sale at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">That understanding is consistent with the purposes of the OTDA, which was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cenacted in 1959 to provide an alternative to the judicial foreclosure process. That nonjudicial alternative is available when the parties use a trust deed to secure the loan. A trust deed is a deed executed under the OTDA that conveys an interest in real property to a trustee in trust to secure the performance of an obligation the grantor or other person named in the deed owes to a beneficiary. The OTDA permits the trustee appointed under a trust deed to advertise and sell the property to the highest bidder without judicial involvement. Like a mortgage, a trust deed creates a lien on real property to secure an underlying obligation in the event of a default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Brandrup v. ReconTrust Co., </em>353 Or 668, 676, 303 P3d 301 (2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the OTDA \u201cconfers upon a trustee the power to sell property securing an obligation under a trust deed in the event of default, without the necessity for judicial action.\u201d <em>Staffordshire Investments, Inc. v. Cal-Western, </em>209 Or App 528, 542, 149 P3d 150 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 727 (2007). \u201c[I]n authorizing the use of trust deeds, the legislature sought to provide a more cost-effective means of foreclosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>liens on real property and, in doing so, to expand the pool of capital available for small homeowners.\u201d <em>Brandrup, </em>353 Or at 711 (Kistler, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, SB 117, Apr 16, 1959, 1). The OTDA also \u201creflects] the legislature\u2019s intent to protect the grantor against the unauthorized loss of its property and to give the grantor sufficient opportunity to cure the default.\u201d <em>Staffordshire Investments, Inc., </em>209 Or App at 542. Thus, it incorporates safeguards to protect grantors against unauthorized foreclosure. To allow a grantor \u201ctime to seek judicial intervention\u201d in appropriate circumstances, the trustee is required to give the grantor and other interested parties at least 120 days\u2019 advance notice of the trustee\u2019s sale. <em>Brandrup, </em>353 Or at 677; <em>see </em>ORS 86.752; ORS 86.764. Furthermore, the OTDA \u201cprovides a mechanism by which the grantor can, at any time prior to five days before the date set for sale, cure the default and dismiss the proceedings.\u201d <em>Staffordshire Investments, Inc., </em>209 Or App at 542; <em>see </em>ORS 86.778. \u201cIf the trustee has complied with the statutory notice requirements and the default is not cured, the trustee may sell the property at public auction to the highest bidder without judicial oversight.\u201d <em>Brandrup, </em>353 Or at 678. After a trustee\u2019s sale, the interest of a grantor that was properly provided notice under ORS 86.764 and ORS 86.774 is foreclosed and terminated, and the grantor cannot redeem the property. ORS 86.797(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">As those provisions demonstrate, the OTDA, as a whole, \u201crepresents a well-coordinated statutory scheme to protect grantors from unauthorized foreclosure and wrongful sale of property, while at the same time providing creditors with a quick and efficient remedy against a defaulting grantor.\u201d <em>Staffordshire Investments, Inc., </em>209 Or App at 542. As we observed in <em>Wolf, </em>in enacting the OTDA, \u201cthe legislature intended to provide finality\u201d and also to protect grantors from the wrongful sale of their property. 276 Or App at 548. However, the understanding of ORS 86.797(1) advanced by DiGregorio, that a defect of any type at any stage of the process under the OTDA undercuts the validity of the trustee\u2019s sale after it has been conducted, does not serve those interests. It runs directly contrary to the interest of providing a quick, efficient, and final remedy against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defaulting grantor, while not serving the interest of protecting grantors against unauthorized foreclosures and wrongful sales of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">That point is illustrated by the circumstances of this case. DiGregorio does not contest that she is a person to whom notice of sale was given as required by ORS 86.764 and ORS 86.774.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does she dispute that the sale was conducted by a trustee pursuant to her default on her obligations. Instead, she seeks to undermine a completed trustee\u2019s sale based on a single asserted defect in the content of the trustee\u2019s notice of sale under ORS 86.771, which she received (and did not challenge) prior to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Our understanding of ORS 86.797 is also consistent with our recent decision in <em>Wolf. </em>In that case, we considered whether a borrower who received notice that his property was being sold at a trustee\u2019s sale under the OTDA could later challenge the sale on the grounds that the entity that executed the sale was not a trustee or the agent of a trustee. 276 Or App at 643. The borrower in that case contended that ORS 86.797(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> could not foreclose or terminate his interest in the property because the sale at issue was not conducted by a trustee, as required. <em>Id. </em>at 544. Although we acknowledged that the legislature, through ORS 86.797, sought to promote certainty and finality following a sale, we explained that \u201cthe participation of a \u2018trustee\u2019 is so fundamental to a \u2018trustee\u2019s sale\u2019 that a sale cannot foreclose and terminate an individual\u2019s property interest under [ORS 86.797(1)] unless the sale is conducted by an actual trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. In other words, the provisions of ORS 86.797(1) apply to a \u201ctrustee\u2019s sale\u201d under the OTDA. Because the statute \u201capplies only to a \u2018trustee\u2019s sale,\u201d\u2019 its provisions \u201ccannot preclude a post-sale challenge to the sale of * * * property by someone who was not, in fact, the trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549; <em>see id. </em>at 547 (\u201c [I] n the absence of a validly appointed trustee, there is no \u2018trustee\u2019 at all for purposes of the OTDA \u2014 and, hence, no \u2018trustee\u2019s sale\u2019 with the power to foreclose other persons\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>property interests.\u201d); <em>see also Staffordshire Investments, Inc., </em>209 Or App at 542 (observing that there is nothing in the OTDA \u201cto indicate that the legislature intended the auction to be final in the absence of legal authority to sell the property\u201d (emphasis omitted)). On the other hand, where the fundamental premises of ORS 86.797(1) are satisfied, its provisions apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In light of the foregoing, we reject DiGregorio\u2019s contention that failure to strictly comply with a single provision of the OTDA (that the trustee\u2019s notice of sale list the name of the \u201cbeneficiary in the trust deed\u201d) renders ORS 86.797 inapplicable and the trustee\u2019s sale invalid.
