J.</author>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In these consolidated cases, father appeals orders and judgments by the juvenile court that asserted jurisdiction over father\u2019s two children. We reverse and remand with instructions to terminate the wardships over the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In March 2014, the juvenile court asserted jurisdiction over the children based on allegations that mother, who had physical custody of the children in Oregon, had substance abuse and mental health issues that threatened the children\u2019s welfare and that father, who lived in California, did not have legal custody of the children and had not taken steps to obtain it. In March 2015, at a permanency hearing, father moved to dismiss jurisdiction and terminate the wardships over the children, asserting that the adjudicated bases for jurisdiction did not provide grounds for continuing jurisdiction. The juvenile court denied the motion, reasoning, in part, that jurisdiction was warranted because Arizona, where father had relocated, had declined to approve father as a \u201cplacement\u201d for the children through the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC). ORS 417.200-417.260.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Father appealed, contending that the juvenile court erred in continuing jurisdiction because, at the time of the hearing on father\u2019s motion to dismiss, father\u2019s lack of a custody order did not expose the children to a particularized and nonspeculative risk of serious loss or injury. The Department of Human Services (DHS) conceded that the juvenile court had erred in denying father\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agreed and reversed the permanency judgments denying father\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. Z. E. </em>W., 276 Or App 463, 368 P3d 64 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">While that appeal was pending, the juvenile court held a hearing on amended jurisdictional petitions, which alleged, among other things, that Arizona had again declined to approve father as a placement through the ICPC. During the hearing, the juvenile court expressed its belief that it had to apply the ICPC when ruling on the jurisdictional petitions. In response, the attorneys for father and DHS explained that the ICPC\u2019s placement provisions apply only after the juvenile court has asserted jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201c[FATHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: *** And just to clarify, the \u2014 father\u2019s position has been that <em>you don\u2019t get to the ICPC unless the [sjtate has already proven the </em>\u2014 that <em>the grounds that brought the children were within the [cjourt\u2019s jurisdiction still exist.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><em>\u201cICPC deals with an open case and placement, </em>but the case doesn\u2019t remain open unless the [s]tate has proven that the grounds that brought the children within the [c] ourt\u2019s jurisdiction continue to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201c[DHS\u2019S COUNSEL]: I believe, Your Honor, and with what [father\u2019s counsel] is saying, it\u2019s just, I think, it was a little different way of saying what I was saying, is that, <em>you get to that [the ICPCJ when you have jurisdiction. If this </em>\u2014 if <em>the father were before this court and you found that their bases for jurisdiction didn\u2019t exist or we don\u2019t get </em>\u2014 to <em>the next step.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The trial court rejected father\u2019s argument against jurisdiction and entered the jurisdictional orders and judgments that are the subjects of these consolidated appeals. On appeal, father argues that the juvenile court erred by asserting jurisdiction over the children because the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that the children\u2019s conditions or circumstances were \u201csuch as to endanger [their] welfare.\u201d ORS 419B.100(l)(c). DHS concedes that the juvenile court erred. Regarding Arizona\u2019s decisions not to certify father as a placement, DHS agrees that, given the absence of evidence of a specific risk to the children\u2019s welfare, \u201cthe juvenile court erred when it relied on the negative ICPC [report] as the basis for taking jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We agree with the parties that DHS failed to present legally sufficient evidence to establish that the children were endangered by their conditions and circumstances as alleged in the amended jurisdictional petitions. We also note that, as the parties agree, the fact that father has not been approved as an ICPC placement is not, in and of itself, a basis for asserting jurisdiction over the children. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.334 (\u201cWhen the court determines it would be in the best interest and welfare of a <em>ward, </em>the court may, if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>is an interstate compact * * * permitting the ward to reside in another state while under protective supervision, or to be placed in an institution or with an agency in another state, place the ward under protective supervision in such other state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to terminate wardships.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
