Father argues that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment is invalid, as a matter of law, because it was inextricably linked to a 2014 jurisdictional judgment, which has since been reversed on appeal. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. B. P., </em>277 Or App 23, 370 P3d 536 (2016). Father argues further that the juvenile court lacked the authority to terminate his parental rights as a result of our reversal in <em>B. P. </em>We conclude that the juvenile court properly asserted jurisdiction based on the 2015 petition, which contained allegations that were not dependent on the validity of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment. We also conclude that the juvenile court had authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights. We therefore affirm both the jurisdictional and termination judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">A. <em>2014 Jurisdictional Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The facts, which are largely procedural, are undisputed. In March 2014, the Department of Human Services (DHS) removed M from father and disallowed contact between father and M based on allegations of sexual abuse, drug use, and neglect. In October 2014, the juvenile court held a three-day hearing on the allegations against father. The child\u2019s mother, who had previously admitted to having mental health issues that interfered with her ability to safely parent the child, testified at the hearing. The juvenile court issued an order pertaining solely to father. The court ruled that DHS had failed to prove that (1) father sexually abused M, (2) M\u2019s statement that father sexually abused her warranted jurisdiction, (3) father allowed M to reside in unfit conditions, (4) father failed to provide M with routine meals, and (5) father exhibited a pattern of drug use. However, at the conclusion of the hearing and upon consent of both parties, the court amended the petition and asserted jurisdiction over M based on findings that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cfather was neglectful toward the child by not enrolling the child in school from October through December of 2013, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and by regularly failing to bring the child to school on time. Furthermore, the child\u2019s educational and social needs were not being met because of this neglect and the child suffered harm by falling behind and needing to repeat her kindergarten year in school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In November 2014, the juvenile court referee conducted a hearing and entered an order regarding both parents. The juvenile court affirmed the referee\u2019s order and entered a judgment establishing dependency jurisdiction over M (the 2014 jurisdictional judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Father appealed the 2014 jurisdictional judgment, arguing that the court\u2019s findings that father neglected M\u2019s educational and grooming needs and allowed M to have contact with her mother despite a contrary visitation order were insufficient to support juvenile court jurisdiction. <em>B. P., </em>277 Or App at 25. Neither DHS nor M defended the merits of the juvenile court\u2019s decision. Rather, they argued that the decision finding M within the jurisdiction of the court was not made in an appealable judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On May 1, 2015, while father\u2019s appeal was pending, the juvenile court changed M\u2019s permanency plan from reunification to adoption, and authorized and ordered DHS to file a petition to terminate both parents\u2019 parental rights. DHS filed a petition to terminate father\u2019s parental rights on June 2, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">B. <em>2015 Jurisdictional Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On July 17, 2015, DHS filed a second dependency petition with allegations pertaining to father only. DHS then filed an amended version of the second dependency petition on August 3, 2015; again, the petition contained allegations pertaining solely to father. Specifically, the amended second petition alleged that M\u2019s conditions and circumstances endangered her welfare because: (1) father had \u201ca pattern of residential, relationship, and lifestyle instability which impair his ability to safely and adequately care for the child\u201d; (2) since October 2014, father had not visited M or maintained contact with DHS, indicating that he was either unwilling, or unable, to meet M\u2019s special needs; (3) since March 2014, father had \u201cfailed to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>court-ordered therapeutic services designed to help him recognize and reunite the special needs of his child\u201d; (4) M had been diagnosed as \u201csuffering from sexual abuse of a child (by history) and neglect of child from history\u201d and father was unable and unwilling to meet M\u2019s special needs; (5) father had no contact with M since her removal in March 2014, despite visitation having been made available to him since November 2014; and (6) father failed to maintain regular communication with DHS. The petition also alleged that M was dependent for care and support from DHS because \u201cfather has not engaged in services designed to reunite him with his child, and the child requires foster care placement.\u201d Lastly, the petition alleged that father abandoned M \u201cphysically and emotionally,\u201d failed to provide M with the \u201ccare or education required by law,\u201d and failed to provide M with the \u201ccare, guidance and protection\u201d necessary for her physical, mental, or emotional well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">At the start of the hearing, DHS moved to amend the petition once again by removing the words \u201ccourt-ordered\u201d from allegation number three, and by changing M\u2019s diagnosis in allegation four from \u201csexual abuse of a child (by history) and neglect of child from history\u201d to \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder (including primary symptoms of PTSD, along with characteristics of complex developmental trauma),\u201d and \u201ccontinue to monitor for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\u201d Father did not object to those amendments or ask for a continuance. Then, upon DHS\u2019s request, the juvenile court took judicial notice of the case file from the 2014 dependency petition. Father did not object to the court taking such judicial notice. Lastly, counsel for DHS clarified that it was seeking wardship \u201cbased upon the absence of [father] in [M\u2019s] life since [December 2014].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">During the hearing, father noted that there was an ongoing appeal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment and sought to introduce into evidence the appellate briefs filed in that matter. Father argued that the briefs were relevant to show why DHS had filed a second dependency petition that was substantively similar to the first, rather than amending the original petition \u2014 namely, that DHS was trying to bolster a weak jurisdictional finding that would likely be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>overturned on appeal. Father noted that both DHS and M had conceded that the evidence put forth in the 2014 hearing was insufficient to support a jurisdictional finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In an effort to understand father\u2019s argument about the relevance of the pending appeal, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cI think the argument is that there shouldn\u2019t have been jurisdiction in the first place, * * * and if there should not have been jurisdiction in the first place, then the father shouldn\u2019t have had to do all of these things that it\u2019s alleged he did not do, and since there shouldn\u2019t have been jurisdiction, then it\u2019s kind of no-harm/no-foul; doesn\u2019t matter that he didn\u2019t do those things, because he shouldn\u2019t have had to in the first place, so the allegations \u2014 the underpinning of the allegations is without merit and therefore the allegation should be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Father\u2019s counsel agreed to the court\u2019s characterization of his argument. The court ultimately did not admit the appellate briefs, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c[t]he issues in this case that I\u2019m hearing now is there\u2019s a child who is damaged. Period. There are certain things that the Court required the father to do and that the father should have done regard \u2014 if there was no jurisdiction \u2014 if there was no jurisdiction; if the Juvenile Court hadn\u2019t been involved and this child were damaged for whatever reason, a parent who is taking adequate care of that child would have done \u2014 would have gone to a therapist, would have sought professional help, would have stayed in contact with that child, all of the things that are alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cSo the rightness or the wrongness of the original taking of jurisdiction is frankly irrelevant to the decision as we\u2019re sitting here today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">On October 15, 2015, the juvenile court asserted jurisdiction over M on several grounds (the 2015 jurisdictional judgment): (1) M\u2019s PTSD and her \u201chost of emotional, psychological, and behavioral problems\u201d and father\u2019s unwillingness to meet or acknowledge those special needs; (2) father\u2019s <em>de facto </em>\u201cabandonment\u201d of M as a result of his failure to visit with M since November 2014, and the consequent \u201cprofound\u201d harm to M; and (3) father\u2019s failure to participate in court-ordered therapeutic services.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>On November 24, 2015, a juvenile court referee conducted an \u201cannual review\u201d permanency hearing and entered an order continuing the permanency plan of adoption, which had been first determined at the May 1, 2015, hearing after entry of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">C. <em>The Termination Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On June 15, 2015, father was summoned to personally appear in court to admit or deny the allegations contained in the termination of parental rights (TPR) petition that had been filed on June 2, 2015. He appeared for that purpose on July 30, 2015, and the case was set over for \u201ccall\u201d on December 10, 2015, at 8:30 a.m., in the Juvenile Justice Complex. The order stated that father\u2019s attorney could not attend the hearing in lieu of father, and warned, \u201cIf a parent fails to appear in person at call, the court, without further notice and in the parent\u2019s absence, may immediately terminate the parent\u2019s rights.\u201d Father signed the order, acknowledging his receipt of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On November 24, 2015, DHS amended the petition to terminate father\u2019s parental rights to include the findings of both jurisdictional judgments. The amended petition stated that it was being filed \u201cpursuant to the direction of [the juvenile court] as the court changed the plan to achieve adoption on May 1,2015.\u201d The petition also stated that M was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction based on the October 7, 2014, finding that M\u2019s conditions and circumstances \u201cwere such as to endanger her own welfare and that her parents failed to provide her with the care, guidance, and protection necessary for her physical, mental, and emotional well-being.\u201d The specific allegations contained in the petition included that father was unfit to parent because of his residential instability, his unwillingness or inability to meet M\u2019s special needs, his failure to participate in visitation and in therapeutic services, his failure to provide for M\u2019s physical and psychological needs for at least six months prior to the filing of the amended TPR petition, and father\u2019s abandonment of M; each of those allegations had been adjudicated during the 2015 dependency proceeding. The petition also alleged that father subjected M to physical neglect and failed to provide for her educational needs, as well as provide adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>grooming; those allegations had been adjudicated during the 2014 dependency proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Father failed to appear in court on December 10, 2015. Over objection from father\u2019s attorney, the juvenile court permitted DHS to present a <em>prima facie </em>case in father\u2019s absence. Father\u2019s attorney sought to adjourn the proceedings for father to appear and because of the fact that both the 2014 and 2015 jurisdictional judgments were pending appeal. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201c[W]e simply don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to move forward on the Termination Petition when the underlying basis of jurisdiction is null or soon will be null and the new basis for jurisdiction is on appeal with a matter \u2014 with an emergency stay pending and with father given precious little time to change his circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Counsel argued further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201c [T]he State has failed to gain the necessary permission from the Court to file the Termination Petition related to the new jurisdictional findings by Judge Svetkey made in October of 2015. They only have permission, I submit, to move forward on the original Termination Petition and its findings related to the original jurisdiction, all of which will soon be moot because jurisdiction never should have been taken for a child who was not mandatorily required to attend school under Oregon law, failing to attend school (indiscernible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The juvenile court denied counsel\u2019s request for an adjournment and, after receiving evidence from DHS, terminated father\u2019s parental rights (the TPR judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">D. <em>Subsequent Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">On March 16, 2016, this court reversed the 2014 jurisdictional judgment. We held that the judgment was reviewable on appeal and accepted DHS\u2019s and M\u2019s concessions that the allegations found to be proved by the juvenile court were insufficient to support jurisdiction over M. <em>B. R, </em>277 Or App at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Father now appeals from both the 2015 jurisdictional judgment and the TPR judgment. In his first three assignments of error, he challenges the juvenile court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights because the termination petition was predicated upon the now-reversed 2014 jurisdictional judgment and the May 1, 2015, permanency judgment, which in turn was also premised on the now-reversed 2014 jurisdictional judgment. In his fourth assignment of error, father challenges the 2015 jurisdictional judgment, arguing that, to the extent it was meant to incorporate the allegations adjudicated in 2014, the reversal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment renders the 2015 jurisdictional judgment invalid as a matter of law. In the alternative, father argues that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment is invalid because the 2015 petition\u2019s allegations pertained solely to father and not to mother. Father argues that the juvenile court\u2019s failure to consider the totality of M\u2019s circumstances, including her mother\u2019s fitness to parent, requires us to vacate and remand the 2015 jurisdictional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A. <em>2015 Jurisdictional Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We begin with father\u2019s fourth assignment of error, which challenges the validity of the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. Although father appears to argue that his challenges to the 2015 jurisdictional judgment are preserved, he nevertheless urges us to exercise our discretion to correct those errors as plain. DHS and M maintain that the claimed errors are unpreserved and not plain. They also oppose father\u2019s claim on the merits, arguing that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment is not invalid because the 2015 petition was a \u201cstand-alone petition, independent from the initial petition.\u201d Thus, they argue, the reversal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment had no effect on the validity of the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. DHS and M also challenge father\u2019s assertion that the court erred in asserting jurisdiction over M in 2015 by not considering the fitness of mother, arguing that father failed to preserve that contention and that \u201c[n]othing in the juvenile code requires a court to reconsider automatically its prior determination of a parent\u2019s unfitness when adjudicating new allegations of unfitness as to the other parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that father preserved \u2014 to the extent possible \u2014 his claim that our later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>reversal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment invalidated the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. However, we conclude that the reversal of the 2014 judgment did not render the 2015 judgment invalid as a matter of law, and that the juvenile court did not, therefore, err in asserting jurisdiction over M based on the 2015 petition. We conclude further that father failed to preserve his claim that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment was improperly based on allegations pertaining solely to father, and that any error committed by the juvenile court in asserting jurisdiction based on those allegations is not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Father preserved, to the extent possible, his argument that our reversal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment in <em>B. P. </em>invalidated the 2015 jurisdictional judgment as a matter of law. At the 2015 hearing, father alerted the juvenile court to the pending appeal of the 2014 judgment and attempted to admit copies of briefs filed in that appeal. He argued that they were relevant to show that DHS had filed a new dependency petition only because the 2014 jurisdictional judgment was weak and likely to be overturned on appeal. Father argued that DHS was merely trying to bolster weak allegations by filing a new petition that was not substantively different from the earlier allegations. The juvenile court understood father\u2019s contention to be that, if jurisdiction was not valid based on the allegations in the 2014 petition, then the allegations against father in the 2015 petition \u2014 namely, failing to avail himself of therapeutic services and visitation with M \u2014 had no legal basis and should be dismissed. Father agreed with that characterization of his argument. Thus, although we had not yet reversed the 2014 jurisdictional judgment at the time of the 2015 hearing, the juvenile court was aware of father\u2019s contention that an eventual reversal could affect the validity of the allegations contained in the 2015 petition. The court considered that argument and rejected it, finding that the validity of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment was irrelevant to the court\u2019s determination on the 2015 petition. Neither the court nor the parties were taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet father\u2019s argument, and we therefore conclude that the claim was preserved to the extent possible under the somewhat unusual procedural history of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>case. <em>See Davis v. O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Or 729, 737, 891 P2d 1307 (1995) (preservation is required to ensure that \u201cparties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">We now turn to the merits of that argument, which requires us to analyze the effect, if any, of our reversal of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment on the juvenile court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction in 2015. That, in turn, requires us to analyze whether the allegations found to be proved in the 2015 petition were linked to those adjudicated in 2014. We conclude that the 2015 petition, and the resulting jurisdictional judgment, contained separate allegations from those that were reversed in <em>B. P. </em>Thus, the juvenile court did not err, as a matter of law, in taking jurisdiction over M based on the 2015 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As DHS points out in its brief, the 2015 petition seeking jurisdiction over M was assigned a distinct case number from the 2014 jurisdictional petition. The new petition did not reference the 2014 petition or the juvenile court\u2019s findings that led the court to assert jurisdiction over M in 2014. Nor did the new petition indicate that it was meant to serve as an amendment to the 2014 petition under ORS 419B.809(6) (stating that dependency petitions may be amended \u201cat any time\u201d). And, despite father\u2019s contention to the contrary, the record does not indicate that the parties and the court were laboring under the impression that the 2015 petition was an amendment to the 2014 petition, or that it necessarily incorporated all of the allegations adjudicated in 2014.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, at the start of the hearing, DHS clarified that the issues being adjudicated were \u201cessentially what has gone on in the case since December of 2014 forward,\u201d which occurred after the 2014 judgment had been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We also reject father\u2019s contention that the allegations contained in the 2015 petition were substantively similar and inextricably linked to those alleged and found to be proved during the 2014 dependency proceeding. The 2014 petition alleged that father had sexually assaulted M, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>used drugs, allowed M to reside in unfit conditions, and that father was neglectful by not enrolling M in school, providing her with routine meals, or grooming her. The juvenile court ultimately asserted jurisdiction based on its finding that father had neglected to enroll M in school from October through December of 2013, had regularly failed to bring M to school on time, and that M suffered resulting harm by falling behind and needing to repeat her kindergarten year in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The 2015 petition, on the other hand, alleged that father demonstrated a pattern of instability, that he did not participate in therapeutic services offered to him to help him understand and manage M\u2019s special needs, that M suffered from PTSD, that he physically and emotionally abandoned M (specifically, that he had no contact with M since her removal and had not visited M since after the 2014 jurisdictional hearing), that he did not provide M with the care or education required by law, and did not provide her with the care, guidance, and protection necessary for M\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional well-being. The juvenile court ultimately asserted jurisdiction over M based on (1) M\u2019s PTSD and her \u201chost of emotional, psychological, and behavioral problems\u201d and father\u2019s unwillingness to meet or acknowledge those special needs; (2) father\u2019s <em>defacto </em>\u201cabandonment\u201d of M as a result of his failure to visit with M since November 2014, and the consequent \u201cprofound\u201d harm to M; and (3) father\u2019s failure to participate in court-ordered therapeutic services.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We find no basis to conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over M was inextricably linked to the 2014 jurisdictional findings that were subsequently reversed by us in <em>B. P. </em>At the outset of the court\u2019s oral ruling, it stated, \u201cI have a petition sitting here in front of me, and the petition has allegations with regard to the conditions and circumstances of this child as we\u2019re sitting here today.\u201d The court then asserted jurisdiction over M on three bases, each of which related to circumstances arising after the 2014 jurisdictional hearing. Indeed, the first basis on which the court asserted jurisdiction related to M\u2019s special needs that existed at the time of the 2015 jurisdictional hearing, and father\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>those needs. That finding was based on M\u2019s psychological well-being evaluation, which took place in May 2015, and her resulting PTSD diagnosis. The second basis on which the court asserted jurisdiction was father\u2019s failure to visit M since November 2014, after the 2014 jurisdictional judgment had been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The final basis for asserting jurisdiction was father\u2019s failure to participate in therapeutic services offered to help him understand and manage M\u2019s psychological and emotional needs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Father argues that this basis was inextricably linked to the 2014 jurisdictional judgment: \u201c [T]he department\u2019s theory was that jurisdiction was warranted on the new allegations because father had failed to take[] the steps necessary to ameliorate the original bases for jurisdiction and the conditions attendant to [M\u2019s] abrupt removal from father\u2019s care and tenure in foster care.\u201d However, the record demonstrates that the juvenile court viewed father\u2019s failure to engage in therapy as independent from the 2014 dependency proceedings. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cThis father hasn\u2019t made any effort to ascertain generally how [M] is doing or specifically how her emotional, psychological, and behavioral health are; he did not bother to stay awake to listen when that information was presented in this trial; he did not provide this child with cards or letters, even on her birthday; and he failed to participate in her therapy. He did not attend the second day of trial. He did all of this to her detriment, and to the endangerment of her welfare, either (or maybe both) because he thought somehow that that would impact the viability of his appeal, which is absurd, or because he didn\u2019t want to. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that it is because he didn\u2019t want to, because he didn\u2019t want to follow the rules of what the agency, Court, lawyers, or anybody told him. The harm that he has caused this child by abandoning her in these ways is profound and continues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The juvenile court was aware that the therapeutic services in which father failed to participate related to the 2014 judgment that was pending on appeal. The court nevertheless found that father should have participated in therapy for the well-being of his child, and that father\u2019s failure to attend therapy was cause for jurisdiction, independent of the 2014 jurisdictional judgment. We agree with the court\u2019s determination, and conclude that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment was not dependent on the 2014 jurisdictional judgment, but was based on the new and substantively different allegations adjudicated in 2015. We therefore conclude that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment is valid, notwithstanding our subsequent decision in <em>B. P. </em>that reversed the 2014 jurisdictional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We turn to father\u2019s alternative claim that the 2015 jurisdictional judgment is nevertheless invalid because the juvenile court did not consider mother\u2019s fitness to parent when it rendered its decision. Father acknowledges, and we agree, that this contention is unpreserved, but he asks us to exercise our discretion to correct the error under the plain-error doctrine. We conclude that any error committed by the juvenile court is not plain from the face of the record, and thus decline to review defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u201cAn error is \u2018plain\u2019 \u2018if (1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute, and (3) the error appears on the face of the record, so that we need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Hanson, </em>280 Or App 196, 201, 380 P3d 1136 (2016) (quoting <em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 551, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014)). Here, father fails to establish the second prong of the plain-error test\u2014 that the purported error is obvious and not reasonably in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">At the time of the 2015 jurisdictional hearing, the 2014 jurisdictional judgment was still a valid judgment. The juvenile court took judicial notice of the 2014 case file, which included admissions by mother of her inability to parent M. Father did not object to the court\u2019s consideration of the 2014 case file, acknowledged that the file contained an admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>by mother, and then presented no evidence to challenge mother\u2019s admission. Under those circumstances, it cannot plainly be said that the juvenile court failed to consider mother\u2019s fitness as part of the totality of M\u2019s circumstances in asserting jurisdiction over M. <em>Cf. Dept. of Human Services v. A. F., </em>268 Or App 340, 348, 341 P3d 858 (2014) (finding that the juvenile court erred in asserting jurisdiction over child where prior stipulations of the mother were challenged at the father\u2019s hearing). Indeed, we have held that \u201ca court may make findings about one parent and then proceed to make findings about the other parent before finally taking jurisdiction based on that totality of evidence [,]\u201d provided that \u201cthe conditions and circumstances that give rise to jurisdiction must exist at the time of the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. Here, the record does not plainly demonstrate that the juvenile court did not consider mother\u2019s previous admission when it asserted jurisdiction over M. And, it is not obvious and free from dispute that the juvenile court would have erred in relying on that admission. In <em>B. P., </em>we did not hold that the admissions made by mother were invalid or unreliable, but, rather, accepted DHS\u2019s concession that the evidence <em>as a whole </em>was legally insufficient to demonstrate that M\u2019s conditions or circumstances at the time of the 2014 hearing demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of harm to M\u2019s welfare. 277 Or App at 36. We therefore decline to review father\u2019s unpreserved claim that the court failed to consider the totality of M\u2019s circumstances in asserting jurisdiction over her.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">B. <em>TPR Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We now turn to father\u2019s challenges to the TPR judgment, raised in his first three assignments of error. Father argues that the juvenile court lacked the authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights because the termination petition was predicated upon the now-reversed 2014 jurisdictional judgment and the May 1, 2015, permanency judgment, which in turn was also premised on the now-reversed 2014 jurisdictional judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Father argues that, \u201cto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>extent that this court concludes that father was required to preserve his claims of error and failed to do so,\u201d we should nevertheless review the errors under the plan error doctrine. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">DHS and M contend that father\u2019s claims are procedurally barred for several reasons. First, father waived his right to appeal the TPR judgment when he failed to appear at the termination hearing. Second, father\u2019s challenges to the TPR judgment are unpreserved, and any error was not plain. And, third, because we had not yet reversed the 2014 jurisdictional judgment at the time the juvenile court entered the termination judgment, the juvenile court had \u201cno reason to consider whether it lacked authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights in the absence of the 2014 judgment,\u201d and thus it did not err in conducting the hearing and entering the TPR judgment. We reject DHS and M\u2019s contentions that father\u2019s claims are procedurally barred from appellate review. However, we conclude that the juvenile court had the authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We disagree with DHS and M\u2019s contention that father waived his right to appeal the TPR judgment when he did not appear for call on December 10, 2015. In challenging father\u2019s ability to appeal the TPR judgment, DHS and M rely primarily on our decision in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Jenkins, </em>209 Or App 637, 646, 149 P3d 324 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 416 (2007). In <em>Jenkins, </em>the parent had been served with a summons to personally appear in court <em>to admit or deny </em>the allegations contained in the termination petition. When the parent failed to appear, the juvenile court permitted DHS to present a <em>prima facie </em>case and terminated the parent\u2019s rights. The result was a judgment <em>for want of an answer, </em>which constituted a nonappealable default judgment under ORS 19.245(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After analyzing ORS 19.245(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>and its history, we concluded that the legislature did not intend to exclude judgments terminating parental rights from the requirements set forth under that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 641-44. We explained that, \u201cgenerally under ORS 19.245, a defendant waives the right to appeal when he fails to file a written answer, or if he fails to appear in court at the time and place stated in the summons in the event that the governing statutes provide for an appearance in court in lieu of a written answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. We explained further that \u201c[t]o permit a defendant in a termination of parental rights proceeding to fail to appear at hearing and then to contest the judgment on appeal would be to offend the policy underlying ORS 19.245(2) as determined by [the Supreme Court].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We do not agree with DHS and M that <em>Jenkins </em>is factually similar to the instant case. Here, like in <em>Jenkins, </em>father was initially summoned to appear in court to admit or deny the termination allegations. However, unlike in <em>Jenkins, </em>father did, in fact, appear to deny the allegations against him. After he answered the petition by personally appearing in court, the case was set over for a trial on those allegations. When father did not appear in person for the termination trial, DHS was permitted to present a <em>prima facie </em>case and the juvenile court terminated father\u2019s parental rights <em>in absentia. </em>The key difference between the TPR judgment here and the one rendered in <em>Jenkins </em>is that the instant judgment was not <em>for want of an answer. </em>Thus, it does not constitute a default judgment as contemplated by ORS 19.245(2). <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. S. C. T., </em>281 Or App 246, 253-55, 380 P3d 1211 (2016) (dependency judgment rendered after the parents\u2019 nonappearance at jurisdictional hearing was not a default judgment under ORS 19.245(2), because the parents had personally appeared to answer the petition at an earlier date and the judgment was not for want of an answer). We therefore reject DHS and M\u2019s argument that father\u2019s failure to appear for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>termination trial results in a waiver of his right to appeal the TPR judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We also disagree with DHS and M that father\u2019s claims are unpreserved, and that the juvenile court had no reason to consider whether it lacked authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights in the absence of the 2014 judgment. Just as he did at the jurisdictional hearing, father raised at the termination hearing his contention that the juvenile court could not proceed because the 2014 jurisdictional judgment was likely to soon be reversed on appeal and because father had also appealed the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. In response, DHS explained that dependency was adjudicated anew in October 2015, and that the termination petition had been amended in November 2015 based on the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. The juvenile court denied counsel\u2019s request to set over the trial and permitted DHS to proceed with its <em>prima facie </em>case. Thus, to the extent that preservation principles apply under these circumstances \u2014 where the 2014 jurisdictional judgment had not yet been reversed\u2014 we conclude that father preserved his claims regarding the court\u2019s authority to proceed at the termination hearing. And, contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, the juvenile court did consider its authority to terminate father\u2019s parental rights in light of the pending appeal of the 2014 judgment. We therefore conclude that father\u2019s challenges to the TPR judgment are properly reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">However, father\u2019s arguments fail on the merits. In his first three assignments of error, father contends that the juvenile court erred in ruling that the 2014 jurisdictional judgment and the May 1, 2015, permanency judgment, authorized the filing and prosecution of the termination petition. To the extent that father is arguing that the juvenile court terminated father\u2019s parental rights based solely on the 2014 jurisdictional judgment and the May 1, 2015, permanency judgment, father is incorrect. It is clear from the allegations against father that the termination petition was based on both the 2014 and 2015 jurisdictional judgments. The majority of those allegations related to findings the court made during the 2015 dependency proceeding. Only one allegation \u2014 that father subjected M to physical neglect and failed to provide for her educational, social, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>grooming needs \u2014 pertained to the 2014 jurisdictional judgment. Furthermore, the May 1, 2015, permanency judgment that changed M\u2019s plan to adoption after the 2014 jurisdictional judgment was continued in a separate order rendered on November 24, 2015, after the 2015 jurisdictional judgment. Thus, father\u2019s argument that the termination petition, or the underlying permanency plan of adoption, was based solely on the 2014 jurisdictional judgment, which is now reversed, is unavailing and does not provide a basis for us to reverse the TPR judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> We note that father does not argue that DHS lacked the authority to file a second dependency petition in lieu of amending the first petition, and thus, we do not address that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> Although the 2015 jurisdictional judgment states that \u201cfather has failed to participate in court-ordered therapeutic services,\u201d we note that the jurisdictional petition was amended at the start of the hearing to remove the words \u201ccourt-ordered.\u201d 281 Or App at 222. There was no objection to that amendment, and the parties and the court proceeded with the understanding that father was alleged to have failed to participate in therapy designed to help him recognize and manage M\u2019s special needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> Father does not challenge the juvenile court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law.
