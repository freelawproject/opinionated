It only declares such assignments valid, and the assignee capable of suing in his own name. But the courts of that state have clearly defined\"his rights, duties and obligations resulting from the assignment. The assignee cannot maintain an action on the mere non-payment of the note and notice thereof, until the holder of the note has made use of all due and legal diligence to recover the money from the drawer; whose engagement is held to be, that he will pay the amount, if after due and diligent pursuit the maker is found insolvent.

[381]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-7\">A judgment does not bind lands in the state of Kentucky. The lien attaches only from the delivery of the execution to the sheriff. It then binds real and \u2022personal property, held by legal title. An execution, returned, is no lien on any . property not levied ori; and no new lien can be acquired, until a new execution ' is put into the hands of the sheriff; and none can issue while a former levy is in force. Any delay then by the assignee, enables the debtor to alienate his property in the interval between judgment and the execution reaching the 'sheriff, as well as between the return of one and the lien acquired by a new execution. [8S3]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-8\">By the law of Kentucky.no equitable interest in real or personal, property, unless it is held by mortgage, deed of trust, or other .incumbrance, can.be taken in execution. A capias ad satisfaciendum is the only mode by which the equitable estate of a debtor or his choses in action can be in any way reached by any legal process. It may be the means of coercing the payment of the debt, and it must therefore be used. The return of nulla bona to an execution is in that state the only evidence of there being no property of the debtor on which a levy can be made. It is not evidence of them being no equitable interest which is beyond the reach of such process; orofhis not having that kind of property, on which a levy can be made. [383]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-9\">After judgment obtained in the circuit court of the United States against the drawer of the note, a capias ad satisfaciendum was issued against\u2018him by the holder, and he was put in prison. Two justices of the peace ordered his discharge, claiming to proceed according to the law of Kentucky in the case of insolvent debtors; and the'jailor permitted him to leave the prison. The jailor inade himself and his securities liable for an. escape, by permitting the prisoner to leave the prison. Held, that the neglect of the holder of the note to proceed against the jailor and bis securities, prevents his making of the indorser liable for the amount uf the note.

The general principle of all the cases is, that a plaintiff must pursue with legal diligence all his means and remedies, direct, immediate or collateral, to recover the amount of his debt from the drawer of the note, or of anyone else who has put himself, or has by operation of law been put-in his place.

Gray. It was negotiable, and payable, without defalcation, at the office of discount and deposit of the bank of the United States at Louisville, Kentucky, for value received. John T.

The return was filed the 28th of. March 1822. On the 3d of April 1822, a venditioni exponas issued, returnable the first Monday in June.

The commitmerit was to March I-S24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">The ..proceedings in the suit against Anderson Miller on the other note were also given in evidence. They also terminated in his committal to prison.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">On the 27th of March 1S24, two justices of Kentucky discharged Anderson Miller-from prison.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">Upon this evidence, the court instructed the jury to find for the defendant; and the jury found accordingly. The plaintiffs excepted, and the judge signed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">The plaintiffs offered witnesses,, to prove, that Anderson Miller was notoriously insolvent when the note fell due, and had so continued ever since. The court rejected the evidence, and the plaintiffs excepted. This exception is stated in the bill..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-9\">The plaintiffs contend, that the court erred in charging the jury to find for the defendant; because .they say, it was fully proved that due diligence was used against the drawer; and the remedies afforded by the .law were exhausted, without obtaining the money, and therefore they were entitled to recover from the indorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-10\">They contend, also, that, under the circumstances of-this case, the evidence offered of Miller\u2019s insolvency, ought to have been received:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-11\">The case was argued by Mr Sergeant, for the plaintiffs in error; and by Mr Wickliffe and Mr Bibb, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-12\">Mr Sergeant stated, that the first question was, whether due diligence had been used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-13\">The second, whether the proceedings have been carried so far as to establish the right of holders to sue the indorser or assignor of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-14\">1. The principles of the case were settled at the last term, in the case of The Bank of the United States <em>vs. </em>Weisiger, 2 Peters, 331. They decide this point, at all events; and it is thought the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-15\">It is to he remarked, that it appears on the face of these notes,. that they were drawn for the purpose of discount; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>they were indorsed for the same, purpose; and they were discounted for.Levi Tyler, for value received by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">The diligence used in the commencement of the suit appears from the statement of the case. It was brought to the first term, and in time to obtain a judgment-at that term. No case in Kentucky requires more than this. The holder is not obliged to run a race against time; nor to sue the first term, if judgment could not be obtained. The general phrase is, <em>\u201c </em>it must be- in reasonable time.\u201d Trimble <em>vs. </em>Webb, 1 Monroe, 100. Oldham <em>vs. </em>Bengan, 2 Litt. 132. Collyer <em>vs. </em>Whitaker, 2 Marsh. 197.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">Bail was demanded, which would be necessary if non est inventus was returned, 1 Bibb, 542, but not otherwise. 2 Marsh. 197. Tyler was the bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-7\">2. Judgment was obtained the first term, and:a fieri facias issued on the same day, and was on the same day in the hands of the sheriff. 2 Peters, 333, 348, 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-8\">The fieri facias in thd second case is said not to have been in the marshal\u2019s hands until the 9th of January; but this is probably a mistake; and if it was not, it, was in good time. 2 Peters, 348. It was also immaterial; because the other fieri facias covered the whole property, as the return shows; and there was nothing to levy upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-9\">Was it necessary to issue two writs of fieri facias? From that time forward there was unceasing diligence; the process being followed up as fast as it was returned. It is true that the marshal returned he had not time to sell; but this was not because the writ came too late; it was because he found nothing to levy upon-until the 28th of September 1822; or perhaps it is the ordinary course. Tyler was conusant of all' this, for he was one of the defendants in one of the three executions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">\u25a0Suppose however the officer did wrong; are the plaintiffs responsible for that? It has never been so settled. Postlethwaite vs. Garrett, 3 Monroe, 346. Nothing was lost by it; for the property was secured, such as it was, find a venditioni issued immediately in each case. The proceedings went on until the drawer was committed to prison; and that was all that could be done, and no more was required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Young <em>vs. </em>Cosby, 3 Bibb, 227. Here the diligence was fairly exhausted and at an end. The bail was discharged by this commitment, and there was no recourse to him..</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">Have the proceedings been carried so far as to entitle the holder to sue the indorser or assignor ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">It is contended that, there is an immediate right of action against the indorser by the holder, after the confinement of the drawer, which cannot be divested but by his own act or consent. He is not bound to take a single step to keep the drawer in prison. Young <em>vs. </em>Cosby, 3 Bibb, 227. Authorities upon this principle, 1 Marsh. 535. 2 Bibb. 34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">All this has been done; and the burthen of proof that any thing has been omitted is thrown upon the defendant.. The plaintiffs are not bound to protract the imprisonment one mgm.ent. Bank of the United States vs. Weisiger, 2 Peters, 331. In Virginia the requirements are far short of this. Violett <em>vs. </em>Patten, 5 Cranch, 142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">Ought the law of Kentucky, which professes to be the law of\u2019Virginia, to be carried further than judicial decisions in that state have carried it? The point to be established is the insolvency of the drawer; or his inability to pay, to a reasonable extent. Not that every possible chance of getting the money by any means is exhausted. That point was reached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">But it is insisted, that a new career was to be begun. It is founded upon this argument, that the justices had no authority to discharge; that it was therefore an escape, and the jailor, and his sureties are liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\">Supposing all this to be correct, is it necessary for the . plaintiffs to proceed ? It will be reeolleeted that there was no request to this effect. There is no decided case which gives any countenance to the position. The case of a replevy bond has no' analogy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-11\">But this proceeding would be collateral to the suit. It would be a new departure on a different line of operations, the first suit being only the base.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-12\">Were the jailor and his sureties liable by the Kentucky law ? This cannot be decided for want of evidence. Were there any sureties of the jailor, and to* what amount? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Were they responsible men-, or were they insolvent? Was the pursuit worth the cost ? Th\u00e9 defendant should have shown this by evidence. He was to ask the pursuit to be undertaken, at his cost and for his account. The claim on the plaintiffs seems wholly inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">But the question presented is one of sofne peculiarity. Is there an escape, and who is liable for itf This'is a new question, considering the circumstances. The United States have no prison in Kentucky, nor is the marshal furnished with any place of imprisonment in Kentucky, under his own jurisdiction. The jailor is not of his appointment. The moment he delivers a prisoner to the jailor,- his authority is at an end.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">\u25a0 The matter depends on the resolutions of -congress, and the acts of Kentucky. Resolution of September 23d, 1789. Ing. Ab. 489. Of March 3d, 1791, Ing. Ab. 496. Of March 3d, 1821, Ing. Ab. 507. Acts of Kentucky, 2 Litt. 57, 369. The marshal therefore cannot be liable. Is the jailor\"? He derives his authority from the state of Kentucky, and this' discharge is under the law of Kentucky. It is a complicated question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">Two questions present themselves:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">1. Is it required by the obligation of due diligence in Kentucky, to issue a capias ad satisfaciendum for the purpose. of imprisonment, since the act abolishing imprisonment for debts? Does the law require that to be -done, which the same law declares ought not to be done ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">2. Can a citizen of Kentucky, and one of the law makers, insist that this ought to be done ? Suppose it to be clear that the plaintiffs had a right of action, were they bound to pursue it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\">This, is .a question of evidence in the case, and it is contended the evidence was inadmissible. Violett <em>vs. </em>Patton, 5 Cranch, 142. 2 Marsh. 255; 2 Bibb, 34. 3 Bibb, 227.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-12\">Mr Wickliffe and Mr Bibb, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-13\">This court has uniformly expressed its disposition to adopt the construction which the courts of a state have given of the laws of the state. Elmendorf <em>vs. </em>Taylor, 10 Wheat. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In this opinion the principle is clearly recognized, that'the judicial department of every government is the appropriate expounder of the legislative acts of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">The law of Kentucky in relation to promissory notes, is applicable to those notes which are the foundation of this action; for the notes were drawn and executed in that state, and thgre assigned.. The law of Kentucky is different from the usual commercial law. The responsibility, of an assignor is to accrue after due diligence, by suit, against the drawer. Smallwood <em>vs. </em>Woods, 1 Bibb, 544. Drake <em>vs. </em>Johnson, Hard. 223. Duncan <em>vs. </em>Littell, 2 Bibb, 35, 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">The statute of Kentucky which authorises the assignment of such notes, omits the words-\u201c in the same manner as bills of exchange\u201d contained in the statute of Anne. 1 Dig. Laws of Kentucky, 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">\u2022 The declaration in this case treats the notes as assigned under the law of Kentucky, and the attempt of the plaintiff has been to make out a case of diligence under the Kentucky law; and this is essential to a recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">By the decisions of the supreme court of Kentucky, the responsibility of an assignor of a bond .or note is made to depend uppn due diligence by .suit. against the maker to compel payment. The assignor'must use every compulsory process afforded by law ; and he must use it until the insolvency of the maker, of the note is established, until the suit and all the incidental remedies, however ramified, prove insufficient. Smallwood <em>vs. </em>Woods, 1 Bibb, 542. Hogan <em>vs. </em>Vance, 2 Bibb, 35. 4 Bibb. 287. Marsh. 523. 3 Marsh. 60. 1 Mon. 103. 5 Litt. 331. 3 Bibb. 7. 1 Marsh. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-11\">. From these cases thq consequences are inevitable : that a failure to sue out successive .executions in due time until the officer returns \u201c no property\u201d is negligence ; that the first and every successive process must be diligently pursued, until the prpperty is exhausted and the body taken; and all th\u00e9 remedies have been employed and have failed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-12\">Due diligence is a question of law to the court, when the facts are ascertained. M\u2019Kenney <em>vs. </em>M\u2019Connel, 1 Bibb. 239. Smallwood <em>vs. </em>Woods, 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In the case before the court, the facts were ascertained by the plaintiffs\u2019evidence, upon which the motion for'instructions which prevailed Was founded; the plaintiff produced none. The rules of the law of Kentucky being fully established upon the authorities cited, the principles .they enforce will be.applied to this case,</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">1. 'By showing that the plaintiffs as assignees have not used due diligence against the maker, between the judgment and the capias ad satisfaciendum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">2. That the plaintiffs having failed to proceed against the jailor for an escape, cannot have recourse to the assignor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">1. The plaintiffs have been guilty of cr\u00e1ssa negligentia, between the judgment and the capias ad satisfaciendum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">If suit must be brought to the first term .(4 Monroe, 15); why so? Because execution would otherwise be delayed. Not only suit, but execution must be sued in due time ; and although a fieri facias was sued in due time, yet a delay in pursuing the execution by capias ad satisfaciendum was adjudged negligence. 2 Marsh. 523. What is due diligence; what is negligence in proceedings und'-r executions ; must be tested by the properties and effects which the law gives to executions in respect to three subjects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-9\">1. As to priority between creditors, where all cannot be satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-10\">\u20192. In overreaching alienations by the debtor to bona fide . purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-11\">3. As to the command to the officer to\u2019levy or compel the debtor, or the obedience due by the officer to the precept.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-12\">I and 2. As to priority of lien amongst creditors, and the lien which overreaches alienations by the debtor; the statutes of Virginia and of Kentucky declare that the property shall be bound only from the delivery of the execution to an .officer; and to that end he is required to indorse the time of delivery. Laws of Virginia, 1748, p. 276, sec. 10. Laws of Kentucky, 1 Dig. 513, 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-13\">The common law doctrine of relation to the beginning of the term by judgments is abolished, and the lien commences as has been stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>By the express provisions of the statutes, and' decisions under them, it appears :</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">That if several executions issue at the same time against th\u00e9 same debtor, and are delivered to the same officer, that which comes first to the officer\u2019s hands must be first satisfied, and it does not bind until delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">An execution issued and delivered, creates no lien after-the return day, except upon such property as may have been seized. Tabb <em>vs. </em>Harris, 4 Bibb, 29. Daniel <em>vs. </em>Cockpen\u2019s Executors, 4 Bibb, 532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">Thus, diligence in delivering the execution to the officer, is of the highest importance. In the exercise of the federal jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, the obligation to pursue with the utmost diligence the delivery of the execution, is more important; for between conflicting jurisdictions, the officer who first levies has the right to retain the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">Due diligence then enjoins a speedy delivery of the process to the officer, and that the lien shall be\u2019preserved by keeping the execution in the hands of the officer until a return of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-9\">By the statutes of Virginia and Kentucky, one execution can be -sued after another, if the first b\u00e9 not returned and executed. The great object of this law is, that the plaintiff may. maintain a continued and unbroken lien upon the debtor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-10\">The laws of Virginia and Kentucky upon these points ar\u00e9 the. same, and the practice in the circuit court of the United. States has been to mould their executions so as to embrace lands as well as goods. and chattels ; and this is shown by the decisions of this court in Wyman <em>vs. </em>Southard, 10 Wheat. 1. Bank of the United States <em>vs. </em>Halstead, 10 Wheat. 57. The question is therefore disentangled of any difficulties in the fornis of the execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-11\">To apply these principles to the facts of the case; and first, as to the note for three thousand nine hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-12\">In the executions against Miller, the plaintiffs were guilty of gross negligence:</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-13\">The first execution is tested the 29th of December 1822, and there was a delay of twenty-one days between the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and the delivery; and during this delay, other creditors might have come in, and'the debtor might have aliened his property. This execution was levied on specified property, without afiy return that there was no other; and a subsequent execution was levied\" on other property than that, which was sold for one thousand three hundred dollars. Had the execution been issued earlier, the officer might have sold.before the return day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-5\">Although the fieri facias was returnable the first Monday in March, the venditioni to compel the officer to sell was delayed until the 3d of April 1822. When that was delivered does not appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-6\">That venditioni exponas was returned \u201c not sold for want of bidders^ and sale postponed by agreement,\u201d indorsed on execution No. 2130; but when that was returned does not appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-7\">The next venditioni exponas to compel the sale, was not issued until the 17th of June 1822; and the property was sold on the 1st and 2d of July.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-8\">From the time of this sale, (2d July,) the plaintiff delayed to put another fieri facias into the officer\u2019s hands until the 1st day of October: ninety days were suffered to elapse without any effort.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-9\">Had the plaintiff been vigilant, he would, immediately after the sales in July have issued another fieri facias to bjnd the debtor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-10\">That there was other property appears by the execution and sale on this second fieri facias; and also by the levy on the third fieri- facias.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-11\">These delays were <em>so </em>great; there was such a want of vigilence and due superintendence; such whs -the careless manner in which the executiohs were suffered to limp and halt and drag, by intervals, between \u2022 the one execution and another; that it has taken from-the 29th of December .1821, to the 16th of March 1824, a period of twenty-six months and upwards, before the capias ad satisfaciendum issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-12\">\u2022During these twenty-six months, there were three levies and three sales; and the process upon which these three levies and sales were compelled, were at intervals which evince a total inattention on the part of tfye plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>His own testimony shows that he relied on the clerk and the marshal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">Neither clerk nor marshal have, by law, authority to issue executions, unless ordered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">They are not, virtute officii, bound to act as agents of the plaintiff, in ordering and delivering executions. If they'do s\u00f3, it must be by special authority given by the plaintiff beforehand, or by adopting their acts afterwards. If the plaintiff has' chosen to rely on the clerk and the marshal, to do that for him which it was his duty to do, he must abide the loss by such delays as have been suffered. The clerk is to issue execution, when ordered, and of the kind directed, whether fieri facias or capias ad satisfaciendum or elegit or levari facias; th\u00e9 marshal is bound to receive such when offered to him. It is the business of the plaintiff to direct the clerk to issue, and it is the business of the plaintiff to deliver to the marshal the execution when issued. It is nor excuse for the delays which have happened, for the plaintiff to Say, it was the clerk\u2019s habit to issue executions and put them into a window in his office, and it was the habit of the marshal to call and get them. A reliance upon such habits shows the want of that superintendence and vigilance which was due from an assignee who expects recourse against the assignor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-7\">It- is no excuse for the lapse of time between the return day of one execution, and the teste of the ensuing execution, to say .that the marshal did not return the execution at the return day. He was bound to return the execution according to the command of the precept; and was subject to a .fine and penalty for failing to return the precept at the day appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\">At each rule day on which the process was returnable, the plaintiff had a right to call for it, to demand it; to proceed \u2022against the officer for a failure to return the precept according to its mandate. Moreover, whether returned, or not, he had the right by law on the rule day, and even beft\u00edre, to sue out any other execution and deliver it, so as to preserve his lien. The officer, upon such second execution, would'of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>course regulate his conduct by what he had done on the previous execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-5\">So much for the delay between judgment and capias ad satisfaciendum on the note of three thousand nine hundred dollars, by Miller to Gray, who assigned to Tyler, who assigned to the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">The two notes, and the process upon them, cannot be brought to the aid of each other. The parties are different, and each must be pursued independently. 2 Marsh. 523, 198, 199. Upon the principles already stated, and supported by authorities, the proceedings against the maker of the note for three thousand eight hundred dollars, are liable to charges of the most gross and entire negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-7\">The fieri facias issued on the 29th of December 1S21, did not come to the hands of the marshal until the 19th of January 1822, nearly one month gfter its issue. From the return day, the first Monday in March, until the 3d of April 1822, there was no movement, when a venditioni exponas issued, returnable in June; and then there was no sale, but this was postponed by agreement. The next venditioni was issued on the 17th of June, and sales were made on the 1st and 2d of July; and from that time the process was suffered to sleep until,the 28th of December 1822, a period of one hundred and seventy days. Even between the return day in September, and the teste of the next execution in December, there was an interval of one hundred and eleven days.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-8\">2.

Gray, negotiable and payable sixty days' after date, at the office of discount and deposit of the Bank of the United States, Louisville, Kentucky, for value received. The note was assigned in. the following manner. <em>\u201c </em>For value received, I assign, the within note to Levi Tyler or order, John T. Gray, by Levi Tyler, liis attorney.\u201d \u201c For value received, I assign the within to the president, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, Levi Tyler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">As this note was drawn, assigned, and payable in Kentucky, the obligations and rights of the parties must depend on the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"AMm_\">The statute authorising the assignment of notes is silent as to the duties of the assignee, or the nature of. the contract created by the assignment. It only declares such assignm\u00e9nt valid, and the assignee capable of suing in his own name ;,but the courts of that state have clearly defined the rights, duties, and obligation resulting from the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The assignee cannot maintain an action on the mere nonpayment of the note and notice thereof, or of a protest to the assignor, until the holder of the note has made use of all du\u00e9 and legal diligence to recover the money from the drawer. But if this fails, then the assignor may be resorted toon his assignment; which is held to be an engagement to, pay .the amount of the note,- if, after due and diligent pursuit, the maker is insolvent. This contract results from the act of assignment, without any express agreement to be an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>swerabl\u00e9; the law. is the same, whether this contract is expressed in terms, or is implied from the, assignment; the rights and duties of the parties are the same in both cases. 4 Bibb, 286. 1 Marsh. 229. This case may then be considered as an assignment of a promissory note, with, an ex-, press promise by the assignor to pay if by legal process and due diligence the assignee is unable to recover the amount due from the drawer, Viewed in this light the case is more readily comprehended*.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The means which the assignee is bound to use, the time within which he must commence, and the diligence with .which he must pursue his legal remedies against the maker, and the extent to which he must carry them,-have been the subject of much litigation and discussion in the courts of Kentucky: they have however adopted the following as principles, which must be taken to be the law of the. state:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">That the assignee is no.t bound to run a race against titne, or to -use. extraordinary means; that he is not required to prosecute a drawer or obligor farther than aman of ordinary prudence and diligence would do in a case where he was s.olely and exclusively interested. But in order to' bring himself within these rules, he must commence a suit against' the drawer at the first term after the note becomes due, if a judgment could be obtained then. He must sue within such time, before the.term, as will authorise him to procure judgment. After suit is brought, he must prosecute it to judgment without delay, or giving time to the maker of the note. Though he is notoriously insol vent,-and dies on the third day of the first term after the note becomes due, and no administration is taken out on his estate, the assignor is discharged, if no suit has been brought. ' After judgment, there must be the same diligence in pursuing the debtor\u2019s property by execution as in the commencement of the -suit. There must be no delay in putting the execution into the hands of the sheriff, or in making sale of the property levied on; he must continue the process of execution until\u2019 the property of the .'drawer is exhausted, and the sheriff returns nulla bona to the last execution; and after his insolvency is thus ascertained, a capias ad satisfaciendum must be \u2018taken for his. body; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and if he is committed, the assignee must show what has become of the debtor, and how he has been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">If the debtor assigns property, it must be sold. If property is taken in execution, and replevin bond given, the bond must be put in suit; if there is bail to the action, and the principal cannot be taken on a capias ad satisfaciendum, the bail must be pursued; and all incidental and collateral remedies, which may accrue to the assignee, must be adopted and prosecuted; and the discharge of the drawer by the insolvent act, at the suit of a third person, will be no excuse for any relaxation in the diligence required to fix the assignor; who is suable only after the exhaustion of all legal means of obtaining payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The cases on this subject have been collected in a note in 2 Peters, 338, 339, 340; and were all cited and ably commented on by the counsel on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">It is believed that the principles which exact- such an unusual degree of vigilance from the assignee, are peculiar to the jurisprudence of Kentucky; but they have been established by a long series of cases adjudged in their highest courts for many years \u2022; they have long formed'the law of that state as to notes and bonds assigned under.their statute; and the legislature has not thought prqper to change it. The courts in Virginia have given a very different .construction to their statute on the same subject; and there are no decisions in any state which have extended the rule of diligence so far. But this court has always felt itself bound to respect local laws', however peculiar, in alteases where they do not come in collision with laws .of higher authority and more imposing obligation. Such a case is not presented in the record now under our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">These are the duties imposed by the law of Kentucky on the assignees of promissory notes, before they can commence a suit against the assignor on his promise.' These rules are the law of this case;' and although in our opinion they carry the doctrine .of diligence to an extent unknown to the principles of the common law, or the law of other states, where bonds, notes, and bills are assignable, we must adopt them as the guide to our judgment. They must be considered with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a reference to the laws of Kentucky respecting judgments and executions, in order to form a correct opinion of their true character. A judgment does not bind land in that state; the lien attaches only from the delivery of an execution to the sheriff; it then binds real and personal property, held by a legal title. An execution returned, is no lien on any property not levied on; and no new one can be acquired'until a new execution is put into the- hands of the sheriff; and none can issue while a former levy is in force. 6 Kentucky Digest, 485, sec. 8. Any delay then by the assignee enables the debtor to acquire, hold or alienate his property in the interval between judgment and the'execution reaching the sheriff; as well as between the return of one and the lien acquired by a new execution. There is therefore more Treason in exacting strict diligence on the part of the assignee, than in those states where real estate is bound by a judgment with-put an execution. On general principles, it is certainly a rule of very great rigour to require a capias ad satisfaciendum to be issued and served after a return of nulla bona. But as, by the law of Kentucky, no equitable interest in real or personal property, except where it is held or covered by mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance, can be taken in execution; a capias ad satisfaciendum is'the only mode by which the equitable estate of 'the debtor or his chos\u00e9s in action can be in any way reached by any legal process. 1 Kent. Dig. 504, sec. 5, 505, sec. 6. It maybe the means of coercing the payment of the debt, and it must therefore be used. The return of nulla bona to an execution, is, in that state, evidence only of there being no property of the debtor on which a levy can be made. It is not evidence of there being no equitable interests, which are beyond the reach of legal process; or of his not having that kind of property on which no levy can be madei A debtor, confined by an execution from the federal courts, can only be discharged under the insolvent act of congress passed January 1800; the provisions of which are effectual to compel a disclosure of all-his property. In the language of this court, \u201c the coercive means of this law are to\u2019 be found in the searching oath to be administered, and in the fear of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>prosecution for perjury, and recommitment; in the .same action. Bank of the United States <em>vs. </em>Weisiger, 2 Peters, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The creditor has a right to use these coercive means; and where he intends to make the insolvency of the debtor. the ground of a resort to the assignor of the note on which the judgment was obtained, he is by the principles of the Kentucky decisions bound to use them to the full extent authorised by the laws of that state, as expounded by its highest judicial tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In discarding from our minds all considerations unconnected with the peculiar local law which governs this case,' and considering.it in all its bearings on both parties; we are not prepared to say that either has any right to complain of ,the severity of the rules which impose on them their respec-. tive obligations. If the law merchant were to govern, the plaintiff would be without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"Atv_\">Suing as the indorser of a negotiable note, he must fail, for want of a protest or demand of payment of the drawer, and notice to the indorser. The diligence exacted of him is quite as extreme, if not more so, as when he sues as assignee. He must not give the drawer time for one day beyond the days of grace, or what local usage permits. His notorious insolvency; his being discharged as an insolvent debtor or a certified bankrupt; will not excuse the holder. This court have decided at this term, in the case of The Bank of the United States <em>vs. </em>Magrjider, that where adrawer of a note dies before^ it becomes due, and the indorser administers on his estate, demand of payment and notice to the indorser are indispensable. No decisions in Kentucky on assigned notes establish a more rigid doctrine than is applicable to indorsers by the law merchant. In such cases demand and notice are required to fix the indorser, because the debtor may pay by the interference of friends; not because he is supposed to have the means of doing it otherwise. It is to\u00f3 late to inquire into the reason of these rules; which have become' settled and established as the general law of negotiable notes in the commercial world, and of assignable notes in Kentucky. They, roust be submitted to as the law of the contract into which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the parties respectively enter, on becoming indorsers in the one case, and assignees in the other. If it is not'going beyond the principles of the common law of England and this country, it is at least extending them to their utmost limits, to say that the assignor of a note, without fraud, or a promise to pay in the event of the insolvency of the drawer, should be liable by. the mere effect of the assignment; and that there is no difference between his assigning with or without an express promise. It is at least testing the contract of assignment by the rules of the summum jus. Neither the statute of Anne or of any of the states of this union, making notes assignable (so far as is known), expressly impose on the assignor any obligation which did not .attach to the assignment-of a chose in action at common law. Such assignments are recognized; and though the assignee cannot sue in his own name, his rights are as much protected in courts of'law as those of assignees, by virtue of the statute. 3 Bibb, 293. 4 Bibb, 557. It is not easy, to assign any sound reasons for construing the assignment as, per se, importing a higher obligation in the one case than the other. But the law of Kentucky has given this effect to assignments of notes under the.statute of that state ; and as the plaintiffs cannot sustain this action in their own name without the aid of the law, they must submit to the conditions which the settled, judgments on the action have imposed on th\u00e9m: If, in availing themselves of this strict obligation imposed on the assignor, they find themselves compelled to use a corresponding degree' of vigilance on their part, exceeding, that which is required in other states under similar statutes ;- this court cannot afford them an exemption from its exercise. The local law is clearly'settled, .and we must submit to. it; however w\u00e9 might be inclined to construe the law, if it were now open to a construction more'consistent with that which has been uniformly given to statutes authorising the assignment of bonds, bills and notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In the.application of these rules to the first note which is the subject of this action, the defendant admits, that up to the time of issuing the first execution, there has been no want of due diligence on the part of the plaintiff; but he alleges, that from that time, there was unnecessary delay in various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>particulars, which nave been pointed out and dwelt upon with much earnestness. As the statement of the case contains the teste, the .return day, the day of the return of each execution, and the time .of their coming to the hands of the marshal; it is unnecessary to examine in detail the alleged instances of negligence by the lapse of time : but there is one rule for which the defendant contends, which deserves some more particular-notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">By the fifth section of a law of Kentucky, passed in 1811, it is made the duty of the courts of that state, to appointby rule of court, some day in each month as a general return day of execution. The provisions of this law having been carried into effect j the defendant insists, that in the exercise of the legal diligence incumbent on the plaintiff, he was bound to take out his execution returnable on some rule day, and attend at the office to watch its progress and effect. We think this would be applying the doctrine of diligence with .unreasonable strictness. We find no decision which warrants the extension of it to so extreme a <em>point; </em>and we are not disposed to go one step in advance of the principles heretofore adopted. The case of the Bank <em>vs. </em>Weisiger is conclusive on this part of thetiefendant\u2019s case; it was there settled, that a lapse of thirty-six days between the judgment and the delivery of the execution to the rnarshai, did not amount to that want of diligence which exonerated the assignor of the note on which the judgment was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">-We have been furnished with no adjudged case's in Kentucky, which fix any definite time within which an execution must be made returnable. On examining the executions which have issued on the judgment.on the first note, they are all returnable within three months from their teste; and no period of three months has been suffered to elapse, within which an execution has not been in the hands of the marshal, unless when writs of venditioni exponas were out: and they appear, to have issued in all instances within that period. The greatest time which has intervened between the issuing of an execution and placing it in the hands of the marshal, appears to be. thirty-one days; and from the return of one execution or venditioni, until the issuing of\u2019another, thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>days : \u00e1nd we are not aware that in any of these cases there is any decision that this would be a wan.t of diligence in the assignor. In the absence of any such decision, and feeling, at liberty to decide upon them as open quesi jns, we are of. opinion, that the plaintiff, in the proceedings subsequent to the judgment, has at no time omitted to pursue the maker ,of this note with all the diligence which the law required of him.- On this part of the case, we think the decision of this court in the case of the Bank of the United States <em>vs. </em>Weisiger is strongly applicable. That was a case of the assignee against the assignor of a promissory note. Judgment was entered November term 1821. Execution issued on the 29th of December; was placed in marshal\u2019s hands on the 19th of. January, thirty-six days from the entry of judgment.; return-' ed nulla bona, at M^rch term 1822, the 3d day of the month; and a capias ad satisfaciendum issued on the 11th of April 1822, thirty-eight days from the return day of the fieri facias. This was held not to be such a want of diligence afe exonerated the assignor. This decision seems to us to cover all the ground assumed by the plaintiff, up to the time of the discharge of Miller from his imprisonment on the capias ad satisfaciendum;, and thus far we think he has done or omitted no act which has impaired his right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">. It remains now to consider the last allegation of the want of diligence imputed to the plaintiff, and its effect on th\u00e9 suit. Miller was arrested and imprisoned on the 27th of March 1824; and on th\u00e9 same day was discharged by the jailor, on the order of/- two justices of the peace, acting or pretending to act under a law of Kentucky, passed in 1820, (1 Kent. Dig. 503, sec. 1 and 3), abolishing imprisonment for debt, and authorising a justice of the peace, on application of any person in jail or in prison bounds, on reasonable notice to the party at whose suit he has been committed, to issue an order for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u25a0 It is not necessary to inquire whether this law would apply to process from the federal courts; so as to legalize the discharge of a prisoner from the execution issued in this \u00a1case, hnd protect the jailor and his sureties from an action by the plaintiffs for an escape. The laws qf 'Kentucky on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>this subject are to6 clear to admit of a doubt: they authorise the discharge of a debtor from, imprisonment., on making a schedule of his property, surrendering it to the use of his creditors, and taking the oath prescribed. 1 Kent. Dig. 490, 491, 492, act of 1819; 564, act of 1821.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It was under this law that the justices acted in issuing the order of discharge. - But it could not apply to a commitment by the marshal, uiider an execution from the federal courts; because an express provision was made by prior laws, which made it the duty of the jailor to safely keep such prisoners, until they shall be discharged according to the laws of the United States. 2 Kentucky Digest, 676. The act of 1798 provides; that jailors shall receive intotheir custody all persons committed under the authority of the United Stat\u00e9s, and keep them safely, until discharged by the due course of the laws of the United States; and the jailor is subject to the same pains and penalties for neglect of duty, as if the commitment had been by state authority. By the act of 1800, the marshal of the United States has a right to use any prison.for the imprisonment of any.one by legal process, in the same manner as the Sheris' of a.county may, if the prisoner was delivered by him; and this law wasunrepeal\u00e9d, and in force, tit, the time of Miller\u2019s discharge. To entitle a debtor to a discharge under the insolvent law of January 1800, he niust give the.credbor thirty days\u2019 notice of his application, and take an oath that he is not worth thirty dollars, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The jailor was bound to take notice of this law, and of tjie laws of Kentucky, which required him to detain the prisoner until he complied with these provisions :, he knew the conditions of his bond, and acted at his peril in releasing him; without one day\u2019s confinement, without notice, oath, or the order of the district judge. The discharge-was wholly unauthorised and illegal; the order of the justices did not protect the jailor; and he was liable to the plaintiff in an, action for the escape, to the full amount of the .execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The. act of 1812, 2 Kent. Dig. 679, requires, all jailors to execute,,.in their county court, a bond, with one or more approved sureties, in at least the sum. of one thousand dollars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and as much more as the court m\u00e1y deem proper; payable to the commonwealth, and conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties of the office.of jailor; which maybe put in suit by any person injured by his acts. And the act of 1811 enacts, that where a bond is given by any public officer to the commonwealth, the recovery against the principal and his sureties shall nbt'be limited to the penalty; but they shall be liable according to law, and to the full extent of the officiabobligations of such officer, as the same are enumerated in the*condition of such bond. 2 Kent. Dig, 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">T.he remedy thus afforded to the plaintiff was a substantial one; extending to his whole claim, if the jailor or his securities were solvent. It w\u00e1s not indirect, remote, or doubtful. die had acquired a new security, of which the assignor had a right to.claim the benefit; but which he could not use for his protection : the-plaintiff could alone sue for the escape, or bring an action on the jailor\u2019s official bond, which enured to his use,\"but not to the use of the defendant. If this new security had been a bond for the prison boiinds, there would be no doubt that it would be his duty to pursue the parties to it before resorting to the. defendant; and it was equally his dirty to pursue the jailor, and his securities, on his-bond of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The jailor had violated his duty; his bond became forfeited ; he and his securities had put themselves in the place of the debtor, who was permitted to escape; and they thus assumed all his responsibility to the plaintiff. No event could arise' by which they could be discharged. A voluntary return, or a recaption of the prisoner; would not avail them; they were under a stronger and more direct obligation to pay the money than special bail; against whom, it is admitted, that legal proceedings must be used with due diligence, before resorting to the assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Although we find no express decision by the courts of Kentucky, enjoining on a plaintiff tjie necessity of suing a jailor and his .securities for the escape of a prisoner; yet it seems to us, that, in the spirit of them all, he is bound to do so The general principle of all the cases is, that a plaintiff must pursue, with legal \u2019diligence, all his means and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>remedies, direct, incidental or collateral, to recover the amount of his debt from the defendant, or any one who has put himself, or has by operation of . law been put in his place. This the plaintiffs in this case have wholly omitted ; with a plain, undoubted cause of action against the jailor and his sureties; with legal means of compelling them to pay to the whole extent of their estates; and, for ought which appears, to the full amount of his claim against Miller, the maker of the note in question. They have made no attempt to assert their rights against either. According to the spirit and principle of the Kentucky decisions, we are constrained to say this is not due diligence; but that kind of legal negligence, which entitled the defendant to a judgment in his favour in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to consider th\u00e9 effect of the proceedings on the second note; which were conducted with less diligence than those on the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Having thus disposed of the first error assigned by the plaintiff, it remains to consider the second; which, is, that the circuit court erred in rejecting the evidence offered of Miller\u2019s notorious insolvency at the time the note became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">If the court are correct in overruling the exception taken to the charge of the circuit court, we cannot reverse then judgment for overruling this evidence. It did not conduce to prove any fact material to the issue between the parties: which was, not whether Miller was in fact insolvent; but whether the plaintiff had by due diligence ascertained his insolvency, by legal process.commenced in time, diligently conducted till its'final consummation,, and by the exhaustion of all incidental and collateral remedies afforded by the law, without obtaining the debt. The proof, or the admission of actual insolvency, would in no wise relieve the plaintiffs from the duty imposed on them ; it would not accelerate their right to- sue the defendant, or enlarge his obligation to pay, which did not arise by the mere insolvency of the maker of the note, but by its legal ascertainment in the manner prescribed by the judicial law of Kentucky. That law has been recognized by this court in the case of Weisiger, as appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>cable to cases of this description. To decide now, that the plaintiffs could avail themselves of the insolvency of the maker, unaccompanied with the diligent use of all legal remedies ; and in a case where we are of opinion that the plaintiffs have not made use of the diligence which under the circumstances of this case it was incumbent on them to use, would be to disregard all the principles of Kentucky jurisprudence, as evidenced by the received opinion, general practice, and judicial decisions of that state</p>\n<p id=\"A8J\">We think it is not an open question, whether these principies shall be respected by this court; and cannot feel authorised to depart from them in a case to which their application cannot be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The judgment of the circuit court is therefore affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript ef the record from the circuit court of the United States, for the seventh circuit and district of Kentucky, and was argued by counsel; on consideration \u2019 Whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
