We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-23\">On April 21, 1987, Smith filed a petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court dismissed the petition for want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>proper prosecution on June 17, 1987. Smith did not appeal that dismissal. On August 18, 1987, Smith filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court dismissed Smith\u2019s Chapter 11 petition on the grounds that the petition was filed less than 180 days after the dismissal of a prior petition for failure to properly prosecute. The district court affirmed and Smith filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">The district court correctly affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s bankruptcy petition. The applicable section of the United States Bankruptcy Code is clear and unambiguous. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKq\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no individual ... may be a debtor under this title who has been a debtor in a case pending under this title at any time in the preceding 180 days if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-6\">(1) the case was dismissed by the court for willful failure of the debtor to abide by orders of the court, or to appear before the court in proper prosecution of the case....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">Mr. Smith\u2019s Chapter 13 petition was dismissed for want of proper prosecution on June 17,1987. His Chapter 11 petition was filed on August 18, 1987, roughly 60 days after the Chapter 13 dismissal. This placed Mr. Smith\u2019s Chapter 11 petition squarely within the prohibited period set forth in the bankruptcy code. The district court therefore correctly upheld the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is patently correct. This appeal is frivolous and entirely without merit. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Local Rule 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
