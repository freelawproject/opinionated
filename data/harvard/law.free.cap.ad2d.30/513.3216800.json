It is noted that the defendant was not originally made a party to the Georgia action but that plaintiff here, a defendant in such action, intends to prosecute therein a third-party complaint against this defendant seeking a recovery for a breach of the contract containing the arbitration clause. In the circumstances here, however, it is not deemed proper for this State court, in the action pending before it, to stay or restrain the plaintiff from proceeding in the action pending in the Federal court. (See <em>Star Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>12 A D 2d 738; <em>Admiral Corp. </em>v. <em>Heines Distrs., </em>9 A D 2d 410, affd. 8 N Y 2d 773; <em>Vandervoort </em>v. <em>M. V. Effort, Inc., </em>50 Misc 2d 633.) The defendant may, of course, apply in the Georgia action for any proper relief. It was properly concluded that the contract between the parties does not provide for unlawful \u201cvertical price fixing\u201d in violation of Federal and State antitrust laws and that the provisions for arbitration are enforeible. (See 37 N. Y. Jur., Monopolies, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29; <em>Dawn to Dusk, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Brunckhorst Co., </em>23 A D 2d 780; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Columbia Pictures Corp., </em>189 F. Supp. 153.) The alleged antitrust issue will not be submitted to the arbitrators. (Cf. <em>Matter of Aimcee Wholesale Corp. [Tomar Prods.], </em>21 N Y 2d 621.) Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s actions were fully consistent with an intention to preserve its right to arbitrate, defendant has not waived its rights under the arbitration clause. (See <em>Matter of Ladin [D. &amp; C. Textile Corp.], </em>20 A D 2d 8, affd. 14 N Y 2d 781.) Concur\u2014Botein, P. J., Eager, Capozzoli, McGivern and Rabin, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
