On appeal he claims that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because a police officer overheard telephone conversations between himself and one Cartwright. Cartwright, a narcotics purchaser turned special employee (informant) for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, gave the officer permission to listen to the conversations on his extension phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-27\">We find no merit to this appeal. Listening in on a telephone conversation on an extension phone with the consent of one party does not constitute a search prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>It is also established that this is not a prohibited interception within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605. Rathun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107, 78 S.Ct. 161, 2 L.Ed. 2d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
