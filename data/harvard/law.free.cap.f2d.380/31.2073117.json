We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-25\">In extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, reported at 236 F.Supp. 866, the District Court held that appel-lee\u2019s pilot exercised due care prior to and during the sheering and grounding of the vessel in the Panama Canal and that the accident was not the fault of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Luckenbach contends that the District Court erred in finding (1) that the pilot was not negligent in proceeding at the course followed and speed accomplished; (2) the pilot took prompt and adequate measures to arrest sheer; and (3) a temporary, self-correcting failure of the Luekenbach\u2019s steering gear was reasonably established as the cause of the grounding. The action of the trial court in admitting into evidence and allowing great credence to the findings and conclusions of the Board of Local Inspectors of the Panama Canal Company is also complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The detailed evidence is clearly and succinctly set out in the published opinion of the District Court. Repeated examination of the record presents us with no basis for deciding here that these findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">As for the admissibility of the findings and conclusions of the Local Board, the Canal Zone Code appears to allow such reports as an exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even in the absence of statutory authority, reports of Boards of Local Inspectors have been held admissible, cf. Judge Borah\u2019s opinion in The Abangarez, E.D.La.1932, 60 F.2d 543, 544, approved in Victorias Milling Co. v. Panama Canal Co., 5 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 716, 724, fn. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\">.
