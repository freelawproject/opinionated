Laws Mich. 1948 \u00a7\u00a7 600.705, 600.715 [P.A.1961, No. 236] against the publisher and author of an article which allegedly invaded plaintiff\u2019s right to privacy. Defendant moved below for dismissal on three grounds: first, that proper service of process had not been accomplished; second, that the long-arm statute should not be construed as applying to the facts alleged in the complaint; and third, that the statute, if applicable, was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Instead of deciding the first question of sufficiency of service, the trial judge decided that the statute was applicable and as applied, was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Our attention has not been directed to, nor do we find, a case in which a Michigan appellate court has construed this statute. Velandra v. Regie Nationale Des Usines Renault, 6 Cir., 336 F.2d 292 (1964), decided by this court, did not, as urged by defendant, construe this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">If the matter is not properly before us because of insufficiency of service, it is unnecessary to construe the statute and to pass on its constitutionality if applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Accordingly, the case will be remanded with the instruction to determine the first ground urged for dismissal. Jurisdiction of the appeal will be retained pending this determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
