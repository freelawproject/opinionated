It was not improper to receive in evidence a photostatic copy of the check. The accompanying certification of the Chief, Directives Control and Distribution Branch, Office of Administrative Services, Treasury Department, alone, was probably deficient to procure admission of the photostatic copy, but its authenticity as a correct copy was abundantly established by the testimony of the thieves who had stolen it, falsely endorsed it and delivered it to the defendant for negotiation. It was similarly identified by the person who cashed it as a copy of the check the defendant had negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
