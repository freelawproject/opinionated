At that time he was informed of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>counsel, waived such assistance, and pleaded guilty. Thereafter, on March 26, 1965, he was arraigned on a Texas information charging him with another Dyer Act violation. Again, he waived his right to counsel and pleaded guilty. Approximately two months later, on May 28, 1965, after a classification study, appellant was given five and three year sentences to run consecutively pursuant to the Youth Correction Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5010(c). Because of the inapplicability of the Youth Correction Act, however, appellant was returned to court on June 10, 1965, at which time the same consecutive sentences were again imposed, this time pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4082.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In this motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, appellant\u2019s allegations are (1) that his plea of guilty was induced by promises by an Assistant United States Attorney of a concurrent sentence and was therefore not voluntarily made; (2) that he was not adequately advised that his right to counsel extended to the time of sentencing, so that he did not intelligently waive that right; (3) that he had a right to be advised in advance of his resentencing so as to be able to prepare statements and arguments; and (4) that he was entitled to access to the Presentence Report and Classification Study. The district court, after a plenary hearing, found with respect to apappellant\u2019s allegations that no Assistant United States Attorney visited appellant at the time alleged, that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was not made in reliance upon any representations or promises of concurrent sentences, that the admonition given appellant prior to the taking of his guilty plea \u201cwas intended and so worded as to effectively advise Petitioner of his right to counsel in connection with any proceedings against him,\u201d and that appellant waived his right to counsel with such full understanding. These findings are amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-17\">We realize that appellant had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel at every stage in the proceedings against him, including sentencing, Ellis v. Ellisor, 5 Cir. 1956, 239 F.2d 175; Davis v. United States, 8 Cir. 1955, 226 F.2d 834. However, we agree with the court below that appellant was adequately advised, pre Miranda,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of his right to counsel and that he intelligently waived it at the March 26 Texas arraignment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The thrust of appellant\u2019s oral argument was that the court, by asking appellant the following question at his arraignment on the California charge, misled him into believing that he had the right to counsel <em>only </em>at his arraignment and at no other time and that he did not have the right to counsel at his sentencing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL4\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-18\">Now, each one of you is entitled to have a lawyer and it won\u2019t cost you anything. You do not have to have a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-19\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-20\">The question I want to find out from each of you is whether at this time for this hearing you wish me to appoint an attorney for you. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>It is clear to us from reading the above portion of the transcript in context<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the trial judge did not mislead appellant as the isolated quotation might indicate, but rather, that the court took special precaution to advise appellant that he would be sentenced at another time and that by not requesting counsel \u201cat this hearing,\u201d appellant would not lose his right to counsel at the later sentencing. We do not here base our holding on the warning given appellant at the arraignment on the California charge, but we cannot ignore the fact that his later waiver <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was made pursuant to the court\u2019s explicit language thereat. The testimony, quoted in full, amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that the admonition was calculated to and effectively did advise appellant of his right to counsel in connection with any proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Appellant\u2019s further contention that the district court erred in not notifying him in advance that he was to be resentenced is wholly without merit. Lack of advance notice was, at most, harmless error, since the resentencing re-' suited only in the identical sentences being made pursuant to the Adult Provision rather than the Youth Correction Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">As for appellant\u2019s allegation that he was entitled to know the contents of the presentence report and classification study, we find no error on the part of the trial court. Even under Rule 32, F.R.Crim.Proc., as amended, disclosure of the presented report is discretionary with the court. The rule as formerly worded, however, did not expressly state whether the court might disclose all or part of the report to the defendant or his counsel. But it was settled that a defendant might not demand inspection as a matter of right, see 8 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 32.03 [4], and without appellant\u2019s having made any request whatever, we cannot here say that failure to disclose the contents of the report was reversible error. Accordingly, the order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion for writ of habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"adv-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\">. 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">.
