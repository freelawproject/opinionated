Acting through its president, one Hill, it entered into a contract with the owners and operators of the Postal Building in Portland, represented by Mrs. Re\u00edos, to clean the windows of that building. In performing the work, one of appellee\u2019s employees fell and was severely injured. Alleging that the accident was caused by the defective nature of the building\u2019s window frames and that the building owners had been negligent in permitting the defective condition to exist, as well as in failing to warn of its existence, the injured employee sued the owners for damages in an Oregon state court. Appellant, a Maryland corporation and the owners\u2019 public liability insurance carrier, undertook defense of the action and ultimately settled it for $22,-500.</p>\n<p id=\"A3O\">Claiming to be subrogated to rights of the building owners, appellant then sought to recover its loss by the present action in the United States District Court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. It alleged that the appellee had breached an oral contract with the owners \u201cto provide insurance protection\u201d which would have indemnified the building owners against \u201cany and all claims of any kind and nature arising out of the window washing operations,\u201d including the claim of the injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Following the presentation of evidence, the district judge granted appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, holding that, even if the conversations relied upon by appellant occurred, as the owners\u2019 agent testified, the terms of the alleged contract were so indefinite that they could not constitute an enforceable contract to procure insurance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">The District Court correctly undertook to apply Oregon law, and appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the court erroneously applied to this case, involving an alleged <em>contrast to procure insurance, </em>the standards of proof which, in Oregon, relate to a <em>contract of insurance. </em>We are referred to Hamacher v. Tumy et al., 222 Or. 341, 352 P.2d 493 (1960), wherein the Supreme Court of Oregon held that the elements of a contract <em>of an insurance broker </em>to procure insurance need not be proved with the exactitude which is required to establish a contract of insurance. Because the broker holds himself out as an expert in the field, said the Oregon court, a contract to procure insurance may arise even though it remains to the broker to ascertain some of the facts essential to creation of the ultimate contract of insurance. The decision is not controlling here, for the appellee is not an insurance broker, nor was it alleged or shown that its representatives were held out as possessing any particular expertise in the insurance field. Moreover, <em>Hamacher </em>specifically recognizes the applicability to alleged <em>contracts to procure insurance </em>of the \u201celementary legal proposition that a contract will not arise until there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sufficient certainty in the proof of its terms.\u201d 352 P.2d at 497. \u201cObviously, liability for failure to procure insurance could not arise unless the agent had sufficiently definite directions from his principal to enable him to consummate the final insurance contract.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Even if the language allegedly used by Hill in the negotiations with Mrs. Re\u00edos could be construed as words of promise to procure insurance, we must agree with the district judge that there was no promise of reasonable certainty. The only real thrust of any promise, as such can be seen from the testimony of Mrs. Re\u00edos, is that the insurance coverage provided by Clean-Rite was \u201cextra heavy\u201d or \u201ccomplete.\u201d These descriptions are so vague that only speculation could support a determination of the precise terms and extent of that coverage and resolution of the question of whether or not it would afford indemnity against many different types of loss, including that which was sustained here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>therefore hold that the alleged contract is, for lack of certainty in its terms, unenforceable, and that the district judge properly granted the appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\">. It is clear that Mrs. Relos herself was originally in doubt as to the import of the statements which, in subsequent testimony, she attributed to Hill. Under date of August 29, 1963, she wrote a letter to Hill and remarked, \u201cIt occurs to me now in view of your earlier comments about insurance that the Postal Building <em>might he </em>covered for this claim under your insurance policies.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The only testimony claimed to support appellant\u2019s case, as emphasized in its brief, is that given by the owners\u2019 agent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cWell, I called him and he came down to the office, and we were discussing doing the window washing at the building, and I told him that \u2014 I asked him what type of coverage <em>he carried, </em>because we wanted complete coverage in everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cAnd he went on to tell me, particularly I do remember about the conversation that <em>he carried </em>extra insurance with the Zurich Company, and that is why he had to charge a bit more for\u2014 on the regular rate. Most of the window washers have about the same rate for the size of the building. I think they do it on account of the windows. At any rate, his fee was more, and I asked him why, and he said because <em>he carried </em>such extra heavy insurance to cover us in any circumstances which might arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">\u201cAnd he said, \u2018For the insurance that <em>I carry, </em>you would be covered for any type of situation that might arise.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">\u201cAnd this is what impressed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABV\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">Q \u201cWhat is that you are looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">A \u201cWell, it is a large ad in the advertising, Clean-Rite Maintenance, and goes on to say what they do, and fully insured for your protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3B\">Q \u201cDid you read that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajv\">A \u201cYes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">\u201cHe said that the one reason that his charge was more was because he had to pay extra for such heavy insurance to protect the people that he worked for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoo\">\u201cHe said that we would be completely covered if anything arose that was wrong that would hurt us; anything wrong he would have the complete insurance coverage, and that is all I was interested in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alc-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcW\">\u201cHe told me that <em>he carried </em>a type of bond. Now \u2014 a type of bond, and <em>he carried </em>this Zurich, with the Zurich Company, and he told me that it just covered extra insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a9f-dedup-0\">\u201cAnd I asked him, \u2018Why do you charge more than \u2014 \u2019 most window washing companies charge about the same. And he said because of the extra coverage <em>he carried, </em>and that is why he had to charge more, but in turn the people that had his services were covered more.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiV\">In the foregoing, we see that the statements attributed to Hill hardly constituted promises to procure insurance, and they cannot be construed as an agreement by appellee to indemnify the owners for losses resulting from the negligence of the owners themselves. They were, more accurately, representations as to insurance already in force.</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">Even if the suit had been predicated upon allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation, as it was not, there was no showing that the insurance carried by appel-lee was not \u201cextra heavy\u201d as compared with insurance customarily carried by firms engaged in the building maintenance business. The appellee was, in fact, insured for \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d for bodily injury or property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>damage under a \u201ccomprehensive liability policy\u201d issued by Zurich Insurance Company for a period including the time when the accident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AFf\">. Because of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us, as it was apparently also believed unnecessary by the District Court, to consider appellee\u2019s contention that appellant, in the circumstances, was not entitled to the asserted right of subrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
