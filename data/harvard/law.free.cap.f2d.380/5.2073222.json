Respondent rejected it<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as not constituting a \u201cconcise\u201d statement of grounds as required by local rule. Petitioner then filed a petition on the mimeographed form supplied by the court and tendered his fifty-page memorandum as a supplement. The judge accepted the petition and rejected the supplement. Petitioner then sought mandamus from this court to compel the judge to accept his fifty-page memorandum. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1964). We granted leave to file, and ordered respondent judge to show cause why the writ should not issue. Respondent has now made his return to our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Since petitioner is in penal custody, oral argument is dispensed with and the case is ordered submitted upon the papers before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"> Respondent, under the District Court\u2019s local rule, properly refused to accept petitioner\u2019s fifty-page memorandum as a petition or supplement to petition for a writ. The volume of habeas corpus petitions has grown to a point where time no longer permits a court-initiated search for merit in every layman\u2019s narrative of grievance prepared in the traditional prison style. When prisoners address the court today they must expect to be required to conform to court rules adopted to assure that a judge\u2019s time is efficiently used. A rule implemented in such fashion as that here under attack now supplies an assurance, otherwise lacking, that relevant facts will be so exposed as to permit the meritorious case to have its remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">While respondent might well have permitted petitioner to file his memorandum as argument in support of his petition, the extent to which a judge will listen to a layman\u2019s argument upon the law is controlled by exercise of discretion, and in our view is not an appropriate subject for mandamus. Petitioner can suffer no prejudice from limitation upon (his right to argue, unless respondent thereby falls into error. Such prejudice would find its remedy in an appeal from denial of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Writ denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-14\">. C.D.Calif.R. 19. Other courts in our Circuit have similar rules: S.D.Calif.R. 19; D.Nev.R. 20; D.Ore.R. 19; E.D.Wash.R. 27; W.D.Wash.R. 34, 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-21\">. This was accomplished by instructions to the clerk of court, on the latter\u2019s inquiry, not to accept the document for filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
