(H MH) and Playboy Clubs International, Inc. (International), Delaware corporations, both with principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois, as plaintiffs, brought this suit against Othal L. Turner and On-The-Town, Inc., d/b/a Atlanta\u2019s Playboy Club, Georgia citizens, defendants, to enjoin the use of plaintiffs\u2019 trade and service marks by defendants in their operation of a night club and restaurant known as \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">The suit is based on diversity of citizenship (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332), on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 relating to actions involving trademarks, and on the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121). It is alleged that defendants wilfully infringed on trade and service marks of plaintiff HMH, especially in the use of the trademark and service mark \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d and in the use of the marks \u201cPlayboy\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d in the conducting of a night club and restaurant. From a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, granting a permanent injunction against the use of these marks, defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">HMH began the publication of \u201cPlayboy\" Magazine in November 1953 and registered the trademark \u201cPlayboy\u201d for a monthly magazine on December 28, 1954 with the United States Patent Office. When defendants began the alleged unauthorized use of the name \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club,\u201d in April 1962, the monthly circulation of Playboy Magazine was 1,310,069 copies and when this case was tried it had reached a monthly circulation of 3,366,000. More than 170,000,-000 copies have been sold. Its circulation is both nationwide and international.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">Hugh M. Hefner was the organizer of HMH and is the owner of 80 per cent of its stock. He has been its president and one of its directors from the beginning. In 1957, HMH announced the intention to use its trademarks directly in the night club business. In 1959, Hefner and two associates organ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ized Chicago Playboy Club, Inc., which later opened the first club in Chicago. In 1960, the same persons organized plaintiff Playboy Clubs International, Inc. and by agreement with HMH, International was granted an exclusive license, as master licensee, to use the HMH marks, alone or in combination, for the operation of key clubs with standards established and to be established by HMH for quality and conduct to be identified with the key clubs and the HMH marks. International was granted the right to grant sublicenses to others for the purpose of operating such clubs using the marks and subject to the approval of HMH. On February 29, 1960, Chicago Playboy Club, Inc. opened a key club named Playboy Club of Chicago under the licensing agreement described, and on May 6, 1961, a similar licensed club was opened in Florida known as Miami Playboy Club. Subsequently a license was granted to Playboy Club of Louisiana which opened the New Orleans Playboy Club on October 5, 1961. Therefore, in April 1962, when defendants opened their club in Atlanta under the name of \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club,\u201d the Chicago, Miami and New Orleans clubs licensed by plaintiffs were already in operation. Subsequently additional clubs have been licensed and opened in New York City, Phoenix, St. Louis, Detroit, Kansas City, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The gross receipts of International and the clubs have increased spectacularly from 1960 to 1965. International has promoted the clubs through magazine, newspaper and radio advertising, use of public relations firms, etc., and has spent a total of $5,158,088 in promotion expenses during that period. In addition to holding a registered trademark for Playboy Magazine, HMH also holds service marks for \u201cThe Playboy Club\u201d for \u201coperating private social clubs which feature food, drinks and entertainment\u201d registered March 5, 1963; another mark entitled \u201cPlayboy\u201d for \u201coperation of establishments which feature food, drink and entertainment\u201d registered May 12, 1964. It likewise has registered trademarks for \u201cPlayboy\u2019s Playmate of the Month,\u201d featured in the magazine \u201cPlayboy,\u201d registered May 6, 1958 and \u201cPlaymate\u201d for calendars registered September 26, 1961, for perfume registered May 7, 1963, and for bracelets, ankle bracelets, earrings, etc. registered September 29, 1964. There are more than 440,000 members of these clubs residing in all of the states, including Georgia, who held keys-to these clubs for which they have paid $25 to $50 each. The key allows access to any of the clubs in the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Defendant Turner purchased the night club known as \u201cThe Anchorage\u201d in Atlanta in 1958, and operated it through the corporate defendant. In April 1962, the corporate defendant registered the trade names \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d in the Clerk\u2019s Office of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Atlanta), Georgia. At the time Turner knew of the existence of Playboy Magazine and of the Chicago and Miami Playboy Clubs which had been licensed by International. The name of \u201cThe Anchorage\u201d was changed by defendants to \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d and defendants began to advertise the club in Atlanta newspapers with a picture of a girl dressed in a costume closely resembling the famous bunny costume featured by HMH. The advertisement stated \u201cNo membership required.\u201d It was not a key club. One of the rooms in defendants\u2019 establishment at another location was called \u201cThe Playmate Lounge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">We are called upon to decide whether plaintiffs have established that the terms \u201cPlayboy\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d have attained a secondary meaning in connection with their operation of night clubs and restaurants as to justify enjoining defendants\u2019 club from using the trade and service marks, where such use adversely affects plaintiffs\u2019 activities in interstate commerce. Also, we must decide whether under the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1055 and 1127) the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>of the registered marks by plaintiffs\u2019 licensees inures to plaintiffs\u2019 benefit because such licensees are \u201crelated companies\u201d within the meaning of the Act, by virtue of the fact that the nature and quality of their goods or services are controlled by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The district judge, sitting without a jury, rendered his written decision in well-reasoned, detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. He held that Playboy Magazine had for many years enjoyed\" wide circulation throughout the United States (including Atlanta and the State of Georgia); that HMH had extensively advertised its trademark \u201cPlayboy\u201d throughout the United States; had advertised and sold in interstate commerce under its trade and service marks \u201cPlayboy\u201d services and consumer items; and that the wide publicizing of the name \u201cPlayboy\u201d through the magazine and through the sale of these items had caused the trademark to be identified by the general public with HMH and its products. He found that in December 1959, HMH began to solicit membership applications for its Chicago Playboy Club which featured food, drink and entertainment; that a controlled license had been granted to International for the exclusive right to use and sublicense the trade and service marks of HMH to identify clubs operated in Chicago and other principal cities in the United States; that great care had been exercised in the selection of the licensees; and that HMH controlled the nature and quality of the services of the clubs so that the services would be compatible with the nature and quality of the magazine and products of HMH. The district judge held that HMH had taken an active part in promoting the clubs and that the consuming public recognized the clubs and the services of the licensee under the trade and service marks as having been approved and licensed by HMH. He also found that the mark \u201cPlaymate\u201d had been widely publicized by HMH and International. He held that defendant changed the name of \u201cThe Anchorage\u201d to \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d with full knowledge of the existence of the use of the trademark \u201cPlayboy\u201d by HMH, including its use in Playboy Magazine, and with the knowledge of the existence of the Chicago and Miami Playboy Clubs franchised by International. He referred to the newspaper advertisements of defendants with the picture of a girl dressed in a costume closely resembling the bunny costume of HMH. He found that the use of the name \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d was confusingly similar to the names of International\u2019s franchisees, Chicago Playboy Club and Miami Playboy Club; that telephone calls had been received by Turner and correspondence by plaintiffs which showed actual confusion by the public as to an affiliation between defendants\u2019 operation and those franchised by plaintiffs. The district court concluded that the defendants had wilfully adopted and infringed the trade and service marks of HMH with the intention of passing off their business as one licensed, sponsored, approved or connected with HMH or its nationally known magazine \u201cPlayboy\u201d or with the clubs which it had licensed; that the continued use by defendants of the name \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d would damage the rights of HMH in its marks of \u201cPlayboy\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d because the public is likely to continue to be deceived or confused into believing there is some trade connection between plaintiffs and defendants. Accordingly, the defendants were enjoined from the use of the name \u201cAtlanta\u2019s Playboy Club\u201d or the use of the marks \u201cPlayboy\u201d or \u201cPlaymate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We are in agreement with the findings of fact of the district judge which are amply supported by the evidence, and with his conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Defendants contend that the trademark \u201cPl\u00e1yboy\u201d is a weak or descriptive term because it is a common word, and because of wide prior usage by other magazines and clubs; that since plaintiffs do not operate a key club but only license such clubs, they exercise no control over them and have no prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>erty right in the trademark. Under the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq.), registration of a trademark confers only procedural advantages and does not enlarge the registrant\u2019s rights, for ownership of the trademark rests on adoption and use, not on registration. See Faciane v. Starner, 5 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 732. However, the record is replete with evidence of continuous use of the marks <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by plaintiffs who have built a national and international business reputation and have extensively publicized and promoted their trade and service marks at the cost of millions of dollars.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trade and service marks \u201cPlayboy,\u201d \u201cPlayboy Club\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have, through extensive use and promotion of plaintiffs, acquired a secondary meaning of sufficient strength to justify enjoining infringement by defendants. See North American Air. Sys. v. North American Aviation, 9 Cir., 1955, 231 F.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The contentions of the parties as to weakness or strength (through secondary meaning) of the marks involve questions of fact implicit in the trial judge\u2019s finding of confusion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and such findings unless clearly erroneous should not be disturbed. American Foods, Inc. v. Golden Flake, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Defendants argue that there is no evidence of confusion in this case between the use of the trademark \u201cPlayboy\u201d for a magazine, and its use by defendant for a night club; that the goods and services of each are noncompeting and, therefore, that the registered trademark is not entitled to protection. We held,. however, in Chemical Corp. of America v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 433, 2 A.L.R.3d 739, that \u201cthe concept of competition with respect to the particular product need not exist to warrant actions of this kind.\u201d The argument of defendants ignores the fact that plaintiff HMH, publisher of Playboy Magazine, also holds registered service marks: \u201cThe Playboy Club\u201d for \u201coperating private social clubs which feature food, drinks and entertainment,\u201d and \u201cPlayboy\u201d for \u201coperation of establishments which feature food, drink and entertainment.\u201d We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the fact that one mark deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>with a magazine and the other with a night club is immaterial since the two are intermeshed in the public mind. To the public Playboy Magazine and the several Playboy Clubs are a single business enterprise. See Esquire, Inc. v. Esquire Slipper Manufacturing Co., 1 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Defendants also contend that HMH\u2019s registry of the mark \u201cPlayboy\u201d in connection with the operation of a night club or restaurant is void because HMH does not operate night clubs but relies for the validity of its marks on the operations of such clubs by third-party sublicensees. We look to the statute for the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Section 5 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cWhere a registered mark or a mark sought to be registered is or may be used legitimately by related companies, such use shall inure to the benefit of the registrant or applicant for registration, and such use shall not affect the validity of such mark or of its registration, provided such mark is not used in such manner as to deceive the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The term \u201crelated company\u201d referred to in Section 5 is defined in Section 45 of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018related company\u2019 means any person who legitimately controls or is controlled by the registrant or applicant for registration in respect to the nature and quality of the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Relying on the preceding sections of the Lanham Act, plaintiffs have introduced ample evidence to show that HMH fully controlled and dictated the nature and quality of the goods and services used in connection with the trade and service marks by the several licensees. When a license is granted to a franchisee, it is required to meet standards established by International which in turn are dictated by HMH. These standards relate to decor, design, quantity and quality of food, beverages and entertainment in the clubs. Each club must conform to the standards already established for existing clubs and the agreements with franchisees are made expressly subject to the terms of International\u2019s license with HMH. International hires and supervises personnel of all the clubs and the right of supervision is a continuing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">The clubs are policed by executives of HMH and by two independent services who regularly and periodically visit the clubs and report on the maintenance of standards for food, beverages, services and decor. At HMH\u2019s direction International has prepared an operating manual for use in the clubs so each is run in exactly the same manner. All billing of club members for credit charges at the clubs is made from Chicago. HMH\u2019s service marks are, therefore, extensively used in commerce. The trial judge found \u2014and we agree \u2014 that the nature and quality of the services rendered at the key clubs under the trade and service marks were controlled by plaintiff HMH.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">In our view, Section 5 of the Lanham Act definitely contemplates that a trade or service mark may be acquired through its use by controlled licensees, even though the registrant itself may not have used the mark. See Alligator Company v. Robert Bruce, Inc., E.D.Pa., 1959, 176 F.Supp. 377.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment of the district court was correct, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-5\">. The evidence is impressive that the use was in commerce as defined by Section 45 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127), despite defendants\u2019 contrary argument. For example, at the date of the trial (October 20, 1965), there were 440,000 key holders in all the states, and 13,329 keys had been sold to Georgia residents (as of August 5, 1965). Billing for credit charges at all clubs was from the Chicago headquarters, across state lines. Supervision and control of nature and quality of goods and services were by persons sent from the Chicago office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. Defendants submitted a number of exhibits of copies of third-party registrations of trademarks of the name \u201cPlayboy\u201d in aid of their argument that the mark \u201cPlayboy\u201d was weak and diluted by wide usage by the public. However, defendants do not contend that their use of the term was prior to that of plaintiffs. We will not assume any knowledge on the part of the purchasing public by mere registrations in the Patent Office, nor will we assume that the marks are in continuing use, so as to have any effect on the mind of the purchasing public merely because they had been so registered. See J. C. Hall Company v. Hallmark Cards, Incorporated, C.C.P.A., 1965, 340 F.2d 960; Application of Helene Curtis Industries, Inc., 1962, 305 F.2d 492, 49 CCPA 1367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. Admittedly, Turner began use of both terms \u201cPlayboy\u201d and \u201cPlaymate\u201d at the same time. However, plaintiffs withdrew their supplemental pleading which related to the term \u201cPlaymate\u201d only, in order to avoid a continuance of the case. Defendants say, therefore, that the term \u201cPlaymate\u201d was not before the court and its order in this regard is erroneous. This contention disregards the fact that the pleadings which remained and which were originally filed were broad enough to include the term \u201cPlaymate,\u201d and the trial judge so ruled and received evidence as to that term also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">. The Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (a)) provides that a person shall be liable in a civil action who shall, in commerce, use without consent of the registrant any registered mark \u201cwhich such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source or origin of such goods or services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\">. Plaintiffs also point out that the record shows that HMH now owns a controlling stock interest in International and that International now owns all of the stock in the Chicago Club and the other clubs except Boston (where it owns 50%), Baltimore (5%), and St. Louis and Detroit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b277-18\">. Plaintiffs cite In re Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Co., 129 U.S.P.Q. 329 (1961) in accord with this view of the law; defendants cite In re C. B. Donald Co., 122 U.S.P.Q. 401 (1959) contra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
