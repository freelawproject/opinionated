See, e. g., Unicon Management Corp. v. Koppers Co., Inc., 366 F.2d 199 (2 Cir. 1966); W. E. Bassett Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 354 F.2d 868 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Plaintiff, Judge McLean found, was incorporated in January 1964, changed its name to Gold Master Corp. in February 1964 after a trademark search which indicated no prior use of the name, registered the trademarks \u201cGold Master,\u201d \u201cGMC,\u201d and \u201cGMC\u201d in a stylized design in New York in June and July 1964, obtained United States registration of the marks \u201cGMC\u201d and \u201cGMC\u201d in design in March 1965, and applied for United States registration of \u201cGold Master\u201d in October 1965. Beginning in 1964, plaintiff stamped its rings \u201cGMC\u201d or \u201cGold Master,\u201d advertised nationally in trade journals and by mail, and listed its name in the trade directory. Plaintiff also set up a booth at the retail jewelers\u2019 convention in New York in August 1964, and distributed fifteen thousand brass-plated keys imprinted \u201cGold Master,\u201d which could be filed to fit automobile ignitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Judge McLean found, on the basis of invoices produced by appellant, that Millers International began to sell gold rings with a dark \u201cantique\u201d finish under the name \u201cGold Master Originals\u201d on the Pacific coast in 1960, and sold them in small quantities to customers as far east as Michigan and Ohio in 1965 and 1966. There is no partnership or other entity called \u201cGold Master Originals,\u201d the name is not listed in the trade directory, and Millers International sought United States registration of the mark \u201cGold Master Originals\u201d only after this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">Plaintiff learned of Millers International\u2019s use of the name \u201cGold Master Originals\u201d in September 1965, and by letter from its attorney in December 1965 it demanded that it cease. Appellant, representing \u201cGold Master Originals,\u201d attended the retail jewelers\u2019 convention in New York for the first time in August 1966, having sent to jewelers a key bearing a tag reading, \u201cAll keyed up for profits and prizes? Meet Miss Gold Master in New York or Dallas.\u201d The summons in this diversity action, seeking damages and an injunction, was served upon appellant at the convention. Numerous jewelers at the convention brought to the plaintiff the keys sent out by Millers International, and packages intended for appellant were delivered to plaintiff\u2019s booth. On three other occasions, purchasers of \u201cGold Master Originals\u201d rings have sent them to plaintiff for repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">The first basis for Judge McLean\u2019s order granting the prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>nary injunction was plaintiff\u2019s registration of the mark \u201cGold Master\u201d in New York. We affirm the order upon this ground. Appellant argues first that this registration is subject to cancellation if no goods bearing the mark were \u201csold or otherwise distributed\u201d by plaintiff in New York before the mark was registered, see N. Y. General Business Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 20, \u00a7\u00a7 360 (e), 362(c), 367(4) (c), and that there is no affirmative evidence of such sale or distribution in the record. But the issue of cancellation should be raised by counterclaim, see Herbert Prods., Inc. v. Oxy-Dry Sprayer Corp., 1 Misc.2d 71, 145 N.Y.S.2d 168 (Sup.Ct.1955), and was not raised below. More important, the record shows that plaintiff\u2019s place of business is in New York, so that the chance that it did not sell any rings there is so negligible that we need not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that the New York trademark statute expressly saves Millers International\u2019s common law rights, N. Y. General Business Law \u00a7 368-e, among which is the right reasonably to expand the area of its prior use of the name \u201cGold Master Originals.\u201d See generally, e. g., 3 Callman, Unfair Competition and TradeMarks \u00a7 76.3(b) (2) (2 ed. 1950); Developments in the Law \u2014 Trade-Marks and Unfair Competition, 68 Harv.L.Rev. 814, 857-59 (1955). But this right must yield to the plaintiff\u2019s in areas where plaintiff first used the name \u201cGold Master\u201d in ignorance of its prior use by Millers International in a distant area. E. g., Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 415-418, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1910); Cohn-Goldwater Mfg. Co. v. Wilk Shirt Corp., 147 F.2d 767 (2 Cir. 1945). Plaintiff\u2019s adoption of the name \u201cGold Master\u201d was, on this record, clearly innocent, and from the record before us it seems more than likely that it will be able to establish prior use in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Finally, appellant suggests that there was no evidence that anyone purchased rings from Millers International believing he was purchasing from plaintiff. However, there was evidence of confusion on the part of jewelers attending the 1966 convention and purchasers seeking to have their rings repaired. Moreover, where confusion is as likely as it is between the marks \u201cGold Master\u201d and \u201cGold Master Originals,\u201d evidence of actual mistaken purchases is not a prerequisite to relief. E. g., Collyrium, Inc. v. John Wyeth &amp; Bro., Inc., 167 Misc. 231, 3 N.Y.S.2d 42 (Sup.Ct.1938); cf., e. g., American Chicle Co. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 208 F.2d 560 (2 Cir. 1953); G. H. Mumm Champagne v. Eastern Wine Corp., 142 F.2d 499 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 715, 65 S.Ct. 41, 89 L.Ed. 575 (1944). We therefore uphold Judge McLean\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff has established a probable infringement of the mark \u201cGold Master.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">As we affirm the preliminary injunction on the basis of plaintiff\u2019s New York registration of its marks, we do not reach the alternate ground upon which Judge McLean granted the injunction, the inference that the keys publicizing \u201cMiss Gold Master\u201d sent out by Millers International before the 1966 convention indicated a deliberate attempt to capitalize on plaintiff\u2019s good will, or the alternate grounds which plaintiff urges, based on the Lanham Act\u2019s pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>scription of \u201ca false designation of origin\u201d on goods entering commerce, 60 Stat. 441 (1946), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, and the Gold Stamping Act, 34 Stat. 260 (1906), as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 294-300. Plaintiff also contends that the limitation of the injunction to appellant, based upon the district court\u2019s doubt that service upon appellant conferred jurisdiction over the Oregon partnership, was error; but, as plaintiff took no cross-appeal, we cannot consider this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">We add that the trial of this action on the merits should be expedited upon application of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\">. As we uphold Judge McLean\u2019s finding of a likelihood of confusion between plaintiff\u2019s mark and appellant\u2019s, we need not consider the extent to which N.Y. General Business Law, \u00a7 368-d, which provides that \u201c[l]ikelihood * * * of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark * * * shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of infringement of a mark * * * notwithstanding * * * the absence of confusion as to the source of goods,\u201d would justify an injunction absent a showing of confusion. Compare, e. g., United Merchants &amp; Mfrs., Inc. v. Amtex Fabrics, Inc., 29 Misc.2d 86, 212 N.Y.S.2d 498 (Sup.Ct. 1961), with, e. g., Cue Publishing Co., Inc. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 45 Misc.2d 161, 167-168, 256 N.Y.S.2d 239, 245-246 (Sup.Ct.), aff\u2019d per curiam, 23 A.D.2d 829, 259 N.Y.S.2d 377 (1 Dep\u2019t 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
