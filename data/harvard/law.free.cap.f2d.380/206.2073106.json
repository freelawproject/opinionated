He was sentenced to 7% years on each count to be served concurrently. On appeal, he claims that the government failed to establish probable cause for his arrest without a warrant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>obtained in a search incident to his arrest ought therefore to have been suppressed at the pretrial hearing. Judge Frankel, following the government\u2019s refusal to comply with an order to disclose the identity of certain informers, nevertheless found that there was probable cause for arrest. D.C., 248 F.Supp. 911 (1965). Appellant further contends that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury. We find that the evidence produced both on the motion to suppress and at trial was sufficient to establish probable cause for arrest and to justify a verdict of guilty, and we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The arrest was made on the following information. During January 1964, federal narcotics agents Herman Scott and Walter Smith were conducting a surveillance in New York City of one David Wiggens, a suspected seller of narcotics.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the evening of January 16, the agents saw Wiggens approach appellant, the two men converse, and appellant hand Wig-gens some currency. That evening, appellant was observed driving a blue 1963 Cadillac convertible with Maryland license plates, entering the apartment building in which Wiggens lived, and thereafter leaving with him. Twenty minutes later, Wiggens sold Agent Scott some narcotics. Upon inquiring at the Baltimore office of the Bureau of Narcotics, Scott learned that the Cadillac convertible was registered to appellant, who was under investigation in Baltimore by both state and federal authorities for transporting narcotics between New York and Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">During July 1964, Smith received a second report, this one from the Bureau\u2019s New Orleans office, to the effect that a warrant to search appellant\u2019s automobile was issued while he was in New Orleans, and although the search disclosed nothing, he was subsequently found with a small quantity of marijuana on his person. Thereafter, in September and October 1964, Scott was given information about appellant\u2019s pattern of operations by four informants, all of whom, according to Agent Smith, had previously given information that had proved reliable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the informants, appellant customarily drove to New York City with an associate in a new Cadillac convertible or Thunderbird with Maryland license plates, to purchase drugs. He would usually stay in a drive-in motel at 75 Macombs Place in Manhattan; registering under the name of Edward Perkins or Edward Johnson. Appellant would then canvass a number of sources of narcotics and purchase a supply of drugs to be adulterated and packaged in Baltimore for sale there, in Washington, D. C., and in New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">On the evening of October 20, agents Scott and Dennis Raugh learned from an informer that appellant, accompanied by one \u201cBippety Bop,\u201d had arrived in town to purchase a large quantity of heroin and that the two were traveling in appellant\u2019s green 1964 Cadillac convertible. Upon checking with the Bureau of Narcotics files, the agents learned that \u201cBip-pety Bop\u201d was an alias used by one Raymond Worrell, a suspected Baltimore narcotics trafficker. At about 9:00 P.M. agents Smith, Scott and Raugh drove to a point opposite the Macombs Place motel. Within a short time they spotted appellant driving into the motel parking lot. Appellant got out, Worrell moved into the driver\u2019s seat and appellant handed him some money. As Worrell started to leave appellant recalled him and, according to Agent Scott, who by now had crossed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Street and was standing nearby in the shelter of the motel entrance, appellant said words to the effect of \u201cSee if you can get a sample and make a meet for me as soon as possible.\u201d Agent Smith, continuing the surveillance from across the street, saw Tucker enter Room 211 on the upstairs balcony. Agent Scott then called the motel and learned that \u201cEdward Perkins\u201d had registered in Room 211. Within half an hour Worrell returned with the car, parked it in the motel lot, and went into Room 211. Fifteen minutes later, appellant came out alone and drove off to a nearby bowling alley on 146th Street, where, following a twenty minute wait, he met with one Thomas J. Carswell (Coswell?). Agent Scott, who had followed appellant into the bowling alley, overheard him admonish Carswell for keeping him waiting \u201con business like this.\u201d Tucker and Cars-well then left the alley together, and drove to the motel where they joined Worrell in Room 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Within twenty minutes Worrell came downstairs and sat in the car, followed a few minutes later by Carswell, and the two drove off in appellant\u2019s green Cadillac, trailed by the agents. They drove first to a bar and grill, then to a restaurant, and lastly to a building at 69 East 123rd Street. Each time Worrell waited in the ear while Carswell ran inside. Carswell and Worrell then parted company, and Worrell returned to the motel parking lot alone, where the agents moved in and arrested him. A search of appellant\u2019s automobile disclosed 12.38 grams of heroin, mannite, gelatin capsules, glassine envelopes, an eyedropper and a hypodermic needle. The agents then went to Room 211 where they arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Appellant does not claim that all of the above information would not constitute probable cause. Rather, he contends that the agents were not entitled to rely on the informers\u2019 reports to aid in showing probable cause without disclosing their identities and that, without the information furnished by the informers, probable cause was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Even if we were required to decide the issue as it has been framed by the appellant, there is much to suggest that probable cause for arrest had been established solely on the basis of the agents\u2019 personal observations and the reports received from other Bureau of Narcotics offices in Baltimore and New Orleans. Compare, e. g., Scher v. United States, 305 U.S. 251, 59 S.Ct. 174, 83 L.Ed. 151 (1938); United States v. Santiago, 327 F.2d 573 (2 Cir. 1964). Nine months prior to arrest, agents Smith and Scott had observed a transaction between appellant and David Wiggens, who was then an active seller. During the three and one-half hour surveillance prior to arrest, agents Smith, Scott and Raugh observed the passing of money by the appellant to \u201cBippety Bop\u201d Worrell and they overheard conversation about a sample and making a \u201cmeet,\u201d appellant\u2019s meeting and conversation with Carswell, and the midnight travels of Worrell and Carswell, all of which, coupled with the use of an assumed name at the motel, gave good cause to believe that a narcotics transaction was under way. For purposes of appeal, however, we think it is enough that we agree with Judge Frankel that the agents\u2019 direct observations and the information received from official files-\u201cwent most if not all of the way toward justifying the arrests\u201d. 248 F.Supp. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The issue before us then is whether, in light of the decisions of the Supreme Court and this court and of the policies which underlie the \u201cinformer\u2019s privilege,\u201d <em>some </em>use can be made of the information received from the four informants in order to establish probable cause, without disclosing their identities and without setting forth \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d to support the reliability of the informers or the basis of their information to the extent suggested by Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1963), see, e. g., United States ex rel. Rogers v. Warden, 381 F.2d 209 (2 Cir., June 15, 1967), where a portion of the information received has been corrob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>orated by the agents\u2019 own surveillance. It is our view that since the information received from undisclosed sources was not \u201cthe essence or core or main bulk of the case for probable cause\u201d, 248 F.Supp. at 915, and since the informants\u2019 description of the appellant\u2019s <em>modus operandi </em>was corroborated in sufficient detail to lend an aura of credence to the remainder of the information and to entitle it to consideration apart from a showing of reliability as to the individual informers, it was unnecessary to require disclosure of their identities. Cf. Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960); United States v. Elgisser, 334 F.2d 103 (2 Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Gladstein v. United States, 379 U.S. 879, 85 S.Ct. 148, 13 L.Ed.2d 86 (1964); Buford v. United States, 308 F.2d 804 (5 Cir. 1962); United States v. Irby, 304 F.2d 280 (4 Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 830, 83 S.Ct. 39, 9 L.Ed.2d 67 (1962); United States v. Woodson, 303 F.2d 49 (6 Cir. 1962); United States v. Williams, 219 F.Supp. 666 (S.D.N.Y. 1963), aff\u2019d, 336 F.2d 183 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 857, 85 S.Ct. 112, 13 L.Ed.2d 60 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"> There is no absolute constitutional right to disclosure of the identity of an informer at every hearing on a motion to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e. g., McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). The Supreme Court in the exercise of its power to formulate evidentiary rules for federal criminal cases, has continued to recognize the importance of the \u201cinformer\u2019s privilege.\u201d See, e. g., United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1964), cf. Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 210, 87 S.Ct. 424, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Appellant\u2019s position on appeal is that the Supreme Court dictum in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 61, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), to the effect that disclosure had been held necessary in probable cause cases \u201cunless there was sufficient evidence apart from [the informer\u2019s] confidential communication\u201d was adopted as the law of this circuit by United States v. Robinson, 325 F.2d 391, 393 (2 Cir. 1963), see United States ex rel. Coffey v. Fay, 344 F.2d 625, 633 (2 Cir. 1965), and the word <em>apart, </em>as it was used, requires us to find probable cause on evidence <em>wholly independent </em>of any confidential communication received. This interpretation, as pointed out in Judge Frankel\u2019s opinion below, 248 F.Supp. at 915-916, is necessarily rejected by other language in <em>Roviaro </em>and our decisions that have followed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\"><em>Roviaro </em>cautioned that \u201cno fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable,\u201d and that the problem presented by the claim of informer privilege \u201cis one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information\u201d against the interest of the individual that would be served by disclosure. 353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628. If, as appellant suggests, disclosure were required \u201cwhenever an informer\u2019s report plays some role in the proof of probable cause * * *, there would never be anything to weigh in these cases,\u201d and \u201cthe perplexities [that] the courts have faced would have been imaginary all along.\u201d 248 F.Supp. at 915-916. It would seem therefore that if <em>any </em>rule requiring disclosure might be extracted from the language of <em>Roviaro, </em>it would be that disclosure would be required only where independent evidence was so insubstantial that in essence \u201cthe existence depends solely upon the reliability of an informer * * United States v. Elgisser, supra 334 F.2d at 110; see United States ex rel. Coffey v. Fay, supra 344 F.2d at 633-634; also People v. Ma-linsky, 15 N.Y.2d 86, 93-94, 262 N.Y.S.2d 65, 72-73, 209 N.E.2d 694, 699-700 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(1965). See, however, McCray v. Illinois, supra at 311-312 n. 11.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Viewing other language found in Second Circuit cases, that disclosure is compulsory whenever the informants' communications are \u201cessential to the establishment of probable cause * * United States v. Elgisser, supra 334 F.2d at 110, see United States v. Santiago, supra 327 F.2d at 575; United States v. Rosario, 327 F.2d 561, 564 (2 Cir. 1964); United States v. Robinson, supra 325 F.2d at 393-394, in the light of the foregoing it is difficult to read \u201cessential\u201d as synonymous with <em>any quantum; </em>rather, \u201cessential\u201d must be read to mean \u201cthe essence or core or main bulk\u201d of the evidence brought forth which would otherwise establish probable cause. The <em>Robinson </em>case, cited and relied upon so heavily by appellant, cannot be said to stand for any proposition to the contrary, for in that case the showing of probable cause for the arrest was based almost entirely upon informant information, as \u201cthe arresting officers knew nothing more than what the informant had told them\u201d. United States v. Elgisser, supra 334 F.2d at 111 (Lumbard, C. J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Inasmuch as we conclude that we are not bound by any rule requiring disclosure of the informants\u2019 identities, we then reach the question whether nondisclosure was justified in light of the particular circumstances of this case. Although appellant did not set forth any particular reasons as to why the disclosure of the informants\u2019 identities would prove useful, it is generally recognized that by demanding disclosure, a defendant avails himself of the opportunity to test the existence of the informer and whether the agents ought to have regarded the information they obtained as reliable, and, of course, whether the agent might have misrepresented the information given him by the informant. In cases such as this where probable cause for arrest is at issue, rather than the guilt or innocence of the defendant, it matters little whether the informants were truthful in fact, it matters only that in the judge\u2019s view, the agents acted reasonably on the basis of all the facts at hand. See Beck v. State of Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964). In view of the corroborative nature of events which the agents themselves observed on the night of arrest, we think it was proper for the agents to give some weight, sufficient for the present inquiry, to the information yielded by the four informers. This assumes, of course, that the agents\u2019 sworn statements, both as to the existence of the informants and the substance of the information received, were truthful, a factor for which there is no guarantee short of disclosure and production of the four informants for purposes of cross-examination. But, even in viewing the credibility of the agents we are mindful that outright perjury by federal agents is not a common occurrence, see, e. g., U. S. ex rel. Coffey v. Fay, supra 344 F.2d at 634, and there was still much evidence before the judge on the motion to determine their credibility, and if he doubted it he could have required the informants to be identified or even produced. Here, both agents Scott<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Smith took the stand, and Judge Frankel found that the \u201cpossibility\u201d that their report might have been falsified \u201cremained almost entirely incredible after the agents had been cross-examined.\u201d 248 F.Supp. at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Against the defendant\u2019s interest in the disclosure by the government of the identity of the informants, in order that he may explore the justification for the arrest, there is the strong public interest in encouraging the free flow of information to law enforcement officers. An informant may volunteer information to government agents for a variety of reasons, see e. g., Harney &amp; Cross, The Informer in Law Enforcement 33-39 (1960); Gutterman, The Informer Privilege, 58 J.Crim.L. 32, 33-34 (1967), but it has been the experience of law enforcement officers that the prospective informer will usually condition his cooperation on an assurance of anonymity, fearing that if disclosure is made, physical harm or other undesirable consequences may be visited upon him or his family. By withholding the identity of the informer, the government profits in that the continued value of informants placed in strategic positions is protected, and other persons are encouraged to cooperate in the administration of justice. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2374 (McNaughton rev. 1961); Gutterman, supra at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Communications from informers have proved vital to the detection of criminal activity, see, e. g., the Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, A Report by the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice 218 (1967); Vollmer, The Police in Modern Society (1936), and the importance of \u201cinformer\u2019s privilege\u201d in keeping open channels of information is seldom more evident than in cases involving narcotics offenses, because detection through other means proves so difficult. Small quantities of narcotics, worth large sums of money, can be easily concealed and moved about, and as in the enforcement of vice and liquor laws, there is seldom an aggrieved victim when narcotics laws are violated, who might render information voluntarily. E. g., 1956 Report of the Subcommittee on Narcotics of the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, 1956 U.S.Code &amp; Ad.News, p. 3302; Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.10, comment, p. 16 (Tent.Draft No. 9, 1959). The fear that harm may result from disclosure seems all the more real when it is recognized that the narcotics traffic is usually carried on by large organized rings who are ruthless in the protection of their interests and who deal mercilessly with those who disclose their activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In the present case the government made clear its position that it thought it to be in its best interest not to dispose the identity of any of the four informers who had given information, running the risk that the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress would be granted. Judge Frankel carefully considered the evidence presented and found that there was probable cause for arrest. He was further of the view that \u201cthe likelihood that defendants would have used the informants * * *, and that the strong showing of probable cause could then have been dissipated, is thin almost to the point of nonexistence.\u201d 248 F.Supp. at 917. We agree that the disclosure was unnecessary and that the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">As the result of certain intimations that might be drawn from Judge Frankel\u2019s thorough and considered opinion, 248 F.Supp. at 912 n. 2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we think it necessary to make one further comment regarding the inquiry as to establishing probable cause at a pretrial hearing. There is, of course, no inherent reason why the government should, be required to elect not to disclose the identity of its informers, and then be required to stand on that election prior to a ruling by the court on whether or not probable cause has already been estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>lished on the evidence presented. The government ought to be permitted considerable latitude as long as the defendant is not then in jeopardy, and vague notions of unfairness, that the government should not have \u201ctwo bites\u201d off the same apple, ought not control. We think no injustice would result if, in hearings such as this, the court were first to rule on the motion to suppress when the request for disclosure is made and after all the evidence is presented, and if the court\u2019s ruling is unfavorable to the government, to allow the government to reconsider its decision not to disclose. Compare United States v. Robinson, supra (reversed and remanded for rehearing on reliability of undisclosed informer. See United States v. Robinson, 354 F.2d 109 (2 Cir. 1965)). It would seem that a decision to follow such a procedure would often be warranted, and that it could be made in each instance simply on the basis of such considerations as its effect on court economy, the avoidance of unnecessary delay in the pre-trial stage, and the acknowledged importance of the \u201cinformer\u2019s privilege\u201d to the government. In cases such as this the government must weigh the consequences of disclosure of the informant in the light of the probability that thereby other current investigations involving the same informant may be frustrated and that the informant himself might become unavailable for future investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Appellant\u2019s further claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction is without merit. To give rise to the permissible inference under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, that the heroin was illegally imported and that the defendant knew it to be, it need only be shown that he had constructive possession of it. See, e. g., United States v. Ramsey, 374 F.2d 192, 195 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Lopez, 355 F.2d 250 (2 Cir. 1966); United States v. Jones, 308 F.2d 26, 31-33 (2 Cir. 1962). There was sufficient evidence submitted to the jury from which it could find that the appellant had \u201cthe requisite domination and control [over the narcotics] to justify a finding of constructive possession,\u201d United States v. Lopez, supra, 355 F.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">As between \u201cBippety Bop\u201d Worrell and appellant Tucker, there was much undisputed evidence to suggest a conspiracy and that of the two it was Tucker who was in charge of the narcotics transaction. It was Tucker who, after giving Worrell a sum of money, sent him out to get a \u201csample\u201d and make a \u201cmeet.\u201d When Worrell returned, Tucker left to rendezvous with Carswell \u201con business.\u201d The actual pickup was made by Worrell with Carswell\u2019s aid. The 1964 Cadillac used throughout the evening was registered in Tucker\u2019s name, and it was Tucker who in an assumed name had taken Room 211, the room in which the gatherings took place. At the time of arrest, Tucker had $2615.60 in cash on his person, with which the jury might infer that the transaction was to be consummated; Worrell had only seventeen dollars. In view of such evidence it was proper to submit the case to the jury on both the substantive and conspiracy counts. There was ample evidence to support the conviction, which is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\">. No argument is made that the agents ought to have obtained a warrant prior to the search and arrest. The Narcotics Control Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 570 (1956), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607, specifically gives narcotics agents the power to arrest without warrant \u201cwhere they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a violation of the narcotics laws.\u201d United States v. Santiago, 327 F.2d 573, 575 (2 Cir. 1964); see Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 478, n. 6, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). Here, it would have been highly impracticable to pause to obtain a warrant. The agents were required to move quickly to arrest both parties and obtain the narcotics which could have been easily removed or secreted. Moreover, even if a warrant could practically have been obtained, the search would not have been improper. E. g., United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 65-66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950) ; United States v. McMillan, 368 F.2d 810, 812 (2 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>386 U.S. 909, 87 S.Ct. 856, 17 L.Ed.2d 783 (Feb. 13, 1967) : United States v.
