We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-20\">This libel was for condemnation of certain cotton seed under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was alleged that about March 8, 1966, there were shipped from Marietta, Georgia to Hurtsboro, Alabama, 35 or more bags of cotton seed, Lot #761, that attached to these bags were labels showing the number of noxious weed seed per pound to be \u201cNONE\u201d, but nevertheless the bags contained the seeds of the despised cocklebur at the rate of twenty per pound, therefore the cotton seed were shipped into Alabama unlawfully, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1571(a) (5) and 1571(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-21\">Appellant claimed the cotton seed. After much procedural maneuvering on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the part of an officer of Coweta, a layman, who has handled Coweta\u2019s case, the Court below granted the motion of the United States for summary judgment. Coweta appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In its answer to the libel, Coweta alleged, \u201cNo test has been made on these seed in accordance with the Federal Seed Act to the best of our knowledge\u201d. By interrogatories, Coweta challenged the United States to disclose the procedure used in sampling the cotton seed. To this, the United States answered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cThe manner or procedure in which the sampling of the 35 bags of Lot 761 is not known by the Unit\u00e9d States, since it was done by the Alabama Seed authorities. However, the usual method for sampling seed by the Alabama State authorities is to use a seed probe * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">This is the only averment in the record as to the method of sampling actually used.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Coweta continued to press its claim that the seed had not been validly sampled. The Court below recognized Cow-eta\u2019s contention. Nevertheless he \u201cfound\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the method of sampling here employed was that ordinarily used for such purposes, describing the method.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Seven U.S.C. \u00a7 1593(a) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cThe samplings, analyses, tests, or examinations of seeds made in connection with the administration of this chapter shall be made by methods set forth by rules and regulations prescribed under section 1592 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Section 201.39 of the Secretary\u2019s regulations in great detail sets forth the method to be used. The basic rule is that \u201cIn order to secure a representative sample, equal portions shall be taken from evenly distributed parts of the quantity of seed * * * to be sampled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">We conclude that there was a material issue of fact as to whether the seed had been validly sampled. The issue was material because although some cockleburs may have been present in whatever seed sample was taken, if the sample was not representative, the test would be useless for Seed Act purposes. It was the government\u2019s burden to show that <em>by a valid sampling </em>the claimant\u2019s seed failed to pass muster under the Seed Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Appellant also challenged the constitutionality of the Alabama law which allows 4 cocklebur per pound for seed shipped <em>within </em>Alabama and allows NONE for seed shipped from Georgia. This raises a serious question that the Alabama statute may be unconstitutional on its face. In view of what we have already said we do not decide that question at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">The Judgment of the District Court will be vacated and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\">. \u00a7 1595.
