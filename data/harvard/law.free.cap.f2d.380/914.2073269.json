Appellant had been convicted of a Dyer Act offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal to this court. Weed v. United States, 10 Cir., 340 F.2d 827. Appellant\u2019s motion was premised upon the affidavit of one Ballard, a co-defendant, to the effect that he, Ballard, had falsely testified as a prosecution witness at appellant\u2019s trial. The trial court, in full recognition of the importance of Ballard\u2019s original testimony as a contributing factor to appellant\u2019s conviction and the requirements to serve \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d under Rule 33, Ledet v. United States, 5 Cir., 297 F.2d 737, conducted a full evidentiary hearing. Ballard, presently serving a California state sentence for armed robbery, appeared and testified pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-20\"> Our appellate review is limited to a consideration of whether the trial court plainly abused his discretion in determining that Ballard\u2019s testimony at trial was credible and that his recantation was not. Casias v. United States, 10 Cir., 350 F.2d 317. We find nothing in the record that would indicate in any way such an abuse of discretion. The judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b962-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
