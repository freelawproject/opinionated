We are of the firm opinion that it did not and that his defense of entrapment was submitted to the jury under clear instructions patterned after the criteria articulated in Kivette v. United States, 230 F.2d 749 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-21\">Patently frivolous is appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge abused his discretion in limiting the cross examination of an agent of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division whose testimony constituted the bulk of the government\u2019s case. No conceivable legitimate purpose could have been served by permitting the absurd questioning in which his attorney persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-22\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
