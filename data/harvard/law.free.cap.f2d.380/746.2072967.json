Irving Hill, United States District Judge, Central District of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b795-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">Appellant was charged with and convicted of the possession and concealment of a narcotic (heroin chloride) which had been illegally imported into the United States, with knowledge that it had been so imported. She was arrested pursuant to a warrant, and there followed a lawful search. There are but two questions raised: (1) Is the statutory presumption, stated in the second paragraph of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, that the heroin found in appellant\u2019s possession was illegally imported, constitutional; and (2) if it is constitutional, was her statement that she \u201cthought it was made in Portland\u201d (R.T. 51) sufficient to overcome the presumption?</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">The presumption has long been held valid by this and other courts. Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904 (1925), Morales v. United States, 344 F.2d 846, 851 (9th Cir. 1965), Ramirez v. United States, 350 F.2d 306, 308 (9th Cir. 1965), Juvera v. United States (9th Cir.), 378 F.2d 433, decided May 9, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">Appellant\u2019s testimony quoted above was found by the trial court to be \u201cunimpressive.\u201d We agree. When asked to explain how she obtained the heroin, she refused to explain, relying on the Fifth Amendment. The presumption may be, but is not necessarily, overcome by appellant\u2019s mere statement as to her conjecture. Chavez v. United States, 343 F.2d 85, 89-90 (9th Cir. 1965), United States v. Norton, 310 F.2d 718, 719 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">Appellant relies heavily on Erwing v. United States, 323 F.2d 674 (9th Cir. 1963). But the facts differ completely. In <em>Erwing </em>a different narcotic was involved, \u201ccocaine hydrochloride.\u201d In <em>Erwing </em>there was uncontradicted expert testimony that \u201call cocaine hydrochloride <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>was manufactured in the United States.\u201d \u201cUnder the evidence\u201d there produced there was held to be \u201cno rational connection between the unexplained possession of cocaine hydrochloride and the presumed fact of illegal importation.\u201d <em>Erwing, </em>supra, has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
