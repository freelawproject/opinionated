We characterize the books as obsessed with sex. If they have any literary merit, it is obscure. At best, they are junk.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">But under First Amendment decisions that have piled up there does not seem to have been the leer accompanying them required by Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 969, 16 L.Ed.2d 31, to uphold the convictions. The books in this case are obviously about the same as dealt with in Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S.Ct. 1414, 18 L.Ed.2d 515; Keney v. New York, 388 U.S. 440, 87 S.Ct. 2091, 18 L.Ed.2d 1302; Friedman v. New York, 388 U.S. 1303, 87 S.Ct. 2091, 18 L.Ed.2d 1303; Ratner v.

The indictment will be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ALuO\"><em> </em>Some indication of the proscriptions left may be in the following extract from <em>Red-rup, </em>supra, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">\u201cIn none of the cases was there a claim that the statute in question reflected a specific and limited state concern for juveniles. See Prince v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645; cf. Butler v. State of Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 77 S.Ct. 524, 1 L.Ed.2d 412. In none was there any suggestion of an assault upon individual privacy by publication in a manner so obtrusive as to make it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid exposure to it. Cf. Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233, 35 A.L.R.2d 335; Public Utilities Comm\u2019n of District of Columbia v. Poliak, 343 U.S. 451, 72 S.Ct. 813, 96 L.Ed. 1068. And in none was there evidence of the sort of \u2018pandering\u2019 which the Court found significant in Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
