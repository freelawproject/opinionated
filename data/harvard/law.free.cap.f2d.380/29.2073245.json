In 1965, after entering a plea of nolo con-tendere, he was convicted of possession of marijuana in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Immigration Service then commenced proceedings to get petitioner deported under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (11), which provides for deportation when an alien is convicted of violating any marijuana law. In due course the special inquiry officer ordered petitioner deported, which order was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-26\"> Petitioner claims that a judgment of guilty in state court after a plea of nolo contendere does not constitute a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (11). He argues that such a judgment can\u2019t be used against him in a subsequent unrelated civil proceeding. While it may be true, as petitioner maintains, that a guilty judgment following a nolo contendere plea can not be used as an admission in a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>action, it has been held that the conviction may be noticed for purposes of deportation where the fact of the conviction is itself the only thing that is relevant, United States ex rel. Bruno v. Reimer, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 92, 93; Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 9 Cir., 247 F.2d 929, cert. denied 355 U.S. 892, 78 S.Ct. 265, 2 L.Ed.2d 190. As we adhere to these cases, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
