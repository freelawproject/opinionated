L. 525, appointed three persons named in it, city auditors, any two of whom should be a quorum, to audit, &amp;c., the accounts of the city treasurer, &amp;c., \u201c and make report thereof to the city council, with a statement of the balance due from or to said treasurer, &amp;c., and once in every year cause to be published, &amp;c., a just and true account of all the moneys which shall have accrued to the city during the, year, and also the disposition thereof, * * * and the said auditors shall have the same authorities that county auditors now have by law';\u201d * * * the auditors named to hold their office until the next city election, when their places were to be supplied by a new election.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-10\">By the Act of April 15th 1834, sect. 55, Pamph.

Mudge objected to filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the report, denying that there was any authority by law to file it. On the 18th of May 1872, the court granted leave to the city to file the report of the auditors under the provisions of the Acts of 1834 and 1870 above mentioned, \u2018\u2018to have such effect as fixed and provided by said Acts of Assembly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">On the 12th of June 1872, the defendant appealed from the report to the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The court directed a feigned issue, \u201c wherein the city of Wil-. liamsport shall be plaintiff, and Hiram Mudge, defendant, to determine whether the amount, found by the auditors of the city of Williamsport, to be due from the said defendant, as treasurer of said city, is more or less than is legally due from said defendant to said plaintiff, and what amount, if any, is due from defendant to plaintiff, on his account as treasurer of said city. <em>Karr, </em>to be filed, &amp;c., plaintiff to give twenty days\u2019 notice before court to defendant, of items and the character thereof, with which they propose to charge defendant, in addition to the amount found to be due by the auditors, and the defendant to serve same notice on plaintiff, of items and character thereof, which he claims should be credited to him in said account, and. which were rejected by the auditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">The case was tried, November 28th 1873, before Gamble, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the report of the auditors before stated, for the purpose of showing the indebtedness of the defendant. The defendant objected to the offer, on the grounds that, in directing the issue, the court was not authorized to make any order which would dispense with making out the plaintiff\u2019s case by competent and legal testimony; the finding of the auditors is not evidence against the defendant; and being an issue in pursuance of an appeal, the plaintiff\u2019s case must be established <em>de novo.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">The offer was admitted, and a bill of exceptions sealed. The report was then given in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">Much evidence was offered, and, under objection and exception, some was received and some rejected; the grounds upon which the Supreme Court decided the case render it unnecessary to refer to it further.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-12\">Under the direction of the court the jury found for the plaintiff for |63,304.33.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-13\">The defendant sued out two writs of error, one from the appeal and the other from the feigned issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-14\">He assigned fourteen errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-15\">1.

The 29th sect, of the Act of 22d of March 1870 (Pamph. L. 535), entitled \u201cA further Supplement to an Act entitled \u2018An Act to incorporate the city of Williamsport,\u2019 \u201d which is relied upon to sustain the action of the auditors, provides that they shall \u201c audit, settle and adjust the accounts of the city treasurer, school directors and overseers of the poor of the said city, and make report thereof to the city council,\u201d &amp;c. The 48th sect, of the Act of 1834, Pamph. L. 547, relating to county auditors, provides that said auditors shall make report to the Court of Common Pleas of said county, and by the 55th sect, of said Act it is further provided that the report of the auditors shall be filed among the records of the Court of Common Pleas of the respective county, and from the time of being filed shall have the effect of a judgment against the real estate of the officer who shall thereby appear to be indebted, either to .the Commonwealth or to the county.\u201d The subsequent sections of the Act of 1834 provide for an appeal from the report of the auditor to the Court of Common Pleas; designate the time within which such appeal may be entered, and the terms upon which it shall be allowed, with authority to the court to direct a feigned issue to ascertain, by the verdict of a jury, the indebtedness of such officer. The supplement to the charter of the city of Williamsport, above cited, contains none of these provisions. It is true, the 29th sect, provides, that \u201cthe said auditors shall have the same authority that county auditors now have by law.\u201d This is relied upon, by the defendants in error, to justify the action of the auditors in filing their report in the Court of Common Pleas. We do not regard this as the proper construction of said section. This is not a question as to the authority of the auditors, but of the effect of their report. The Act of 1870 is explicit, that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>report shall he made to the city council. There is no provision in said act giving to the report, when made, the conclusive effect of a judgment. Nor is it made a lien. This could not well be otherwise, in the absence of any provision giving a right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The case comes up upon two writs of error. One to inquire into the right of the auditors to file their report in the Court of Common Pleas; and the other to contest the right of said court to order a feigned issue upon it, and the manner and effect of the trial. We have already seen that the filing of said report in the court below was without authority of law. It follows, necessarily, that all the subsequent proceedings therein are erroneous, and must be reversed. This view of the case renders it unnecessary to notice in detail the numerous assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The judgment is reversed upon each writ of error; and it is further ordered that the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county, of the 18th of May 1872, authorizing and directing J. W. Hays and A. Nismeyer, a majority of the city auditors of the city of Williamsport, to file their report, as auditors of said city, in the Court of Common Pleas of said county, together with all proceedings in said causes, subsequent to the said order, be reversed and set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
