The telegram as originally written by the plaintiff was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-15\">\u2018 Parkersburg, April 14th 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-16\">To P.

The mistake was not discovered until the 2d or 3d of May, when the plaintiff came to Philadelphia, and had an interview with Edwards, who said that supposing the telegram to be correct, he had made other arrangements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">\u201cThe jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court on the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">\u201c 1. Whether the defendants are liable in this case, the plaintiff not having insured the message nor directed it to he repeated; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">\u201c 2. That the form in which the telegram was transmitted by the defendants and received by Edwards, did not discharge Edwards from his liability as a purchaser under his contract with the plaintiff, and therefore, that the damages sustained by the plaintiff were not a necessary or legal consequence of the default of the telegraph company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">\u201cIt being agreed that judgment should be entered for the defendants if the court in banc were of opinion with them on either point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">. \u201c The first point grows out of the terms and conditions prescribed by the company for the receipt and transmission of all messages. These were, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">\u201c \u2018 In order to guard against and correct as much as possible some of the errors arising from atmospheric and other causes appertaining to telegraphy, every important message should be repeated, by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received to the station from which it is originally sent. Half the usual price will be charged for repeating the message, and while this company in good faith will endeavor to send messages correctly and promptly, it will not be responsible for errors or delays in the transmission or delivery, nor for the non-delivery of <em>repeated messages </em>beyond <em>two hundred </em>times the sum paid for sending the message, unless a special agreement for insurance be made in writing, and the amount of risk specified on this agreement and paid for at the time of sending the message. Nor will the company be responsible for any error or delay in the transmission or delivery, or for the non-delivery of an <em>unrepeated </em>message, beyond the amount paid for sending the same, unless in like manner specially insured, and amount of risk stated thereon, and paid for at the time.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">\u201c If this regulation is valid, there is obviously an end of the plaintiff\u2019s ease. It is conceded that he knew of the rule, and did not require the message to be repeated. He cannot, therefore, make the defendants answerable in damages consistently with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>terms to which <em>he </em>tacitly agreed. It is a general principle that a man who seeks to enforce a contract, shall not recover more than the contract gives. It is for him to consider, in entering into the obligation, what shall be the limit of the liability on the other side. If he assents to a provision that the opposite party shall not be answerable in a given case, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled, he cannot rely on the disadvantageous result of the bargain as a reason for relief. \\'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">\u201c This consideration might be conclusive, if the action were <em>ex </em>contractu, or founded solely on the agreement between the plaintiff' and defendants. Such, however, is not the case. It is an action <em>ex delicto </em>for the breach of a duty which the defendants owe to every man, to receive the messages which he may wish to send, and transmit them to their destination. This obligation was anterior to the contract, and is not necessarily susceptible of being modified by it. Having its foundation in a rule of law, it cannot be varied or restricted, except in subordination to the principles on which the rule depends. The maxim <em>quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se introducto, </em>does not apply when the right in question is conferred on the individual with a view to his protection and for the common good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">\u201c The plaintiff calls for the application of this doctrine to the case in hand. The condition against liability for unrepeated messages, is in his eyes, one which the defendants could not legally impose. It is, as he contends, virtually a stipulation for immunity against the consequences of their own negligence, and therefore invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">\u201c If such be the nature of the regulation, it cannot operate as a defence. The defendants are public agents, and as such bound to the exact diligence which is the condition precedent of all faithful service. Their charter was not conferred upon them merely as a means whereby gain might accrue without the risk incident to individual responsibility. It is a great and beneficial franchise confided to their hands for the better attainment of an object in which the community at large are interested. They are, therefore, not less than a railway .company or a corporation organized to supply gas or water, under an obligation to exercise their peculiar function in away to obtain the end proposed, and must respond in damages to every one who is injured by a want of due care on their part, or on that of the agents whom they employ. This, as the case of The Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Dryburg, 35 Penna. 298, indicates, is true, not only as it regards those who contract with them, but of third persons, who having entered into no relation of contract, are yet injured by their negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">\u201c The fundamental truth of the plaintiff\u2019s contention, is therefore undeniable; but like most truths, it is limited by other and collateral principles. \\A ^railway, telegraph or other company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>charged with a duty which concerns the public interest, cannot screen themselves from liability for negligence, but they may prescribe rules calculated to insure safety, and diminish the loss in the event of accident, and declare that if these are not observed, the injured party shall be considered as in default, and precluded by the doctrine of contributory negligence^ The rule must, however, be such, as that reason, which is said to be the life of the law, can approve; or at the least, such as it need not condemn. By no device can a body corporate avoid liability for fraud, for wilful wrong, or for the gross negligence which, if it does not intend to occasion injury, is reckless of consequences, and transcends the bounds of right with full knowledge that mischief may ensue. Nor, as I am inclined to think, will any stipulation against liability be valid, which has the pecuniary interest of the corporation as its sole object, and takes a safeguard from the public without giving anything in return. But a rule, which, in marking out a path plain and easily accessible, as that in which the company guarantees that every one shall be secure, declares that if any man prefers to walk outside of it, they will accompany him, will do their best to secure and protect him, but will hot be insurei\u2019s, will not consent to be responsible for accidents arising from fortuitous and unexpected causes, or even from a want of care and watchfulness on the part of their agents, may be a reasonable rule, and as such upheld by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">\u201c Applying this test to the case in hand, does the evidence disclose any sufficient ground for overruling a defence which is primfi facie valid? '\\lhe burden of proof is on the plaintiff. It is for him to show in what respect a regulation which he tacitly accepted, is so far hostile to the interests of the community, or of that portion of it which uses telegraphy as a means of communication, that the law should not suffer it to stanc\\ Unless this is so clear as to be legally indisputable, the judiciary should obviously refrain from interfering with the contract as framed by the parties, and refer the subject to the legislature, who can at any time regulate the whole by statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">\u201cWe are fully aware of the importance of the question, and have no desire to relax the just measure of accountability in cases of this description. Telegraphy, like the other powerful instruments -which science has placed at the disposal of man, is capable of being a source of injury instead of benefit. That the intelligence which it conveys is prompt, will serve no good purpose if mistakes occur during the process of transmission. The difficulty of avoiding them is, notwithstanding, greater than might at first appear. The function of the telegraph differs from that of the post-office in this, that while the latter is not concerned with the contents of the missive, and merely agrees to forward it to its address, the former undertakes the much more difficult task of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>transcribing a message written according to one method of notation, in characters which are entirely different, with all the liability to error necessarily incident to such a process. Nor is this all. The telegraph operator is separated by a distance of many miles from the paper on which he writes, so that his.eye cannot discern and correct the mistakes committed by his hand. It was also contended during the argument, that the electric fluid which is used as the medium of communicatipn, is liable to perturbations arising from thunder-storms, and other natural causes. It is, therefore, obvious that entire accuracy cannot always be obtained by the greatest care, and that the only method of avoiding error is to compare the copy with the original, or in other words, that the operator to whom the message is sent should telegraph it back to the station whence it came.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\"><em>\u201c </em>So far the inquiry is plain; but here a question of some difficulty presents itself. Should every message be repeated, or only those which are of sufficient importance to make such a precaution requisite? In answering this question it must be remembered that the repetition of a message necessarily involves delay and expense. The mail may transmit any number of letters simultaneously, but a telegram has exclusive possession of the wires during its passage over the line. While one message is repeated, others are delayed, which may at times be of serious consequence. There is, moreover, an increase of cost, which, though trivial in each instance, would be formidable in the aggregate, *&gt;and necessarily augment the rate of charging in a ratio which has been roughly calculated at one-half. . Such must be the result, if every one who wishes to engage rooms at an hotel, or put a question of friendly interest, must submit to the expense and possible delay of repetition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">\u201c On the other hand, the convenience of the opposite course is not less manifest. Instead of passing every message twice over the line, those only are to be repeated which from their importance, demand peculiar care. And as the company cannot know what telegrams fall within this category, the question is referred to the person chiefly interested. Obviously he who sends a communication is best qualified to judge whether it should be returned for correction. If he asks the company to repeat the message, and they fail to comply, they will clearly be answerable for any injury that may result from the omission. If he does not make such a request, he may well be taken to have acquiesced in the conditions which they prescribe, and at all events cannot object to the want of a precaution he has virtually waived. It is not a just ground of complaint that the power to choose is coupled with an obligation to pay an additional sum to cover the cost of repetici\u00f3n. If it were not, the company would in all probability be called on to repeat every message, with the inevitable result of putting the public to an increased expense, without any corresponding gain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cWe are, therefore, inclined to think that the regulation in question, or at least so much of it as has been considered in this opinion, is well calculated to reconcile the economy and dispatch which the mass of the community principally desire, with the security against accident which each individual is entitled to demand. But we limit ourselves to saying that it is not so far contrary to private interest or the public good, as to justify a court of justice in pronouncing it in valid A</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">\u201cWe have not arrived at this conclusion without a just diffidence arising from the novelty of the subject and the want of any controlling authority in this state. But it is satisfactory to know that the principles set forth above are sustained by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Ellis <em>v. </em>The Telegraph Co., 18 Allen 226; and also by that rendered in Camp <em>v. </em>The Telegraph Co., 2 Mete. (Ky.) 164.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">\u201c We do not think it requisite to notice the second point, beyond saying that it presents a nice question, about which the books do not agree: see Parris\u2019s Case, Law Rep. 7 Chan. App. 587; and the British and American Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Colson, Law Rep. 6 Exch. 108. The fair deduction from the authorities seems to be, that although an offer made through the post office becomes binding as soon as the assent of the person to whom it is addressed is signified by mailing a reply, the contract is still subject to this condition, that the letter of acceptance shall reach its destination; and will fail if the opposite party does not receive notice within a reasonable time in that or some other way. The principle is the same, when a telegram is altered in passing over the line, and misleads a purchaser. We do not, however, express any opinion on this head, and leave it for the consideration of the court above. In deciding that the company is not answerable for unrepeated messages, we have in effect disposed of the whole controversy, and judgment is consequently entered for the defendants on the points reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">\u201c Judgment for defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-9\"><em>J. 0.
