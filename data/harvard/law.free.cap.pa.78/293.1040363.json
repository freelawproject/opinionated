On cross-examination, the inspector, who had been examined only as to 458, testified that he had sometimes found broken grates, but none within three years. <em>Held, </em>this answer was irrelevant; that the plaintiff was bound by it and could not contradict it by showing that broken grates had been found within that time.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b293-9\">March 15th 1875.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ArV\">Before Agnew, C.

The following was the cause of action :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-12\">The house of the plaintiff, which stood near the track of the defendants\u2019 railroad at Shohola Station, in the county of Pike, between Port Jervis and Lackawaxen, was destroyed by fire on the 6th of March 1872; the plaintiff alleged that the fire originated from sparks thrown from locomotive engine No. 458, belonging to the defendants, which passed his house about the time the fire commenced, and that the throwing of the sparks was from the negligence of the defendants in not having their apparatus in proper order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-13\">The case was tried December 18th 1873, before Dreher, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-14\">The plaintiff testified, that his house caught fire between twelve and one o\u2019clock p. M.; before the alarm of fire a train, moving east, passed the house ; the house was entirely consumed and almost everything in it. By other witnesses it was testified that in five minutes after the train passed the fire was discovered; there had been other trains running that day ; none had passed between that of which he spoke and the breaking out of the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-15\">For the defendants, Alfred Carpenter, the engineer of No. 458, testified, that he passed plaintiff\u2019s building about one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of March 6th. The engine had been recently built and had come new from the locomotive works at Scranton about February 1872 ; when it came from the shop it had a stack used for burning soft coal; it was shortly afterwards changed to a stack for burning hard coal, and a grate put in after the 1st of March ; it was the standard grate used on the Erie road; of the best kind in use; nothing more could have been done in passing through Shohola to prevent the throwing of coals than was done; he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>never known the engine to set fire to anything; he looked into the stack when the grate was put in; \u25a0 and also the day after the fire, and the grate was still there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">E. C. Beirne, stack-inspector of the defendants at Port Jervis, testified, that he examined the stack of No. 458 on the 5th of March 1872, and found it in complete order; he did not examine it on the 6th, but did on the 7th of March, and found it in good condition; so on the 8th and 12th of March; on the days it was not inspected it did not arrive during hours of inspection; the netting and grate were' alike good for arresting sparks and for safety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">In addition to the cross-examination, which appeared on the notes of testimony certified by the judge below, the paper-book of the plaintiffs (defendants in error) gave the following as part of the cross-examination of Beirne : \u201c On-the 1st of March No. 458 had no grate ; I saw a grate in on March-the 5th; sometimes find broken grates; have' not found any in three years; a grate will last eight months to a year.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">The defendants gave-'other evidence, for the purpose of showing that the engine was in perfect condition ; had been run carefully, and that the fire had originated inside of the building; and generally in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">In rebuttal, the plaintiff offered to prove that within the past three years they have seen netting taken from the smoke-stack of a locomotive running between Honesdale and Port Jervis (Hawley Branch), and thrown away, and the engine running without it. This is offered to contradict the stack-inspector, who swore that no such thing had occurred within\u2019 three years; also, that they have seen lumps of coal thrown from the smoke-stacks as large as hickory-nuts within sam\u00e9 time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">It was objected that it was not competent to prove what had occurred on Hawley Branch, and that the evidence ofi'ered was not \u25a0 rebutting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">The offer was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">Several witnesses testified in accordance with the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\">The verdict was for the plaiiitiff-for $54429.23.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-14\">The defendants took a writ of error,- \u00bfnd assigned for error the admission of the foregoing evidence..-\u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-15\"><em>W.

It follows, therefore, that the condition of this engine and its management were all that were legitimately before the court. If it was properly constructed as to its furnace and smokestack, and was furnished with a spark-arresting grate of the proper character, the company would not be liable, though the building were burned by fire accidentally issuing, from it: Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Doak, 2 P. F. Smith 379. If, then, this engine was in a proper condition, it mattered not that every other engine, owned by the company, was without the proper appliances for preventing the ejection of coals and sparks. On the other hand, if this engine was dangerous, in this respect, it was of no consequence that all others upon the road were safe. Such being the case, it is manifest that all evidence going to prove defects in engines belonging to this company, other than the one alleged to have produced the injury complained of, was irrelevant to the issue pending, and should have been excluded. It is alleged, however, that this evidence was relevant as tending to contradict certain general statements made in the testimony of Edward C. Beirne, the defendant\u2019s stack-inspector. But we find nothing whatever in that testimony, as certified to us by the judge below, which tends to support such an hypothesis. No allusion is made by Beirne to any engine but No. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">If, nevertheless, we consider that which we are not bound to consider, to wit: the testimony reported in the counter-statement, taken from the notes of the counsel for the defendant in error, we are still unable to pronounce the ruling as free from exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The witness, on cross-examination, stated, among other things, that he depended upon his book entries to refresh his memory; that he sometimes found broken grates, but none within three years. Now, as this answer was irrelevant to the issue trying, and as there was nothing in the examination-in-chief which could properly induce a cross-examination productive of it, the plaintiff, who drew it out, was bound by it, and ought not to have been permitted, under a pretence of contradicting it, to throw evidence into the case, which, whilst prejudicial to the defence, was foreign to the matter in controversy: Griffith <em>v. </em>Eshelman, 4 Watts 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
