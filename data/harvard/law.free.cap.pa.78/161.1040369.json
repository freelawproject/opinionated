An indictment set out an Act of Assembly \u2014 of April 17th 1869 \u2014 to lay out a state road ; averred that it was laid out through Cascade township ; that all the requirements of the act had been complied with, and that the supervisors of that township had neglected to open it. <em>Held, </em>that the supervisors were liable on the indictment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b161-11\">2. The 4th sect, of the act provided, after the report, &amp;c., were filed, the road should be a \u201cpublic highway,\u201d and upon notice it should be opened,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b161-12\">&amp;c., as other public roads.

And that on or about the 11th of August 1873, the said Michael Kelly gave notice to John Reiter, the other supervisor of the said township of Cascade, to open the said road in said township, as provided in said Acts of Assembly.

That they are not subject to indictment for not opening the road mentioned in said indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-12\">2. That said indictment is defective, in that it is not therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>stated that a landowner along the route of said road, or any other person interested, offered to advance to the said John Reiter and Peter Mulvey, or their predecessors in office, the money necessary to open any certain portion of said road, as required by the 5th section of said act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">,3. Because the supplement to an Act of the General Assembly, approved the 24th day of March, A. <em>D. </em>1873, arid recited in said bill, is an attempt by the legislature to give an explanation to the Act of April 17th, a. d. 1869, different from the judicial meaning previously fixed upon said act by this court, when Patrick Flannigan and Peter Wicks, supervisors of said township, -were tried and acquitted in this court for not opening said road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">4. Generally, because said supplement to the act recited in said indictment is unconstitutional and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">5. That the supervisors have not had written or other notice of .the passage of the supplement referred to in said indictment, nor reasonable notice and time to open said road before the finding of the indictment in this case, wherefore they pray judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-10\">Judgment was entered on the demurrer for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-11\">The Oommonwealth sued out this certiorari, and assigned for error, that the court entered judgment for the defendants on the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-12\"><em>S.

Till the courts fix the meaning of a doubtful law, the legislature may explain it: O\u2019Conner <em>v. </em>Warner, 4 W. &amp; S. 227. The legislature might modify or repeal the 4th section of the act, although the courts might declare that rights previously vested should not be affected; Lambertson <em>v. </em>Hogan, 2 Barr 23; Reiser <em>v. </em>Savings Fund, 3 Wright 145; Journeay <em>v. </em>Gibson, 6 P.

If the sections are inconsistent the latter must prevail: Packer <em>v. </em>Sunbury &amp; E. Railroad, 7 Harris 219. The indictment does not show that one or more landholders offered to advance money to open the- road according to the 5th section; this should appear in the indictment: Wharton\u2019s Am. Cr. L., sect. 364.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b164-14\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AzS\">delivered the opinion of the court, May 10th 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Several special matters were alleged in the demurrer. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>court filed no opinion, we are not informed on which the demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">That supervisors are liable to indictment for neglecting to open a public highway duly laid out in their respective townships, is well settled: Grafins <em>et al. v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Penna. R. 502; Edge <em>v. </em>Same, 7 Barr 275; Phillips <em>v. </em>Same, 8 Wright 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">1. The indictment recites at length the Acts of Assembly of 17th April 1869, and of 24th March 1873, which give the power and direct the manner of laying out this public road. It avers a due execution of that power, according to the requirements of the statute; and that the road was duly viewed and laid out in the township of Cascade, of which the defendants are supervisors. Thereupon, the Act of 17th April declares \u201c it shall, to all intents and purposes, be a public highway.\u201d It, therefore, follows that the defendants were liable to an indictment for a neglect of their duty in regard to the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">2. This assumes that the indictment was drawn under the <em>fifth </em>section of the Act of 17th April. This assumption is unwarranted. It is not justified by the record. The fourth and fifth sections severally prescribe under what circumstances the supervisors shall be required to open the road. Section four declares that \u201c upon notice by any person interested, the same shall be opened and repaired as other public roads are opened and repaired in said township.\u201d Wherever there are supervisors, this power is lodged exclusively in them. No other person or official was authorized to open this road. An obligation was then imposed on those supervisors to expend the general funds of the township in opening it.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Section five of the act assumes that some person or persons owning lands along the route of the road may have a special interest in the construction of certain portions of it sooner than the existing funds of the township will pay for its opening. In such a case, if the person so desiring it will advance the money necessary for that purpose, it is made the duty of the supervisors to let such portion to the lowest and best bidder. This indictment does not aver any of those special facts. It does not charge a violation of any duty imposed by that section. It is true that section is recited with the rest of the act; but the specific charge of ' dereliction of duty is under the fourth section. It is, that after notice by a person interested, the defendants have neglected and refused to employ laborers to open and clear the road, and have neglected and refused to open and clear the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">3 and 4. It was clearly within the legislative power to so modify and change the law as to dispense with some of its former requirements. The supplement might impose a duty under certain facts which created none before.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">If the defendants were indicted for their neglect and refusal before the passage of the Act of 24th March 1873, to open the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>road, then this point would have force; but inasmuch as it is for their neglect of duty thereafter, the principle invoked does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">5. The indictment avers notice. The statute does not require it to be in writing. The reasonableness of the time intervening between the notice and the commencement of the prosecution was not a question of law to be declared by the court; but one of fact to be passed upon by the jury, having due regard to the season of the year, and the sufficiency of township funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The learned judge, therefore, erred in allowing and sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Judgment reversed, and judgment entered in favor of the Commonwealth, and the record is remanded for the court below to impose sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
