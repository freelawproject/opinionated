An attachment was issued by the plaintiff, in this cas\u00e9, to attach this sum, so exempted and allowed, and known by him to be so, upon the ground that the obligation given him by defendant, and upon which he obtained the judgment upon which his attachment issued, waived the exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201c Several points have been presented by defendant, one of which only we find it necessary to answer. It is the third point, and is as follows : Plaintiff has produced no evidence showing that defendant waived his right to the $300 exemption. This we answer in the affirmative. The plaintiff has offered the records of\u2019his judgment, it furnishes no such evidence. He has also produced his <em>narr., </em>which is an allegation of plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant, and the nature of such claim; and before he could obtain judgment he would be obliged to furnish proof to the court of all the material allegations in the <em>narr. </em>The <em>narr. </em>now produced proffers -to the court (and says, now shown to the court) the note, the evidence. The note is not shown here; the <em>narr. </em>is a mere allegation and not evidence of a fact. This point taken is correct, there is no evidence before this court or jury that defendant waived the exemption in the note upon which plaintiff\u2019s judgment was obtained, and therefore your verdict must be for defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">The verdict was for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, and assigned for error:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">1.

The pleadings and record show that the defendant\u2019s claim for the $300 exemption ivas made by a special plea to the scire facias, more than three months after the return-day of the writ, and after the interrogatories and answers were filed, and.therefore too late, and this question being raised on the trial, the court was in error in directing a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-10\"><em>A.

Shelly, one of the defendants, made his deed of assignment to Benjamin McCutchen and Christian W. Brubaker, for the benefit of his creditors, reserving therein the amount ($300) exempted from levy and sale under the Act of 1849. Upon settlement of the account of the assignee, this amount was awarded to Shelly, but before it was paid over to him it was attached by the plaintiff in the hands of the assignee. In order to support this attachment, the plaintiff gave in evidence the <em>narr., </em>in which was recited, as the foundation of the suit, a note under seal, executed by the defendants, with waiver of exemption. The learned judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of the Common Pleas held that the allegation of waiver of exemption contained in the <em>narr. </em>was not evidence of that fact, and so ruled the case against the plaintiff. In this we think there was error. The whole record was admissible, and the <em>narr. </em>was part of the record: Erb <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 Harris 20. As the judgment was evidence, so was also the declaration, for by it that upon which the judgment was founded would appear. We apprehend that as the record, as a whole, imports verity, so every part of it is admissible to prove that which it legitimately sets forth. It is no doubt true that where the <em>narr. </em>contains allegations not pertinent or material to the case, such allegations would not be admissible. Such, however, was not the case with the matter in hand. The waiver as set forth was not only pertinent and material, but it was part of the record: Hageman <em>v. </em>Salisberry, 24 P. F. Smith 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
