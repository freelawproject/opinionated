IP. Snyder and others, owners of the schooner \u201cAmanda Flanagan,\u201d against the city of Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-10\">The case of the plaintiffs was, that on the 5th of May 1870, the schooner was lying at Cramp\u2019s wharf, on the river Delaware, in Philadelphia; the vessel had her cargo aboard. Cramp\u2019s wharf was a short wharf not extending out to the port warden\u2019s line; immediately below it was the Kensington Waterworks wharf, belonging to the city; this wharf extended to the port warden\u2019s line, and was 99 feet further out than Cramp\u2019s wharf. About four o\u2019clock P. M. it was attempted to haul the vessel into the stream; to accomplish this a line was run from her bow to the outer end of the long wharf, and another line from her stern to the end of the short wharf; she was then hauled safely until her bow was a few feet beyond the long wharf, where she went aground; after making efforts unsuccessfully to get her off, about two o\u2019clock in the next morning it was discovered that she had \u201cbroken her back \u201d \u2014 as was afterwards ascertained \u2014 from having grounded on a rock on which she rested \u201camidship,\u201d and as the tide fell she settled \u201cfore and aft,\u201d and broke into two pieces.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-11\">The evidence on the trial was substantially as above stated. It also appeared by the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, that the rock was a natural formation and part of the bed of the river ; before the wharf was built it had been exposed, so that a person might stand on it at low water; the wharf had been partially built on it; since the building of the wharf, the tide does not fall sufficiently to expose it to view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-12\">After hearing all the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the court ordered a judgment of nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-13\">This was assigned for error, on the removal of the record to the Supreme Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-14\">The Act of February 2d 1854 (Consolidation Act), sect. 28, Pamph. L. 37, enacts that \u201c it shall be the duty of the councils of the city of Philadelphia, after the requisite surveys and soundings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>shall have been made, to fix lines beyond which no wharf or pier shall be constructed, and to keep the navigable waters <em>within said city for ever open and free from obstruction. </em>The city councils shall authorize the construction of wharves upon a plan and scale to meet the demands of commerce, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The Act of May 13th 1856, sect. 12, Pamph. L. 570, enacts \u201cthat it shall be lawful for the councils of said city (of Philadelphia) to provide by ordinance for the <em>cleaning </em>of the docks on the Delaware and Schuylkill front of said city, and to require the owners of wharves and piers which surround such docks to cleanse the same ; and after thirty days\u2019 default from the service of notice on them to perform said duty, it shall be lawful for the city to do said work and to apportion the expenses thereof among the owners of wharves and piers adjoining, in proportion to the extent of their wharves, having the privilege or use of such docks, and to collect the same by filing liens therefor, and process thereupon, as in case of claims for paving: Provided, that no dock shall be cleansed to a greater depth than the natural bed of the river.\u201d By ordinance of the councils of Philadelphia, the port warden\u2019s line had been fixed at the line to which the Waterworks wharf had been extended.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>J.

Oollis </em>(City Solicitor), for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3\">cited Winpenny <em>v. </em>City, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, January 18th 1875,</p>\n<author id=\"b24-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">The rock upon which the schooner \u201c Amanda Flanigan \u201d rested at the ebb of tide, was a part of the natural bed of the river at the place where this vessel sunk. That it was uneven in surface is evident from the fact that as the tide ebbed and the schooner pressed her bottom upon it, she dipped her bow and stern, while the middle remained stationary, thus causing her to \u201cbreak her hack.\u201d Whether the rock was embedded in mud, which gave way under the bow and stern, or whether it rose in projection from the general surface of its adjacent parts, is not disclosed by the evidence. It would be dangerous to carry the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>nition of an obstruction, as the term is used in the Act of May 2d 185.4, sect. 28, to a natural bottom of the river such as this. Without holding that no natural formation lying in the way of safe navigation is an obstacle, or that the \u25a0 city is not compellable to remove any obstacle to navigation of the most dangerous sort, we may safely say, that the alleged obstruction in this case is not shown to be within the act, especially where no notice has been given to the city authorities of its existence. The case of Winpenny <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 15 P. F. Smith 140, decided that the navigable waters within the city were not confined to the waters within the port wardens\u2019 line, but did not. hold the converse, that the waters within that line were not navigable waters within the meaning of the act. That question remains untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We discover no error to be corrected, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
