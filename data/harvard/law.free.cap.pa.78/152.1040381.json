The witness Gurnee and the plaintiff had sworn, that Wenner and the defendant had been together at the plaintiff\u2019s store, and that some negotiation was had for the purchase of grain. The defendant declined to buy, and in leaving, he said, according to the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of Gurnee, \u201c if he made up his mind to buy, he would leave the order with Mr. Wenner; he would leave instructions with Mr. Wenner whether to buy or not;\u201d or, as stated by the plaintiff, \u201c if he concluded to take it, he would have George come there and tell us so ; give us the order.\u201d This evidence did not justify the admission of proof of the statements of Wenner. Such proof was entitled to he received only on the theory that he had been authorized to contract for the grain on behalf of the defendant as his agent, and there had been nothing to show that a word had passed between them on the subject after they left the plaintiff\u2019s store. Indeed, throughout the trial, there was nothing to indicate the existence of an agency, except what could be implied from the declaration of Wenner in his conversation with the plaintiff. \u201cAn agent is competent to prove his own authority when it is by parol, but his declarations <em>in pais </em>are not proof of it; and though they become evidence as part of the <em>res </em>gestee, if made in the conduct of the business intrusted to him, yet other evidence must first establish his authority to speak before his words, shall bind his principal Jordan <em>v. </em>Stewart, 11 Harris 244. Agency cannot be proved by the declarations of the agent without oath, and in the absence of the party to be affected by them: Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 2 Whart. 340: Chambers <em>v. </em>Davis, 3 Id. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The memorandum which the plaintiff testified he received from Wenner when the contract for the grain was made, was also improperly admitted. The record does not show in whose handwriting the memorandum was. It may or may not have been in Wenner\u2019s, but that is indifferent, for it could only have been made competent evidence by proof, either that the defendant had written it, or that he had authorized Wenner to act as his agent. * The first and second specifications of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The testimony specified in the third, fourth and sixth assignments of error should have been received. The defendant had sworn that he had given no order, verbal or written, for the grain purchased from the plaintiff. Wenner was indebted to him in a sum exceeding $900. When the car load of grain was bought, the plaintiff had been requested to ship it to the defendant. The offer was to prove that at the time of the delivery, the defendant bought the grain of Wenner, and gave him a credit on his books for the amount which had been agreed upon as its price, and that Wenner had said about the middle of October 1872, that he had a car load of grain at Ereemansburg, and had requested the defendant to unload it and give him credit on his books. The defendant\u2019s day-book was offered to show the fact that the credit was given on the 18th of October 1872. Now, keeping in view the defendant\u2019s positive denial of any authority in Wenner to bind him, there was nothing in the position of. the parties at the point of time to which these offers related, to create a motive to fabri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cate testimony or falsify facts. The grain had been bought by Wenner in the name of the defendant, and he was selling it as his own. It had been shipped, but the letter of the plaintiff demanding payment had not been received. How could the evidence offered be treated as <em>res inter alios ? </em>It would have explained the defendant\u2019s possession of the grain. By the plaintiff\u2019s case, he stood charged with obtaining and holding another man\u2019s property, and with refusing to pay for it. Why could he not show that he had taken it in payment of a debt ? The proposition was to lay the exact character of the transaction before the jury. All the items of evidence embraced in the three offers, were <em>res </em>gestee, for th\u00e9y were eotemporaneous with a material fact in the cause\u2014 the delivery of the grain \u2014 and were so connected with it as to illustrate its character. It was error to reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The rejection of the letter of Wenner, to which the fifth assignment relates, was right. It was sent from Reading, and although dated on the 18th of October 1872, must be presumed to have been received after the delivery had been accomplished. Declarations, to become part of the <em>res </em>gestee, must have been made at the time of the act done which they are supposed to characterize, and calculated to unfold the nature and quality of the facts they were intended to explain: Enos <em>v. </em>Tuttle, 8 Conn. 250. So far from harmonizing with the other testimony offered, the letter introduced an element entirely inconsistent and in conflict with it. If the fact which it disclosed, that the grain bad been bought in his name had been brought to his notice before delivery, it is to be assumed that the defendant would not have accepted it. The letter would have been admissible only as the act of a participant in a combination by Wenner with the plaintiff to defraud the defendant, and not the slightest suggestion of the existence of such a combination has been made throughout the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">There was no such error in the answer of the court below to the defendant\u2019s point, as, of itself, to require a reversal of the judgment. The statements proved to have been made by the defendant in his conversation with Gurnee, were <em>some </em>evidence that he had bought the grain of Wenner and had credited him with its price. By the rigid, rejection of the other testimony, however, they stood alone, and, without any corroboration, they can scarcely be held to have amounted to proof substantial and significant enough to have supported a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
