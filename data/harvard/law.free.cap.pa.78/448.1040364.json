One of the witnesses having died, his writing was proved and the will admitted to probate by the register. In an issue on appeal, the will was admitted as primfi, facie under the probate.

The residue of his estate was to be divided in equal shares amongst nine children, including Harry, Michael and Jacob; he excluded from this distribution two children, on the ground that they had inherited their mother\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-10\">The plaintiffs then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-11\">The defendants read the deposition of William Carpenter, one of the subscribing witnesses to the will. He testified that the paper was written by him, and that he saw Henry Charles sign it on the day of its date. \u201c There was an alteration made in two places in the valuation of the real estate devised to his sons; * * the valuations were higher than they are now; the one was $25 or $35 higher, I think, and the other $30 or $35, to the best of my recollection. I think there were two words in each case, where there are erasures, and ink lines drawn over them. Although uncertain as to the amounts that they were, I am certain that they were higher than they now are, in those two devises, at the time the will was signed than they now appear upon the face of the paper. These alterations were made before the death of my son Albert, which occurred in December, 1871; I think these alterations were made in the summer of 1871, in my office, by me, while he was sitting by my side; I do not think that any other person was in my office at the time. After the alterations were made Mr. Charles acknowledged the will in the presence of my son Albert and myself; at the time Mr. Charles signed his will my son Albert and I signed it as witnesses; my son Albert is dead, and this is his signature to the will; after the date of the will, during the lifetime of my son, Mr. Charles came to my office and requested me to make these alterations. After the alterations were made, as he wished them, he acknowledged the will in my presence and in the presence of my son Albert; he preferred these alterations in the place of making a codicil.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-12\">The plaintiffs then proved by W.

It was proved by two witnesses only. When one of the subscribing witnesses testified, on the trial of the issue <em>devisavit vel </em>non, that the paper thus admitted on the prim\u00e1. facie proof, was altered after he subscribed the will, he contradicted the prim$ facie evidence of the probate, which left the altered paper unproved, and standing on the testimony of the other subscribing witness only, who was dead. The altered will was therefore without proof. The will as it stood before alteration was not proved, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the deceased subscribing witness had not proved the will as it had originally stood, but proved it only in its altered state, which left the original text proved by a single witness only. Then, the alteration being proved by a single witness only, the paper in neither form was legally proved. The consequence is that the paper fell as a will. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
