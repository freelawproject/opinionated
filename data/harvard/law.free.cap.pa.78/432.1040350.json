A suit was brought in that county against the administrator by John Reck, No. 53, to the April Term of the Court of Common Pleas, for the support, funeral expenses, &amp;c., of the widow \u2014 she having made no claim for any portion of the fund in her lifetime \u2014 and judgment was recovered by Reck against the administrator for $509.50. The petitioner settled his account in Huntingdon county as administrator, charging himself with $50, the interest on $1000, which had accrued at the widow\u2019s death. Reck filed exceptions to'the account, asking that the accountant should be surcharged with so much of the principal of the $1000 in the hands of the executors of Joseph Blocher, deceased, as would pay the judgment and costs; the auditor, to whom the exceptions were referred, made a report, which being under consideration on exceptions, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Huntingdon county held the matter under advisement until the Orphans\u2019 Court of Adams county should make a decree ordering or refusing to order the executors of Joseph Blocher to pay to the administrator, &amp;c., of Elizabeth Blocher, deceased, so much of the principal sum of $1000 as should be sufiicient to satisfy the judgment, &amp;c., recovered by Reck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">The prayer was that the court would make such order in the-premises as might be right, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">The executors, &amp;c., of Joseph Blocher joined in the prayer of.\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the petition, but represented it as their opinion, as they had been advised, that the court ought not to require such payment to be made by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">On the 8th of November 1874, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Adams county granted a rule on the parties interested to show cause why a decree should not be made requiring the executors, &amp;c., of Joseph Bloeher, deceased, to pay to Reck out of the $1000 so much as would satisfy his judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">The executors also answered, admitting substantially the fact's in the petition: They also set out that the widow, on the 1st of April 1867, made a verbal agreement with Reck for her support and maintenance during life, and that she resided with him till her death; they then set out the suit and the judgment in favor of Reck, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">They averred:\u2014 (</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\">\u201c That the suit brought by plaintiff only determines the contingency provided for in the will of Joseph Bloeher, as to the $1000, and that the $1000 did not become a vested legacy at the death of Elizabeth Bloeher, but upon the determination of the amount due for support and maintenance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\">The statement filed in the suit by Reck against the administrator of the widow was :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\">Eor boarding from April 1st 1867. to February 1st 1871 . $866 For cash paid physician for her medical attendance . . 4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-12\">For expenses, boarding guests at funeral, &amp;c., ... 20</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-13\">For coffin......... 22</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-14\">$912</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-15\">The court discharged the rule, Wills, P.

It is a rule of common sense as well as law not to attempt to construe that which needs no construction. The testator in the will before us has said, in plain unmistakable English, that his widow should receive during her life the interest of one thousand dollars, to be put at interest by his executors, \u201c and should the interest of the same be insufficient to provide for her, then as much of the principal as may be required.\u201d After her death \u201cthe balance of the thousand dollars to be disposed of \u201d the same as the balance of his other property. Nothing but this balance was given over, whatever that balance might be. The children entitled to this balance undoubtedly took a vested interest in it, that is, in case of their death before the widow, their respective shares would have passed to their personal representatives. But what that interest would be, would depend upon what the balance was. It is contended, however, that as the widow made no demand for any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>principal during her lifetime, the whole fund went over. But where is that condition written in the will? The words are, \u201cas much of the principal as may be required to provide for her.\u201d The testator may have well anticipated that a state of things might occur when others must provide for her. He did not mean that as long as the one thousand dollars lasted, she should be thrown upon public or private charity for support. Can it be doubted, then, that a person who has supplied her with necessaries, with nursing, and medical attendance during her last sickness, and a decent Christian burial on her decease, has an equitable claim upon this fund for reimbursement ? It would be to make her sin in her grave to suppose that, with a right to call upon any part of the whole of this fund, she did not intend so to do in order to pay this honest and meritorious creditor. Her administrator then had a right to call for the amount necessary for this purpose. The judgment of John Reck against the administrator, in an action in which he alleged a special contract with the widow for her support, in the absence of any allegations of fraud or collusion with the administrator, was at least prim\u00e1, facie, if not conclusive, evidence of the justice of the claim. We think, therefore, that the court below erred in refusing to grant the prayer of the petition of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Decree reversed, and now it is ordered and decreed that the executors of Joseph Blocher pay to the administrator of 'Elizabeth Blocher such amount of the principal sum of $1000, bequeathed for the support of the said Elizabeth Blocher, as shall be necessary and sufficient to satisfy the debt, interest and costs of the judgment of John Reck in the Court of-Common Pleas of Huntingdon county, No. 53, April term 1874, and that the costs of this appeal be paid by the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
