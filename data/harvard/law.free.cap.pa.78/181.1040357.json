A.

L. 230, road commissioners are substituted in each township of Warren county for supervisors, and were required to take charge of the roads and. bridges, lay out and alter roads when necessary at the request of the citizens, and make return of the roads so laid out to the town clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-10\">By a supplement of March 15th 1848, Pamph. L. 163, they are required to report roads laid out by them to the Court of Quarter Sessions, and be subject to its approval.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-11\">In 1867, the Warren and Franklin railroad was constructed through Deerfield township, and so occupied and obstructed a public road in that township, as to make it necessary that another road should be made; this hy the General Railroad Law, February 19th 1849, Pamph. L. 13, was to be done by the railroad company. The company, instead of making the road themselves, on the 23d of August 1867, entered into an agreement in writing with the township of Deerfield, through W. W. Connelly and John Robinson, the predecessors of the appellants, by which, in consideration of $2750, the township released the company from all liability \u201cfor the construction, building or repair of any of the roads in the township, * * * so far as such construction, building and repairs to said roads are rendered necessary by the obstructions or occupancy or injury caused by the building of\u201d the railroad. The $2750 were paid to the township. Nothing was done towards the construction of the road until after the appellants came into office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-12\">On the 8th of October 1869, the appellants, as road commissioners, entered into a written contract with G. D. Leighton to build a road to supply the place of one occupied and obstructed by the railroad. The work on the road was commenced in August 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-13\">When this contract was made and the work was done, there had been no authority obtained for making the road. On the 7th of September 1871, McCoy and Snow, as road commissioners, reported that they had laid out the road over the ground on which it had been constructed by them; on the same day the report was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>firmed <em>nisi, </em>and the road ordered to. be opened 50 feet wide; on the 7th of December 1871, the road was confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">The cause was tried March 12th 1873, before Wetmore, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The plaintiffs in the issue gave evidence that Snow, one of the defendants, had received from the township treasurer $800, paid him by orders dated October 1st and December 7th 1870, and drawn in his favor by Leighton for making the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">They gave evidence, also, for the purpose of showing that the contract was not for the benefit of Leighton, but that Snow himself was the actual contractor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">There was other evidence to which, in' view of the opinion of the Supreme Court, it is not necessary to refer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">The defendant submitted these points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-11\">2.

The road on which this money was expended having been built to supply the road taken by the railroad company, and having been since accepted by the township, regularly returned to the court, confirmed and ordered opened, such action is an adoption of the previous acts of the road commissioners, said road is now a regular public road, and the expense of making such road was a legitimate expenditure of the money of the township, for which the commissioners should receive credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-13\">6.

W. Connelly and John Robinson as agents for the company to exercise its powers in making the road in question to supply the place of that occupied by the company. It was much more; it was an agreement by the township wholly to release the railroad company from all responsibility and liability for the construction and repair of this and all other roads made necessary by the obstructions, or occupancy, or injury caused by the building of the railroad, and to perform this duty on part of the township. Now, clearly this was a contract beyond the scope of the powers of the commissioners who made the agreement on behalf of the township. They could not release the railroad company from its'public duty and its liability to the public for neglect or non-performance of the duty. Nor could the township exercise the special powers of the company in the laying out of the new road, the payment of damages, and construction of the road. The whole contract was <em>ultra </em>vires, and compelled the township to assume a liability to the public which was specially imposed by law upon the railroad com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>pany. Had the road been duly laid out, and the contract been merely for the construction of the road, there might have been more plausibility in the claim of the present parties as against the township, for then a proper and reasonable performance of the work, and expenditures of the money upon it, would have been an equitable demand for compensation. But here the work was done upon a route not laid out by the railroad company under its responsibility to the public, or by any competent authority, and was done in substance and effect under a contract with one of the commissioners in his own right. This was in conflict with his duty as a commissioner. Then, when the road was afterwards laid out, it was in truth laid out to suit the expenditure of money already made. The duties of the commissioners in regard to the laying out of roads ought not to be thus made subject to their private interests. It is true the location was approved by the court, but this might really be done in ignorance of the fact that the location was designed to cover an expenditure already made by the commissioners. Upon the whole case we can discover no reasonable ground to admit the right of the commissioners to compensation. To do so would be to encourage a violation of duty, and subject the township to contracts and doings of the commissioners incompatible with its interests. The policy of the law is to secure a disinterested and faithful discharge of duty by public officers, which cannot be effected by laxity in the' requirements of the law, or by the administration of an imperfect and uncertain equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
