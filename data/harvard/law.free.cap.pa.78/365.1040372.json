They denied that the company acquired the right of w7ay under proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill county, or that they acquired any title to the right of way against-the possession of the respondents by virtue of the release of November 2d 1868, and averred that such possession and its extent were known to the railroad company ; that on the 1st of January 1868 the owners of the land over which the plane was located, leased to Lawrence, Merkle &amp; Co. for fifteen years the exclusive right to dig, &amp;c., coal, and the exclusive possession of a body of land which includes the part on which the Mahanoy Plane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>in located, and they immediately took possession of the leased premises, commenced to open the Mammoth vein, erect improvements, &amp;c., of which the Mahanoy and Broad Mountain Company had notice before they took the release. The respondents admitted that they took possession of the demised premises after the occupation of part of them by the Mahanoy and Broad Mountain Company for their plane, but denied that their occupation was unlawful ; and they averred that there was no reservation in the demise to the respondents, of any part of the land within the boundaries of the demised premises ; they admitted that they were mining and driving a gangway toward the plane with the intention of taking away all the coal except that immediately under the roadway of the plane, and claiming the right to mine, &amp;cl, all the coal in the Mammoth vein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">A replication was filed and an examiner appointed, who took testimony, hut no master was appointed. Proceedings were commenced on the 17th of November 1862, to have damages assessed for the owners of the land by reason of its occupancy for the railroad ; the viewers appointed reported February 3d 1863, that they had assessed the damages at $570, but inasmuch as there was dispute about the ownership of the land, they were unable to report to whom the damages were to be paid, but suggusted that they be paid into court to await the determination of the question of the title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">On the 2d of March 1863, John Gilbert and others of the owners appealed. On the 18th of January 1869, it appearing to the court that the title to the land had been finally settled in favor of Gilbert and others, and that none of the other parties defendants had any claim to the land or the award of $570, the court ordered that the proceedings to assess damages should be discontinued, and satisfaction entered on the award of the viewers, upon said parties filing an agreement to that effect; the agreement was filed and satisfaction entered the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">The release referred to in the bill, recited that the Mahanoy and Broad Mountain Bailroad Co. had fixed, &amp;c., the route for their main line, the Mahanoy city branch, &amp;c., to the colliery of Lawrence, Merkle &amp; Co., through and upon lands of John Gilbert and others, naming them, and occupied or' intended to occupy for the main line, land thirty feet wide on each side of the centre line of their road, &amp;c., and in consideration of the advantage to be derived to them from the location and construction of the road, Gilbert and others, the owners of the land, released the railroad company from all claims, damages, &amp;c., by reason of their entering upon and taking the land and the location and construction of their railroad, and covenanted that no non-user of the land appropriated and no occupation by the releasors by residence or otherwise for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>any period of time, should affect the right of the railroad company to the entire and exclusive possession of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">The other testimony related principally to the questions of the mining of respondents with reference to the railroad, and the danger to it by continuing the mining.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">The court (Walker, A.

The railroad company had actually appropriated the land, and built and used its railway long before any title by lease of the coal mines had vested in the defendants. This is admitted in the answer. Th e owner of the land made no objection to this appropriation, but after a proceeding to assess the damages had been prosecuted, finally compromised and released. The title of the railroad company came not through this proceeding, but by its original entry and appropriation without objection. The release operated not by way of an original conveyance, but by way of a discharge for the damages incurred by the entry and construction of the railway. It is clear therefore that when the defendants obtained their lease they took it subject to the previous easement and right of way of the railroad company over the surface. The railroad was then in lawful existence and use. The owners made no defence to the right of the railroad company to appropriate the land, and their tenants cannot now set up a defence which they waived, if they had any. The Act of 1849 does not compel a railroad company to remove its track, though it gives the authority. A most necessary provision for the security of the company and of the public. To hold the law to be mandatory would result in its being compelled to shift the location, involving perhaps an extensive change of gradients, as often as the mine owner honeycombs the earth beneath the railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Decree affirmed with costs and appeal dismissed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
