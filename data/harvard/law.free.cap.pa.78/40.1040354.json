A testator, after providing for his wife, directed that no distribution of his estate should be made until five years from his death, and not then unless his wife were dead. He gave some legacies, and directed that the income of his estate should be paid in sixth parts to certain legatees until the time for distribution of his estate. At the time of the distribution of the corpus of his estate, he ordered it to be divided into six parts ; one part he eave.to his son Guy, and in case of his death without issue before the distribution, he gave it over, with the proviso that if he died before the time of distribution without issue, $5000 in Allegheny bonds should be paid to Guy\u2019s wife. Guy died before the time of distribution, his wife surviving. <em>Held, </em>that she was not entitled to the $5000, until the time of the distribution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-6\">2.

The plaintiff is his widow. The executors of the will of James Schott paid to her, after her husband\u2019s death, the legacy of $500, mentioned in the said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">The plaintiff contends that she was entitled to receive also the $5,000 Allegheny county five per cent, honds, mentioned in the said will on the day .of the death of her husband. The defendants contend that she was not so entitled, and will not be entitled to receive the same until the expiration of the time at which it is provided by the said will that the estate of the testator shall be distributed, viz.: five years after his death, provided, the plaintiff should then be living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-13\">\u201cIf the court should be of opinion that she w\u00e1s entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>receive the said $5000 Allegheny county five per cent, bonds upon the said sixth day of September 1871, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff, for the said sum of $5000, payable in the said bonds, together with all the interest that has accrued, and been received thereon, since the said sixth day of September 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">\u201c If the court should be of opinion that the said sum is not so payable to the plaintiff, then judgment is to be entered for the defendants, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right, or that of her legal representatives, to institute other legal proceedings after the expiration of five years from the death of the testator, if she or they shall then be lawfully entitled so to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">Mr. Justice Mercur, at Nisi Prius, entered judgment on the case stated for the defendants, delivering the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">\u201cJames Schott died on the 23d day of October 1870, having first made his last will and testament, wherein he provided, <em>inter </em>alia, that, \u2018 in the event of the death of my son, G. Bryan, before the distribution of my estate, leaving no lawful issue, and his wife Marian shall then be living, I hereby authorize and direct my executors to pay her $5000, par value, of my Allegheny county five per cent, bonds.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">\u201c G. Bryan Schott, the son of the testator, died on the 6th day of September 1871, before distribution of the estate was made ;\u2022 but whether he left lawful issue is not stated, although the counsel on both sides have argued the case as if he had left none, and it appears that a legacy of $500 has been paid to his widow that she would not have been entitled to receive in case he had left issue. The -plaintiff is his widow, and claims she was entitled to the said bopds upon the death of her husband. The defendants deny her right to demand them until the distribution shall be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-10\">\u201c Looking at the foregoing extract only, the plaintiff\u2019s construction would seem to be the correct one. In the event that \u2018 his wife Marian shall then be living\u2019 would indicate \u2018 then\u2019 as pointing to the time of her husband\u2019s death. The rule, however, by which a will is to be construed, requires us to examine the whole instrument. Every sentence and word in a will must be considered in forming a judicial opinion upon it: Turbett <em>v. </em>Turbett,. 3 Yeates 187. The intention of the testator drawn from the words of a will, taken altogether, must govern in its construction: Lynn <em>v. </em>Downes, 1 Yeates 518. The intention of the testator, said Yeates, Justice, in Eindlay <em>v. </em>Riddle,. 3 Binn. 149, has always been deemed the first great leading fundamental rule in the construction of wills. It is true, the intention of the testator shall not govern in the construction of a will where the rule of law overrules the intention. This is said to be reduceable to four' instances: 1. Where the devise would make a perpetuity; 2. Where it would put the freehold in abeyance; 3. Where chattels are limited in inheritances; and, 4. Where a fee is limited on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>fee: 2 Dallas 244. To this list may be added the case where the Act of Assembly of 27th April 1855, makes that a fee-simple estate which the testator intended should be a fee-tail only. None of these exceptional cases, however, interpose in this case to prevent full effect being given to the testator\u2019s intention. It is the general intent of a will which controls in its construction. Hence, the general intent being first ascertained, a court will, in order to give effect to such intent, overlook a particular intent inconsistent therewith : Findlay <em>v. </em>Riddle, 3 Binn. 150.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">\u201c Tested by these rules, and examining the whole will, we discover the great controlling idea and intention of the testator to be as expressed in the third item, \u2018 that no division or distribution of my estate shall be made until after the expiration of five years from the day of my death.\u2019 Within those five years certain legacies are made payable out of the income from his estate; but no portion of the principal shall be disturbed. After having made a disposition of the income to his several descendants, and persons intermarried therewith, in each case referring to the subsequent distribution of his estate, he says : \u2018 After the expiration of five years, and when the time shall arrive for the division and distribution of my estate, it is my will that the whole of my estate, real, personal, and mixed, shall be disposed of as follows.\u2019 Then, after making some provision for several of his grandchildren, he again recurs to a general distribution in these words: \u2018 After the expiration of five years, and when the time shall arrive for the division and distribution of my estate, as hereinbefore provided for, it is my will that the whole of my estate that shall remain after the aforesaid legacies are paid and provided for shall be disposed of as follows.\u2019 Then follow other legacies to several other of his grandchildren, after which the testator says : <em>e </em>It is my will that the whole of the remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, shall be divided into four equal parts.\u2019 The income from one part thereof is given to each of his three several daughters during life, with power to dispose of the said part by will. The other fourth part thereof is given \u2018 to my son Gruy Bryan Schott; and in case of his death, before the distribution of my estate to his lawful issue, if he shall have any; and in default of lawful issue his interest shall cease and his share shall be equally divided between his sisters. * * * But if my son shall be living when the time arrives for the distribution of my estate, his share shall be paid to him and at his own disposal.\u2019 Then immediately follows the clause first quoted, under which the plaintiff rests her right to recover upon the death of her husband. It appears from the portions of the will recited that no general distribution of the property, no division of the principal, was to be made until five years after the death of the testator. Neither son, nor daughter, nor grandchild, was entitled to receive one dollar of the principal within the five years. Within that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the legacies given to all of them were to be paid out of the income only. If the construction claimed by the plaintiff be correct she stands upon higher ground than either of the legatees in whose veins the blood of the testator flows. Within the five years she can withdraw a portion of the principal of the estate: none of his descendants can. The general intent of the will leads to an entirely different conclusion. To give effect to that general intent, we say the true reading of the will is, \u2018 in the event of the death of my son G. Bryan before the distribution of my estate, leaving no lawful issue, and his wife Marian shall be living at the time of said distribution.\u2019 May we so change the language to effectuate the general intent? Words maybe added, altered, or rejected, for that purpose: Duffield <em>v. </em>Morris, 4 P. L. J. 79. The construction claimed by the plaintiff destroys the symmetry of the will, and would produce results inconsistent with the whole spirit of the distribution of the property proposed.by the testator; while the other view, that the plaintiff is not entitled to the bonds until the general distribution of the property shall be made at the expiration of five years after the death of the testator, harmonizes all his dispositions, an.d accomplishes all his intentions. We may, therefore, safely conclude that the latter is the true will of the testator : Earp\u2019s Will, 1 Pars. 457.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\">\u201cJudgment is therefore to be entered for the defendants, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right, or that of her legal representatives, to institute other legal proceedings after the expiration of five years from the death of the testator, if she or they shall then be lawfully entitled so to do, according to the case stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, assigning for error the entry of judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-6\"><em>J.
