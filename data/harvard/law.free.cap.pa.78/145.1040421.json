B. Linderman &amp; Co. issued a pluries fi. fa., No. 2, to March Term 1874, against Laux, for debt, $7500; on this writ the sheriff endorsed <em>\u201c </em>Came to my hands, January 19th 1874, at 4 p. M.\u201d On the same day, F. H. Person issued a fi. fa., No. 3, to the same term, against Laux, for debt, $327.42 ; on this writ the sheriff endorsed, <em>\u201c </em>Came to my hands, January 19th 1874, at 12.30 p. M.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">The auditor heard parol testimony, which showed that for nine years two pigeon holes or boxes had been set apart in the prothonotary\u2019s office for the shei\u2019iff\u2019s writs; in one of them the writs are placed by the prothonotary as soon as they are issued; in the other the sheriff placed the writs after he had executed them. There was, also, a desk in the prothonotary\u2019s office for the exclusive use of the sheriff; he kept a key of the office and had free access to the pigeon holes where the writs were placed. The sheriff was in the prothonotary\u2019s office when writ No. 2 was issued, and 'then knew of its being issued; after leaving the office and going to his dinner, No. 3 was placed in his hands at his residence and he there endorsed the time of its receipt. He returned to the prothonotary\u2019s office about four o\u2019clock, got No. 3 from his pigeon hole, and then endorsed the time of its receipt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-13\">The auditor decided, under these facts, that the prothonotary\u2019s office was the sheriff\u2019s usual place of business, that placing No. 2 in the sheriff\u2019s pigeon hole was a proper delivery to him; and as that had been done before No. 3 was put into the sheriff\u2019s hands, No. 2 was entitled to priority in the distribution of the fund, not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>withstanding the endorsements on the writs showed that No. 3 came first to his hands.

The one, a-pluries fi. fa., No. 2, of March Term, was issued on a judgment of G. B. Linderman &amp; Co., and the other, a fi. fa., No. 3, of the same term, upon a judgment of F. H. Person, the appellant. The execution first issued, Linderman &amp; Co.\u2019s, was endorsed by the sheriff as coming to his hands at 4 p. M., of the 19th of January, and the other, Person\u2019s, as coming to his hands at 12.30 P. M., of the same day. To this first-named writ, the auditor, to whom was committed distribution of the money raised by the sale, awarded the fund, though it appeared by the endorsement thereon, to have reached the hands of the sheriff subsequently to that of the appellant. This award was induced by the consideration of certain oral testimony, from which it appeared that it was customary for the prothonotary of Carbon county, to put writs, as he issued them, into a box, in his office, set apart for the sheriff, and to which that officer had free access at all times. It also appeared that the prothonotary had placed writ No. 2 in this box before No. 3 was made out, but that this latter writ was put into the sheriff\u2019s possession some hours before he took the former out of the box. We do not think this evidence warranted the conclusion to which the auditor and court below arrived. It will be observed, that the lien of an execution attaches, not from the date of its issue, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>from the time it comes into the hands of the sheriff: Act June 16th 1836, sect. 37, Pamph. L. 768. But the ruling of the court below would, in effect, give the lien to the execution first issued, for the prothonotary would naturally and uniformly place these writs in the box in the order in which they were made out. Such was the result of the case under consideration; No. 2 was the first in the box and took the money, though No. 3 was first in the sheriff\u2019s hands. This was a complete inversion of the Act of Assembly. The setting apart of a pigeon hole, in the prothonotary\u2019s office, for the use of the sheriff, is a mere matter of convenience, and the putting of a writ therein is no delivery to him. It is undoubtedly true, that in the absence of an endorsement of the time of receipt, parol evidence may be adduced to prove which of two or more writs came first into the custody of the executive officer : Mifflin <em>v. </em>Will, 2 Yeates 177; Hale\u2019s Appeal, 8 Wright 438. But as is observed by Justice Thompson, in the case last cited, when, in obedience to the direction of Act of 1836, the sheriff does note the precise date of the receipts of the writs, it is conclusive. In the case now under review, the precise dates of the receipts of the writs were noted, and an inspection thereof renders itt patent that the money in court should have been applied in satisfaction of the appellant\u2019s execution. The decree of the court below is reversed at the costs of the appellees, and a new distribution ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
