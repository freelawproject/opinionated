M. North </em>(with whom was <em>Gr. M. Kline), </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOJ\">\u2014The agreement showed that it was the individual contract of Smith ; and if it had been joint, it could have been taken advantage of only by plea of abatement: Chorpenning <em>v. </em>Royer, 8 P. F. Smith 474; Bellas <em>v. </em>Fagely, 7 Harris 275.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-11\"><em>0. J.

Giving entire assent to the contention of the defendant that he thereby entered into copartnership with the- original contractor, he made the contract his own contract, even if he had not expressly agreed, as he did, <em>\u201c </em>to account to the within-named Abraham Collins for the full amount of the within agreement.\u201d Was it any answer to the action to set up that there was another person liable to him on the contract jointly with him ? There is nothing better settled than that the non-joinder of a co-contractor can only be taken advantage of by a plea in abatement. It would be ah affectation of learning to cite authorities for this proposition. We have our own cases of Bellas <em>v. </em>Fagely, 7 Harris 275; Chorpenning <em>v. </em>Royer, 8 P. F. Smith 474 \u2014 full to the point. Nor does it matter that the declaration is upon an individual contract. A joint contract is not at variance with the count. It is still the undertaking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the defendant <em>m solido; </em>though being with another, he has the right to have that other brought in, but only in the very first stage of the cause, by plea in abatement. Had the written evidence been admitted, as it ought to have been, the other offers would have been unnecessary; and certainly the learned judge was right in rejecting them, as the contract was in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
