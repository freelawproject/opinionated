Surveys adjoining under warrants to S. Harvey and M. Harvey wero in Northampton county in 1792; in 1798 Wayne county was cut off from Northampton, leaving, as was supposed, the S. Harvey in Wayne. It, others, was sold to feellogg, by the sheriff of Wayne county, for taxes in 1806, and conveyed by one deed; the tracts were actually in Northampton. Kellogg, in 180f, sold the two tracts to Stoddart. In 1814 Tyson convoyed them to James, reciting a deed from Stoddart of 1808 to him, endorsed on the deed from Kellogg. James built a saw-mill on the M. Harvey, on which houses also were built, and timber for the mill was cut from the tracts, which were afterwards conveyed as one tract and vested in plaintiff in 1859. The M. Harvey had been continually occupied till the trial. The S. Harvey was taxed as unseated. There had been no claim or payment of taxes by S. Harvey or any one under him; but Tyson and those under him paid such taxes as had been paid. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiffs had such color of title as authorized them to pay the taxes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b129-10\">2.

Rees\u2019s office, in which he had kept his papers for the last six or seven years, and to which his papers had been removed from the bank, where he had before kept them; he had not searched at the bank for the letter since he had left it; two or three years after he received the letter he searched for it at the bank; he found the receipt, but did not find the letter; his letters were in bundles, endorsed; he took the bundles apart and looked for the letter, but did not open each letter; he kept his papers in a drawer in the bank vault; also private papers in the pigeon holes; the search was in the drawer, but none in the pigeon holes; he left the letters in the pigeon holes when he left the bank ; at Rees\u2019s office he looked inside of every letter separately; the letters in the pigeon holes were to himself as cashier; did not keep his private letters in them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">After the adjournment of the court, the witness testified that since the adjournment he had searched in the pigeon holes; he inquired at the bank and learned that the letters had been destroyed; the cashier said the letters prior to 1866 had been put into the cellar, and afterwards had been sold to a man who bought paper and rags.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">The plaintiffs then offered to give evidence of the contents of the letter; the defendants objected, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence of its loss; the court admitted the offer, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">The witness testified that the letter -was from Day and Saylor; it contained money to pay taxes, with a list of the tracts on which they were to be paid; he left the list with the treasurer, and told him he wanted to pay the taxes on Day and Saylor\u2019s land; the next day he paid the taxes and took a receipt; this was before the treasurer\u2019s sale in 1860; he had no.recollections of the contents of the letter, except in a general way to pay their taxes; he had no recollection of the contents of the list except that it contained the warrantee names; there was one Samuel Harvey on the list; there were two Samuel Harvey tracts, one of which Day and Saylor did not own. When Day got the receipt he found it was for the one which he did not own; this was after the treasurer\u2019s sale, and after the day of redemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">Saylor, one of plaintiffs, testified that, in 1860, he wrote to Stroud to pay their taxes in Monroe county, giving the names, amongst others, \u201c our Trout creek lands, bought from the Moore family, giving the names of Daniel Ross, Mary Harvey and Samuel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Harvey, to pay taxes on the same tract Moore paid on.\u201d He did not own the Samuel Harvey tract in Ooolbaugh township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">They then gave in evidence the treasurer\u2019s unseated land-book of Monroe county, showing the payment of the taxes for 1858-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">1859 by Day and Saylor, on the Mary Harvey in Tobyhanna; and for the same, years on the Samuel Harvey in Ooolbaugh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\">The defendants gave evidence, by the treasurer of 1860 and by his books, that the taxes of the tracts which Saylor had testified were contained in his letter, except Samuel Harvey in Tobyhanna, were paid by Day and Saylor, and that at the same time the tax on the Samuel Harvey, in Ooolbaugh, had been paid by them, but that the tax on that in Tobyhanna had not been paid. They gave in evidence a copy of the receipt given June 9th 1860, the time of payment. It contained a list of the same tracts, including the Samuel Harvey of Ooolbaugh, but not of Tobyhanna.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">The first point of the plaintiff was affirmed; it was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-10\">\u201c The plaintiffs have shown sufficient title upon which to recover the land in dispute against the defendants, unless the tax sale of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-11\">1860 legally passed the title to S.

Stroud for Day and Saylor upon their unseated lands situate in Monroe county, in the month of June 1860, and, through mistake of the treasurer, the portion directed to be paid upon the Samuel Harvey tract owned by them was not credited to said tract, the sale for unpaid taxes to Mr. Hollinshead was void, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the land in dispute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-14\">The court said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-15\">\u201c We answer this point in the affirmative, unless the jury believe that Day and Saylor by their negligence in some degree occasioned the mistake.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-16\">The following were points of the defendants, with the answers:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-17\">\u201c The limitation of five years, fixed by the third section of the Act of 3d April 1804, is a bar to the recovery of the plaintiffs in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-18\">Answer : \u201c This point is denied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-19\">5. \u201c If the Samuel Harvey tract in Tobyhanna township was never in Wayne county, no title to it passed by the sheriff\u2019s sale for the non-payment of taxes in that county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-20\">\u201c This point is true as an abstract proposition, but has no application to this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-21\">The court charged :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-22\">\u201c The tax sale of 1806 in Wayne county, given in evidence by the plaintiff, was invalid so far as relates to the land in dispute in this case. The Samuel Harvey located in Tobyhanna township, was not located in Wayne county, and Silas Kellogg, the purchaser, took no title to this tract. [That tax sale is a matter of no im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>portance in this case.] On the 3d of June 1847 [James Tyson being in possession of several tracts, including the Samuel Harvey, conveyed them in a body to George Craig], This conveyance embraced 850 acres and 25 perches, and included the Samuel Harvey, the Mary Harvey and the George Solliday tracts. [Craig lumbered on these lands some three years, according to the evidence of Andrew Escheubach, and then by deed dated 13th January 1851, conveyed the same property to Amos Moore. Moore lumbered upon it several years and paid taxes upon it, and died in possession.] The title of Moore was vested in these plaintiffs by deed of the 5th of April 1859. [This recital of facts shows that the plaintiffs were in possession by color of title, and they may recover against an intruder without title.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">\u201c Are the defendants intruders, or are they in possession by virtue of a title? This question can only be considered by determining the validity of the tax sale of 1860 to Stroud J. Hollinshead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">\u201c The tract was unseated, and, if the taxes had not been paid, that sale passed a good title to Stroud J. Hollinshead, who conveyed to these defendants. Day and Saylor attempted to pay these taxes. They sent funds to James H. Stroud, and directed him to pay their taxes. He paid the money to the county treasurer, but the taxes upon the Samuel Harvey in Tobyhanna township were not marked as paid. The evidence shows that the money of Day and Saylor was applied to the payment of the taxes upon the Samuel Harvey in Coolbaugh township, a tract which the plaintiffs did not claim to own. [The money seems to have been credited to the wrong tract. Whose mistake was it? Did the negligence of Day and Saylor contribute, in the least degree, to this mistake ?] If it did, the sale was good, and Hollinshead took a perfect title, which is now vested in these defendants. But if Day and Saylor paid the full taxes, and they were credited to the wrong tract by the mistake of the treasurer alone, and the fault was exclusively his, then the payment was a good one, and the subsequent sale for taxes was void. <em>* </em>* * By whose negligence were the taxes applied to the wrong tract ? If there was any negligence on the part of Day and Saylor, then this tax sale was good, though the treasurer may also have been guilty of gross negligence. Did the list given to the treasurer by Stroud indicate clearly and plainly the tracts upon which the money was to be paid, so that no mistake could be made without gross inattention on the part of the treasurer ? If it did, and the mistake was exclusively the fault of the treasurer, the payment was a good one, and the tax sale void. [The case turns upon the question of fact, which is entirely for the jury. I repeat that if Day and Saylor, by the manner in which they prepared their instructions, contributed in the least degree to the mistake which seems to have been made in crediting the taxes, they are not enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tied to recover, but if the fault was wholly and entirely that of the treasurer, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">The defendants sued out a writ of error; they assigned for error:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">1.

But the true attitude of this cas\u00e9 presents only a single principal question, to wit: Whether the two plaintiffs, Israel Day and Samuel Saylor, had, in the year 1860, such claim or color of title to the Samuel Harvey tract as enabled them rightfully to pay the taxes. \u25a0 If they had, then the taxes being paid, and accepted .,by the treasurer in fact, and the misapplication of the money to the wrong tract being wholly his fault, as found by the jury, he had no right or authority to sell the land; the tax' sale to S. J. Hollinshead, after payment of the taxes, was void, and the plaintiffs were entitled to recover: Bubb <em>v. </em>Tompkins, 11 Wright 359; Price <em>v. </em>Mott, 2 P. F. Smith 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Then, had these plaintiffs such claim or color of title as authorized them to pay the taxes on the tract warranted in the name of Samuel Harvey ? Had they such a title as the law would enable them to pi\u2019otect by payment. This must be determined by the facts in evidence. A warrant was issued in the name of Samuel Harvey, on the 17th September 1792, for four hundred acres of land on Trout creek, near the Lehigh, in Northampton county, upon which a survey was made on the 19th of November 1792, of four hundred and thirteen and three-quarter acres and allowance, the same land now in controversy. Wayne county was cut off from Northampton in the year 1798, by a line from the Delaware river to the mouth of Trout creek, on the Lehigh, running by this tract, and leaving it, as it was supposed, until recently, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Wayne county. It is found that a small portion only, probably ten or twelve acres, lie in Wayne county. In the year 1806 this Samuel Harvey tract and the Mary Harvey tract adjoining it on the northwest, another Samuel Harvey tract, and seven other tracts in the same vicinity, were sold as unseated lands for taxes by the sheriff of Wayne county, and conveyed together in one deed to Silas Kellogg. In 1807, Silas Kellogg conveyed two of these tracts (the Mary Harvey and the Samuel Harvey, the one in controversy) to John Stoddart. By deed dated in 1814, Joseph Tyson conveyed to James Tyson the undivided half of these two tracts, reciting a deed poll from John Stoddart, dated 24th May 1808, endorsed on the deed to Silas Kellogg for the same two tracts to Joseph and Jonathan Tyson. Jonathan Tyson also conveyed his undivided half to James Tyson in the year 1813. Before Jonathan had parted with his title he had built a saw-mill on the Mary Harvey tract, within a few perches of the northwestern boundary'of the Samuel Harvey tract. James Tyson built another saw-mill on the site of the old one, a few years prior to his sale to George Craig, and several houses also, which were occupied from time to time by tenants. The testimony tends to show that the boundary line between the Mary and Samuel Harvey tracts had not been marked on the ground. The pool of the saw-mill dam extended beyond this boundary into the Samuel Harvey tract, and the evidence shows that timber for the mill was cut on both tracts. In 1847, James Tyson conveyed to George/ Craig the two tracts, Mary and Samuel Harvey, and a third small parcel, surveyed in the name of George Solliday, containing thirty-four acres, all together, and described as one tract of eight hundred and fifty acres and twenty-five perches, and allowance. In 1851, George Craig conveyed the same property described as one tract to Amos Moore. In 1858, Amos Moore devised one-half of his property in Monroe county to .Stephen B. Moore, and the other half to be sold by his executors. In 1859, Stephen B. Moore conveyed his undivided half of eight hundred and fifty acres and twenty-five perches to Israel L. Day and Samuel Saylor, and on the same day the executors of Amos Moore conveyed the other undivided half of the same property to Day and Saylor. Thus it appears that these two tracts, Mary and Samuel Harvey, passed together into a single ownership so early as the year 1814, and have so continued until the time of the treasurer\u2019s sale in 1860 to S. J. Hollinshead. From 1847 they were not only held together as a single ownership, but were with the small tract of thirty-four acres conveyed together as a single tract of eight hundred and fifty acres and twenty-five perches. The mill and houses on the Mary Harvey tract have been occupied under the several owners down to the time of trial, and timber cut on both tracts. No claim has been made' by Samuel Harvey, the warrantee, or taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>paid by Mm or any one under bim or Ms title. He is wholly unknown, except as his name appears in the warrant. So.far as taxes are shown to be paid by any one, it has been under the name of James Tyson and his successors, while the continued possession of the Mary Harvey warrant and joint ownership and use of it with the Samuel Harvey warrant, raise the presumption that all the taxes have been paid under that title. Here then was a bon\u00e1 fide claim of title under a sale supposed to be valid of the two tracts warranted in the names of Mary Harvey and Samuel Harvey, without molestation or interference of any one for a period of fifty-six years, and a joint ownership of the tracts as one, and control of both together as one body of land, conveying them together, and using them together by actual possession and improvement of one, and by backing up the water, and cutting timber upon the other. If such a claim of right cannot be protected from divestiture, by payment of taxes to prevent a sale, it is difficult to conceive of any interest in land but an absolute title, which can be so protected by payment. Had the division of Northampton county in 1798 thrown the Samuel Harvey tract entirely into Wayne county, as for many years it was believed to be, there would be no doubt of the right. Then the limitation of five years in the Act of 1804 would have confirmed the sheriff\u2019s deed. Clearly it was color of title, and would give effect even to the general statute of limitations in case of actual possession, such as there was of the Mary Harvey warrant. How then can the mistake of locality in 1806 so derogate from the title to the Samuel Harvey warrant, as to prevent payment of the taxes upon it by the only known owner of it in 1860 ? Will a party claiming both tracts together as a whole, under a long line of conveyances, treating the ownership as one, and exercising control over both, be, by this mistake, when discovered after a lapse of years, stripped of his power to protect himself from a sale for taxes ? The effect of such unity of title to several distinct tracts (fifteen in that case) was strongly stated by Chief Justice Lewis, in the memorable case of Hole <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, 1 Casey 491, in explaining the decision in Kite <em>v. </em>Brown, 5 Barr 291. This effect was perhaps too strongly stated in reference to its influence upon the Statute of Limitations, as was said by Thompson, J., in Warner <em>v. </em>Henby, 12 Wright 187 ; but the principle of this unity'of title and claim makes it clear that the owner may so treat his property. Thus, it was held in Burkholder <em>v. </em>Sigler, 7 W. &amp; S. 154, that when an owner of a tract purchased a small parcel of adjoining land for the use of his mill, a levy and sheriff\u2019s sale carried both, though without any description of the small parcel. It is common practice to levy and sell as one a farm composed of several parcels, but used as a whole, even where one of the parcels consists of woodland only.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The fact that the Samuel Harvey tract was assessed as unseated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>while the Mary Harvey was seated, does not dissever the joint ownership, or forbid the claimant to pay the taxes on the unseated tract. Assessment is the act of the law. The second section of the Act of 1804 required the deputy surveyors to return to the county commissioners all the lands in their districts, \u201c which return shall include a list of the number of acres contained in each survey or warrant, and of the names and surnames of the original warrantees, the waters on which the same is situate, the lands contiguous thereto, and the township, if known, wherein the same may lie.\u201d This was a matter of public policy to obtain all the lands liable to taxation, unseated lands at that time being generally wild, and embraced in large unsettled districts in which even the townships were often unknown. This act was followed by that of 1806, requiring the owners of lands to furnish a list to the commissioners \u201cof each and every tract\u201d of unseated land held by them, with the name of the warrantee, under a penalty of a fourfold tax to be assessed on \u201c every trace \u201d not returned. This is the very view taken by the late Chief Justice Thompson, in Heft <em>v. </em>Gephart, 15 P. F. Smith 516-17. The law of assessment, therefore, does not change the right of the owner or claimant to pay the taxes according to his ownership. The question here is, had the plaintiffs a right to pay the taxes of the Samuel Harvey tract, not how they should be assessed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Bearing on this question are some of the decisions as to the right of redemption. Thus, in Shearer <em>v. </em>Woodburn, 10 Barr 511, a purchaser from one who had purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale the claim of one who had exercised acts of ownership over land, and been the reputed owner for years, was deemed to have such title as entitled him to redeem. Redemption presupposes a valid sale for unpaid taxes, and requires a clearer right to redeem after such a sale than to pay taxes before the sale, in self protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">There is another class of cases bearing on this right to protect such a claim of title, to wit, those establishing a presumption of title arising from great lapse of time. In this case there had been no claim by the warrantee, or any one under him, for a period of over eighty years at the time of trial, and no adverse claim or interruption of the title by sheriff\u2019s sale in 1806, for fifty-four years, at the time of the sale for taxes. In Taylor <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 1 W. &amp; S. 326, a case of one claiming a warranted tract against an intruder without title, Chief Justice Gibson said : \u201c The land was warranted and surveyed in 1773, in the name of Henry Kepple, of whom nothing has since been heard during a period of near seventy years, while they, under whose title the plaintiffs claimed, exercised the only ownership over the warrant, of which, as a title to wild land, it was susceptible. They paid the only taxes for it that ever have been assessed upon'it, and this from 1805 till the trial of the cause (1840). Surely, if the beneficial ownership had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>been in Kepple, he or his representatives would have claimed it long before. The presumption from time alone of an intermediate conveyance from him as a trustee, would be sufficient to go to a jury as prim\u00e1 facie evidence of the fact.\u201d Hastings <em>v. </em>Wagner, 7 W. &amp; S. 215, is a still stronger case, for there the land had been patented, and a deed from the third grantee, followed by a lapse of thirty years, was presumed in favor of those claiming title under it, while the actual possession of the land was in one claiming by settlement and residence. In that case, C. J. Gibson remarks, \u201c that to raise a presumption of a conveyance the question of possession is between not these two (to wit, the claimant and the settlor), but the presumptive grantor and the presumptive grantee.\u201d The' doctrine of presumption is laid down quite as strongly by C. J. Black, in Strimpfler <em>v. </em>Roberts, 6 Harris 283. But it is unnecessary to enlarge, as this subject has so recently undergone investigation in the case of Carter <em>v. </em>The Tinicum Fishing Company, 27 P. F. Smith 310. In the present case there has been not only a continuous claim of title from 1806 to 1860, when these taxes were paid; but, also, the only possession of these two tracts ever known to be had of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Another class of cases gives strength to the position of Day and Saylor as claimants under color of title, viz., those holding that even a treasurer\u2019s deed before the Act of 1815, or one which may not be maintained against the owner of the land, will enable the holder of the tax deed to recover against an intruder: Foster <em>v. </em>McDivit, 9 Watts 344, 345. Now, clearly, a title such as would enable the possessor of it to recover against an intruder would be sufficient to enable the same party to pay the taxes on the land he can thus recover. In doing this he is performing a public duty and injuring no one, for the true owner is benefited by his act, and his title saved from a sale, while the subsequent purchaser from the treasurer had not then come into existence, and had then no rights to be affected. As the owner of even a defeasible title he ought to be permitted to protect himself by payment, for the true owner may never come, or may be barred by lapse of time, and the title may never be defeated. Thus we have in the case before us a holding of the title for fifty-four years, repeated sales and conveyances of the two tracts as one, a joint holding of both under the same title, actual possession of one longer than to give title by limitation, and the use of the other by means of backwater and cutting timber, a dying seised and devise of both as one body of land, and subsequent conveyances in continuation of this unity, and payment of taxes as they were demanded, without any adverse claim of title whatever. Clearly such a claim of ownership entitled Day and Saylor to pay the taxes in 1860, and thus avert a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In regard to the only other question, that as to the sufficiency of the search for the letter to James H. Stroud, it seems to us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>when,all the witness testified to in his several examinations, for he was recalled twice, and made re-examination after the adjournment of the court, is considered, there was ample evidence of search to admit the contents of the letter ; especially in view of the time which had elapsed, the removal of papers, destruction of those that remained in the bank, and the want of knowledge as to where the letter had really been deposited. It would consume unnecessary time and space to enter into a labored examination of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
