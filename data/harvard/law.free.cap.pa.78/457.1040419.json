By an Act of Assembly, Dauphin and Perry counties were required to rebuild a bridge across the Juniata which separated them : the cost not to exceed a sum named. The bridge was built by contract for the sum and accepted from the contractor. The filling up, &amp;c., of the approaches to the end of the bridge in Perry county were not made, leaving it inaccessible. <em>Held, </em>that the county and not the township in which the bridge ended was bound to complete the approaches.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b457-9\">2.

The commissioners contracted for the erection of the bridge for $18,000, the specifications provided for the abutments and \u201c wing-walls to be of sufficient length to retain the embankment, * * * the back of the abutment to be filled in,\u201d &amp;c. The bridge was completed by the contractor according to the specifications ; it was taken off his hands and he paid the full contract price, but it \u201c was inaccessible by reason of there being no embankment or filling up of the approaches to the bridge between the wing-walls, nor was. the bed of the public road leading to said bridge raised or changed in any way by the contractor so as to enable travellers to get upon the structure of the bridge with their horses and wagons or other vehicles on the Perry county side.\u201d The estimated cost of raising the road-bed and completing the approaches was from $200 to $800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-6\">The question for the decision of the court was whether it was the duty of the Penn township or the duty of Perry county to have the approaches to the bridge' on the Perry county side completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">If the court should be of the opinion that it was the duty of the township to complete the approaches, &amp;c., judgment to be entered against the township for costs; if the court should be of the opinion otherwise, judgment to be entered against the county for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-8\">The court entered judgment for the defendant, which was assigned for error on the removal of the record by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-9\"><em>O.

The question presented, in the case stated, for the solution of the court below, was whether the township or county was liable for the expense of this filling, so as to make the bridge accessible to the public, for whose convenience it was erected. The learned judge below held that this liability rested upon the township ; and this on the ground that the wing-walls and earth filling were not technically part of the bridge proper, but rather part of the road leading thereto. We cannot subscribe to this doctrine. \u2022 That the approach to a bridge is part of the highway is doubtless true, but so, also, is the bridge itself; and as the construction of this part of the highway is too expensive for the township to bear, therefore it is imposed on the county. The design of bridging is to provide a safe and convenient passage for the public over some stream or ravine, but no such passage'is afforded when the structure cannot be approached. Can a house be said to be finished until there are steps up to its doors or stairs to its chambers? And how can a bridge be said to be completed without the proper means of access ? Certainly this is so necessary to its use, that without it, the structure is a vain thing; utterly useless and of no account. The bridge is incomplete until everything necessary for its proper use has been supplied, and every such necessary appliance is part of the bridge. When, therefore, the Act of Assembly directed the counties of Dauphin and Perry to build this bridge over the Juniata, it meant that these two counties without the aid of the townships should provide a safe and convenient passage or highway over that river, and not merely that they should set up a structure which the public could not reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered on the case stated, in favor of the township of Penn, and against the county of Perry, for the costs of this case, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
