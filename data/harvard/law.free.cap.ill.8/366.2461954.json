There is nothing before this Court except the order of the Court below refusing the motion to quash, and consequently this Court cannot judge of the correctness of the decision below. Browder v. Johnson, Bre. 62; Kimmel v. Shultz, Ib. 129; Rust v. Frothingham, Ib. 258; Sims v. Hugsly, Bre. App. 27; Cole v. Driskell, 1 Blackf. 16; Vanlandingham v.

That decision is now assigned for error. The testimony on which the Circuit Court based its decision is not before us, and we cannot therefore inquire into the propriety of the decision. The clerk has copied into the transcript certain papers, which were probably read as evidence on the hearing of the motion. That, however, does not make them a part of the record. The appellant should have introduced the evidence into the record by tendering a bill of exceptions. See the case of Saunders v. McCollins, 4 Scam. 419, and the cases there referred to.</p> <p id=\"b379-7\" pgmap=\"379\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b379-8\" pgmap=\"379\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
