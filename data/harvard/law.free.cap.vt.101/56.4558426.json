After hearing, the demurrer was overruled by the trial court, and the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It is argued that this declaration fails to allege facts which show the existence of a duty owing from the defendant to the plaintiff, the shortage of that duty, and the resulting injury, and the facts constituting the claimed negligence, and how the same caused the injury. '\u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> But the answer to this is that the declaration alleges that the defendant was a -common carrier, an'd, this being so, the duties and obligations imposed upon it by common law follow as a matter of course. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>37 Vt. 161, 164; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Rutland </em>&amp; <em>Burlington R. R. Co., </em>26 Vt. 247, 255, 62 A. D. 567. Among these duties- is that of safe transportation of goods delivered to it for carriage and the delivery of such goods at the destination within a reasonable time. <em>Chicago and A. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>225 U. S. 155, 56 L. ed. 1033, 1037, 32 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number> One is required to allege in his declaration only what is necessary to prove in making out a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Prima facie, </em>the defendant, by accepting the merchandise for transportation, incurred the responsibilities put upon it by the common law, or that law as modified by statute. <em>Haglin-Stahr Co. </em>v. <em>M. and W. R. R., 92 </em>Vt. 258, 261, 102 Atl. 940, 23 A. L. R. 748. It is not claimed here that there are any statutory modifications of the common law in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">It is true that the declaration alleges negligence on the part of the defendant. But, while the term \u201cnegligence\u201d is often used in this connection (see <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Rutland &amp; Burlington R. R. Co., </em>26 Vt. 247, 254, 62 A. D. 567), the \u201cprudent man\u201d rule as commonly understood has no application. It is sufficient to allege the delivery of the goods to the carrier, the delay in arrival, and the consequent injury. <em>Kaglin-Stahr Co. </em>v. <em>M. and W. B. B., supra. </em>Since the causes of the delay are particularly within the knowledge of the carrier, it is for it to excuse or explain such delay and bring itself within an exception to its liability, if such exists. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Birchard, </em>40 Vt. 326, 328, 94 A. <em>D. </em>398; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>B. and M. R. R., </em>84 Vt. 329, 337, 79 Atl. 865; <em>Haglin-Stahr Co. </em>v. <em>M. and W. R. R., supra, </em>at page 262 (102 Atl. 940). Even though negligence is alleged in such an action against a carrier and fails of proof, there is no variance, and the plaintiff may recover, if the evidence shows a case under the general rule respecting the liability of carriers. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Birchard &amp; Page, </em>43 Vt. 570, 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The defendant says that the declaration should set forth the terms of the bill of lading under which the shipment proceeded, and the legal duty to be deduced therefrom. But, if any special contract therein contained limits the defendant\u2019s common law liability in any respect material here, it is for the defendant to bring itself within its operation. <em>Haglin-Stahr Co. </em>v. <em>M. and W. R. R., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">It is also argued that the declaration does not allege in what manner the bananas were injured. This point was not made a ground of the demurrer, and we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">There was no error in the ruling below.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
