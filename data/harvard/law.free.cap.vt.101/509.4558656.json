Peck. All facts material to the question here raised appear in the opinion in that case, and need not be restated. These appellants, who arc heirs of the Katharine Keyes Peck mentioned in both the will and codicil in question, contend that under those instruments, when properly construed, they are entitled to all of the principal of the trust estate created by the testator. The decision in the case referred to necessarily disposes of appellants\u2019 claim adversely to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed with costs.
