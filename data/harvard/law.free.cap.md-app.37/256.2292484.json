After two days of trial, during which the testimony was substantially concerned with whether or not the appellant was the employer, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>declared a mistrial. Subsequently, the court adopted an Order rescinding the Order appealed from and affirmed the Commission\u2019s original Order. It also \u201creinstated\u201d the Commission\u2019s finding in the Award of Compensation that the claimant was an employee of the appellant on the date of the accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The court\u2019s Order was unaccompanied by an opinion or memorandum setting forth its reasons. It is clear from the record, however, that its action was based upon the provisions of the Annotated Code of Maryland, Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (e) (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.) entitled \u201cMotion for rehearing of decision of Commission,\u201d which provides that a motion for a rehearing may be filed within a prescribed time and \u201conly upon grounds of error of law, or newly discovered evidence.\u201d In our judgment \u00a7 56 (e) was not applicable and, for the reasons set forth, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The appellee, Ray L. Harris, a truck driver earning $800 per week, was injured in an accident on October 23, 1974, and the significant sequence of events thereafter is reflected by the following chronology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">(a) <em>November lb, 197b</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Mr. Harris filed an employee\u2019s claim on a form provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission. At the bottom of the form in a \u201cbox\u201d reserved for Commission use only, the following appeared:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\u201cConsideration Date: Unless a request for hearing is received by the Commission on or before December 2, 1974 an Order will be passed upon the evidence in the hands of the Commission. Any request for hearing shall be filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule No. 9B of the Rules of Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">(b) <em>November 22, 197b</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">The Commission addressed a form entitled \u201cNotice to Employer\u201d to East Coast Freight Lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>stating that: (1) Commission records disclosed that it did not carry workmen\u2019s compensation insurance; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) if this information was incorrect, East Coast should immediately contact its insurer who must file \u201cthe proper records\u201d on or before the consideration date listed on the claim form; (3) if Commission records were correct and the employer was uninsured but desired to contest the claim, it was required to notify the Commission in writing on or before the consideration date; and (4) if appellant did nothing, <em>\u201cAn award will be passed based upon the information supplied on the attached claim form, </em>\u201d and East Coast, as an uninsured employer, would be assessed a penalty in accordance with Art. 101, \u00a7 91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">(c) <em>November 26, 1974</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">East Coast Freight Lines replied by certified mail to the November 22, 1974 notice, advising that it <em>was </em>insured and that the insurer was the Midland Insurance Company of New York. It also stated that the company\u2019s files contained no report of personal injury submitted by the appellee and that the insurer had been requested to contact the Commission to take appropriate action. The letter concluded: \u201cWe shall await your further advice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">(d) <em>December 9, 1974</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission by Daniel T. Doherty, Chairman, rendered an Award of Compensation on an official form of the Commission, finding temporary total disability and ordering that East Coast Freight Lines pay $102.30 per week during the continuance of the temporary total disability of the claimant, beginning October 27, 1974, subject to further determination by the Commission as to whether the claimant sustained any permanent disability. In addition, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>non-insured, East Coast was assessed $150 plus an additional assessment of 15% of the Award and of any subsequent awards that might be made, not to exceed the sum of $1500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">The Order was said to be \u201cbased on the evidence in the record but [the Commission] will reserve the right of both parties to have the issue of average weekly wage adjudicated at the time a hearing is held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">(e) <em>December 12, 197k</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cIssues\u201d were filed on the form prescribed by the Commission, executed by an official of Midland Insurance Company, Towson, Maryland, with copies to the claimant and to East Coast Freight Lines, Inc., a subsidiary of Smith and Solomon, Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey. Seven separate issues were designated on the printed form, the first of which was whether the claimant was an employee of appellant on October 23, 1974, \u201cor was he an employee of Edwin McDonald Jenkins?\u201d The seventh item designated was, \u201cSuch other and further issues as may be raised at the time of hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">(f) <em>December 13, 197k</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">The Commission issued a form entitled \u201cNotification of Correction,\u201d listing the name of the insurance carrier and reciting, opposite the words \u201cConsideration Date,\u201d the following: \u201cHEARING REQUESTED BY INSURER.\u201d Under the caption, \u201cRemarks,\u201d the form stated: \u201cCertification of Insurance not received until December 13,1974.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">(g) <em>February 25, 27, 1975</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">Workmen's Compensation Commission hearings were held at Baltimore before G. Howlett Cobourn, Commissioner, on the following issues: (1) Claimant\u2019s motion based upon \u00a7 56 (e) of Art. 101;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(2) Was the claimant an employee of East Coast Freight Lines, Inc. or of Edwin McDonald Jenkins on October 23, 1974?; (3) Was East Coast Freight Lines, Inc. the employer and was Midland Insurance Company the insurer of claimant on October 23,1974?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">(h) <em>April 16, 1975</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">The above issues were decided against the claimant and an Order was signed by Commissioner Cobourn, in which the Commission\u2019s Order of December 9, 1974 was \u201crescinded and annulled\u201d and the claim for compensation was disallowed. The reasons for the Commission\u2019s disposition of the employee\u2019s contention under Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (e) were not stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Mr. Harris thereafter filed an appeal to the Circuit Court of Baltimore County pursuant to Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (a) and prayed a jury trial. In his Petition he contended that the Commission erred in its evidentiary findings and in its interpretation of \u00a7 56 (e) of Art. 101. The trial commenced on June 16, 1976 and, as previously indicated, on June 17 a mistrial was declared. Thereafter, on July 9, 1976, the lower court signed an Order providing, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201c[T]hat the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission dated April 16, 1975 is hereby rescinded and annulled and further that the Order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission dated December 9, 1974 is hereby affirmed and reinstated finding that the claimant was an employee of the employer on October 23, 1974 at the time of the accidental injury.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">On July 12, 1976, a motion was filed by the employer and insurer \u201cfor reconsideration of the claimant\u2019s motion under \u00a7 56 (e) of Art. 101.\u201d By Order of the Circuit Court (Proctor, J.) the latter motion was denied on September 3,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In our consideration of this appeal, two fundamental questions emerge. First, is this really a case for the application of \u00a7 56 (e) of Art. 101? Second, if not, what authority supports the action of the Commission in entertaining \u201cIssues\u201d filed after the adoption of an Award of Compensation on December 9, 1974 and vacating that Award?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The claimant has insisted throughout that when the insurer filed \u201cIssues\u201d on December 12, 1974, it was in actuality requesting a rehearing of the Commission\u2019s decision dated December 9,1974, and that its motion was not supported by Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (e). That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cA Motion for a rehearing may be filed within seven days from the date of the decision of the Commission, <em>only upon grounds of error of law, or newly discovered evidence. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Art. 101, \u00a7 56(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">That the claimant-appellee interprets the filing of \u201cIssues\u201d as a motion for a rehearing, obviously does not make it so. Indeed, in our view of what occurred, no such rehearing was involved and the provisions of \u00a7 56 (e) with respect to \u201cerror[s] of law or newly discovered evidence\u201d are totally inapplicable. What was perhaps involved, as Commissioner Cobourn suggested to counsel for the claimant at the opening of the Commission hearings, was whether the insurance company\u2019s \u201cIssues\u201d were timely filed since they came after the original consideration date of December 2, 1974; and the proceedings were patently not in the nature of a \u201crehearing\u201d because no hearing had been held in the first place. The Commission had acted <em>ex parte </em>on the basis of the employee\u2019s claim when it made a temporary award on December 9,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Why the Commission proceeded as it did in this case is not disclosed in the hearings before the Commission nor in its final Order. We think it fair to suggest, however, that because of the confusion that existed with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>whether or not the appellant was insured, the Commission inadvertently entered its Award of December 9, 1974, which not only allowed compensation for temporary total disability but also erroneously penalized the employer as a non-insured; and that, upon the filing of \u201cIssues\u201d by Midland Insurance Company some ten days after the original Consideration Date, they were accepted and set for hearing because the interests of justice and proper administrative procedure required such action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The question then arises: Did the Commission have such authority? In our judgment, the answer is clearly affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As the Court of Appeals had occasion to observe in the case of <em>Plater v. Kane Warehouse Co., </em>241 Md. 462, 466, 217 A. 2d 102 (1966), the General Assembly of Maryland has declared that, \u201cThe powers and jurisdiction of the Commission over each case shall be <em>continuing, </em>and it may, from time to time, make such modifications or changes with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto <em>as in its opinion may be justified.. </em>..\u201d (Emphasis added.) Art. 101, \u00a7 40 (c). In addition, the Legislature has conferred upon the Commission the power to \u201cadopt reasonable and proper rules to govern its procedure. . . .\u201d Art. 101, \u00a7 10. Pursuant to the latter authorization, the Commission has adopted Rule 11 of its Rules of Procedure relating to \u201cRequisites to Application for Review.\u201d That rule reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cRule No. 11. The Commission will not grant reviews of awards upon application of a party or parties except such application be made upon the grounds of a change in conditions, as provided in Section 40 of this Article and be accompanied with statement of facts alleged to constitute such change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of conditions, <em>but upon its own motion it mil exercise its continuing jurisdiction over each case, and for reasons deemed by it to be sufficient will, from time to time, make such modification or change with respect to its former findings or orders relating to any such case as in its opinion may be just, </em>including the making of awards in cases where they may have been denied, but no award will be changed or modified upon ex parte information unless said information is against the interest of the party giving same.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We need not decide whether the Commission\u2019s action, in the instant case, was a modification or change within the meaning of Art. 101, \u00a7 40 (c). <em>See Plater v. Kane Warehouse Co., supra, </em>241 Md. at 466-67; <em>Kelly-Springfield Co. v. Roland, </em>197 Md. 354, 79 A. 2d 153 (1951). What we do decide is that when, as here, the Commission without a hearing renders an award of temporary total disability, it has continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 40 (c) and Rule 11, and may, under the Rule, for good cause, set the case down for a plenary hearing upon \u201cIssues\u201d timely filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Judge McWilliams stated in <em>Plater v. Kane Warehouse Co., supra, </em>where the claimant was permitted to withdraw an automatic award of temporary total disability preliminary to refiling in another jurisdiction, and his authority to do so was challenged by the employer and insurer, \u201c[W]e know of no Maryland statute or decision or rule of this Court, which negates the power and authority of the Commission to allow, in appropriate circumstances, the withdrawal of claims and the vacation of awards.\u201d 241 Md. at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Even in the absence of a specific rule, we think the Commission would have authority to reserve continuing jurisdiction where, as here, the award which was made was inadvertent, was not one upon which a hearing had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>held, was temporary only and could not be deemed to constitute a final award. <em>See Porter v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., </em>188 Md. 668, 53 A. 2d 668 (1947); 3 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 81.53 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\n<em>Order reversed; case remanded for trial; costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\">. The circumstances surrounding the delay are hereafter stated. \u201cIssues,\u201d it may be noted, are filed on a form prescribed by the Commission and constitute a request for hearing and notification that the claim is contested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. As indicated <em>infra, </em>this statement was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-13\">. This motion appears to have been made orally on behalf of the employee at the outset of the hearings before the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\">. No specific reference is made to the penalty provisions of the Order of December 9, 1974 and it would appear that those provisions were also affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. The Commission did not formally suspend its Award of December 9, 1974 prior to the hearing. Such action would, of course, have been appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">. Under the circumstances of this case, we do not consider Midland\u2019s \u201cIssues\u201d to have been a,t all untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
