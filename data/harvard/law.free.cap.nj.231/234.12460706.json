When it hired Vitale, Allied Barton required him to execute an agreement entitled \u201cWorker\u2019s Comp Disclaimer\u201d (Disclaimer) as a condition of his employment. In the Disclaimer, Vitale agreed to \u201cwaive and forever release any and all rights\u201d that he may have had to assert a claim \u201cagainst any customer ... of Allied Security to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>[Vitale] may be assigned, arising from or related to injuries which are covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Allied Barton assigned Vitale to provide security services at a facility operated by its customer, defendant Schering-Plough Corporation (Schering-Plough). While on duty at that facility, Vitale was seriously injured in an accident. After recovering benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -146, Vitale filed a third-party action, alleging that Schering-Plough negligently maintained its premises and that its negligence caused his injuries. Schering-Plough moved for summary judgment, asserting that Vitale waived his negligence claims against Schering-Plough when he executed the Disclaimer. The trial court held that the Disclaimer was void as contrary to public policy and denied Schering-Plough\u2019s motion; the matter proceeded to trial. A jury returned a verdict in Vitale\u2019s favor and awarded substantial damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">An Appellate Division panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment and the jury\u2019s determination of damages. The panel, however, reversed the trial court\u2019s determination to bar the jury from considering Vitale\u2019s negligence and allocating a percentage of fault to him and remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of liability. We granted certification limited to the question of the Disclaimer\u2019s enforceability.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We hold that the Disclaimer contravenes public policy as expressed in two provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. First, N.J.S.A. 34:15-40 (section 40) provides that an employee\u2019s right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not preclude his or her assertion of common-law personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against a liable third party, and that the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier may be granted a lien against the employee\u2019s recovery in the third-party claim. By virtue of its waiver of any third-party action, the Disclaimer would alter the balancing of interests of the employer, the employee, and a potentially liable party that the Legislature envisioned when it enacted that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Second, subject to an exception that is inapplicable here, N.J.S.A. 34:15-39 (section 39) expressly declares any \u201cagreement, composition, or release of damages made before the happening of any accident\u201d to be contrary to public policy. Section 39 is not limited to agreements to waive workers\u2019 compensation benefits; it governs Vitale\u2019s pre-accident agreement to forego any third-party claim against Schering-Plough in the event that he sustained a workplace injury on its premises. Section 39\u2019s plain language voids the Disclaimer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Accordingly, we affirm as modified the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment, and remand to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">We derive our account of the facts from the summary judgment record presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Pursuant to the terms of a Master Vendor Agreement between Allied Barton and Schering-Plough, effective July 27, 2002, Allied Barton agreed to assign supervisory and general security officers to provide security services at Schering-Plough facilities. Under that agreement, the security officers would be Allied Barton employees but would report to work at Schering-Plough.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">In August or September 2005, Allied Barton hired Vitale to work as a security officer. On September 27, 2005, Vitale signed the Disclaimer, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">I understand that state Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes cover work-related injuries that may be sustained by me. If I am injured on the job, I understand that I am required to notify my manager immediately. The manager will inform me of my state\u2019s Workers' Compensation law as it pertains to seeking medical treatment. This is to assure that reasonable medical treatment for an injury will be paid for by Allied\u2019s Workers' Compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">As a result, and in consideration of Allied Security offering me employment, I hereby waive and forever release any and all rights I may have to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">\u2014make a claim, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhW\">\u2014commence a lawsuit, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtFs\">\u2014recover damages or losses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>from or against any customer (and the employees of any customer) of Allied Security to which I may be assigned, arising from or related to injuries which are covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Allied Barton assigned Vitale to Schering-Plough\u2019s Kenilworth facility. Between 2005 and 2008, Vitale worked as a security officer. Vitale described his job duties in the position as \u201c[ojbserv-ing, reporting, holding a post, touring the facility or the post area,\u201d and monitoring security cameras. In 2008, Allied Barton promoted Vitale to the position of field manager, with responsibilities to train and supervise other Allied Barton officers at the Schering-Plough facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">One of Vitale\u2019s responsibilities as a field manager was to ensure that the security officers under his supervision had appropriate uniforms. Beginning in 2008, the security officers\u2019 uniforms were stored in the basement of the main guardhouse of the Kenilworth facility. On ten to fifteen occasions, Vitale descended the stairs to retrieve uniforms for the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">While on duty on August 31, 2009, Vitale fell down the stairs that led to the guardhouse basement. Another security officer turned on the light in the stairwell and saw Vitale \u201claid out at the bottom of the stairs.\u201d The officer who found Vitale attributed his fall to the \u201ccluttered\u201d condition of the entrance to the stairwell. Vitale sustained injuries to his head, neck, shoulder, and lower back as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Vitale filed a claim pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation. In a settlement agreement incorporated in an Order Approving Settlement dated March 7, 2011, Vitale and Allied Barton resolved the workers\u2019 compensation claim. Vitale, who had received temporary disability benefits at a rate of $549.92 per week for thirty weeks, was awarded \u201c30% of partial total [disability],\u201d allocated among lower back, shoulder, and neurological injuries, for 180 weeks at a rate of $252.90 per week. Vitale did not return to his employment with Allied Barton.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Vitale then filed this action. He asserted that Schering-Plough owed him a duty of care as a business invitee working on its premises, that he was injured because Schering-Plough had negligently maintained its facility and failed to warn him of a dangerous condition, and that he was entitled to compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">After obtaining a copy of the Disclaimer in discovery, Schering-Plough moved before the trial court for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 4:46-2(c). It argued that Vitale\u2019s negligence claims were barred by the Disclaimer. The trial court denied Schering-Plough\u2019s summary judgment motion. The court reasoned that a ruling barring Vitale\u2019s claims against Schering-Plough would contravene public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The case was tried before a jury. The trial court granted Vitale\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the question of his comparative negligence. The court did not permit the jury to consider whether Vitale was negligent in descending the stairs without turning on the stairwell light, or to allocate fault to him pursuant to the Comparative Negligence Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.1 to -5.8. The jury determined that Schering-Plough was negligent and that its negligence was a proximate cause of Vitale\u2019s injuries and awarded $900,000 in compensatory damages. The trial court denied Schering-Plough\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Schering-Plough appealed. An Appellate Division panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court\u2019s judgment. Vitale v. Schering-Plough Corp., 447 N.J. Super. 98, 107, 146 A.3d 162 (App. Div. 2016). The panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Schering-Plough\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Id. at 110-18, 146 A.3d 162. It relied on the \u201cjoint employer\u201d or \u201cspecial employee\u201d doctrine, stating that in that doctrine, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act had long recognized and accommodated \u201cthe type of relationship between plaintiff, defendant, and Allied Barton.\u201d Id. at 118, 146 A.3d 162. The panel considered the Disclaimer to be a contract of adhesion that was substantively unconscionable because it was contrary to public policy. Id. at 109-15, 146 A.3d 162. It also invalidated the Disclaimer on the ground that it was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>exculpatory contract that violated public policy. Id. at 110-14, 146 A.3d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The panel, however, held that because of evidence admitted at trial that Vitale descended the stairs without turning on the stairwell light, the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider whether Vitale\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of his accident and to decide whether a percentage of fault should be allocated to him. Id. at 118-22, 146 A.3d 162. It therefore reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and remanded the matter for a new trial on the question of liability. Id. at 121, 146 A.3d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We granted Schering-Plough\u2019s petition for certification, in which Schering-Plough raised only the question of whether it was entitled to summary judgment by virtue of the Disclaimer. 228 N.J. 421, 157 A.3d 842 (2016). We denied Vitale\u2019s cross-petition for certification, in which he challenged the Appellate Division\u2019s grant of a new trial as to liability. 228 N.J. 430, 157 A.3d 847 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Schering-Plough urges the Court to reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment and enter summary judgment in its favor. It argues that because New Jersey courts routinely enforce contracts limiting an employee\u2019s rights if they are clear and unambiguous, the Disclaimer should bar Vitale\u2019s claim. Schering-Plough asserts that the Disclaimer does not adversely affect the public interest because Vitale had ample notice that his employment as a security guard for Allied Barton\u2019s customers entailed a risk of injury. It also contends that the Disclaimer is consonant with the objectives of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it preserves the remedies against the employer prescribed by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Vitale asserts that because the Disclaimer is a contract of adhesion and an exculpatory contract, it must be scrutinized to determine whether it is contrary to public policy. He argues that the Disclaimer contravenes both the deterrent objective of tort law and the protective policies of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as expressed in section 39, section 40, and other provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Amicus curiae Allied Barton contends that the Disclaimer serves the legitimate business objective of shielding Allied Barton\u2019s clients from litigation, and notes that the Disclaimer had no impact on Vitale\u2019s right to recover the benefits to which he was entitled under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Amicus curiae New Jersey Civil Justice Institute argues that because the Disclaimer protects Allied Barton\u2019s clients and ensures that Vitale receives appropriate workers\u2019 compensation benefits, it strikes an appropriate balance in the employer-employee-client business relationship. New Jersey Civil Justice Institute contends that the Disclaimer does not create a disincentive to a client company\u2019s maintenance of a safe premises because Allied Barton\u2019s clients will in any event be motivated to ensure a safe workplace for their own employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Amici curiae National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey and New Jersey Industrial Union Council assert that Vitale received no valid consideration for his execution of the Disclaimer. They contend that the Disclaimer is void as a matter of public policy because it provides no benefit that compensates the employee for the loss of his third-party claim, and it reduces the client company\u2019s incentive to maintain a safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Amicus curiae New Jersey Association for Justice notes that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial social legislation and should therefore be liberally construed. It argues that the Disclaimer violates public policy because it encourages Allied Barton\u2019s clients to perpetuate inadequate health and safety practices and affords to Allied Barton an unfair competitive advantage over companies that do not compel their employees to enter into exculpatory contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The trial court premised its denial of Schering-Plough\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its conclusion that the Disclaim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>er was contrary to public policy, and thus unenforceable. We review that legal determination de novo, affording \u201cno deference to an interpretation of law that flows from established facts.\u201d State v. Perini Corp., 221 N.J. 412, 425, 113 A.3d 1199 (2015); see also State v. Miles, 229 N.J. 83, 90, 160 A.3d 23 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The agreement at the center of this appeal is a private contract, subject to the general principle that parties \u201care afforded the liberty to bind themselves as they see fit.\u201d Stelluti v. Casapenn Enters., LLC, 203 N.J. 286, 302, 1 A.3d 678 (2010); see also Rudbart v. N. Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, 127 N.J. 344, 353, 605 A.2d 681 (1992) (\u201c[T]he basic tenet of freedom of competent parties to contract is a factor of importance.\u201d (quoting Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 386, 161 A.2d 69 (1960))). Freedom of contract is, however, \u201cnot such an immutable doctrine as to admit of no qualification.\u201d Rodriguez v. Raymours Furniture Co., 225 N.J. 343, 361, 138 A.3d 528 (2016) (quoting Henningsen, 32 N.J. at 388, 161 A.2d 69). \u201cThe right must recede \u2018to prevent its abuse, as otherwise it could be used to override all public interests.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Henningsen, 32 N.J. at 388, 161 A.2d 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In this appeal, Vitale contends that the Disclaimer is unenforceable on two closely-related grounds: that it is a contract of adhesion that is unconscionable because it offends public policy, and that it is an exculpatory contract that is contrary to public policy. We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201c[T]he essential nature of a contract of adhesion is that it is presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, commonly in a standardized printed form, without opportunity for the \u2018adhering\u2019 party to negotiate except perhaps on a few particulars.\u201d Rudbart, 127 N.J. at 353, 605 A.2d 681; accord Stelluti, 203 N.J. at 301, 1 A.3d 678. Although a contract of adhesion is not per se unenforceable, a court may decline to enforce it if it is found to be unconscionable. Stelluti, 203 N.J. at 301, 1 A.3d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>In evaluating a claim that an adhesion contract is unconscionable, courts consider four factors that \u201cfocus on procedural and substantive aspects of the contract \u2018to determine whether the contract is so oppressive, or inconsistent with the vindication of public policy, that it would be unconscionable to permit its enforcement.\u2019 \u201d Rodriguez, 225 N.J. at 367, 138 A.3d 528 (quoting Delta Funding Corp. v. Harris, 189 N.J. 28, 40, 912 A.2d 104 (2006)). Those factors are \u201cthe subject matter of the contract, the parties\u2019 relative bargaining positions, the degree of economic compulsion motivating the \u2018adhering\u2019 party, and the public interests affected by the contract.\u201d Rudbart, 127 N.J. at 356, 605 A.2d 681; accord Rodriguez, 225 N.J. at 367, 138 A.3d 528; Stelluti, 203 N.J. at 301, 1 A.3d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Vitale makes no claim on appeal that the Disclaimer is procedurally unconscionable. Vitale, 447 N.J. Super. at 111, 146 A.3d 162. Instead, relying on the fourth factor identified in Rudbart, Vitale contends that the Disclaimer is substantively unconscionable because it is contrary to public policy. Thus, in order to decide Vitale\u2019s claim that the Disclaimer is an unconscionable contract of adhesion, we determine whether the agreement comports with public policy. See Rodriguez, 225 N.J. at 367, 138 A.3d 528; Rudbart, 127 N.J. at 354-56, 605 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Exculpatory agreements \u201cviolate the aims underlying our tort law: deterrence of careless behavior and compensation by the wrongdoer for injuries sustained by victims.\u201d Marcinczyk v. State Police Training Comm\u2019n, 203 N.J. 586, 593, 5 A.3d 785 (2010). Such contracts are subjected to \u201cclose judicial scrutiny.\u201d Stelluti, 203 N.J. at 303, 1 A.3d 678. \u201c[T]o be enforceable, an exculpatory agreement must \u2018reflect the unequivocal expression of the party giving up his or her legal rights that this decision was made voluntarily, intelligently and with the full knowledge of its legal consequences.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 304-05, 1 A.3d 678 (quoting Gershon v. Regency Diving Ctr., Inc., 368 N.J. Super. 237, 247, 845 A.2d 720 (App. Div. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Our law \u201cdoes not demand a per se ban against enforcement of an exculpatory agreement based on the mere existence of a duty recognized in the common law in respect of premises liability.\u201d Stelluti, 203 N.J. at 306, 1 A.3d 678. Instead, we assess whether the contractual elimination of a common-law duty would contravene public policy. Ibid.; see also Steinberg v. Sahara Sam\u2019s Oasis, LLC, 226 N.J. 344, 369-60, 142 A.3d 742 (2016) (finding pre-injury release \u201cthat exculpates a business owner from liability for tortious conduct resulting from the violation of a duty imposed by statute or from gross negligence contrary to public policy and unenforceable\u201d); Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, 187 N.J. 323, 335, 901 A.2d 381 (2006) (declining, based on public policy reflected in parens patriae doctrine, to enforce parents\u2019 waiver of potential personal injury claims on behalf of child).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u201cTo the extent that any contract of adhesion also would require review to determine whether its enforcement implicates a matter of public interest, that test overlaps, and is subsumed by the more precise analysis employed when assessing whether to enforce an exculpatory agreement.\u201d Steiluti, 203 N.J. at 302, 1 A.3d 678. In the setting of this appeal, in which a contract of adhesion that would eliminate a legal duty is challenged exclusively on public policy grounds, the standard of substantive uncon-scionability that governs a contract of adhesion and the test by which we evaluate an exculpatory agreement converge; the sole question is whether the agreement at issue is contrary to public policy. See ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In the contrasting settings of Steiluti and Rodriguez, we considered the public-policy implications of an allegedly unconscionable contract of adhesion. Steiluti arose from an accident that occurred while the plaintiff was using exercise equipment at a health club. Id. at 294, 1 A.3d 678. In the membership agreement that the plaintiff signed when she joined the health club, she assumed all risk of the health club\u2019s negligence, and waived any right \u201cto bring a legal action against the club for personal injury or property damage.\u201d Id. at 293, 1 A.3d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We affirmed the determination of the trial court and Appellate Division that the disputed provision was enforceable to bar the negligence claim asserted by the plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that the provision was a contract of adhesion and an exculpatory agreement. Id. at 300-06, 1 A.3d 678. We reasoned that although there is a public interest in compelling a health club to maintain its facility in a safe condition, public policy does not require the imposition of liability on that club based on ordinary negligence for the recognized risk of injury that arises when an individual uses exercise equipment. Id. at 307-11, 1 A.3d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In Rodriguez, the plaintiffs employment application included a provision by which the employee \u201cagree[d] to bring any employment-related cause of action against the [defendant] employer within six months of the challenged employment action and [to] waive any statute of limitations to the contrary.\u201d 226 N.J. at 346, 138 A.3d 628. Had the agreement been enforced, that six-month limitation would have governed claims brought under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -49, which are subject to a two-year statute of limitations under Montells v. Haynes, 133 N.J. 282, 291-92, 627 A.2d 654 (1993). Id. at 356-57, 138 A.3d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">We reversed the determination of the Appellate Division, which had affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the employee\u2019s action based on the six-month limitations period prescribed by the agreement. Id. at 362-66, 138 A.3d 528.

[N.J.S.A. 34:15-40.] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In enacting section 40, the Legislature did not express a policy in favor of an employee\u2019s recovery of damages based on his or her tort claims, or otherwise address the merits of the third-party common-law claim that the statute preserves. Ibid. It sought, however, to regulate \u201cthe rights and responsibilities of the several parties concerned in compensation payments where, in the course of his employment, injury or death comes to a workman as the result of the fault of a third party.\u201d U.S. Cas. Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., 4 N.J. 157, 165, 72 A.2d 190 (1950); accord Lambert v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Am., 447 N.J. Super. 61, 73, 145 A.3d 1095 (App. Div. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u201cSection 40 permits a workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier to seek reimbursement of benefits it pays when a third[ ]party, other than the employer, caused the employee\u2019s injury.\u201d Talmadge v.

Pursuant to section 40, the Act imposes a lien in favor of the workers\u2019 compensation carrier \u201c[i]f the sum recovered by the employee or his dependents from the third person or his insurance carrier is equivalent to or greater than the liability of the employer or his insurance carrier\u201d under the Act.

Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., 189 N.J. Super. 160, 165, 459 A.2d 686 (App. Div. 1983). The Legislature envisioned that if the employee recovered damages in his or her third-party action, any award to the employee in that action would ameliorate the burden imposed on the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, thus promoting the equitable balancing of competing interests that the statutory scheme is designed to achieve. N.J.S.A. 34:15-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In section 39, the Legislature declared a public policy regarding certain agreements entered into in advance of a workplace accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">No agreement, composition, or release of damages made before the happening of any accident, except the agreement defined in section 34:16-7 of this title shall be valid or shall bar a claim for damages for the injury resulting therefrom, and any such agreement is declared to be against public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[N.J.S.A. 34:16-39.] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">That provision addressing pre-accident agreements has been a component of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act since 1913, when section 39\u2019s similarly-worded predecessor statute was enacted as an amendment to the Act. L. 1913, c. 174, \u00a7 8 (enacted as First Supplement to Compiled Statutes, p. 1651 \u00a7 23 (section 23)). The provision has been construed in several decisions to void a pre-accident agreement by which the employee purports to waive his or her right to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits authorized by the Act. See Gotkin, 2 N.J. at 308, 66 A.2d 438 (invoking section 39 to invalidate choice-of-law provision in employment agreement that would have deprived employee of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Act); Stroebel v.

Bronstein &amp; Co. v. Hoffman, 117 N.J.L. 500, 503-04, 189 A. 121 (E. &amp; A. 1936)); Miller v. Nat\u2019l Chair Co., 127 N.J.L. 414, 416-19, 22 A.2d 804 (Sup. Ct. 1941) (applying section 23 to invalidate choice-of-law provision by which employee waived protection of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act), aff'd, 129 N.J.L. 98, 28 A.2d 125 (E. &amp; A. 1942); Wallace v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 20 N.J. Misc. 224, 229, 26 A.2d 704 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1942) (\u201cIn compensation law even the signing of a release would be no bar to a meritorious consideration of petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d); Davis v. City of Newark, 19 N.J. Misc. 85, 87, 17 A.2d 305 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1941) (\u201cReleases have no legal status in a compensation case.\u201d); Castagno v. Lavine Express, 13 N.J.

Those decisions make clear that, unless authorized by N.J.S.A. 34:15-7, a pre-accident employer-employee agreement that prospectively deprives the employee of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is contrary to public policy pursuant to section 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The Legislature, however, did not restrict section 39 or its predecessor statute to the waiver of workers\u2019 compensation benefits through pre-accident agreements, as it could have by means of a simple modification of the statutory language. Instead, the Legislature chose expansive terminology in section 39. It provided that no pre-accident \u201cagreement, composition, or release of damages,\u201d other than an agreement authorized by N.J.S.A. 34:15-7, would bar a claim for \u201cdamages\u201d\u2014the same term that appears in section 40 to describe the remedy that an employee would pursue in a third-party claim. See N.J.S.A. 34:15\u201440(f). As we have frequently noted, \u201c[w]e cannot \u2018write in an additional qualification which the Legislature pointedly omitted in drafting its own enactment.\u2019 \u201d DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(2005) (quoting Craster v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 9 N.J. 225, 230, 87 A.2d 721 (1952)). We decline to do so here. We construe section 39\u2019s broad language to encompass not only pre-accident agreements waiving the employee\u2019s right to assert the statutory claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but agreements waiving the employee\u2019s right to assert a common-law action for damages against a third party based on a workplace accident, that is addressed in section 40.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Our interpretation of section 39 is consistent with a decision construing section 39\u2019s predecessor statute, section 23, shortly after the provision was enacted. In Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Co. v. Smyth, 93 N.J. Eq. 80, 82-83, 115 A. 65 (Ch. 1921), the court invalidated a pre-accident agreement between an employee and his employer, entitled \u201cAccident Release,\u201d by which the employee would have prospectively waived the right to pursue a third-party claim against a common carrier on whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>premises the employee was assigned to work. Ibid. The court noted that section 23 was \u201cgeneral in its terms, and renders invalid all such agreements or releases as that contained under the caption \u2018Accident Release.\u2019\u201d Id. at 82. Based on section 23, the court declared the disputed agreement \u201cto be against the public policy of this state.\u201d Id. at 83. No later opinion of this Court, or published opinion of the Appellate Division, has construed section 39 to apply only to agreements waiving the right to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In sum, we view sections 39 and 40 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to state public policy governing this appeal. Under section 40, the Act does not bar or limit common-law premises liability claims against potentially liable third parties, but provides for a lien on the employee\u2019s recovery that may relieve the financial burden of a compensation award on the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. N.J.S.A. 34:15\u201440(b) and (f). To ensure that the statutory scheme properly balances the interests of the employee, the employer, the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier and any potentially liable third party, the Legislature declared in section 39 that any pre-accident \u201cagreement, composition or release of damages\u201d other than that defined in N.J.S.A. 34:15-7, is contrary to public policy. N.J.S.A. 34:15-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Applying the contract principles set forth in Rudbart, Stelluti, and Rodriguez, we conclude that the Disclaimer is void because it is contrary to the public policy expressed in sections 39 and 40 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The Disclaimer, by which Vitale waived \u201cany claims arising from or related to injuries which are covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes,\u201d constitutes an \u201cagreement, composition or release of damages made before the happening of any accident.\u201d N.J.S.A. 34:15-39. It is not an agreement authorized by N.J.S.A. 34:15-7, and is therefore not within the sole exception identified in section 39. Ibid. Accordingly, the Disclaimer is in the category of employment agreements that the Legislature has declared to be \u201cagainst public policy.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Moreover, were the Disclaimer to be enforced, it would undermine the Legislature\u2019s purpose when it enacted section 40 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It would not only deprive Vitale of the opportunity to pursue a common-law action against a potentially culpable third party, but would eliminate Allied Barton\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s lien on any damages awarded to Vitale in his third-party action. The Disclaimer would disrupt the balancing of interests that the Legislature sought to achieve when it incorporated section 40 into the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Accordingly, we concur with the trial court\u2019s determination that the Disclaimer is unenforceable because it contravenes public policy. We hold that the trial court properly denied Schering-Plough\u2019s motion for summary judgment under Rule 4:46-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">We affirm as modified the judgment of the Appellate Division, and remand for a new trial on the issue of liability.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, and TIMPONE join in JUSTICE PATTERSON\u2019S opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> Section 40 defines \"third person\u201d to include \"corporations, companies, associations, societies, firms, partnerships and joint stock companies as well as individuals.\u201d N.J.S.A. 34:15-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The \u201cagreement defined in section 34:15-7 of this title\" refers to an employer and employee's \"agreement ...

Sunoco, Inc., 620 Pa. 28, 65 A.3d 901, 906-08 (2013), the only out-of-state case cited by Schering-Plough in which the court considered a provision analogous to section 39. In Bowman, the majority construed section 204(a) of Pennsylvania's Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \"to apply only to agreements to bar a claim against an employer.\u201d Id. at 908. We find persuasive the reasoning of the dissenting justice in that case, who viewed the provision to be \"absolute in its language that 'no agreement, composition or release of damages' shall preclude \u2018a claim lor damages,\u2019 and that 'any such agreement is void as against the public policy of the Commonwealth.\u201d' Id. at 911 (Baer, J., dissenting) (quoting 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 71(a)). Although Schering-Plough cites three other decisions upholding employer-employee agreements, none of those decisions applies a statutory provision analogous to section 39. See Edgin v. Entergy Operations, Inc., 331 Ark. 162, 961 S.W.2d 724, 727 (1998) (upholding a third-party liability disclaimer despite Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-9-108(a), which addresses only an employee\u2019s agreement \"to waive his or her right to compensation\"); Brown v. 1301 K St. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 31 A.3d 902, 905 (D.C. 2011) (interpreting D.C. Code \u00a7 32-1517, which voids only \"assignment, release or commutation of compensation or benefits due or payable under this chapter,\" not to govern agreements waiving third-party tort claims); Horner v. Bos. Edison Co., 45 Mass.App.Ct. 139, 695 N.E.2d 1093, 1095 (1998) (upholding employee\u2019s agreement to waive third-party claim based on Massachusetts' workers\u2019 compensation law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, \u00a7 15, which contains no provision similar to section 39).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> We do not concur with the Appellate Division panel's reliance on the \u201cjoint employer\u2019\u2019 or \u201cspecial employee\u2019\u2019 doctrine to invalidate the Disclaimer. Vitale, 447 N.J. Super, at 116-17, 146 A.3d 162. Under that doctrine, two employers may be deemed liable to an employee for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the employee is consequently barred from pursuing a common-law negligence action against either employer. Volb v. G.E. Capital Corp., 139 N.J. 110, 116-18, 651 A.2d 1002 (1995); New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Popovich, 18 N.J. 218, 225, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>113 A.2d 666 (1955). In this appeal, no party asserted before the trial court, or contends on appeal, that Schering-Plough was Vitale\u2019s \"joint employer\" for purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act, and that doctrine is accordingly irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
