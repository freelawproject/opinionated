See State v. Handy, 206 N.J. 39, 53-54, 18 A.3d 179 (2011). In this matter, a police officer pulled over a car under the belief that the vehicle was in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66 because one of the vehicle\u2019s taillights was not operational. The trial court determined that the officer was mistaken about the law and granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of the motor vehicle stop. The Appellate Division reversed. The panel determined that the relevant motor vehicle statutes were ambiguous and that, applying the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 530, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014), the officer\u2019s stop of defendant\u2019s car constituted at most an objectively reasonable mistake of law that should be treated in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>manner as a mistake of fact. Accordingly, the panel held that the officer\u2019s mistake of law did not require suppression of the motor vehicle stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We now reverse. The Appellate Division erred in concluding that the holding in Heien is applicable here. Because the motor vehicle statutes pertinent here are not ambiguous, we need not consider importing Heien into the determination of this matter. Thus, we do not address the arguments raised herein that Helen\u2019s mistake-of-law analysis is not reconcilable with our state constitutional jurisprudence. The officer\u2019s stop of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law that gave rise to constitutional reasonable suspicion; the stop was therefore unconstitutional. We remand to the Appellate Division for its consideration of the State\u2019s alternative argument, which the panel did not reach, that the stop should be sustained based on the community caretaking doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">At the suppression hearing in this matter, the following facts were adduced. Officer Michael Carletta of the Mount Olive Police Department was the sole witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">At about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of February 3, 2014, Officer Carletta was on motor vehicle patrol traveling southbound on Route 206. A Toyota Camry passed him traveling northbound. Looking in his rearview mirror, the officer observed that the northbound vehicle appeared to have a malfunctioning taillight. Although the vehicle had four taillights in total, two on each side, and although only one light on the rear passenger side was not illuminated, Officer Carletta believed that the vehicle was in violation of the motor vehicle code. He made a U-turn and began to follow the vehicle. After confirming that one of the vehicle\u2019s taillights was not illuminated, he executed a motor vehicle stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Officer Carletta testified that, in such situations, it is typical police practice to give the driver a warning rather than a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">After stopping and approaching the vehicle, Officer Carletta asked the driver, defendant Ryan Sutherland, for his driver\u2019s license, motor vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant initially stated that he did not have his driver\u2019s license with him but then quickly admitted that he did not have a valid driver\u2019s license. After obtaining defendant\u2019s name and date of birth, Officer Carletta returned to his vehicle to check defendant\u2019s information with police dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Upon confirming that defendant\u2019s license was in fact suspended, Officer Carletta issued defendant two summonses: driving with a suspended license in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-40, and failure to maintain the vehicle\u2019s \u201clamps\u201d in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Officer Carletta explained to defendant that he had been stopped because one of his taillights was not working and that he could no longer drive the vehicle because he had a suspended driver\u2019s license. The officer allowed defendant to leave the scene on the condition that his passenger drive the car to its intended destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">On June 2, 2014, defendant was charged in municipal court with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26. A Morris County grand jury later indicted defendant and charged him with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension for a second or subsequent driving-while-intoxicated conviction in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress the traffic stop and to dismiss the indictment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that the traffic stop constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>an unreasonable seizure because his vehicle had three operable taillights, in compliance with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66. The State countered that the stop was lawful because the malfunctioning taillight provided Officer Carletta with reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and because the stop was lawful under the \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function by which police officers engage in protecting public safety. Officer Carletta testified at the hearing that he had stopped the vehicle both because he believed that any malfunctioning taillight constituted a violation of the statute and because he was engaging in community caretak-ing by letting defendant know that his vehicle was not in proper working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence resulting from the motor vehicle stop, but the court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of faulty instructions provided to the grand jury. On the motor vehicle stop, the trial court agreed with defendant that Officer Carletta\u2019s understanding of the maintenance-of-lamps statute had been \u201cincorrect\u201d and that defendant had not violated the statute because he had at least one functioning taillight on each side of the vehicle. Relying heavily on State v. Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. 378, 878 A.2d 857 (App. Div. 2005), as well as an unpublished 2009 Appellate Division decision, the trial court concluded that Officer Carletta\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the law\u2014even though it was a \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d approach to interpreting the statute\u2014could not pass constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The State sought leave to appeal on the grounds that (1) Officer Carletta had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop; (2) Puzio\u2019s continuing vitality was put into question by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Heien, in which the Supreme Court held that objectively reasonable mistakes of law can provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the reasonable suspicion necessary for a constitutional stop; and (3) the stop was lawful under the community caretaking doctrine. The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal and reversed the trial court in a published opinion. State v. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. 358, 138 A.3d 551 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Relying extensively on Heien, the panel determined that \u201ceven if the officer was mistaken that the inoperable tail light constituted a Title 39 violation, he had an objectively reasonable basis for stopping defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Id. at 360, 138 A.3d 551. In reaching that conclusion, the panel questioned the continuing vitality of Puzio, which had held \u201cthat where an officer mistakenly believes that driving conduct constitutes a violation of the law, but in actuality it does not, no objectively reasonable basis exists upon which to justify a vehicle stop.\u201d Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857 (collecting cases).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The panel reasoned that Puzio had been decided before Heien and that Heien\u2019s \u201cwell-reasoned\u201d holding had cast doubt on Puzio\u2019s continuing validity. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 366-67, 138 A.3d 551. The panel went on to conclude that the statute at issue here was ambiguous and that even if Officer Carletta\u2019s interpretation of the statute was an objectively reasonable mistake of law, the stop was permissible pursuant to Heien \u201c[bjecause the Fourth Amendment tolerates objectively reasonable mistakes of law.\u201d Id. at 368-70, 138 A.3d 551. The panel\u2019s reasoning made it unnecessary to reach the State\u2019s argument about the applicability of the community caretak-ing doctrine. Id. at 371, 138 A.3d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Defendant sought leave to appeal from this Court, which we granted. 228 N.J. 246, 156 A.3d 167 (2016). We also granted the motion of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) to appear as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The parties\u2019 arguments are largely those advanced in the proceedings before the trial and appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Defendant argues that the Appellate Division\u2019s adoption of Heien is at odds with prior New Jersey precedent, which has traditionally provided greater protections under our state analogue to the Fourth Amendment than those provided by the Federal Constitution. Specifically, he argues that Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 383, 878 A.2d 857, correctly held that a traffic stop based on an incorrect interpretation of law can never be objectively reasonable. That holding, defendant argues, is a natural extension of this Court\u2019s decision in State v. Novembrino, 105 N.J. 95, 519 A.2d 820 (1987), which held that our State Constitution does not contemplate good faith mistakes by law enforcement as an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant also contends that the statutory provisions at issue here were plain and unambiguous and did not apply to his vehicle, undermining any basis for reasonable suspicion. In essence, defendant\u2019s argument challenges Officer Carletta\u2019s interpretation of those provisions as not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The State argues that the Appellate Division correctly held that Officer Carletta\u2019s belief that defendant was in violation of the motor vehicle code was objectively reasonable and provided him with reasonable suspicion to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle. Relying on Heien, the State posits that just as we have held that reasonable mistakes of fact can pass constitutional scrutiny, so too should we hold that reasonable mistakes of law do not run afoul of our constitution. Such a result is not inconsistent with Puzio, the State argues, because Puzio involved an objectively unreasonable mistake of law, whereas here, Officer Carletta was forced to interpret a confusing and outdated set of statutes ambiguous enough to be open to differing and equally reasonable interpretations. Additionally, the State maintains that it preserved its argument that Officer Carletta had lawful authority to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle based on the community caretaking doctrine, which provides police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>with the power to ensure the safety and welfare of the public independent of their law enforcement objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Amicus curiae ACLU-NJ argues that the statutes at issue here are not ambiguous and that the rule of lenity requires strict construction of those statutes in defendant\u2019s favor. ACLU-NJ further argues that a stop based on a police officer\u2019s misunderstanding or ignorance of the law can and should be differentiated from mistakes of fact, and that such ignorance or misunderstanding of the law must always be unreasonable and thus unconstitutional under our Article I, Paragraph 7 jurisprudence. Like defendant, ACLU-NJ maintains that that conclusion flows naturally from state constitutional case law, most specifically from Novem-brino. Heien, the ACLU-NJ argues, is inconsistent with that jurisprudence and thus should not be adopted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Under previous case law in this state, a police officer\u2019s objectively reasonable mistake of fact does not render a search or arrest unconstitutional. Consistent with federal jurisprudence, we have held that Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution provides \u201croom ... for some mistakes [by police].\u201d Handy, 206 N.J. at 54, 18 A.3d 179 (second alteration in original) (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990)). However, that principle applies only when \u201cthe police ... behave[ ] reasonably.\u201d Ibid.; see also State v. Green, 318 N.J. Super. 346, 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012 (App. Div. 1999) (holding reasonable but mistaken belief leading to arrest did not warrant suppression).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">In Handy, a police dispatcher, erroneously relying on a record of a warrant containing a name and date of birth that did not match the defendant\u2019s reported information, advised a police officer to execute that warrant without taking necessary steps to clarify discrepancies. 206 N.J. at 41-42, 18 A.3d 179. Our Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>concluded that the dispatcher\u2019s conduct was not objectively reasonable. Id. at 54, 18 A.3d 179. Therefore, we determined that the arrest violated the defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights, and we suppressed the evidence found during the search incident to the arrest. Id. at 42, 18 A.3d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The facts in Handy led us to a different conclusion than the mistake of fact in State v. Green, in which the error was determined to be objectively reasonable. In Green, which we cited approvingly in Handy, the Appellate Division upheld an arrest and search of defendant Green, where Green closely matched the description of another man named Lovett\u2014for whom the warrant was issued\u2014and where the police encountered Green outside Lovett\u2019s residence. Green, 318 N.J. Super. at 352-53, 723 A.2d 1012. In those circumstances the Appellate Division rightly concluded that the arrest was premised on an objectively reasonable mistake of fact and was thus lawful. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Until the Appellate Division decision in this case, the jurisprudence of our state appellate courts had not held that reasonable mistakes of law would pass constitutional muster. In fact, courts had reached the opposite conclusion. See Puzio, 379 N.J. Super. at 382-83, 878 A.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In Puzio, an officer stopped a moving vehicle with commercial license plates, believing the driver was operating it in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:4-46(a) because the vehicle had no placard on the right side of the vehicle displaying the name and address of its business. Id. at 380, 878 A.2d 857. The Appellate Division determined as a matter of law that the stop was in error because the statute relied on by the officer plainly excluded \u201cpassenger vehicles,\u201d like the one driven by the defendant, from the \u201cplacard\u201d requirement. Id. at 382-84, 878 A.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Importantly, the Puzio decision noted \u201ca clear distinction between the present situation and those presented in cases where the officer correctly understands the statute but arguably misinterprets the facts concerning whether a vehicle, or operator, has violated the statute.\u201d Id. at 382, 878 A.2d 857. In explaining its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>reasoning, the panel stated that \u201c[i]f officers were permitted to stop vehicles where it is objectively determined that there is no legal basis for their action, \u2018the potential for abuse of traffic infractions as pretext for effecting stops seems boundless and the costs to privacy rights excessive.\u2019\u201d Id. at 384, 878 A.2d 857 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Valdez, 178 F.3d 282, 289 (5th Cir. 1999)). The panel also viewed the creation of an exception for a mistake of law as inconsistent with the exclusionary rule because \u201cit would remove the incentive for police to make certain that they properly understand the law that they are entrusted to enforce and obey.\u201d Ibid. (quoting United States v. Lopez-Soto, 205 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Another mistake-of-fact case\u2014the State\u2019s assertions to the contrary notwithstanding\u2014is State v. Williamson, 138 N.J. 302, 650 A.2d 348 (1994). Williamson dealt with a police officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that a motorist had \u201caffected traffic\u201d so as to be in violation of the motor vehicle code by failing to use a turn signal. Id. at 303-04, 650 A.2d 348. The officer was required to make a judgment that involved interpreting facts, namely whether the motorist had actually affected traffic; there was no mistake about what the law meant. See id. at 304, 650 A.2d 348. We held that \u201cthe State need prove only that the police lawfully stopped the car, not that it could convict the driver of the motor-vehicle offense.\u201d Ibid. At its core, Williamson involved a factual dispute: whether the officer could have an objectively reasonable belief, even if mistaken, that the defendant\u2019s driving behavior \u201caffected traffic,\u201d to justify the stop. See also State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. 463, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (noting that State is not required to prove that motor vehicle violation occurred in order to meet standard of reasonable suspicion).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Thus, at the time of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision here, neither this Court nor the Appellate Division had authorized reliance on a reasonable but mistaken understanding of the law to support a search or arrest. In the appellate judgment under review, the panel relied on, as persuasive, the intervening decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the United States Supreme Court in Heien to support its holding. We turn therefore to that decision in setting forth the background to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In Heien, the United States Supreme Court considered a police officer\u2019s reasonable but erroneous interpretation of a motor vehicle statute. In that case, a North Carolina Sheriffs Officer observed a vehicle traveling along the highway with a malfunctioning brake light. Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 534. Believing the faulty brake light to be in violation of the state\u2019s motor vehicle code, the officer executed a traffic stop. Ibid. During the stop, the officer received permission to search the vehicle and discovered illegal drugs in a duffel bag. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The defendant sought to suppress the evidence uncovered during the search, contending that the stop had violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 535. The trial court denied the suppression motion, but the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the initial stop was invalid \u201cbecause driving with only one working brake light was not actually a violation of North Carolina law.\u201d Ibid. The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officer\u2019s interpretation of the motor vehicle code\u2014even if incorrect\u2014was not unreasonable and thus not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari. Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s majority opinion noted that \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u201d Id. at 536 (quoting Riley v. California, 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2482, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014)). After explaining that \u201c[t]o be reasonable is not to be perfect,\u201d and that the Fourth Amendment allows for reasonable mistakes of fact, the Chief Justice went on to explain that the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry applies to mistakes of law just as it applies to mistakes of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>[Reasonable men make mistakes of law, too, and such mistakes are no less compatible with the concept of reasonable suspicion [than mistakes of fact]. Reasonable suspicion arises from the combination of an officer\u2019s understanding of the facts and his understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be reasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts turn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out to be not what was thought, the result is the same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason, under the text of the Fourth Amendment or our precedents, why this same result should be acceptable when reached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not when reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">[Ibid.l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Based on the language of the North Carolina statute involved in Heien, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the officer\u2019s error of law was reasonable and thus provided the officer with reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. Id. at 540. Importantly, Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Ginsburg, wrote a concurrence that has garnered support with states that have chosen to follow the Heien approach in their own search and seizure analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Justice Kagan\u2019s concurrence contained several important caveats, Critical to her agreement with the majority was her belief that erroneous interpretations of the law will pass Fourth Amendment scrutiny only when the law at issue is \u201c \u2018so doubtful in construction\u2019 that a reasonable judge could agree with the officer\u2019s view.\u201d Id. at 541 (Kagan, J., concurring) (quoting The Friendship, 9 F. Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125) (C.C.D. Mass. 1812)). Thus, \u201c[i]f the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer\u2019s judgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not, not.\u201d Ibid. Such cases must necessarily involve a \u201creally difficult\u201d or \u201cvery hard question of statutory interpretation\u201d and will thus be \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">A number of states have subsequently adopted Helen\u2019s holding. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo v. State, 335 Ga.App. 788, 783 S.E.2d 150, 153 n.12 (2016) (dicta); Williams v. State, 28 N.E.3d 293, 294-95 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015); People v. Guthrie, 25 N.Y.3d 130, 30 N.E.3d 880, 886-88 (2015); State v. Hirschkorn, 881 N.W.2d 244, 248-49 (N.D. 2016); State v. Lerma, 884 N.W.2d 749, 750-53 (S.D. 2016). However, some of those states had already developed a jurisprudence prior to Heien allowing for reasonable mistakes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>law on the part of police officers. See, e.g., Sevilla-Carcamo, 783 S.E.2d at 153 n.12 (noting that Heien is in accord with established Georgia case law); State v. Wright, 791 N.W.2d 791, 796-99 (S.D. 2010) (suggesting that objectively reasonable mistake of law can provide basis for constitutional traffic stop).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Importantly, however, a number of states have either followed or acknowledged Justice Kagan\u2019s narrow interpretation of an objectively reasonable mistake of law when deciding similar issues under the rubric of Helen\u2019s analysis. See State v. Stoll, 239 Ariz. 292, 370 P.3d 1130, 1134 (App. 2016) (citing Justice Kagan\u2019s concurrence for proposition that statute must be \u201cgenuinely ambiguous\u201d and require \u201chard interpretive work\u201d to find that officer has made reasonable mistake); People v. Gaytan, 392 Ill.Dec. 333, 32 N.E.3d 641, 652 (2015) (same); State v. Eldridge, 790 S.E.2d 740, 743-44 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016) (same); State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433, 441 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan\u2019s indication that \u201cthe bar is high in cases in which a stop is predicated on a mistake of law\u201d); State v. Houghton, 364 Wis.2d 234, 868 N.W.2d 143, 158-60 (2015) (noting Justice Kagan\u2019s view that objectively reasonable mistakes of law will be \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d); see also State v. Dopslaf, 356 P.3d 559, 563-64 (N.M. Ct. App. 2015) (citing Justice Kagan\u2019s concurrence as support for proposition that police officer\u2019s potential mistake of law was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In this state, we have had only one prior occasion to consider Heien; that opportunity presented itself in State v. Scriven, 226 N.J. 20, 140 A.3d 535 (2016). However, we ultimately did not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the question of whether to adopt Heien and find that an objectively reasonable mistake of law could support reasonable suspicion for a constitutional police stop. Id. at 36, 140 A.3d 535. Instead, we held that the officer\u2019s mistake of law in that case was not objectively reasonable, see ibid., and thus did not qualify as the type of \u201crare\u201d case that involves an objectively reasonable mistake of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">With that background in mind, we turn to the motor vehicle statutes that, the State contends, give rise to an objectively reasonable mistake of law in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Defendant\u2019s traffic stop was premised on perceived violations of two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">N.J.S.A. 39:3\u201461(a), relating to the types of \u201clamps and reflectors\u201d required on certain motor vehicles, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnLt\">Every motor vehicle other than a motor cycle and other than a motor-drawn vehicle shall be equipped on the front with at least two headlamps, an equal number at each side, and with two turn signals, one on each side; and on the rear with two tail lamps, two or more stop lamps, as prescribed by section 2 of L. 2013, c. 230 ([N.J.S.A.] 39:3-06.3), two turn signals, and two reflectors, one of each at each side; except that a passenger vehicle manufactured before July 2, 1964, and registered in this State may be equipped with one stop lamp, one reflector, and one tail lamp and is not required to be equipped with turn signals. [ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">N.J.S.A. 39:3-66, which specifies the proper maintenance of such lamps and reflectors, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">All lamps, reflectors and other illuminating devices required by this article shall be kept clean and in good working order and, as far as practicable, shall be mounted in such a manner as to reduce the likelihood of their being obscured by mud or dust thrown up by the wheels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">When interpreting a statute we look first, and foremost, to its actual language and ascribe to its words their ordinary meaning. Mason v. City of Hoboken, 196 N.J. 51, 68, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008) (citing DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)). \u201cIf in ascribing to those words their \u2018ordinary meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and significance,\u2019 the Legislators\u2019 intent is self-evident, we need not search further for guidance.\u201d Simon v. Cronecker, 189 N.J. 304, 332, 915 A.2d 489 (2007) (quoting DiProspero, 183 N.J. at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The statutes read together require that a motor vehicle only have two working rear lamps, with at least one working lamp on each side. See N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a); N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Additionally, N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 mandates that the lamps \u201crequired by this article\u201d must be kept in good working order. Thus, if there is only the minimum one taillight on each side of a vehicle and either of those taillights is not working, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle and issue a citation for failure to maintain lamps. When a vehicle has more than the minimum of two rear taillights, for example the vehicle has two taillights on each side, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle when one side\u2019s taillights are both out, even though the vehicle has two or more taillights illuminated on the other side. In other words, the statutes require one working taillight on each side of a vehicle. Thus, if a vehicle has two taillights on each side of the vehicle\u2014more than the law requires\u2014and one of those multiple taillights on one side is not working, a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66, as was assumed and charged here, has not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We find the language unambiguous and therefore need not resort to legislative history. Were that history to be examined on the relevant question, we would note, as the State points out, that the Legislature did at one point begin consideration of an amendment; that amendment would have worked a different interpretation of existing law as we read it, and as it was applied in a prior unpublished decision that received legislative attention. As originally introduced at the outset of the 2012 Legislative Session, Assembly Bill 354 would have amended N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 and N.J.S.A. 39:3-61 to establish that \u201can equipment violation [will be found] if any lighting device installed on a vehicle is not in working order.\u201d Those proposed amendments were never adopted by the Legislature, as the Appellate Division noted in its opinion. Suther<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>land, 445 N.J. Super. at 367 n.3, 138 A.3d 551. We do not ascribe much weight to legislative inaction but note merely that there has been no legislation to alter prior application of the pertinent statutes. Cf. State v. Smith, 197 N.J. 325, 335, 963 A.2d 281 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Finally, we reject the argument that N.J.S.A. 39:3-18, which addresses visibility specifications for vehicle lights, can inject ambiguity into the clear wording of the statutes at issue here. Nor does the permissive repair provision in N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(1)\u2014which does not have applicability in the present situation or in most modern malfunctioning-taillight circumstances\u2014convert the interpretative question before us into one that rises to the level of difficulty envisioned as the \u201crare\u201d case of an objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the law. See Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 541 (noting that such cases must necessarily involve \u201cvery hard question[s] of statutory interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Putting the statutes in question to rigorous analysis, we fail to find them unclear, as the State suggests. We find that the officer\u2019s erroneous application of the functioning taillight requirement was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law. This case does not present a basis for considering the application of Heien and the Appellate Division erred in reaching that determination based on the error here. Simply put, this was not a good stop. Even Heien could not save it, were we ever to consider adopting such an approach for the truly rare case that rose to the level of an objectively reasonable mistake of law. But this was not that case. The judgment of the Appellate Division, premised on an application of Heien to the stop in this matter, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">That, however, does not end the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The State also asserted community caretaking as an alternative basis to support the stop. It is a rule that allows police officers to conduct warrantless searches where necessary to \u201cpreserve life or property.\u201d State v. Edmonds, 211 N.J. 117, 141-42, 47 A.3d 737 (2012) (summarizing community caretaking rule). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>rationale for the community caretaking rule is that searches made pursuant to the rule are \u201cdivorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d Id. at 142, 47 A.3d 737 (quoting Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">That doctrine was raised at the suppression hearing and there was testimony from the officer on the point. Although raised on appeal, the Appellate Division did not reach the argument in light of the manner in which it resolved the case. Accordingly, a remand is appropriate to allow the Appellate Division to address the unresolved argument advanced by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. We remand the matter for further proceedings in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON, AND TIMPONE join in JUSTICE LaVECCHIA\u2019s opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\"> The Appellate Division opinion treats defendant as having filed two separate motions: a motion to suppress the stop and a motion to dismiss the indictment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>However, it appears from the record that defendant filed one motion to dismiss the indictment for two discrete reasons: (1) because the charge resulted from an unconstitutional stop; and (2) because the prosecutor gave improper instructions to the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\"> The panel below also disagreed with the holding in the unpublished decision referenced by the trial court, which, the panel noted, is unpublished and thus does not constitute precedential authority. Sutherland, 445 N.J. Super. at 365, 138 A.3d 551.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> Some states have changed their views entirely in light of Heien. Compare Williams, 28 N.E.3d at 293-95 (Indiana Court of Appeals reversing on rehearing and following Heien's holding that reasonable mistakes of law can provide reasonable suspicion for traffic stop), with Gunn v. State, 956 N.E.2d 136, 141 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (noting party's acknowledgement of \u201cIndiana decisions determining that an officer's mistake of law can never be reasonable\u2019\u2019); see also Guthrie, 30 N.E.3d at 885 (noting prior appellate precedent in New York that \"mistake of law cannot justify a traffic stop\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
