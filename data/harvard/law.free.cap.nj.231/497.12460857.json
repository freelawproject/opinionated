After doing so, we must apply that standard to the facts of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">We conclude that the proper standard of appellate review is whether the trial court abused its discretion by relying on an impermissible basis, by relying upon irrelevant or inappropriate factors, by failing to consider all relevant factors, or by making a clear error in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Here, we affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to detain defendant. We do so because the trial court relied on inappropriate factors and failed to consider all relevant factors in finding that there was sufficient evidence before the court to overcome the presumption of defendant\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The facts and procedural history are culled from the record of defendant\u2019s detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In March 2017, law enforcement obtained an arrest warrant for defendant S.N.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for acts alleged to have been committed against his stepdaughter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in 2012. In a complaint-warrant, the State charged defendant with first-degree aggravated sexual assault on a person under the age of thirteen, N.J.S.A. 2C:14\u20142(a)(1); fourth-degree lewdness, N.J.S.A. 2C:14\u20144(b)(1); and second-degree child endangerment, N.J.S.A. 2C:24^(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The affidavit of probable cause in support of the complaint-warrant stated that the victim told a staff member at her school that defendant came into her bedroom and sexually assaulted her approximately fifty times while she was in the sixth and seventh grades. The affidavit also disclosed that, in 2015, the victim told a friend that defendant had \u201ctouched her in a sexual manner.\u201d In addition, the State prepared a preliminary law enforcement incident report (PLEIR), which stated that \u201cdefendant was known to the victim as [f]amily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Following defendant\u2019s arrest, a pretrial services officer prepared a Public Safety Assessment (PSA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that rated defendant a 1 out of 6\u2014the lowest possible risk score\u2014for both failure to appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and new criminal activity. The PSA noted that defendant did not have any prior criminal history or failures to appear, but the current charges pending against defendant stemmed from a violent offense. Despite the low risk scores, the PSA concluded \u201cNo Release Recommended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The State moved for pretrial detention, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A: 162-19. In support of its pretrial detention motion, the prosecution certified that the charged crime could subject defendant to \u201can ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there is a \u201cserious risk\u201d that \u201cdefendant will not appear in court,\u201d and \u201cdefendant will pose a danger to any other person or the community.\u201d In addition, the certification stated, \u201c[(defendant\u2019s victim is his step-daughter. Defendant is a risk to harm and intimidate his victim and her mother and to obstruct justice by interfering with the investigation and witnesses. Defendant is a risk of flight because his biological mother and sister live in Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">At the detention hearing, the State submitted the affidavit of probable cause in support of the complaint-warrant, the PLEIR,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the PSA. The prosecutor claimed that the PSA did not take into account defendant\u2019s dual citizenship or the risk to the victim because \u201c[defendant] knows where she lives. He knows where her mother lives. And the fear is that if he\u2019s released, he will harm them physically.\u201d Regarding the potential for obstruction, the prosecutor stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">[t]hese sorts of cases are sensitive in the sense that if a defendant has access to the victim or other family members, we know\u2014and it\u2019s common sense\u2014that the defendant often tries to obstruct justice by trying to convince family members and other people in the family to say it didn't happen, or put pressure on the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The State also sought a restraining order to prohibit defendant from having contact with the victim, her mother, and his three biological children (the victim\u2019s half-siblings).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Defense counsel countered that the State did not present clear and convincing evidence to support its detention motion, and that the State\u2019s arguments were based on \u201cmere speculation.\u201d Defense counsel further noted that defendant had no prior record, including no disorderly persons offenses, had no failures to appear, was gainfully employed, and had the support of his adoptive parents, who live in New Jersey. Regarding defendant\u2019s biological mother in Canada, defense counsel stated defendant has not had \u201ctelephonic or face-to-face contact with her\u201d and defendant \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know where she lives.\u201d Counsel noted that defendant\u2019s biological mother had visited New Jersey \u201cmore than a decade ago,\u201d but it \u201cended in [defendant\u2019s] getting a restraining order against her, [and] her being physically removed from his house by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Further, defense counsel claimed that defendant lived in the same home as the victim \u201cuntil a couple of years ago\u201d and that \u201cno further problems apparently ... have been even alleged.\u201d Defense counsel also asserted that defendant is involved in the lives of his three biological children and has had \u201cconstant contact\u201d with them despite no longer living in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The trial court issued an oral ruling at the end of the detention hearing granting the State\u2019s motion for pretrial detention and the restraining order. The court found that the State had established probable cause that defendant committed the charged offenses. In making the pretrial detention determination, the judge reviewed the circumstances of the charged offenses, the potential sentence if convicted, defendant\u2019s risk of flight in light of his dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship, and the potential for defendant\u2019s obstruction of the criminal justice process \u201c[b]ased on the fact that this is essentially a he said, she said situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The court gave great weight to \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any other person or community that would be posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>by the defendant\u2019s release.\u201d Also, the court specifically found that defendant is eligible for detention under the statute \u201cbecause this is a first degree [offense] with No Early Release attaching to it pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:162\u201419(a)(1).\u201d The court summarized its detention decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Based on the factors I've outlined, the Court does find that the nature and circumstances should be given great weight, as well as the flight risk due to dual citizenship. Also, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, as well as the fact that\u2014and/or the defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">In making my decision today I've given great weight to NERA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the fact that this is a NERA offense and first degree, the dual citizenship, due to the extensive] exposure of incarceration if convicted, the fact that release was not recommended, and the fact that this is considered a violent offense. Therefore, based on all of the above the Court will grant the State's motion and pretrial detention will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In \u201c[t]he history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d section of the pretrial detention order, the court wrote, \u201c[r]isk of flight\u2014 family in Canada, no prior record, dual citizenship, employed. Resident of NJ.\u201d Under \u201c[t]he nature and seriousness of the danger to any other person or the community that would be posed by the defendant\u2019s release,\u201d the court wrote that the alleged crime was a first-degree aggravated sexual assault and further noted \u201cNERA.\u201d Regarding the risk of obstruction, the court wrote \u201cpotential to intimidate.\u201d The court also listed \u201cFurther Reasons for Pretrial Detention\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">- NERA offense\u2014[first degree]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">- [D]ual citizenship creates a high risk of flight due to the extensive exposure to incarceration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">- Release not recommended</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">- Violent offense</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">Pursuant to Rule 2:9-13, defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s pretrial detention order, and the Appellate Division reversed and released defendant with conditions. The panel, citing State v. C.W., 449 N.J. Super. 231, 156 A.3d 1088 (App. Div. 2017), found that \u201c[t]he trial court abused its discretion by not considering defendant\u2019s age, level of prior criminal involvement and ties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the community.\u201d The Appellate Division required as part of defendant\u2019s release that \u201cdefendant must report to pretrial detention as frequently as necessary to determine his compliance with restraining orders prohibiting him from having any contact with the victim or her family .... [and] must surrender his passport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">This Court granted the State\u2019s emergent motion for leave to appeal and for a stay of the Appellate Division\u2019s order to release defendant on conditions. 230 N.J. 349, 350, 167 A.3d 644 (2017). We granted leave to appear as amicus curiae to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU), the Office of the Public Defender (OPD), and the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey (CPANJ). Following oral argument, we lifted the stay, allowed defendant\u2019s release, and directed that \u201cthe trial court may enforce the Appellate Division\u2019s order reversing the order for defendant\u2019s pretrial detention, including establishing the schedule for defendant to report \u2018as necessary to determine his compliance with restraining orders.\u2019\u201d 230 N.J. 585, 170 A.3d 932 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We summarize the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The State urges this Court to adopt an abuse of discretion standard and claims that the appellate panel essentially reviewed the detention decision de novo, substituting its own judgment for that of the trial court. The State further contends that the Appellate Division compounded its error by imposing conditions of release without a remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">The State asserts that, in its detention order, the trial judge highlighted facts that pertain \u201cto every subcategory of N.J.S.A. 2A: 162-20, which is merely a permissive list of factors a court may consider\u201d and, therefore, the trial court did not fail to consider any relevant factors, and did not err in ordering pretrial detention. The State posits that \u201c[t]he PSA is only a starting point\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the court \u201cproperly gave great weight to the nature and circumstances of the offense charged\u201d and properly \u201cconsidered the risk that defendant would contact the victim ... and that defendant knows how to contact the victim as she is [his] stepdaughter.\u201d The State also notes that the court was permitted to consider defendant\u2019s dual citizenship as an indication of an enhanced flight risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Lastly, the State, citing C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 231, 156 A.3d 1088, asserts that the panel was required to identify factors that the trial court should have considered and then remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Noting that a majority of circuit courts have adopted a standard of independent review, defendant urges the Court to reject a more deferential standard and to adopt a standard that \u201ccalls for independent review, while according deference to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings that are clearly and convincingly supported by the evidence presented by the prosecutor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Defendant asserts that \u201c[t]here is a significant difference between the nature of the liberty interest involved for a defendant between seeking a review of an order setting unreasonable release conditions ... and an order denying release under any conditions.\u201d The latter type of review is at issue in this case; it \u201cnecessarily requires an independent review\u201d of the evidence to determine whether that evidence clearly and convincingly supports the State\u2019s motion for pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Regardless of which standard the Court adopts\u2014abuse of discretion or independent review with deference\u2014defendant argues that the panel was correct to reverse the trial court\u2019s order of detention because the State failed to produce clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of pretrial release. Defendant claims the State offered \u201clittle more than its boilerplate recitation\u201d that defendant posed a risk of flight and of obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The amici all urge the Court to adopt an abuse of discretion standard. The ACLU and the OPD assert that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering detention. Conversely, the CPANJ asserts that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The ACLU argues that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion by considering inappropriate factors, by failing to consider necessary factors and by engaging in a clear error of judgment.\u201d The ACLU notes that defendant is an United States citizen, that his dual citizenship alone is not probative of risk of flight, and that \u201cthere is no evidence, other than [defendant\u2019s relationship to the complaining witness, to suggest he would interfere in the investigation or prosecution of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The ACLU asserts that the court incorrectly held the fact that the case \u201cis essentially a he said, she said situation\u201d against defendant because \u201ca defendant should not be deemed to be higher risk because there is less evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The ACLU also claims that the trial court failed to consider necessary factors such as defendant\u2019s employment, ties to the State of New Jersey, age, and lack of a criminal record. The ACLU therefore contends that the court abused its discretion by failing to consider factors that would make it more likely that defendant would appear in court when required.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The OPD makes similar arguments. It contends that the trial court failed to make an individualized risk assessment by failing to consider defendant\u2019s age, employment, residence, and lack of criminal record. The OPD further argues defendant \u201creceived the lowest PSA scores, had no violence flag,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was gainfully employed, had absolutely no criminal history, and had strong family ties in New Jersey.\u201d According to the OPD, the court also \u201cinappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ately considered the defendant\u2019s dual citizenship and familiarity with the complaining witness as evidence of risk of flight and obstruction when neither fact establishes an actual risk that the defendant would engage in such future conduct.\u201d Additionally, the OPD argues that the court did not provide any statement to support its finding that defendant posed a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The OPD claims that the trial court ordered defendant detained pretrial based solely on the charged crime, even though first-degree sexual assault is not one of the enumerated offenses that the Legislature identified in the CJRA. The OPD reaches this conclusion \u201c[b]ecause the only other reasons put forward\u2014that [defendant] has dual citizenship and knows the victim\u2014even if properly considered, could not be sufficient to overcome a presumption of release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The CPANJ similarly asks this Court to confirm \u201cthat the appropriate appellate standard of review in pretrial detention cases is abuse of discretion, with de novo review only appropriate when the pretrial detention hearing court has misapplied the law.\u201d According to the CPANJ, this standard comports with the purpose of the CJRA and \u201cthe historical standards of review for pretrial and post-conviction decisions.\u201d The CPANJ claims that, before the CJRA, appellate courts reviewed bail determinations for abuse of discretion, and \u201c[t]here is no legal or public policy reason to disturb a legal standard that advances the efficient administration of pretrial justice and appropriate risk management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Finally, according to the CPANJ, assuming the judge abused her discretion, the panel should have remanded the case \u201cfor consideration in light of the appellate court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Our initial task is to determine the scope of appellate review of pretrial detention decisions made by the trial court under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>CJRA. Although this is the first time this Court has confronted the issue, guidance is provided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McLane Co. v. EEOC, 581 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1159, 197 L.Ed.2d 500 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In McLane, the Supreme Court employed a two-part test to determine the appropriate standard of appellate review in the absence of an \u201cexplicit statutory command.\u201d 137 S.Ct. at 1166-67. In Pierce v. Underwood, a case involving the award of counsel fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), the Court provided an example of what would qualify as a \u201crelatively explicit statutory command\u201d that would reveal \u201cthe standard of appellate review\u201d: \u201c[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 487 U.S. 552, 558, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (alterations in original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988). Absent such a command, a court first must \u201cask whether the \u2018history of appellate practice\u2019 yields an answer. Second, at least where \u2018neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition exists,\u2019 we ask whether, \u2018as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.\u2019 \u201d McLane, 137 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 558-60, 108 S.Ct. 2541).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">To determine whether there is a \u201cclear statutory prescription\u201d in favor of a particular review standard, we look to the text of the CJRA. We note that the CJRA does not specify a standard of review, unlike the example furnished in Pierce. That does not mean, however, that the statute cannot provide guidance as to the appropriate level of review. Indeed, although the United States Supreme Court did not find an \u201cexplicit statutory command\u201d in the legislation at issue in Pierce, it found the use of permissive language highly significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">We turn first to the language and structure of the governing statute. It provides that attorney\u2019s fees shall be awarded \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>United States was substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). This formulation, as opposed to simply \"unless the position of the United States was substantially justified,\u201d emphasizes the fact that the determination is for the district court to make, and thus suggests some deference to the district court upon appeal. That inference is not compelled, but certainly available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[Pierce, 487 U.S. at 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We therefore review the applicable provisions of the CJRA. We do so in the context of the statutory requirement that the CJRA \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of primarily relying upon pretrial release by non-monetary means to reasonably assure\u201d that a defendant will \u201cappearf ] in court when required,\u201d will not endanger \u201cthe safety of any other person or the community,\u201d and \u201cwill not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The CJRA provides that, \u201cfollowing the issuance of a complaint-warrant,\u201d as occurred in this case, a defendant \u201cshall be temporarily detained to allow the Pretrial Services Program to prepare a risk assessment with recommendations on conditions of release.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A:162-16(a); see also N.J.S.A. 2A:162-25. Thereafter, the CJRA authorizes trial courts, \u201cupon motion of a prosecutor,\u201d to order a defendant detained pretrial \u201cwhen it finds clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the effectuation of [the] goals\u201d of safeguarding against danger, flight, and obstruction. N.J.S.A. 2A: 162-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">When considering a prosecutor\u2019s detention motion, trial courts must consider the risk assessment and recommendations and \u201cshall make a pretrial release decision\u201d within forty-eight hours of the \u201cdefendant\u2019s commitment to jail.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A: 162\u201416(b)( 1). To make that decision, the \u201ccourt shall hold a hearing to determine whether any amount of monetary bail or non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions ... will reasonably assure\u201d that the three goals set forth above are met. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-19(e). If, as in this case, the prosecutor moves for detention where there is no indictment, the prosecutor must first establish at the hearing that probable cause exists that the defendant committed the charged offense. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>19(e)(2). Unless the defendant is charged with murder or a crime for which he would be subject to an ordinary or extended life term, N.J.S.A. 2A:162-19(b), the CJRA imposes a presumption against pretrial detention, N.J.S.A. 2A: 162\u201418(b); R. 3:4A(b)(5). The State can rebut that presumption of release only by presenting \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A: 162\u201418(a)(1); see also R. 3:4A(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At a pretrial detention hearing, the defendant has the right \u201cto testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A:162\u201419(e)(1). The State need not present a live witness at a detention hearing, State v. Ingram, 230 N.J. 190, 213, 165 A.3d 797 (2017), but it has the option to do so. Additionally, \u201cthe trial court has discretion to require direct testimony if it is dissatisfied with the State\u2019s proffer.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">At the hearing, the court \u201cmay take into account\u201d various factors, including \u201c[t]he nature and circumstances of the [charged] offense\u201d; the weight of the evidence proffered against the defendant; characteristics of the defendant as he or she stands before the court, including his or her employment status, familial ties, and length of residence in the community; \u201c[t]he nature and seriousness of the danger\u201d that would be posed to other persons or the community if the defendant were released; the risk that the defendant will obstruct the criminal justice process; and the PSA recommendation. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">If the court orders pretrial detention, it shall \u201cinclude written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A:162\u201421(a)(1); see also R. 3:4A(c). A defendant may appeal a pretrial detention order as of right, pursuant to court rules. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-18(c); see also R. 2:9\u201413(a). Because the defendant remains detained pending appeal, the court shall hear the defendant\u2019s appeal in an expedited manner. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-18(c); R. 2:9\u201413(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Although the CJRA does not explicitly set forth the appropriate scope of appellate review of trial court detention decisions, its language supports that the proper standard of appellate review is abuse of discretion. First, the Legislature used both \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in various provisions of the CJRA. See generally N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 to -26. \u201cWhere a statutory provision contains both the words \u2018may1 and \u2018shall,\u2019 it is presumed that the lawmaker intended to distinguish between them, \u2018shall\u2019 being construed as mandatory and \u2018may\u2019 as permissive.\u201d Aponte-Correa v. Allstate Ins. Co., 162 N.J. 318, 325, 744 A.2d 175 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Under the CJRA, \u201cthe court may take into account\u201d certain information. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-20 (emphasis added). If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release will be sufficient, \u201cthe court may order, before trial, the detention of an eligible defendant.\u201d N.J.S.A, 2A:162-18(a)(l) (emphasis added). By contrast, the trial court must provide a written statement of reasons if it orders detention. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-21(a)(1). The pointed use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in those provisions establishes the trial court\u2019s significant discretion in making pretrial detention decisions and suggests that deferential review is appropriate. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Nevertheless, because the statutory language is not sufficiently explicit to dispose of the question here, we apply the two-part McLane test.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Turning to the first inquiry under that test, we find further support for the abuse of discretion standard in \u201cthe history of appellate practice.\u201d McLane, 137 S.Ct. at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Since the 1800s, appellate courts have acknowledged that bail determinations were discretionary and not readily reviewable by appellate courts. See Parsell v. State, 30 N.J.L. 530, 546 (1863) (finding that \u201cthe law confides \u2018the exclusive order and directions in such cases [ (referring to discharging bail, &amp;c.,) ] to the legal discretion and judgment of the court having jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>subject matter; and courts of error will not deem themselves at liberty to review the same\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Wright v. Green, 11 N.J.L. 334, 337 (Sup. Ct. 1830) (involving trial court\u2019s decision to set aside amercement and discharge debtor))).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">As a result, over many deeades, appellate courts have reviewed many bail determinations for abuse of discretion. See State v. Fajardo-Santos, 199 N.J. 520, 531, 533-34, 973 A.2d 933 (2009) (stating that a trial court \u201cengage[s] in a fact-sensitive analysis in setting bail\u201d and noting our Court \u201cus[ed] [an] abuse of discretion standard to review [the] fact-sensitive determination whether to remit forfeited bail\u201d in State v. Ventura, 196 N.J. 203, 206, 952 A.2d 1049 (2008)); State v. Korecky, 169 N.J. 364, 373, 777 A.2d 927 (2001) (\u201cThe imposition of a bail condition is a matter of judicial discretion.\u201d); State v. Johnson, 61 N.J. 351, 364, 294 A.2d 245 (1972) (noting that \u201cbail liberty is a matter for the discretion of the trial courts\u201d and that \u201cdiscretion must be exercised reasonably\u201d); State v. Steele, 430 N.J. Super. 24, 34, 61 A.3d 174 (App. Div. 2013); State v. Petrucelli, 37 N.J. Super. 1, 6, 116 A.2d 721 (App. Div. 1955) (noting that \u201c[t]he amount of bail is left to sound judicial discretion\u201d and that appellate courts are \u201cnot warranted in nullifying a trial court\u2019s exercise of judicial discretion in the absence of showing that its action was clearly unreasonable\u201d). There is no indication that the Legislature intended to change that practice under the new system. See C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 254-56, 156 A.3d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The second part of the Supreme Court\u2019s test in McLane is whether \u201cas a matter of sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.\u201d 137 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 559-60, 108 S.Ct. 2541). We have long deferred to trial courts\u2019 factual determinations because they \u201chear and see the witnesses and ... have the \u2018feel\u2019 of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d State v. Johnson, 42 N.J. 146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>consequence, trial courts are \u201cbetter positioned\u201d than appellate courts to make factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">With respect to detention determinations, trial courts regularly handle detention motions under the CJRA and, going forward, will continue to develop expertise in the CJRA\u2019s application. See Ingram, 230 N.J. at 212, 165 A.3d 797 (stating that under CJRA, \u201cthe State moved for detention in 7824 cases in the first half of 2017\u201d with \u201c[c]ourts hfolding] hearings in 5548 of those cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Legislature\u2019s significant use of permissive language in the CJRA, the history of appellate deference to the factual findings of trial courts, the history of appellate review of bail decisions for abuse of discretion, and the ongoing development of trial court expertise in applying the CJRA, all suggest that abuse of discretion is the appropriate appellate standard of review for determinations made in pretrial detention hearings under the CJRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In C.W., cited by the Appellate Division here, the panel also concluded that an abuse of discretion standard should apply to detention determinations under the CJRA. 449 N.J. Super. at 235, 252-54, 156 A.3d 1088. The panel found support in the words and policy objectives of the CJRA\u2014\u201cthe objectives of the [CJRA] in attaining the expeditious resolution of criminal cases could be thwarted if this court routinely second-guessed decisions on pretrial detention motions simply because we personally would have reached a different result than the trial judge.\u201d Id. at 256, 156 A.3d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">C.W. correctly recognized that, \u201c[i]n many instances, the pretrial hearing may entail no witness testimony and no need for credibility findings by the trial court, to which we ordinarily accord great deference.\u201d Id. at 257, 156 A.3d 1088. Nevertheless, regardless of whether the evidence is live testimony, a videotaped statement, or documentary evidence, deference is owed to the trial court\u2019s determinations of fact and credibility. State v. S.S., 229 N.J. 360, 379, 162 A.3d 1058 (2017) (\u201c[A] standard of deference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>a trial court\u2019s fact findings, even fact findings based solely on video or documentary evidence, best advances the interests of justice in a judicial system that assigns different roles to trial courts and appellate courts.\u201d); State v. Elders, 192 N.J. 224, 244, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We conclude that the appellate panel in C.W. identified the proper standard of review of detention decisions under the CJRA\u2014abuse of discretion. We find that the panel correctly enunciated the standard when it stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">[w]hile the concept is difficult to define with precision, an appellate court \u201cmay find an abuse of discretion when a decision \u2018rest[s] on an impermissible basis\u2019 or wras \u2018based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors.\u2019 \u201d Steele, 430 N.J. Super. at 34-35, 61 [61 A.3d 174] (quoting Flagg v. Essex Cty. Prosecutor, 171 N.J. 561, 571 [796 A.2d 182] (2002)). An appellate court can also discern an abuse of discretion when the trial court fails to take into consideration all relevant factors and when its decision reflects a clear error in judgment. State v. Baynes, 148 N.J. 434, 444 [690 A.2d 594] (1997). Likewise, when the trial court renders a decision based upon a misconception of the law, that decision is not entitled to any particular deference and consequently will be reviewed de novo. See, e.g., State v. Stein, 225 N.J. 582, 593 [139 A.3d 1174] (2016); State v. Williams, 441 N.J. Super. 266, 272 [117 A.3d 1247] (App. Div. 2015).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">[C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 255, 156 A.3d 1088.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Under that standard, \u201c[a] reviewing court generally will give no deference to a trial court decision that fails to \u2018provide factual underpinnings and legal bases supporting [its] exercise of judicial discretion.\u2019 \u201d C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 255, 156 A.3d 1088 (second alteration in original) (quoting Clark v. Clark, 429 N.J. Super. 61, 72, 57 A.3d 1 (App. Div. 2012)). In other words, a trial court\u2019s detention decision not supported by articulable facts is not entitled to deference and may constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Our final task is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering defendant\u2019s detention. This determination requires a review of whether the trial court\u2019s decision \u201crest[s] on an impermissible basis,\u201d \u201cwas based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors,\u201d \u201cfail[ed] to take into consideration all relevant factors and whe[ther] [the] decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>reflects a clear error in judgment.\u201d C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 265, 156 A.3d 1088 (first alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Where, as here, the defendant has not been indicted, the CJRA requires trial courts to determine at a detention hearing whether the State established probable cause and demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant\u2019s danger, risk of flight, and risk of obstruction overcomes the presumption of release. See N.J.S.A. 2A:162\u201418(a)(1); -19(e)(2); -20(a), (b). Because the finding of probable cause is not at issue here, we confine our consideration to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s danger, risk of flight, and risk of obstruction overcame the presumption of his release. See N.J.S.A. 2A:162-18(a)(1); -19(e)(2); -20(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We repeat the following principles that guide our final determination. The State\u2019s burden to overcome the statutory presumption of release is substantial because \u201c[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.\u201d State v. Robinson, 229 N.J. 44, 68, 160 A.3d 1 (2017) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987)). If the court orders pretrial detention, it shall \u201cinclude written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention.\u201d N.J.S.A. 2A:162-21(a)(l); see also R. 3:4A(c). Indeed, \u201c[a] reviewing court generally will give no deference to a trial court decision that fails to \u2018provide factual underpinnings and legal bases supporting [its] exercise of judicial discretion.\u2019 \u201d C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 255, 156 A.3d 1088 (second alteration in original) (quoting Clark, 429 N.J. Super. at 72, 57 A.3d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The CJRA specifically delineates the kind of evidence that the court may consider in making a detention decision. N.J.S.A. 2A: 162-20. As noted above, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A: 162-20, the court may take into account various factors, including \u201c[t]he nature and circumstances of the [charged] offense;\u201d \u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d proffered against the defendant; characteristics of the defendant as he stands before the court, including his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>employment status, familial ties, and length of residence in the community; \u201c[t]he nature and seriousness of the danger\u201d posed to other persons or the community if the defendant were released; the risk that the defendant will obstruct the criminal justice process; and the PSA recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court here considered the nature of the offense charged and gave it \u201cgreat weight.\u201d The court acknowledged the weakness of the State\u2019s case by stating that the proofs were limited to \u201che said, she said.\u201d Even though the weakness of the State\u2019s case generally militates in favor of release, the court used this factor to support the prosecutor\u2019s claim that there was a risk of obstruction. That was so, even though there was no past conduct by defendant or empirical evidence offered by the prosecutor to support the contention that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">[t]hese sorts of cases are sensitive in the sense that if a defendant has access to the victim or other family members, we know\u2014and it\u2019s common sense\u2014that the defendant often tries to obstruct justice by trying to cominee family members and other people in the family to say it didn\u2019t happen, or put pressure on the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Defendant\u2019s characteristics as he stood before the court, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:162-20, were as follows: he was fifty years of age; he had a PSA score of 1/6\u2014the lowest score\u2014for both \u201c[failure to appear\u201d and \u201c[n]ew criminal activity\u201d; he was gainfully employed, had no criminal history, had no violence flags, and had strong ties to the community including the support of his adoptive parents and his relationship with his biological children; he was born in Canada, but adopted shortly thereafter, and has lived in the United States; because he was born in Canada, defendant has dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship; and his birth mother visited him on one occasion more than ten years ago, and the visit ended with defendant obtaining a restraining order against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In addition, defense counsel proffered, without dispute by the prosecutor, that defendant had \u201cno telephonic or face-to-face contact with [his mother]\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know where to go find her\u201d; defendant lived in the same home as the victim \u201cuntil a couple of years ago\u201d and \u201cno further problems apparently ... have been alleged\u201d; and defendant is involved in the lives of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>three biological children and has had \u201cconstant contact\u201d with them despite no longer living in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The nature and circumstances of the offense are pertinent to whether the statutory presumption of release has been overcome. However, the court based its detention decision almost entirely upon the offense charged, even though that charge does not carry a presumption of detention. See N.J.S.A. 2A:162-18(b). The court also relied on unsupported conclusory statements by the prosecutor to establish risk of obstruction even though there was no evidence of defendant\u2019s obstructive conduct. As defense counsel noted, defendant lived in the same home as the victim \u201cuntil a couple of years ago\u201d and \u201cno further problems apparently ... have been alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The court based defendant\u2019s risk of flight upon his dual U.S.Canadian citizenship even though the evidence presented at the detention hearing was that defendant had \u201clived in New Jersey [for] almost his entire life\u201d and that defendant has no ties to Canada because he has no contact with his biological mother and does not know where she lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In summary, the trial court, in ordering defendant detained, failed to properly consider defendant\u2019s characteristics as he stood before the court. Furthermore, the trial court relied upon general, conclusory statements put forward by the prosecutor at the detention hearing. For example, at the detention hearing, the prosecutor asserted in a conclusory fashion that defendant\u2019s dual citizenship created a risk of flight and that because defendant knows where the victim and her mother live \u201cthe fear is that if he\u2019s released, he will harm them physically.\u201d Lastly, the prosecutor stated, without factual support, that \u201c[t]hese sorts of cases are sensitive\u201d because \u201cdefendant has access to the victim and other family members\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s common sense ... that the defendant often tries to obstruct justice by trying to convince family members and other people in the family to say it didn\u2019t happen, or put pressure on the victim.\u201d Because the court\u2019s detention decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>does not set forth articulable facts supporting its exercise of judicial discretion, it is not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We are thus constrained to find that the evidence at the detention hearing did not overcome the CJRA\u2019s presumption of release. The trial court\u2019s detention decision constituted an abuse of discretion because it \u201crest[s] on an impermissible basis,\u201d \u201cwas based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors,\u201d \u201cfail[ed] to take into consideration all relevant factors,\u201d including defendant\u2019s characteristics as he stood before the court, and \u201creflects a clear error in judgment.\u201d C.W., 449 N.J. Super. at 255, 156 A.3d 1088 (first alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Having determined that the trial court abused its discretion by detaining defendant, the next appropriate procedural step is to remand the matter to the trial court to determine the suitable conditions of release. Remand is required because the trial court has the opportunity at a detention hearing to \u201chear and see witnesses\u201d and gain a \u201c \u2018feel\u2019 of the case which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u201d Johnson, 42 N.J. at 161, 199 A.2d 809. Trial courts are therefore better positioned to determine conditions of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm as modified the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand to the trial court for a hearing to determine the appropriate conditions of release.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, and TIMPONE join in JUSTICE SOLOMON\u2019S opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> As per Rule 1:38-3(c)(12), initials will be used to preserve the confidentiality of the victim in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> Defendant and the victim's mother were never married and defendant is not the victim\u2019s biological father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\"> Two months after defendant\u2019s arrest on the complaint-warrant, he was indicted for first-degree aggravated sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(a)(l); second-degree sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b); second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(a)(1); and fourth-degree lewdness, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-4(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\"> The PSA is a tool that \"assesses the level of risk for failure to appear and for new criminal activity on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest, and may include a flag to denote new violent criminal activity.\u2019\u2019 State v.
