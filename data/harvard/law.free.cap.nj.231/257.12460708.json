A commitment to free discourse requires that we tolerate communication of which we strongly disapprove. This case tests the limits to which a broadly worded harassment statute can criminalize speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">William Burkert and Gerald Halton were corrections officers, who held positions in different unions representing distinct classes of corrections officers. Their relationship became particularly strained after Burkert read online comments attributed to Hal-ton\u2019s wife that Burkert felt insulted him and his family. In response, Burkert downloaded a wedding photograph of Halton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>and his wife that was posted on social media and then inscribed degrading and vile dialogue on copies of the photograph. Copies of those photographs were found strewn in the employee parking garage and locker room of the Union County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Halton filed three complaints in municipal court charging Bur-kert with harassment in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c), which makes it an offense to have engaged in a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy [a] person.\u201d Halton\u2019s private attorney prosecuted this quasi-criminal offense on behalf of the State while Halton contemporaneously pursued a civil action against Burkert. A municipal court judge found Burkert guilty of harassment on two of the complaints, as did a Law Division judge after a trial de novo on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Appellate Division vacated Burkert\u2019s conviction, determining that although the flyers were wholly unprofessional and inappropriate for the workplace, they did \u201cnot amount to criminal harassment\u201d in light of our constitutional free-speech guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We affirm. Criminal laws targeting speech that are not clearly drawn are anathema to the First Amendment and our state constitutional analogue because they give the government broad authority to prosecute protected expressive activities and do not give fair notice of what the law proscribes. Such laws also chill permissible speech because people, fearful that their utterances may subject them to criminal prosecution, may not give voice to their thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">To ensure that N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) does not exceed its constitutional reach in cases involving the prosecution of pure speech, repeated acts to \u201calarm\u201d and \u201cseriously annoy\u201d must be read as encompassing only repeated communications directed at a person that reasonably put that person in fear for his safety or security or that intolerably interfere with that person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. We consider that approach to be faithful to the legislative purpose in enacting subsection (c) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4 and consonant with the constitutional guarantees of free speech. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Burkert\u2019s intent to annoy was not a crime, and he did not engage in the type of repetitive acts contemplated by the statute. Therefore, Burkert is not guilty of a petty disorderly persons offense, although he may be subject to workplace discipline or a civil tort action. The language on the flyers, despite its vulgarity and meanness, is constitutionally protected from a criminal prosecution for harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division, which dismissed the charges against Burkert.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">On September 30, 2011, Halton filed three separate complaints, alleging that Burkert committed the petty disorderly persons offense of harassment on January 8, 9, and 11, 2011, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A three-day trial was held in the Elizabeth Municipal Court. Halton\u2019s privately retained attorney prosecuted the case on behalf of the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">At trial, Halton and Burkert testified, as did two other corrections officers. The testimony, much of which was undisputed, elicited the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>As of January 2011, Halton and Burkert had both worked as Union County correctional officers for more than twenty years. Halton served as a sergeant and also as the vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), a union representing high-ranking corrections officers. Burkert served as a corrections officer and also as the treasurer of the Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association (PBA), a union representing rank-and-file corrections officers. The rivalry between those two unions evidently caused friction in their personal relationship. The tension became much more acute when Burkert learned that Halton\u2019s wife was posting derogatory comments about him and his family on a public internet forum. Halton\u2019s wife referred to Burkert and his two brothers\u2014who also were corrections officers\u2014as bullies. According to Burkert, the postings also described him as \u201cfat\u201d and one of his brothers as \u201cquirky\u201d and \u201ckind of retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Angered by the insulting online comments, Burkert retaliated. Burkert downloaded the Haltons\u2019 wedding photograph, which Halton\u2019s wife apparently had posted on a social media website. He then copied the photograph and made two flyers, writing lewd dialogue in speech bubbles over the faces of the bride and groom. On Flyer # 1, over Halton\u2019s face were the words, \u201cI know I\u2019m a pussy with a little dick. Don\u2019t do the inmates please Laura,\u201d and over his wife\u2019s face were the words, \u201cI wish you had a cock like the inmates.\u201d On Flyer #2, over Halton\u2019s face, the writing stated, \u201cFam, I got me another whore.\u201d According to Halton, \u201cfam\u201d is a term denoting the corrections officers as family, and the dialogue on the flyers obliquely referenced his prior wife, a former corrections officer who he claimed had relations with another officer and an inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Halton testified that on January 8, 2011, at approximately 10:45 p.m., he arrived at the employee garage of the Union County Jail, parked his vehicle, and saw papers \u201cblowing all over the place.\u201d He picked one up and discovered Flyer # 1. Halton was offended and humiliated by the scurrilous writing over his wedding photograph. As he approached the gun locker area, Burkert and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>brother, Sergeant Kevin Burkert, stood in his path. As he walked between them, Halton asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d and Burkert replied, \u201cYou\u2019re what\u2019s up.\u201d Later, while Halton was working at the booking area, he received a call from Burkert. During their conversation, Burkert mentioned that Halton\u2019s wife had called him fat; Halton denied having any knowledge of it. When asked, Burkert denied knowing about the flyers. The conversation came to an inconclusive end.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The next day, January 9, when Halton arrived at work, a sergeant handed him Flyer # 2, which the sergeant had found in the area of the officers\u2019 locker room. Halton identified the handwriting on both flyers as Burkert\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On January 11, while Halton was off his usual schedule and engaged in union negotiations for the FOP, a lieutenant handed him Flyer # 2, stating, \u201cThis came out the other night.\u201d The flyer was the same one turned over to Halton two days earlier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Halton indicated that he \u201cwas a mess in negotiations,\u201d went home, and never returned to work. Halton explained that he felt embarrassed and concerned for his safety and received psychological counseling and treatment. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for this work-related injury and retired on November 1, 2011. Halton acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for placing the flyers in the various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Ten months after the January incidents, Halton filed the criminal harassment charges. Halton stated that he filed the charges only because the county had failed to properly discipline Burkert.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also filed a civil lawsuit against Burkert.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">During the county\u2019s investigation into the flyers, Sergeant Stephen Pilot interviewed Burkert. Sergeant Pilot advised Bur-kert that a refusal to give a statement would jeopardize his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>employment. Burkert admitted to Pilot that he had prepared the flyers but denied circulating them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Burkert testified that he had been friends with Halton and became angry when he discovered that Halton\u2019s wife had been posting insulting comments about him and his brothers on a website for more than two years. While on the website, Burkert clicked a link to the wife\u2019s screen name, and the Haltons\u2019 wedding photograph appeared. He admitted downloading the photograph, inscribing the bubble dialogue over the Haltons\u2019 faces, and attaching the two flyers to the wall behind his desk in his union office. He denied, however, circulating the flyers that were later discovered in the garage and locker room. According to Burkert, on the evening of January 8, after the telephone conversation earlier described by Halton, he went to see Halton and said, \u201cHere. I made the pictures. This is payback for what you did to my family.\u201d Burkert explained that he expressed himself through the flyers rather than \u201cget physical with the guy.\u201d Burkert retired as a corrections officer in September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">No testimony was elicited that Burkert worked either on January 9 or 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The municipal court entered a guilty verdict against Burkert for harassing Halton on January 8 and 11 in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that Burkert made and circulated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>flyers in the garage and locker room, that the bubble dialogue inscribed on the Haltons\u2019 wedding photograph was \u201clewd and obnoxious,\u201d and that such language would \u201cseriously annoy any person, in this case Mr. Halton.\u201d The court imposed fines of $500 for each conviction and additional financial assessments and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In a de novo trial on the record before the Law Division, the court found Burkert guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of committing acts of harassment on January 8 and 11. The court determined that Burkert created and circulated the photographs and did so with the purpose to harass, and further that the harassing conduct was not protected by the First Amendment. More specifically, the court held that Burkert\u2019s intent in placing the vulgar language on the photos was to seriously annoy Halton in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33^1(c). The Law Division imposed the same fines, assessments, and costs as the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">A panel of the Appellate Division reversed Burkert\u2019s conviction, concluding that \u201cthe commentary [Burkert] added to [Halton\u2019s] wedding photograph was constitutionally protected speech.\u201d State v. Burkert, 444 N.J. Super. 591, 594, 135 A.3d 150 (App. Div. 2016).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The panel accepted the argument that \u201cthe altered photograph ... was not directed to [Halton],\u201d but rather to an audience of possibly willing listeners\u2014other corrections officers. Id. at 601-02, 135 A.3d 150. The panel determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the flyers \u201cwere a direct attempt to alarm or seriously annoy\u201d Halton or to invade his privacy rights. Id. at 601, 135 A.3d 150. The panel stated that the \u201cuncouth annotations to [Halton\u2019s] wedding photograph\u201d amounted to \u201cconstitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>protected expression, despite its boorish content, which bothered or embarrassed [Halton].\u201d Ibid. The panel also found that the vulgar commentary on the flyers, although \u201cunprofessional, puerile, and inappropriate for the workplace,\u201d did not constitute criminal harassment. Id. at 603, 135 A.3d 150. The panel did not address whether the flyers exposed Burkert to employment discipline. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for certification. 227 N.J. 377, 151 A.3d 977 (2016). We also granted the motions of the Pennsylvania Center for the First Amendment and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) to participate as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The State argues that the Appellate Division erred in vacating Burkert\u2019s harassment conviction on First Amendment grounds and that Burkert\u2019s conduct in creating and distributing the flyers was sufficient to justify the conviction. According to the State, \u201c[t]he harassment statute restricts conduct, not speech,\u201d and the right to free speech \u201cdoes not encompass a right to abuse or annoy another person intentionally.\u201d The State contends that \u201cspeech or writing used as an integral part of the harassing conduct is not entitled to First Amendment protection.\u201d The State rejects the notion that Burkert engaged in permissible speech with an audience that included willing listeners, suggesting that inmates may have been part of that audience and that a \u201cworkplace audience is \u2018captive.\u2019 \u201d The State emphasizes that N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) requires that a defendant act with the purpose to harass\u2014\u201cwith a conscious object ... to annoy\u201d\u2014to demonstrate that permissible speech will not fall within the statute\u2019s sweep. To establish that Burkert\u2019s \u201ccourse of conduct was alarming and injurious,\u201d the State points to Burkert\u2019s admission that \u201che made the flyers as an alternative to physically assaulting Halton\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>from that admission, reasons that Burkert intended \u201cthe flyers to have the same effect as a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Burkert contends that the Appellate Division properly vacated his conviction, reasoning that \u201c[u]nder the First Amendment, the State cannot prosecute an individual for publicly taunting another, even if done through crude language and with an intent to annoy.\u201d Burkert asserts that the speech on the flyers constituted an opinion and cannot be criminalized by labeling it conduct. Burkert asks this Court to \u201creaffirm\u201d that \u201cthe mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression unprotected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Amicus Pennsylvania Center for the First Amendment submits that the Appellate Division correctly reversed Burkert\u2019s conviction for the following reasons: (1) New Jersey jurisprudence has \u201capplied the criminal harassment statute only to repeated communication to an unwilling listener, not speech about an unwilling listener\u201d; (2) the flyers at issue conveyed words and pictures\u2014 traditional means of speech\u2014and cannot be reclassified as conduct to evade the protections of the First Amendment; (3) the speech here did not fall into the category of speech integral to a criminal offense because the flyers were not ancillary to other conduct\u2014 rather, the expressions on the flyers were the only target of the prosecution; (4) speech does not lose its First Amendment protection, however vulgar the content, even when its purpose is simply to offend; and (5) Burkert\u2019s speech was no less deserving of constitutional protection because the matters addressed were personal rather than political.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Amicus ACLU-NJ proposes that this Court adopt a \u201csensible construction\u201d of the language \u201cpurpose to harass\u201d in N.J.S.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>2C:33^(c) that will keep the statute within constitutional bounds. The ACLU-NJ contends that a defendant\u2019s use of speech with the intent \u201cto insult, embarrass or even humiliate\u201d should not be sufficient to justify a harassment conviction under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c), even though such conduct may trigger civil consequences, such as a private tort action or employment discipline. The ACLU-NJ suggests that we construe N.J.S.A. 2C:33^4(c) to require that a \u201cdefendant have the conscious object to cause in the victim the fear or apprehension of intrusion into the victim\u2019s safety, security, or seclusion.\u201d According to the ACLU-NJ, that interpretation is consistent with our case law and will make clear that the statute cannot criminalize \u201cinsulting and even vulgar communications\u201d of the type in this case that are an inevitable part of the aggravations of daily existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The issue before us is whether Burkert is guilty of harassment because, as he intended, the lewd flyers seriously annoyed Halton. In addressing that issue, we must determine whether the Legislature intended N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) to criminalize the type of speech in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">To understand the meaning of N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c), we must look not only to the statutory language, but also to related provisions in surrounding statutes. State v. Crawley, 187 N.J. 440, 452, 901 A.2d 924 (2006) (\u201c[W]e do not read [statutory words] in a vacuum, but rather \u2018in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.\u2019 \u201d (quoting DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005))). We begin with N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">[A] person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">b. Subjects another to striking, kicking, shoving, or other offensive touching, or threatens to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>c. Engages in any other course of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy such other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The statute distinguishes between \u201ccommunications\u201d and \u201clanguage\u201d that violate the statute in subsection (a), and \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201cacts\u201d that do so in subsection (c). Likewise, in surrounding statutes, the Legislature has clearly indicated when language and communication can be the basis for a criminal prosecution. The \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d statute targets \u201cunreasonably loud and offensively coarse or abusive language\u201d in a public place, N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20142(b) (emphasis added), and the \u201ccyber-harassment\u201d statute targets certain online \u201ccommunication[s],\u2019\u2019 N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4.1 (emphasis added). The Legislature has made clear when its primary objective is to classify speech as criminal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Although a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct\u201d or \u201crepeatedly committed acts\u201d can occur through communications and language alone, it is far from clear that the Legislature had in mind offensive speech as the object of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c). This point comes into better focus by examining the Model Penal Code (MPC) Section 250.4, which is the source of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4. See N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4; 1 The New Jersey Penal Code: Final Report \u00a7 2C:33-4 (Criminal Law Revision Comm\u2019n 1971); State v. Robinson, 217 N.J. 594, 606, 92 A.3d 656 (2014) (\u201cWhen a provision of the Code is modeled after the MPC, it is appropriate to consider the MPC and any commentary to interpret the intent of the statutory language.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">MPC Section 250.4, which is entitled \u201cHarassment,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">A person commits a petty misdemeanor if, with purpose to harass another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">(1) makes a telephone call without purpose of legitimate communication; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(2) insults, taunts or challenges another in a manner likely to provoke violent or disorderly response; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">(3) makes repeated communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">(4) subjects another to an offensive touching; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">(5) engages in any other course of alarming conduct serving no legitimate purpose of the actor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Subsections (1) through (3) of MPC Section 250.4 correspond to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a). The MPC Commentaries indicate that \u201c[s]ub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sections (1) through (3) of [MPC Section 250.4] proscribe harassment by communication.\u201d Model Penal Code (MPC) \u00a7 250.4 cmt. 6 (Am. Law Inst. 1962). On the other hand, MPC Section 250.4(5), which directly corresponds to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c), primarily prohibits \u201charassment by action rather than by communication,\u201d ibid., and does not apply to harassment covered by the other subsections, id. \u00a7 250.4 cmt. 5. The MPC drafters provide three illustrations of conduct proscribed by subsection (5): \u201cburning a cross on the lawn of a black family,\u201d \u201cleaving animal carcasses on a neighbor\u2019s stoop,\u201d and \u201cshining a spotlight into a parked car in order to embarrass or frighten the occupants.\u201d Ibid. Those examples suggest that subsection (5) focused on conduct intended to cause fright and threaten a person\u2019s safety, security, or reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Under subsection (5), the MPC drafters acknowledge a potential scenario \u201cof harassing conduct [that] is so imbued with expressive content as to implicate first-amendment concerns.\u201d Id. \u00a7 250.4 cmt. 6. Nevertheless, the drafters believed that such concerns \u201cwould probably be excluded by the statutory requirements that the action serve no legitimate purpose of the actor and that there be a purpose to harass.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Unlike MPC Section 250.4(5), N.J.S.A. 2C:33^(c) allows for a harassment conviction based on conduct that \u201cseriously annoys\u201d another. As a consequence, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) criminalizes a much broader swath of conduct than the MPC. Additionally, unlike the MPC, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) does not limit prosecutions to expressive acts or conduct that have \u201cno legitimate purpose.\u201d Overall, compared to our state harassment statute, MPC Section 250.4(5) is more narrowly drawn to insulate it from potential First Amendment concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">That the primary thrust of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) is not to interdict speech, but rather conduct, is reinforced in State v. Hoffman, 149 N.J. 564, 695 A.2d 236 (1997). In that case, we found that a defendant who ripped up a court support order and sent it to his estranged wife did not constitute harassment under N.J.S.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>2C:33-4(a). Id. at 584, 695 A.2d 236. In rendering that decision, we distinguished subsection (c) from subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">[t]he purpose of subsection (c) is to reach conduct not covered by subsections (a) and (b). For example, if a person were to ring a former companion\u2019s doorbell at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, flash bright lights into her windows on Monday at 6:00 p.m., throw tomatoes into her front door on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., throw eggs on her car on Wednesday, and repeat the same conduct over a two-week period, a judge could find that subsection (c) has been violated. We do not imply by that example that five or more episodes are required to establish a course of alarming conduct. [Id. at 580-81, 695 A.2d 236.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The example given in Hoffman indicates that the Court considered subsection (c)\u2014which makes unlawful a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy\u201d\u2014as targeting harassment by action. Despite the Hoffman example, we do not doubt that, in certain clearly defined circumstances, speech can take the form of conduct and therefore be the appropriate focus of a subsection (c) prosecution. It is evident, however, that the Legislature was not homing in on speech in subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In the cyber-harassment statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-^1.1, which became effective in 2014, the Legislature made it a crime when a defendant, through an online electronic communication, \u201cthreatens to inflict injury or physical harm\u201d; \u201cthreatens to commit any crime against [a] person or [a] person\u2019s property\u201d; or knowingly sends lewd or obscene material with the \u201cintent to emotionally harm a reasonable person.\u201d The cyber-harassment statute limits the criminalization of speech mostly to those communications that threaten to cause physical or emotional harm or damage. The cyber-harassment statute\u2019s precise and exacting standard thus stands in contrast to the more loosely worded language of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">One further observation. At the time the Legislature passed the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, N.J.S.A. 2C:1-1 to 104-9, it repealed New Jersey\u2019s last criminal libel statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:120-1. L. 1978, c. 95, \u00a7 2C:98-2 (eff. Sept. 1, 1979). In doing so, the Legislature signaled that the criminal law would not be used as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>weapon against defamatory remarks, thereby aligning our new criminal code with the Model Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The MPC Commentaries reveal that a criminal libel provision was not included in the MPC because \u201cpenal sanctions cannot be justified merely by the fact that defamation is evil or damaging to a person in ways that entitle him to maintain a civil suit.\u201d Model Penal Code (MPC Tentative Draft) \u00a7 250.7 cmt. 2 (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 13, 1961). Criminal laws are usually reserved \u201cfor harmful behavior which exceptionally disturbs the community\u2019s sense of security,\u201d not for \u201cpersonal calumny.\u201d State v. Browne, 86 N.J. Super. 217, 228, 206 A.2d 591 (App. Div. 1965) (quoting MPC Tentative Draft \u00a7 250.7 cmt. 2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Accordingly, the Legislature framed the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice with a conscious deference to the right of free expression. We now turn to the constitutional constraints placed on overly broad criminal statutes that threaten the right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The First Amendment protects \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. I., as does Article I, Paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution, which states that \u201c[ejvery person may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Laws may \u201cnot transgress the boundaries fixed by the Constitution for freedom of expression.\u201d Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 515, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948). Accordingly, \u201cthe scrutiny to be accorded legislation that trenches upon first amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ment liberties must be especially scrupulous.\u201d State v. Cameron, 100 N.J. 586, 592, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985). The constitutional guarantee of free speech, moreover, imposes higher \u201cstandards of certainty\u201d on criminal laws than civil laws. Winters, 333 U.S. at 515, 68 S.Ct. 665. \u201cPenal laws ... are subjected to sharper scrutiny and given more exacting and critical assessment under the vagueness doctrine than civil enactments.\u201d Cameron, 100 N.J. at 592, 498 A.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Criminal laws touching on speech must give fair notice of where the line is set between what is permissible and proscribed and must be drawn \u201cwith appropriate definiteness.\u201d Winters, 333 U.S. at 515, 68 S.Ct. 665 (quoting Pierce v. United States, 314 U.S. 306, 311, 62 S.Ct. 237, 86 L.Ed. 226 (1941)); accord Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 304, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). Vague and overly broad laws criminalizing speech have the potential to chill permissible speech, causing speakers to silence themselves rather than utter words that may be subject to penal sanctions. Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 871-72, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). Such laws also give government authorities undue prosecutorial discretion, thus increasing \u201cthe risk of discriminatory enforcement.\u201d See Reno, 521 U.S. at 872, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (citing Denver Area Educ. Telcomms. Consortium v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cA court can invalidate a statute that is substantially overbroad on its face\u201d if \u201cthe statute \u2018reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019\u201d State v. Mortimer, 135 N.J. 517, 530, 641 A.2d 257 (1994) (quoting Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458-59, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987)). Such a drastic remedy, however, is not the only\u2014and not even the preferred\u2014approach. State Chamber of Commerce v. Election Law Enf't Comm\u2019n, 82 N.J. 57, 81, 411 A.2d 168 (1980) (holding that \u201cnarrow and discriminate construction of the key terms of the legislation serves to overcome its major overbreadth objections\u201d and is done \u201cto salvage the Legislature\u2019s own product\u201d). When a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>statute\u2019s constitutionality is subject to doubt because of ambiguity in its wording, we proceed under \u201cthe assumption that the legislature intended to act in a constitutional manner.\u201d State v. Johnson, 166 N.J. 523, 540\u201441, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001) (quoting Right to Choose v. Byrne, 91 N.J. 287, 311, 450 A.2d 925 (1982)). Provided that a statute is \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d to an interpretation that will render it constitutional, we must construe the statute to conform to the Constitution, thus removing any doubt about its validity. State v. Profaci, 56 N.J. 346, 350, 266 A.2d 579 (1970); see also State Bd. of Higher Educ. v. Bd. of Dirs. of Shelton Coll., 90 N.J. 470, 478, 448 A.2d 988 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In short, we must construe a statute that criminalizes expressive activity narrowly to avoid any conflict with the constitutional right to free speech. For example, in State v. Rosenfeld, this Court affirmed the overturning of the defendant\u2019s conviction under N.J.S.A. 2A:170-29(1) for using foul language (the words \u201cMother F ing\u201d) in a school auditorium during a municipal discussion on racism. 62 N.J. 594, 603-04, 303 A.2d 889 (1973). N.J.S.A. 2A:170-29(1)\u2014a predecessor statute to N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20142 and -4\u2014made it an offense for a person to \u201cutter[ ] loud and offensive or profane or indecent language in any ... place to which the public is invited.\u201d The Court noted, \u201cthe State has no right to cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us.\u201d Rosenfeld, 62 N.J. at 603, 303 A.2d 889 (quoting Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971)), The Court constrained the broadly worded statute so that it only \u201cprohibits indecent language which is spoken loudly in a public place and is of such nature as to be likely to incite the hearer to an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In rendering its decision, the Rosenfeld Court cited extensively to Gooding v. Wilson, in which the United States Supreme Court vacated the conviction of a defendant who violated a Georgia misdemeanor statute that prohibited the use of \u201copprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>peace.\u201d Rosenfeld, 62 N.J. at 600, 303 A.2d 889 (quoting Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 519, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972)). The United States Supreme Court found the statute unconstitutionally overbroad because the statute made it a misdemeanor \u201cmerely to speak words offensive to some who hear them.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Gooding, 405 U.S. at 527, 92 S.Ct. 1103).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Significantly, this Court has construed the language in subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4\u2014which proscribes communications made in any \u201cmanner likely to cause annoyance or alarm\u201d\u2014as encompassing, \u201cfor constitutional reasons, only those modes of communicative harassment that \u2018are also invasive of the recipient\u2019s privacy,\u2019 \u201d Cesare v. Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 404, 713 A.2d 390 (1998) (quoting Hoffman, 149 N.J. at 583, 695 A.2d 236), and that constitute threats to safety, see id. at 414-15, 713 A.2d 390. In that vein, our courts have upheld harassment convictions pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:33^(a) where a defendant scrawled racially offensive graffiti on a victim\u2019s home, Mortimer, 135 N.J. 517, 641 A.2d 257, made persistent unwanted telephone calls, which included a racial slur, to the victim\u2019s workplace, State v. Fin. Am. Corp., 182 N.J. Super. 33, 440 A.2d 28 (App. Div. 1981), and repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell of a home in which the defendant\u2019s physically abused wife had sought shelter, State v. Reyes, 172 N.J. 154, 796 A.2d 879 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">How courts in other states have addressed harassment statutes is also instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In People v. Norman, the Colorado Supreme Court declared the state\u2019s harassment statute unconstitutional due to vagueness. 703 P.2d 1261, 1267 (Colo. 1985). Colo. Rev. Stat. Section 18-9-111(1)(d) (1978) (repealed, H.B. 90-1118, 57th Gen. Assemb., 2d Reg. Sess. (Colo. 1990))\u2014like N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c)\u2014provided that a person commits the crime of harassment if, \u201cwith intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person,\u201d he \u201cengages in conduct or repeatedly commits acts that alarm or seriously annoy another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>person and that serve no legitimate purpose.\u201d The Colorado high court found the statute constitutionally infirm on due process grounds because it provided no limiting standards \u201cto assist citizens, courts, judges or police personnel to define what conduct is prohibited and, conversely, what conduct is permitted\u201d and gave prosecutors \u201cunfettered\u201d discretion. Norman, 703 P.2d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Norman followed an earlier Colorado Supreme Court decision that struck down a subsection of Colorado\u2019s harassment statute similar to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a). Bolles v. People, 189 Colo. 394, 541 P.2d 80, 84 (1975). The court found that the statute was impermis-sibly overbroad and impinged on free-speech rights. Ibid. The court determined that the terms \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201calarm\u201d were so vague that even innocuous comments about noteworthy but unpleasant topics might subject a person to criminal prosecution. Id. at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Likewise, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down on vagueness grounds a Texas harassment statute similar to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a). Kramer v. Price, 712 F.2d 174, 178 (5th Cir. 1983). The Fifth Circuit found that the absence of clear enforcement guidelines gave prosecutors \u201cunbounded discretion\u201d and subjected the exercise of First Amendment rights to an \u201cunascertainable standard.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In People v. Dietze, the New York Court of Appeals declared a subsection of New York\u2019s harassment statute, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 240.25(2) (1988) (current version at N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 240.26), overbroad and therefore unconstitutional because of its potential infringement on free-speech rights. 75 N.Y.2d 47, 550 N.Y.S.2d 595, 549 N.E.2d 1166, 1167 (1989). N.Y. Penal Law Section 240.25(2) stated: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment when, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person ... [i]n a public place, he uses abusive or obscene language, or makes an obscene gesture.\u201d In overturning subsection (2), the Court of Appeals cautioned that \u201cany proscription of pure speech must be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflict injury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tend naturally to evoke immediate violence or other breach of the peace.\u201d Dietze, 550 N.Y.S.2d 595, 549 N.E.2d at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"AvS\">Those cases reinforce the notion that harassment statutes must be written with sufficient precision to ensure that protected speech does not fall within the realm of a potential criminal prosecution and to give fair notice of where free speech ends and criminal conduct begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We conclude that the vaguely and broadly worded standard in N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) does not put a reasonable person on sufficient notice of the kinds of speech that the statute proscribes. The statute\u2019s vagueness also gives prosecuting authorities undue discretion to bring charges related to permissive expressive activities. That, in turn, means that the statute\u2014if not more narrowly defined\u2014has the capacity to chill permissible speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Although patterned after the MPC, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) is more broadly written than its MPC counterpart and therefore more likely to impinge on protected expressive activities. Whereas N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) permits the conviction of a person who acts with the purpose to \u201cseriously annoy\u201d another person, under the corresponding MPC provision a conviction may be premised only on \u201calarming conduct.\u201d Unlike its MPC counterpart, N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c) is not restricted to conduct that serves \u201cno legitimate purpose of the actor.\u201d See N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The circularity of the language of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4, moreover, does not place limits on the statute. Under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4, an accused may not be convicted unless he acts \u201cwith the purpose to harass.\u201d However, one common definition of harass is to annoy. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 784 (9th ed. 2009); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1031 (1981). Accordingly, the words \u201charass\u201d and \u201cannoy\u201d are interchangeable. By that reckoning, under subsection (c), a person who, with the purpose to seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>annoy another, does seriously annoy another is guilty of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Speech, however, cannot be transformed into criminal conduct merely because it annoys, disturbs, or arouses contempt. See Houston, 482 U.S. at 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502 (stating that speech cannot be punished unless it is \u201clikely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest\u201d (quoting Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949))); cf. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011). \u201cThere is no categorical \u2018harassment exception\u2019 to the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause.\u201d Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 204 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The First Amendment protects offensive discourse, hateful ideas, and crude language because freedom of expression needs breathing room and in the long run leads to a more enlightened society. See Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 4, 69 S.Ct. 894. Outside of the category of obscenity, courts should not play the role of censor by engaging in a weighing of an expression\u2019s value or \u201crelative social costs and benefits.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 470, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010); see also Brown v. Entm\u2019t Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, 792-93, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011). Speech cannot be criminalized merely because others see no value in it. \u201cThe First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing speech, or even expressive conduct, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.\u201d R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Nonetheless, neither the First Amendment nor Article I, Paragraph 6 of our State Constitution prohibits the State from criminalizing certain limited categories of speech, such as speech that is integral to criminal conduct, speech that physically threatens or terrorizes another, or speech that is intended to incite imminent unlawful conduct. See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>709, 717, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012); cf. Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Verniero, 156 N.J. 254, 264, 716 A.2d 1137 (1998). For example, a robber\u2019s command that a victim turn over money is unprotected speech because the expressive activity is integral to the commission of a crime. Likewise, laws that punish threats of physical harm are constitutional because the State has a strong interest in \u201cprotecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\u201d R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538; see also United States v. Turner, 720 F.3d 411, 420-21 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that defendant\u2019s threatening statements to judges, despite political content, were not protected by First Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The First Amendment also does not bar states from enacting laws that punish expressive activity when \u201csubstantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.\u201d See Cohen, 403 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. 1780. Although the \u201cpresence of unwitting listeners or viewers does not serve automatically to justify curtailing all speech capable of giving offense,\u201d the government, for example, may \u201cprohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views and ideas which cannot be totally banned from the public dialogue.\u201d Ibid. A speaker using a bullhorn in a town square may voice objectionable ideas to passing members of the public who are seemingly a captive audience without offending the First Amendment, but the Constitution will not protect the speaker with a bullhorn bellowing outside a home in the early morning hours. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (noting that although \u201c[o]ne important aspect of residential privacy is protection of the unwilling listener,\u201d \u201c Ve are often \u201ccaptives\u201d outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech\u2019 \u201d (quoting Rowan v. Post Office Dep\u2019t, 397 U.S. 728, 738, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970))).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In Hoffman, we determined that the catchall language of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a)\u2014\u201cany other manner likely to cause annoyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>or alarm\u201d\u2014was intended to \u201cencompass only those types of communications that also are invasive of the recipient\u2019s privacy,\u201d a purpose that would not run amiss of any constitutional proscription. See 149 N.J. at 583-84, 695 A.2d 236. According to another court, the constitutional right to free expression does not protect one who \u201crepeatedly invade[s]\u201d another person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy \u201cthrough the use of acts and threats that evidence a pattern of harassment designed to inflict substantial emotional distress.\u201d People v. Borrelli, 77 Cal.App.4th 703, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 859-60 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Recognizing that the First Amendment and Article I, Paragraph 6 of our State Constitution allow the State to punish threatening speech or speech that invades a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in an intolerable manner informs our analysis in construing the broad language of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) within constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Unlike some of our sister jurisdictions that have struck down overly broad and vague harassment statutes, our approach is to conform subsection (c) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4 \u201cto the Constitution in a way that the Legislature would have intended.\u201d See State v. Natale, 184 N.J. 458, 485-86, 878 A.2d 724 (2005). In adopting N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c), which was patterned after its MPC counterpart, the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent was to address harassment by action rather than communication. See MPC \u00a7 250.4 cmt. 6. We cannot say that the Legislature intended to criminalize speech that poses no threat to a person\u2019s safety or security or speech that does not intolerably interfere with a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. We have come to that conclusion by comparing subsection (c) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4 to subsection (a), to N.J.S.A. 2C-.33-2, and to the cyber-harassment statute; by our analysis of the MPC Commentaries; and by our review of case law, including the example given in Hoffman of conduct proscribed by subsection (c). We also find the limitations that we have placed on the catch-all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>provision of subsection (a) instructive. See Cesare, 154 N.J. at 404, 414-15, 713 A.2d 390; Hoffman, 149 N.J. at 583, 695 A.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The constraint we place on the overbroad language of subsection (c) is compelled by the principles animating our free-speech guarantees. We now return to the specific language of the statute at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">[A] person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA6h\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"13\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIAAAANAQAAAADDaABkAAAALklEQVR4nGP8z8DAwMBwkIkBAsim/zJ8YTjBwMD0h+EDXJyDgYGJkUGEwYCBAQAwfwbMdY8XTQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"50\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">c. Engages in any other course of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy such other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">In cases based on pure expressive activity, the amorphous terms \u201calarming conduct\u201d and \u201cacts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy\u201d must be defined in more concrete terms consonant with the dictates of the free-speech clauses of our Federal and State Constitutions. Narrowly reading the terms alarm and annoy\u2014as we have done in past cases involving subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4\u2014will save the statute from constitutional infirmity. See Cesare, 154 N.J. at 404, 713 A.2d 390 (stating that \u201cprovision in N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a) prohibiting conduct communicated in any manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm encompasses, for constitutional reasons, only those modes of communicative harassment that \u2018are also invasive of the recipient\u2019s privacy\u2019 \u201d (quoting Hoffman, 149 N.J. at 583, 695 A.2d 236)). We believe the Legislature would prefer a subsection (c) prohibiting verbal harassment that conforms to the First Amendment than no such provision at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">Therefore, for constitutional reasons, we will construe the terms \u201cany other course of alarming conduct\u201d and \u201cacts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy\u201d as repeated communications directed at a person that reasonably put that person in fear for his safety or security or that intolerably interfere with that person\u2019s reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>expectation of privacy. Of course, the Legislature may decide to amend subsection (c) with other language that conforms to the requirements of our free-speech clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To be clear, the standard set forth above applies only in those cases where the alleged harassing conduct is based on pure expressive activity. Under that standard, repeated threats or menacing communications that reasonably place a person in fear for his safety or security are not protected expressive activities. Likewise, a person who repeatedly makes unwanted communications to a subject, thereby intolerably interfering with his reasonable expectation of privacy, will not find shelter behind the First Amendment. Thus, a person who every day, over the course of a week, either repeatedly yells outside an ex-partner\u2019s house during the night, or repeatedly follows closely next to a woman importuning her for a date or making other unwanted comments, despite constant demands to stop, would violate subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Subsection (c) was never intended to protect against the common stresses, shocks, and insults of life that come from exposure to crude remarks and offensive expressions, teasing and rumor mongering, and general inappropriate behavior. The aim of subsection (c) is not to enforce a code of civil behavior or proper manners.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The prosecution in this case targeted purely expressive activity and therefore we apply the heightened standard of subsection (c) set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We recognize that neither the municipal court nor Law Division judge who sat in this case had the benefit of the standard developed in this opinion. They applied the statute as written. Although in other circumstances a remand might be appropriate, we see no point here because even the most indulgent view of the record favoring the State would not support a harassment conviction under N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20144(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>First, we note that, based on the issuance of separate summonses, Burkert was charged with and convicted of committing acts of harassment on discrete dates, January 8 and 11, 2011. However, a conviction under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) requires the finding of a \u201ccourse of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy.\u201d Neither the municipal court nor Law Division judge specifically found that Burkert engaged in a course of conduct or repeatedly committed acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The record soundly supports the municipal court\u2019s finding that Burkert circulated the flyers in the correctional facility\u2019s garage on January 8. Although the municipal court found that Burkert distributed the flyers discovered in the locker room on January 11, no testimony was offered that Burkert worked on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The record unquestionably supports the finding of the municipal court\u2014echoed by the Law Division\u2014that the bubble dialogue Burkert scribbled on Halton\u2019s wedding photograph was \u201clewd and obnoxious\u201d and seriously annoyed Halton as it would have any reasonable person. Burkert clearly intended to seriously annoy Halton because he believed that Halton\u2019s wife had insulted Bur-kert and members of his family on an internet website. The issue is not whether Burkert\u2019s expressive activity\u2014placing offensive dialogue on Halton\u2019s wedding photograph and then circulating the flyers\u2014was boorish, crude, utterly unprofessional, and hurtful. Of that there can be no doubt. Within a workplace setting, such conduct was grossly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">However, our task here is to determine whether Burkert violated a criminal statute. Even assuming that the circulation of the flyers constituted a course of conduct or repetitive acts, the State did not present sufficient evidence to support a conviction under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c). The flyers were intended to and did humiliate Halton. The flyers, however, did not threaten or menace him. Nothing in the record suggests that Halton\u2019s safety or security were put at risk by the flyers, or that any inmates got ahold of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The record, moreover, does not establish that Burkert had repeated unwanted communications with Halton. Burkert\u2019s only direct interaction with Halton concerning the flyers occurred on January 8. The rude and loutish dialogue on the flyers obliquely referred to a matter apparently of common knowledge among many corrections officers\u2014that Halton\u2019s former wife allegedly had relations with a corrections officer and inmate. Although Burkert displayed appalling insensitivity, he did not engage in repeated unwanted communications with Halton that intolerably interfered with his reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The facts in this case\u2014even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State\u2014do not satisfy the elements necessary for a subsection (c) violation of the harassment statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Having come to that conclusion does not foreclose other potential remedies or sanctions for the behavior at issue in this case. Indeed, workplace discipline was imposed on Burkert, and Halton filed a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division, which dismissed the harassment charges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, and TIMPONE join in JUSTICE ALBIN\u2019s opinion.

Inv\u2019rs Ins. Co., 65 N.J. 474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). \u201cHowever, legal issues are subject to de novo review; the appellate court owes no deference to legal conclusions drawn by the trial court.\u201d H.S.P. v. J.K., 223 N.J. 196, 215, 121 A.3d 849 (2015) (citing M.S. v. Millburn Police Dep\u2019t, 197 N.J. 236, 246 n.10, 962 A.2d 515 (2008)). Here, Burkert admitted under oath that he created, posted, and personally handed the offensive flyers to Halton. The trial court found that Burkert circulated the flyers in the parking garage of the correctional facility and in the employee locker room. Burkert further admitted under oath that he created and posted these flyers only \u201cas payback for what [Halton] did to [Burkert\u2019s] family.\u201d As the majority concedes, \u201cBurkert clearly intended to seriously annoy Halton.\u201d Ante at 286, 174 A.3d at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Burkert\u2019s conduct conflicts with the majority\u2019s enunciated requirements of subsection (c)(1)\u2014\u201cconstruing] the terms \u2018any other course of alarming conduct\u2019 and \u2018acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy1 as any repeated communications directed at a person that reasonably puts that person in fear for his safety or security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The flyers were copied and posted in the men\u2019s locker room and in the employee parking lot of Halton\u2019s place of employment, the Union County Jail, where Halton worked as a sergeant. As a sergeant, Halton had frequent contact with inmates and held a position of authority over other correctional officers. Moreover, Burkert knew Halton\u2019s position and duties within the jail because they worked together for twenty years. Thus, Burkert knew that Halton\u2019s safety could reasonably be threatened by posting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>flyers within the jail where co-workers and inmates could easily see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The content of the flyers, see ante at 265, 174 A.3d at 991, was such as to inspire mockery and potential disobedience by inmates. Halton testified that the flyers made him fearful because inmates might have seen or redistributed the flyers. Halton testified that \u201cinmates clean [the locker room] ... [s]o I was afraid that an inmate got a hold of it ... part of my anxiety [was] that they got a hold of it and they were showing it to all the inmates in the jail and that my authority was going to be undermined.\u201d Halton also testified that he felt the flyers undermined his authority with coworkers as well, which led him to fear that his safety at the jail was in jeopardy. As this Court stated in Cesare v. Cesare, although \u201ccourts should not consider the victim\u2019s actual fear, courts must still consider a plaintiffs individual circumstances and background in determining whether a reasonable person in that situation would have\u201d felt fearful. 154 N.J. 394, 403, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). Here, it was reasonable to find that Halton feared for his safety considering he worked in a position of authority in a county jail where Burkert distributed the two profane flyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">I now turn to the majority\u2019s contention that the flyers were not \u201crepeated communications.\u201d New Jersey jurisprudence has scant instruction on the boundaries of what constitutes \u201crepeated\u201d conduct in the context of harassment. What instruction is available points toward a broad definition of \u201crepeated communications.\u201d See N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(a)(2) (defining \u201c[r]epeatedly\u201d as conduct \u201con two or more occasions\u201d in the context of stalking); Webster\u2019s Second New College Dictionary 939 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \u201crepeat\u201d as \u201c[t]o do or say something again\u201d). Therefore, \u201crepeated\u201d conduct, as generally understood by a person of ordinary intelligence, is conduct done more than once. See State v. Goodwin, 224 N.J. 102, 112, 129 A.3d 316 (2016) (noting that, in construing statutes, courts \u201cascribe to the statutory words their ordinary meaning and significance\u201d and view those words in context (quoting State v. Crawley, 187 N.J. 440, 452, 901 A.2d 924 (2006))).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Although the majority does not directly cite to State v. Hoffman, 149 N.J. 564, 695 A.2d 236 (1997), to support a narrow construction of \u201crepeatedly,\u201d Hoffman must be distinguished to avoid confusion. In Hoffman, this Court did not come to its holding based on the number of mailings (two) the defendant sent to the victim. 149 N.J. at 583, 695 A.2d 236. Rather the Court found the two mailings were insufficient to run afoul of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a) because the mailings \u201cwere not sent anonymously, or at an extremely inconvenient hour, or in offensively coarse language\u201d\u2014 thus, the mailings did not invade the victim\u2019s privacy. Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">However, as noted by the majority, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) was modeled after Model Penal Code (MPC) Section 250.4(5). See State v. Robinson, 217 N.J. 594, 606, 92 A.3d 656 (2014). The comments to MPC Section 250.4(5) provide three illustrations of conduct that would fall within the subsection and be considered harassment. MPC \u00a7 250.4 cmt. 5 (Am. Law Inst. 1980). The illustrations include \u201cburning a cross on the lawn of a black family,\u201d \u201cleaving animal carcasses on a neighbor\u2019s stoop,\u201d and \u201cshining a spotlight into a parked car in order to embarrass or frighten the occupants.\u201d Ibid. Using the majority\u2019s logic in this case, the MPC illustrations would not be harassment if the perpetrator did not directly interact with the black family regarding the cross burning or if the spotlight shone into the car illuminated conduct that was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d to some of the community. The majority\u2019s interpretation adds unreasonable and illogical requirements to \u201crepeated communication\u201d under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Burkert\u2019s conduct also conflicts with the majority\u2019s new requirements for subsection (2)\u2014\u201crepeatedly makes unwanted communications to a subject that intolerably interfere with that person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d New Jersey recognizes a limited right to privacy in the workplace. See Stengart v. Loving Care Agency, Inc., 201 N.J. 300, 322, 990 A.2d 650 (2010) (finding plaintiff had reasonable expectation of privacy in \u201ce-mails ... exchanged with her attorney on her personal, password-protected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>web-based e-mail account, accessed on a company laptop\u201d); Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., 129 N.J. 81, 102, 609 A.2d 11 (1992) (finding employer\u2019s safety concerns could override employee\u2019s right to privacy in mandating drug testing in workplace); Bresocnik v. Gallegos, 367 N.J. Super. 178, 183, 842 A.2d 276 (App. Div. 2004) (finding \u201ca single hand-delivered letter to a work place does not illegally invade privacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">New Jersey also recognizes the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion. Hennessey, 129 N.J. at 94, 609 A.2d 11. Although that tort is not at issue here, its elements are instructive and are as follows: an \u201cintentional[ ] intrusion], physical ] or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns ... if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 652B (Am. Law Inst. 1977). Because New Jersey case law regarding privacy in the workplace focuses on the limits of illegal searches, intrusion upon seclusion is an illustrative parallel to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">I believe that, under New Jersey jurisprudence, it is clear that Halton had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his personal relationship with his wife. Included in that expectation of privacy is the expectation that his personal life would not be brought into his place of employment for all of his co-workers, and possibly inmates, to see, discuss, and ridicule. Furthermore, unlike cases that have balanced an employer or the public\u2019s interest against the employee\u2019s interest in privacy, the employer in this case does not have a competing interest. The flyers in this case served no overarching purpose or interest other than to harass Halton.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Thus, following subsection (2), Burkert\u2019s conduct constitutes the criminal act of harassment. The communications found in the flyers were \u201cunwanted\u201d by Halton. The communications were repeated, as previously discussed. And the communications \u201cintolerably interfere[d] with [Halton\u2019s] reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>It is clear to me that Burkert\u2019s conduct falls squarely within the prohibited conduct of N.J.S.A. 2C:33\u20141(c) as interpreted by the majority. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
