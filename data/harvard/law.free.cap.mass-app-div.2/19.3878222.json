This petition was filed .October 7, 1936, and Rule XXX of the Rules of the District Court, 1932 Ed. requires that the party seeking the establishment of a report \u201cmay within five days after such allowance . . . file with the clerk his petition verified by affidavit setting forth in full his claim for such a report and all of the facts material thereto\u201d, so that so much of the petition to establish a report as is based upon the allowance of the original report is not properly before us because not filed within five days of the allowance of the report, and for the further reason that the defendant by his action in moving to amend the report as allowed and filing copies of the report as required by Rule XXXT as allowed within fifteen days of its allowance and briefs in support of his contention has waived any right to the establishment of a report on the matters set forth in the report allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\">Regarding so much of the petition to establish a report as is based on the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to amend the report allowed by the trial judge, we cannot amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>report without the consent of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth v. Suffolk Trust Co., </em>161 Mass. 550; <em>Burbank v. Farnham, </em>220 Mass. 514, 516, 517; and no sufficient reason having been shown us that the trial judge was in error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion an order will be made affirming the denial of the motion and dismissing the petition to establish a report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
