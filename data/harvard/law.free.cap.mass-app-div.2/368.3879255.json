The allowance of the amendments would add nothing to that issue and in no way would change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The first question is whether the appointment in Massachusetts of an administratrix, after the action was brought, relates back and corrects the defect resulting from the bringing of the action in the name of a plaintiff who had died before the writ issued. <em>Brooks v. Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway Co., </em>211 Mass. 277, is final authority against the plaintiff on this point. Such an action has no legal existence when begun and cannot be given life by the subsequent appointment of the administrator. <em>Lewis v. Austin, </em>144 Mass. 383, is not in conflict with <em>Brooks v. Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway Co., </em>for the reasons specifically pointed out in the latter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The next question is whether the situation is in any way affected by the fact that at the time when the action was begun there was a duly appointed administratrix in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">This issue is discussed in detail in the opinion to be filed in this case, as the opinion of this Division, disposing of the report allowed by the trial judge. Briefly summarized, that opinion is to the effect that the administratrix ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>pointed in New Hampshire has no standing whatever in Massachusetts and as such cannot bring an action at law in this Commonwealth. <em>Goodwin v. Jones, </em>3 Mass. 514, at 518, 530; <em>Borden v. Borden, </em>5 Mass. 67 at 77; <em>Pond v. Makepeace, 2 </em>Metc. 114; <em>Gallup v. Gallup, </em>11 Metc. 445, at 447; <em>Cassidy v. Shimmin, </em>122 Mass. 406, at 412; <em>Brown v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>283 Mass. 192, at 195. The existence of the New Hampshire administration at the time the action was brought can in no way benefit the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">If, therefore, the plaintiff is not aided by either of the probate appointments upon which she relies, that of the New Hampshire administratrix before the beginning of the action, or that of the Massachusetts administratrix after the action was begun, it is futile to allow the motions now under consideration. They are therefore denied. <em>Fitch v. Jefferson, </em>175 Mass. 56; <em>Bishop, petr., </em>208 Mass. 405, at 407; <em>Koch, petr., </em>225 Mass. 148, at 150; <em>Commonwealth v. Vallarelli, </em>273 Mass. 240, at 247.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
