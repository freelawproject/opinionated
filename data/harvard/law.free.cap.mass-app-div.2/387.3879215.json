The reasons assigned for the dismissal of the report are,\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">1. The petition does not comply with Rule XXX of the Rules of the District Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in that it does not set forth in full the defendant\u2019s claim for a report and all of the facts material thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">2. The petition does not comply with Rule XXX of the Rules of the District Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in that the petition is not verified by an affidavit as required by the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">3. The petitioner has failed to comply with Rule XXX of the Rules of the District Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in that the petitioner has failed to send to the plaintiff a copy of the petition in the form required by the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The second ground assigned for the dismissal of the petition is the only ground necessary to be noted by the court as a reason for the granting of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Proceedings for the establishment of a report, being analogous to proceedings for the establishment of exceptions, must be regarded as <em>strictissimi juris. Bishop, Petitioner, </em>208 Mass. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Rule XXX aforesaid requires that such petition shall be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201cverified by affidavit setting forth in full his (the petitioner\u2019s) claim for such report and all of the facts material thereto. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">The defendant\u2019s oath supporting the petition in this case is that the facts stated in the affidavit are true \u201cto the best of her knowledge and belief.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>It has been held many times that the rule regarding verification must be strictly complied with. <em>Clemens Electrical Manufacturing Co. v. Walton, </em>168 Mass. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">The affidavit in this case fails to comply with this rule. It is not sufficient that it be verified as true to the best of petitioner\u2019s knowledge and belief, it must be verified as true. <em>Hadley v. Watson, </em>143 Mass. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The rule referred to further forbids the establishment of a report unless all the requirements relating thereto are complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">It is unnecessary to take up the further grounds set forth by the plaintiff in his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Consequently the defendant\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
