J., </em>Rowe, &amp; Sanborn, <em>JJ.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-8\"><em>J. Lipsitt, </em>for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-9\"><em>T. F.

L. Ch. 90, \u00a734A, providing for compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance extends the liability of an automobile owner so as to include any person who operates the automobile with his express or implied consent. In other words, that the pre-existing common law to the effect that one who is neither the servant nor agent of the owner, but an independent bailee, cannot by his negligence, charge the owner with responsibility, has been changed by the compulsory insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u2022 Whether a policy of liability insurance issued to the defendant in compliance with G. L, Ch. 90, \u00a734A, would afford protection to the plaintiff in an action against the operator under the circumstances of this case, need not be here considered. The sole question is whether the plaintiff can hold this defendant liable in damages for the injuries sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We are of the opinion that the statute in question requiring owners of automobiles to carry liability insurance, has not changed the substantive law of negligence. It does not render the owner of an automobile liable for damages caused by the negligence of one not his servant or agent. <em>McNeil vs. Powers, </em>266 Mass. 446; <em>Smith vs. Freedman, </em>268 Mass. 38; <em>Hobbs vs. Cunningham, </em>273 Mass. 529; <em>Bruce vs. Hanks, </em>277 Mass. 268; <em>Marshall vs. Hickey, </em>225 Mass. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">The question of agency was one of fact for the trial Court, and having found no agency or employment existed between the defendant and the operator of the automobile rightly found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
