I find further that the note was given in payment for the instruction to be given under the contract for which the plaintiff applied, but that no contract ever came into existence, and that there was a complete lack of ' consideration for the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASH\">\u201cThe defendant at the trial asked the plaintiff to produce a letter written by him to the plaintiff, without having previously notified the plaintiff that he desired the letter produced. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not have the letter and the defendant offered oral evidence of its contents. I received this evidence <em>de bene, </em>and on the plaintiff\u2019s motion I now exclude it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff presented three requests for rulings, all of which I deny. The introduction of the note made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, but the burden of proving consideration was on the plaintiff after evidence on the point was also introduced. <em>Wolff v. Perkins, 254 </em>Mass. 10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The two dates in the above finding appearing as \u201c193.6\u201d should appear as \u201c1934\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The Court found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\">The plaintiff had filed the following requests for rulings\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201c1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the reasons that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY0\">a. The introduction and admission in evidence of the note declared upon together with the defendant\u2019s admission that no payment other than the initial payment was ever made thereon, made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A43q\">h. The defendant introduced no evidence to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">2. The evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding by the Court that the defendant cancelled the contract before it was accepted by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">3. In view of the pleadings, if the Court should find that the contract was cancelled, such finding of cancellation will not bar the plaintiff from recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">These requests raise two questions, one a question of pl\u00e9ading, and the other a question whether the evidence was sufficient to justify the finding that the offer in the enrollment application was not accepted before withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">In <em>Davis v. Travis, </em>98 Mass. 222, it was held that lack of consideration might be shown under an answer containing simply a general denial. This seems to be conclusive on the question of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The plaintiff has the burden of proving that there was consideration for the note in question. The plaintiff made a <em>prima facie </em>case on this point by producing the note, which purports to be \u201cFor value received\u201d, and was signed by the defendant. However, this is a mere admission out of court, and like any other admission or receipt, is open to explanation or contradiction by evidence in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">The note and the enrollment application, although on separate pieces of paper, were parts of one transaction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The application was signed by the defendant, but it did not purport to be a contract until it was accepted by the plaintiff. The application now bears an acceptance dated Aug. 7, 1934. It is elementary that the offer could be withdrawn at any time before acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">The defendant testified that he had made one payment, to wit, the sum of $5. at the time of the execution of the application and note herein referred to and that he made no further payments. Defendant further testified that the day following the execution of both the aforementioned papers he sent a special delivery letter directed to the plaintiff which he never received back, and which it was agreed should have in the usual course reached the plaintiff on August 5th; that he subsequently received from the plaintiff a certificate of enrollment dated August 13th, in the school of the plaintiff, and a letter also dated August 13th, which acknowledged receipt of the defendant\u2019s letter and referred to it \u201cas your letter requesting cancellation\u201d, which letter may be referred to at the time of argument before the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">There was no evidence that the plaintiff gave notice prior to August 13, 1934, that it had accepted the defendant\u2019s offer, and it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show such acceptance prior to the withdrawal of the offer. Without proof of such acceptance as to convert the enrollment application into a binding contract there was no consideration for the note in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We find no prejudicial error in the refusal to rule as requested, and the report must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
