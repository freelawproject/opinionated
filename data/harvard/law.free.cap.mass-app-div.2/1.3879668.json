From the facts: that the defendant lived with his family of which he was the head, in a one-family house; that the dog in question was kept at said house and in the lot of land appurtenant thereto; and that the said dog was licensed in the name of the defendant; there should be a finding that the defendant was a keeper of said dog.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b10-8\">2. The alleged defense that the plaintiff claimed and accepted workmen\u2019s compensation should not be considered by the Court under the defendant\u2019s answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b10-9\">3. ' The burden is on the defendant to prove by a fair preponderance of evidence as a matter of confession and avoidance that the plaintiff claimed and accepted workmen\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>4. </em>The report made by the plaintiff to the Town of Watertown relative to his injury in the form introduced in evidence is not of itself a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-3\">5. On the evidence that the plaintiff took a vacation and that the records of the Town of Watertown show that the said vacation commenced at one o \u2019clock in the afternoon of the day on which the plaintiff was injured, if believed by the Court, there should be a finding that the plaintiff did not intend to claim workmen\u2019s compensation, and that the Town knew or should have known of that intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-4\">6. Payment by the Town of Watertown from its workmen\u2019s compensation fund to doctors for services rendered to the plaintiff is not a bar to this action, unless the plaintiff knew that the payments were made out of the said fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-5\">7. Without the plaintiffs assent thereto, payment by the Town of Watertown from its workmen\u2019s compensation fund to doctors for services rendered to the plaintiff is not a bar to this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-6\">8. The fact that the plaintiff took a vacation from his work while incapacitated from performing his usual work should not be considered by the Court to diminish the plaintiff\u2019s damages for impairment of his capacity to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b11-7\">9. If the Court finds for the plaintiff, then the amount of the damages sustained should be ascertained, and damages awarded for double that amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b11-8\">The court did not pass upon the rulings, but made a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-9\">The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the failure of the court to pass upon his requests for rulings in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-10\">Eule XXVII of the District Court Eules (1932) at Page 35 provides that, \u201cDecisions of the trial Justice as to all requests for rulings duly filed shall be in writing and shall be included in the report as allowed or established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b11-11\">The failure of the trial court to pass upon the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings must be interpreted \u201cas meaning that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the requests were refused.\u201d <em>Hetherington &amp; Sons v. Wm. Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-3\">The principle has been laid down by repeated decisions that a trial judge sitting without a jury must correctly instruct himself as to the governing rules of law and must pass upon pertinent requests for rulings of law presented to bim for this purpose in such a way as to make plain that he has not fallen into error. <em>George W. Povey vs. Colonial Beacon Oil Co., </em>Mass. Adv. Sh. (1936) 767, 773. <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons Lt\u2019d. v. Wm. Firth, </em>210 Mass. 8, 19. <em>Castano v. Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429, 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-4\">It is apparent that if any of the plaintiff\u2019s nine requests for rulings should have been given a new trial must be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-5\">A number of the requests for rulings deal with the application of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to this action and while the Trial Judge may have found the facts rendered such requests inapplicable, in the absence of a statement to that effect, we are unable to say that they were denied for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-6\">The sixth request <em>i. e. </em>\u201cPayment by the Town of Water-town from its workmen\u2019s compensation fund to doctors for services rendered to the plaintiff is not a bar to this action, unless the plaintiff knew that the payments were made out of the said fund,\u201d is a correct statement of law and should have been given. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) C. 152 \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-7\">In view of the fact that a new trial is ordered, it becomes unnecessary to pass upon the other requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-8\">New trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
