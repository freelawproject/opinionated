Municipal Court of the City of Boston</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AcE\">Argued November 16, 1936</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXB\">Opinion filed April 27, 1937.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b275-8\">Present: Bolster, <em>C.

Defendant would not have been entitled to a ruling that the Statute was as a matter of law a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Gen. Laws Ch. 260 \u00a712 (Ter. Ed.) provides that \u201cIf a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it, the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d The agreed facts would warrant a finding that defendant had fraudulently concealed from the plaintiffs the cause of action against him, which plaintiffs did not discover till February, 1932. <em>Connelly v. Bartlett, </em>286 Mass, at p. 317 <em>et seq. </em>and cases cited. <em>Jekshewitz v. Groswald, </em>265 Mass. 413 at 417-3. The cases cited by defendant <em>Stoneham Five Cents Savings Bank v. Johnson et al., </em>1935 Advance Sheets p. 1769; <em>State National Bank of Lynn v. Beacon Trust Co., </em>267 Mass. 355, do not conflict with our view of the possible application of G. L. Ch. 260 \u00a7 12 (Ter. Ed.) to the conclusions warrantably to be reached by the court on a trial of the merits under the right reserved. The ruling requested by the plaintiffs, in effect, that on the agreed facts they were not barred by the Statute of Limitations \u201cas a matter of law\u201d should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">The ruling reported is somewhat like that considered in <em>Woods v. Pease, </em>No. 11354 (49-36) App. Div. Rep. It is somewhat uncertain whether it meant, and whether the judge understood it to mean, that the law forbade him, on the agreed facts, to sustain the plea, or merely that the law permitted, but did not require him to find concealment of the cause of action which would defeat the bar of the statute. Such dubious use of language in requests ought to be discouraged. It would not have been difficult to draft a request which would have contained no uncertainty of meaning. But the judge denied the request without comment, and found generally for the defendant. We think in the interest of justice that the case should be re-tried, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts\u201d permits a finding of fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">In view of the position taken by the defendant in argument that although the plaintiffs did not know, they \u201cought to have known\u201d what the interest rate actually was, it may be observed that, while a failure to know what a man of normal intelligence would know may be held equivalent to real knowledge when it induces an innocent change of position, there is little justice in letting one who has cheated another say that the latter ought to have known sooner than he did that he had been cheated, so as to give the cheater a legal escape from his own fraud. He has not innocently changed his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The finding for the defendant should be vacated and there should be a New Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
