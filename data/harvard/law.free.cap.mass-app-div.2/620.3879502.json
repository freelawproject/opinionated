The only ones which the defendants have argued that the judge, erred in denying are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">4. The defendants\u2019 duty is only to use ordinary care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for the use of tenants and their customers, and the defendants are not insurers of their safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">5. Where, without action for which he is responsible, a dangerous condition arises on premises operated by a landlord, the law allows a landlord reasonable opportunity to become informed of the danger and to take measures to remedy it; and a landlord, in such a case is not liable unless he is negligent in failing- to infer himself and to take appropriate action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendants also contend that the plaintiff was not, as matter of law, in the exercise of due care. This argument is not now open to the defendants since no Request for a Ruling of Law on this phase of the case was presented to or passed upon by the trial judge nor has his ruling upon the matter been reported by him. (See, however, <em>Faxon vs. Butler, </em>206 Mass. 500 and <em>Maran vs. Peabody, </em>228 Mass. 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We do not think that the judge was bound to give the defendants \u2019 fifth Request for Ruling as it was predicated in part on facts which were not in evidence or which need not have been found by the trial judge. The defendants \u2019 duty was to use due care to see that the hallway was lighted. <em>Faxon vs. Butler, </em>206 Mass. 500 at 504, citing <em>Lindsey vs. Leighton, </em>150 Mass. 285, 288. A ruling may be right al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>though a wrong reason he assigned therefor. <em>Reilly vs. Selectmen of Blackstone, </em>266 Mass. 503, 512 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">The denial of the defendants\u2019 fourth Bequest for the reason assigned, however, raises a troublesome question for decision. It was said in <em>Povey vs. Colonial Beacon Oil Co., </em>Mass. A. S. (1936) 767 at 773, \u201cThe principle has been laid down by repeated decisions that a trial judge sitting without a jury must correctly instruct himself as to the governing rules of law and must pass upon pertinent requests for rulings of law presented to him for this purpose in such a way as to make plain that he has not fallen into error. <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. vs. William Firth &amp; Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, <em>19. Castano vs. Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429, 431. There is no formula for the disposition of requests for relevant rulings which can dull the edge of this judicial duty.\u201d And again in <em>Adamaitis vs. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>Mass. A. S. (1936) 1601 at 1604, \u201cThe trial judge in a case like the present performs a dual function. He must adopt correct rules of law for his guidance and find the facts as guided by these rules. And upon proper requests therefor he must state the rules of law adopted by him for his guidance as a trier of fact in. order that the right of review thereof may be preserved. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The trial judge denied the defendants\u2019 fourth Bequest above quoted, \u201cas inapplicable as the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not based upon a defective condition of the stairway.\u201d It is true that the defendants\u2019 only claim of negligence was that the lights lighting the stairway where she fell were out at the time of her fall and based her right to recover for this negligence of the defendants on the ground that the defendants had assumed the obligation of keeping the stairway in question lighted. However, this obligation which the defendants had assumed did not put upon them a different degree of care in respect to the lighting of the stair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>way than, it did in' r\u00e9spect to- other conditions of the premises in question. They'were under no\u2019obligation to light the stairway unless they, had undertaken to do so by express or implied agreement or were bound to-do so by statutory provisions. <em>Sodekson vs. Lynch, et al., </em>Mass. A. S. (1937) 979 at 980 and cases cited. See also <em>Stone vs. Lewis, </em>215 Mass. 594. Tn the case at bar, the trial judge found that the defendants had assumed the duty of lighting this stairway. Having assumed this duty, the defendants were bound to take reasonable care that the premises they had undertaken to keep lighted were safe and suitable at all times for all persons- who were lawfully using the premises., An instruction to this effect was approved in <em>Marwedel vs. Cook, </em>154 Mass. 235, 236, one of the leading cases dealing with a landlord\u2019s duty to light the premises. While the duty to light leased premises, apart from statutory obligation, rests on contract, express or implied, the landlord is not an insurer and the right to recover for a violation of such contract, obligation depends upon negligence. <em>Gallagher vs. Murphy, </em>221 Mass. 363. This seems to have been assumed in <em>Marwedel vs. Cook </em>above, cited, in <em>Faxon vs. Butler, </em>206 Mass. 500 at 504, and in <em>Maran vs. Peabody, </em>228 Mass. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">It is true that the- , trial judge concluded his Finding of Facts as follows: . \u201cThat in order to render the lower part of the stairway reasonably safe for the plaintiff\u2019s use at the time of the accident, the defendants should have provided artificial light in .pursuance of the obligation they had assumed; and that the defendants were negligent in failing to perform, the duty they had assumed.\u201d This follows closely the.language of the court in <em>Maran vs. Peabody, </em>228 Mass. 432, 434, 435, and has a tendency to .indicat\u00e9 that the trial judge had-the correct principles -of law in mind in determining the liability of the defendants. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the other hand, the reason assigned for the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s fourth Request might indicate that he felt that a different rule respecting negligence applied in the ease at bar than to one in which the unsafe condition of the stairway resulted from a defect rather than a failure to keep lighted in performance of an assumed duty. On the record we cannot feel sure that the trial judge had the correct principles of law in mind in view of his refusal of the defendants \u2019 fourth Request, which adequately stated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">Accordingly, we cannot say that the error in dealing with the defendants \u2019 fourth Request did not affect the result of the case and, consequently, conclude that a new trial should be had and it is so ordered.
