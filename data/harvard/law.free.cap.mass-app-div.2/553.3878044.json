The defendant stands defaulted. The City of Boston was duly summoned as trustee; the original writ being served on it January 9,1936 and again on January 27,1936. Later, special precepts of attachment by trustee process were issued. These were served on the trustee on June 25, 1936; June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>26, 1936; June 29, 1936, September 8, 1936. After each service upon it the trustee filed \u201cno funds\u201d answers. Thereafter the plaintiff filed interrogatories to the said trustee. These were answered in part. Later, the plaintiff filed \u201callegations of fact\u201d on which a, hearing was had and testimony received. In due time the plaintiff presented eight requests for rulings, all of which the court denied. The court, thereupon, found \u201cthat the trustee was, not chargeable; denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge the trustee, and allowed the trustees\u2019 motion to discharge it.\u201d It becomes unnecessary to consider the court\u2019s treatment of all of the requests it denied as we have concluded that in denying the plaintiff\u2019s sixth request it committed reversible error. This request asked the court to rule that \u201cas matter of law, the court would be warranted in allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion, to charge the trustee\u201d. The situation here presented is, in principle, similar to that considered in the case of <em>Bresnick v. Heath, </em>A. S. (1935) 2297, at 2301, where the denial of a like request was considered. It was there pointed out that the plaintiff in making such a request \u201cwas seeking a ruling that there was evidence sufficient to justify a finding in his favor. He was entitled to that ruling or to a statement of finding of facts showing that the requested ruling had become irrelevant. \u2014 A finding of facts in favor of the defendant was supportable on the evidence, \u2014 but the record does not show that the ultimate decision may not have been due to the erroneous view of law of the trial judge expressed by his denial of request 6. That is an error which this court cannot correct except by reversing the decision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">In the case before us the trustee has baldly answered that it had no funds of the defendant at any of the times the process was served upon it. These bald answers, together with the testimony most favorable to the trustee given at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the hearing of the issues arising out of the allegation of facts might have justified the court\u2019s action in refusing to charge the trustee, cf. <em>Dennison v. Swerdlove, </em>250 Mass. 507, 509. Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) Ch. 246, \u00a716. But such answers are not conclusive where, as here, testimony is received on issues presented by allegations of fact \u201cnot stated or denied by the trustee\u201d, if the testimony shows that the trustee could be charged. Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) Ch. 246, \u00a716. Questions of fact \u201carising upon sueh allegations\u201d are to be tried and determined by the court. Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) Ch. 246, \u00a717. The language of the statute imports that the court is to pass upon the weight of the testimony offered to it on the issues arising out of the allegations of fact; the burden of proof being upon the plaintiff to show that the trustee should be charged. <em>Krogman v. Rice Bros. Co., </em>241 Mass. 295, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">If the court found that the plaintiff had shown, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the trustee had funds due the defendant at the time it was served with process, it could have charged the trustee though the funds represented wages due the defendant as a schoolteacher of the trustee. <em>North American Finance Co. v. O\u2019Connor &amp; Tr., </em>No. 331598 (of 1933) Municipal Court of the City of Boston, 40 App. Div. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The evidence reported warranted findings \u201cthat the defendant during the school year 1935-1936 was employed \"by the City of Boston as a schoolteacher at a salary in excess of $2400 per year; and was assigned to the continuation school and taught therein during that year; that the Boston Schools, including the continuation school, opened in September, 1935 and closed for the school year on June 24,1936; that the defendant, under her contract, taught at the continuation school from the time the school opened in September, 1935, to the time it closed on June 24, 1936; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>after June 24, 1936, some of the teachers in that school were subject to be called back on June 25, 1936, for some work to be done at the school on that particular day, but that after that date, they were not to be and were not called back to perform any services until the opening of the school year, which began in September, 1936\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">The trustee\u2019s answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories warranted further findings that the defendant had been paid monthly up to June 25, 1936, but that she had \u201cnot been paid any money from June 25, 1936 up to and including August 25, 1936\u201d; that on August 28, 1936, the defendant \u201cwas paid $208 on account of the contract for the school year, 1935-1936\u201d, and had not been paid again until September 28,1936 when she was paid $205. Whether the contract alluded to was oral or in writing does .not appear. Neither does it appear that the defendant and the trustee specifically contracted for monthly payments on account of the \u201csalary in excess of $2400.00 per year\u201d. It does appear that the defendant had been paid on a monthly basis up to June, 1936, and for the months of August and September of that year. The Act of 1935, Ch. 350, requires weekly payments to City employees, unless \u201cthe employee requests in writing to be paid in a different manner\u201d. The court could assume that the City officials made the contract in conformity to the requirements of the statute; <em>Ransom v. Boston, </em>192 Mass. 299, 307, <em>Knowles v. Boston, </em>12 Gray 339, that the defendant had requested in writing to be paid monthly and had been so paid by reason of that request. In the absence of contrary evidence, there is a presumption that one has complied with statutory requirements. <em>Stauffer v. Koch, </em>225 Mass. 525. <em>Karpowicz v. Mansas, </em>275 Mass. 413, 419. cf. <em>Silvia v. The Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>252 Mass. 328, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, aided by the presumptions above referred to and the reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>enees that could be drawn from the testimony would warrant a court finding that on September 8, 1936 (when the trustee was last served) there was some money due the defendant from the trustee, and that it was due \u201cabsolutely and without any contingency\u201d. This finding would warrant a court\u2019s granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge the trustee. Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) Ch. 246, \u00a724.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">It, therefore, appears that the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s 6th request was prejudicial error. The order therefore is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">(1) The court\u2019s order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge the trustee be, and is, hereby vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">(2) The court\u2019s order discharging the trustee be, and is, hereby vacated.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
