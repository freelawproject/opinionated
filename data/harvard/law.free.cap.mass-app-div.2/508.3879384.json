The writ was dated December 17, 1935. The defendant\u2019s second request, which the court refused, was:\u2014 <em>\u201c2. </em>The plaintiff failed to bring suit against the defendant within six (6) years from the date the alleged cause of action accrued and therefore such alleged action is barred by the Statute of Limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">No written findings of facts are reported. Finding was for the plaintiff in the sum of $111.20 with interest from February 10, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The only conclusion we can draw from the rulings and findings is that the court construed the instrument to be a promissory note. Such a construction, we think was error. <em>Sloan vs. McCarty, </em>134 Mass. 245, <em>Central National Bank vs. Hubbel, </em>258 Mass. 124, <em>Pierce Etc. Mfg. Co. vs. Daniel Russell Boiler Works, </em>262 Mass. 242 at 245. The two latter eases are cited by the plaintiff. It attempts to distinguish them from <em>Sloan vs. McCarty, </em>but those cases distinctly affirm the first case. In <em>Central National Bank vs. Hubbel </em>the court says \u201cwe * * * regard it as binding.\u201d We are of the opinion that the instrument in question is a conditional sale contract, and that the twenty year period of limitations does not apply. General Statutes Ch. 155, \u00a74 is substantial the same as the present G. L. 260, \u00a71.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">However, if the court could have found for the plaintiff on a correct ruling of law, in other words if the giving of defendant\u2019s first request was error, and the result was correct it will not be set aside. <em>Ryder vs. Warren, </em>1936 Adv. Sh. 1437, <em>Lincoln Park Garage vs. Devonshire Fin. Ser. Corpn., </em>277 Mass. 303 at 305. <em>Walker vs. Nickerson, </em>1935 Adv. Sh. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The plaintiff argues that the cause of action did not accrue until February 10, 1930, the date when the last instalment was due, and from which date the court found interest to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">It is argued that the default on July 10, 1929, did not automatically cause the whole amount to become due, but the plaintiff contends that the clause in the instrument which says, \u201cthe full amount unpaid herein shall thereupon become due and payable forthwith,\u201d merely gave the plaintiff the right to enforce payment of the full amount upon default of any instalment. That the plaintiff could and did waive that right, and hence its cause of action finally accrued when the last instahnent fell due.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>. It seems, to us that any definite act of. waiver would he binding on the creditor, and we are inclined to agree with those jurisdictions which hold that failure by the creditor to enforce the '.provision of acceleration of payment operates as a waiver, on the ground that the provision is for the benefit of the creditor. 37 Corpus Juris Sec. 211 and cases collected in foot notes. See also <em>Porter vs. Harrington, </em>262 Mass. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">We are therefore of the opinion that the court reached the correct result and that there was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The order, therefore, is</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Report Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
