BRODY, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">Plaintiffs A.F. of L.-A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan (\u201cAFL\u201d), IBEW-NECA Local 505 Health &amp; Welfare Plan (\u201cIBEW\u201d), Painters District Council No. 30 Health &amp; Welfare Fund (\u201cPainters\u201d), and Andrea Kehoe (\u201cKehoe\u201d), collectively \u201cIndirect Purchasers,\u201d are indirect purchasers of the prescription drug Flonase and its generic equivalent. Flonase is the brand-name version of fluticasone propionate (\u201cFP\u201d) \u2014 a steroid nasal spray produced by Defendant SmithKline Beecham Corporation, doing business as GlaxoSmithKline PLC (\u201cGSK\u201d). Indirect Purchasers allege that GSK filed sham citizen petitions with the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) to delay the entry of a cheaper, generic version of Flonase into the market. Indirect Purchasers have moved to certify a class of consumers and third-party payors (\u201cTPPs\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the monopolization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>unfair and deceptive trade practices (\u201cUDTP\u201d), and unjust enrichment laws of five states.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also before me are three <em>Daubert </em>motions seeking to exclude expert reports and testimony critical to this class certification determination: (1) GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude the Expert Report and Testimony of Gordon Rausser; (2) Indirect Purchasers\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Report and Testimony of Bruce Stangle; and (3) Indirect Purchasers\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Report and Testimony of Robert Navarro.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">GSK asserts that Indirect Purchasers have failed to meet certain requirements for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \u2014 in particular, that common issues do not predominate over individual issues for purposes of establishing antitrust impact and damages. GSK contends that only through individual proof and inquiries can the fact of injury or the extent of damage for each class member\u2019s purchase and/or reimbursement of Flonase or its generic equivalent be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">I am satisfied that Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated that common issues will predominate and that the Rule 23 requirements have been met. In reaching that conclusion, however, certain adjustments to Indirect Purchasers\u2019 proposed class definition will be necessary. As opposed to the larger proposed class, a more limited indirect purchaser class will be certified that excludes those class members who did not purchase a generic equivalent of Flonase after it became available. Furthermore, I will only certify the class under the state laws which Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated standing to invoke. Therefore, I will grant in part and deny in part Indirect Purchasers\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">I. Background <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">A. <em>Hatch-Waxman and the Generic Drug Approval Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">In order to market a drug in the United States, a company must obtain FDA approval by filing a \u201cNew Drug Application\u201d (\u201cNDA\u201d) to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b). The NDA process is usually lengthy and expensive, and in 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (\u201cHatch-Waxman Act\u201d) to expedite the approval process for generic drugs. Under Hatch-Waxman, to receive FDA approval for a generic drug, a prospective manufacturer need only file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d), which relies on the safety and efficacy data previously provided in the NDA for its branded equivalent. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j). Instead of clinical trials, an ANDA requires a demonstration of a certain level of bioequivalence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a listed drug. The FDA issues and regularly modifies bioe-quivalence guidance for various categories of generic drugs in order to inform the public of the bioequivalenee standards that ANDAs must meet in order to be approved. Generic drugs certified by the FDA as bioequivalent to the brand drug are completely interchangeable with that branded drug and are referred to as \u201cAB-rated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">While an ANDA is pending before the FDA, any interested party can file a citizen petition with the FDA to register a complaint about the pending application. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 10.25(a), 10.30. Until 2007, the FDA was required to consider and respond to every citizen petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For this reason, filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>citizen petition necessarily delayed the approval of any pending ANDA \u2014 only after the FDA responded to all pending citizen petitions could an ANDA be approved. The citizen petition process often was abused by pharmaceutical companies attempting to prolong their monopoly in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">B. <em>Flonase and GSK\u2019s Alleged Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In October 1994, the FDA approved GSK\u2019s NDA to treat nasal inflammation caused by seasonal and non-seasonal allergies. GSK released Flonase in the United States in 1995, and it quickly became the most prescribed nasal steroid inhalant in the United States. By 2000, Flonase commanded 38% of brand-name inhaled nasal steroid sales in the United States, resulting in over $600 million in sales. By 2005, the peak year for Flonase sales and the last full year of GSK\u2019s market exclusivity, Flonase sales exceeded $1.3 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">GSK\u2019s single patent on Flonase expired on November 13, 2003. However, GSK obtained a statutory extension of market exclusivity from the FDA to August 2004. By the time Flonase\u2019s market exclusivity was set to expire in 2004, GSK had identified a number of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2014 including Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cRox-ane\u201d) \u2014 intent on filing ANDAs and bringing competitive generic FP nasal sprays to the market. This case concerns GSK\u2019s alleged \u201cbrand maturation strategy,\u201d crafted to maintain Flonase\u2019s market dominance in the face of inevitable generic competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Indirect Purchasers offer evidence that GSK\u2019s alleged \u201cbrand maturation strategy\u201d included four tactics to delay the entry of generic FP nasal sprays into the market: (1) GSK improperly influenced the FDA\u2019s bioe-quivalence guidance process; (2) GSK filed several frivolous citizen petitions with the FDA regarding pending generic FP ANDAs in order to force the FDA to respond and delay approval; (3) GSK drafted an FP monograph for submission to the United States Pharmacopeia \u2014 which lists tests, procedures, and acceptance criteria in order to set standards for the quality, purity, strength, and consistency of the pharmaceutical ingredients in an approved drug \u2014 in attempt to raise the bar for FP market entry; and (4) GSK supplemented its original NDA in an attempt to delay the FDA from approving any ANDAs before approving GSK\u2019s supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Roxane\u2019s generic version of Flonase did not enter the market until March 6, 2006. Indirect Purchasers argue that GSK used each of these four tactics to delay the market entry of AB-rated generic equivalents of Flo-nase, and that, absent GSK\u2019s exclusionary conduct, generic FP would have entered the market in August 2004. As a result, Indirect Purchasers claim that they were prevented from purchasing and/or reimbursing for less-expensive generic FP between August 2004 and March 2006, and that they were forced to pay inflated prices for generic FP between March 2006 and March 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">C. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">Indirect Purchasers initiated this case in September 2008. In December 2011, they filed their motion for class certification now before me. During this time, as a result of two Third Circuit opinions and GSK\u2019s filing of several motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, the claims and issues presented in this motion for class certification have been narrowed to a significant degree. A review of this procedural history follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">On September 3, 2008, Indirect Purchasers filed a first amended class action complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) against GSK asserting claims of monopolization, UDTP, and unjust enrichment under numerous state laws. On October 17, 2008, GSK moved to dismiss the FAC. In addressing this motion on April 15, 2009, I concluded that it was appropriate to analyze issues regarding Indirect Purchasers\u2019 standing prior to class certification. I granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>GSK\u2019s motion for two reasons: (1) although Indirect Purchasers could establish standing to bring their claims in the states where they resided or had a principal place of business, they failed to state a claim under any of those state laws; and (2) Indirect Purchasers could not establish standing merely by relying on claims of putative class members. <em>See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>610 F.Supp.2d 409, 413 (E.D.Pa.2009) (\u201cUnless at least one named Plaintiff can state a claim for relief under each count Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring claims as part of a putative class action.\u201d). I dismissed the FAC without prejudice, so that Indirect Purchasers could amend their complaint and, as Indirect Purchasers specifically noted, \u201cnamed Plaintiffs from additional states could join the ease\u201d to address issues of standing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">On May 21, 2009, Indirect Purchasers filed a second amended class action complaint (\u201cSAC\u201d) asserting state law claims under the laws of seven states and adding Kehoe, an individual consumer from Massachusetts, as a named plaintiff. GSK moved to dismiss the SAC by again contending that Indirect Purchasers had not sufficiently plead an injury to have standing to bring their state law claims, or, alternatively, failed to state a claim under those state laws. On January 21, 2010,1 held that Indirect Purchasers had sufficiently plead standing \u201cin states where they reside, and where they purchased Flo-nase or reimbursed for purchases of Flo-nase.\u201d <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>692 F.Supp.2d 524, 534 (E.D.Pa.2010). Additionally, <em>inter alia, </em>Indirect Purchasers\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under Florida law was dismissed because, unlike most unjust enrichment state law, Florida requires that a plaintiff confer a direct benefit upon a defendant in order to state a claim for unjust enrichment. <em>Id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Indirect Purchasers filed a third amended class action complaint (\u201cTAC\u201d) on March 1, 2010, asserting the following state law claims: monopolization under the laws of Arizona, Iowa, North Carolina, and Wisconsin; (2) unfair and deceptive trade practices under the laws of Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, and North Carolina; and (3) unjust enrichment under the laws of Arizona, Iowa, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin. GSK subsequently filed three different motions for summary judgment in October 2010. I denied GSK\u2019s motions for summary judgment on <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>and causation grounds in June and July 2010, respectively. GSK\u2019s third motion for summary judgment against Indirect Purchasers rested on the following three arguments: (1) Indirect Purchasers failed to provide sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they have standing to bring their state law claims; (2) choice of law rules require that the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims be governed by the laws of their home states, rather than the laws of the states in which they purchased and/or reimbursed for purchases of Flonase; and (3) Indirect Purchasers failed to provide sufficient evidence to support several of their state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">On September 26, 2011, I granted in part and denied in part GSK\u2019s motion. In addressing GSK\u2019s standing argument, I again noted that in a class action, \u201c[t]he initial inquiry ... is whether the lead plaintiff individually has standing.\u201d <em>Winer Family Trust v. Queen, </em>503 F.3d 319, 326 (3d Cir.2007); <em>see also O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). And although GSK\u2019s standing contentions had previously been addressed, at the summary judgment stage the standing inquiry changed because Indirect Purchasers could no longer rely on their allegations; instead, they needed to put forth evidence to establish standing. <em>See Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, </em>497 U.S. 871, 902, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990). Considering this burden, I granted GSK\u2019s motion as to the following named Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of standing: (1) IABORI\u2019s monopolization and UDTP claims under North Carolina law and (2) Painters\u2019 monopolization and unjust enrichment claims under Iowa law; and (3) Painters\u2019 UDTP claim under Florida law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>I also conducted a thorough choice of law analysis and concluded that Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims were best considered under the laws of the states in which Flonase or its generic equivalent were purchased (the \u201cpurchase states\u201d), as opposed to the states in which Indirect Purchasers resided or had a principal place of business (the \u201chome states\u201d). <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>815 F.Supp.2d 867, 882-85 (E.D.Pa.2011). Finally, GSK\u2019s motion was granted as to Painters\u2019 Arizona UDTP claim because no genuine issue of fact had been raised regarding whether GSK had deceived Indirect Purchasers as required under Arizona UDTP law. <em>Id. </em>at 885-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Indirect Purchasers have since filed a fourth amended class action complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The following named Plaintiffs and state law claims remain<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Type of Claim State Relevant Plaintiff(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">Monopolization Arizona Painters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">Monopolization Wisconsin Painters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">UDTP Florida AFL, IBEW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-18\">UDTP Massachusetts Kehoe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-21\">Unjust Enrichment Arizona Painters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-24\">Unjust Enrichment Massachusetts Kehoe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-27\">Unjust Enrichment Wisconsin Painters</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-30\">In December 2011, Indirect Purchasers moved for class certification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>22, 2012, a hearing was held to establish the parameters of the class sought for certification. In that hearing, Indirect Purchasers generally asserted that: (1) the laws of North Carolina, GSK\u2019s home state, should be applied for choice of law purposes, and (2) their proposed class could consist of class members in states where no named plaintiff had established standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">With regard to choice of law, for the reasons set forth in my September 26, 2011 opinion on GSK\u2019s motion for summary judgment and stated on the record in the February 22, 2012 hearing, I find that the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims are best considered under the laws of the states where they either purchased FP, or where TPP\u2019s plan members purchased FP and were reimbursed for those purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Regarding standing and class certification, the Third Circuit has held that \u201cto be a class representative on a particular claim, the plaintiff himself must have a cause of action on that claim.\u201d <em>Zimmerman v. HBO Affiliate, </em>834 F.2d 1163, 1169 (3d Cir.1987). Although Indirect Purchasers are correct that named plaintiffs may generally represent other plaintiffs with common but not identical claims, <em>see Sullivan, </em>667 F.3d at 302, Indirect Purchasers cannot attempt to expand their class to include states in which no named plaintiff has demonstrated injury after the completion of discovery and three rounds of dispositive motions addressing the issue of standing. <em>See Griffin v. Dugger, </em>823 F.2d 1476, 1483 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cEach claim must be analyzed separately, and a claim cannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one plaintiff has suffered the injury that gives rise to that claim.\u201d); <em>In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., </em>779 F.Supp.2d 642, 657 (E.D.Mich.2011) (detailing the numerous federal district courts that have held that named plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims under the laws of the states in which they do no reside or in which they suffered no injury); <em>In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litigation, </em>260 F.R.D. 143, 156-158 (E.D.Pa. 2009) (reviewing extensively the applicable case law and subsequently rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that named plaintiffs with standing in one state may represent absent plaintiffs from states in which the named plaintiff does not have standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Therefore, as a result of my choice of law and standing decisions, and as stated on the record in the February 22, 2012 hearing, I find that the indirect purchaser class can only consist of individuals and entities that purchased and/or reimbursed for FP in Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin (the \u201cclass states\u201d) \u2014 states in which at least one named plaintiff has demonstrated injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">From February 27-29, 2012, a hearing was held on Indirect Purchasers\u2019 motion for class certification, with both sides offering the testimony of their respective experts, and the three <em>Daubert </em>motions lodged against each expert. The parties have since filed post-hearing briefs, particularly focused on whether Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated that common issues predominate over individual issues for purposes of establishing antitrust impact and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">II. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Subsection (a) of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 lists four prerequisites for any class action: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Subsection (b) specifies additional requirements for each type of class action. For certification under subsection (b)(3), the movant must also show \u201cthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). These requirements are called predominance and superiority.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">In <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>the Third Circuit clarified the standard of review for motions for class certification. The court held that \u201cproper analysis under Rule 23 requires rigorous consideration of all the evidence and arguments offered by the parties.\u201d <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., </em>552 F.3d 305, 321 (3d Cir.2008). A district court must \u201cconsider carefully all relevant evidence and make a definitive determination that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met before certifying a class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Further, \u201cthe court must resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to class certification, even if they overlap with the merits ... [and] [factual determinations necessary to make Rule 23 findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 320. Finally, \u201c[w]eighing conflicting expert testimony at the certification stage is not only permissible; it may be integral to the rigorous analysis Rule 23 demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323. \u201c[A] district court may find it unnecessary to consider certain expert opinion with respect to a certification requirement, but it may not decline to resolve a genuine legal or factual dispute\u201d relevant to class certification. <em>Id. </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The following are certified as a class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for the class period of August 2004 through March 2009:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">A. <em>With respect to the monopolization and UDTP claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">(1) <em>For the Class Period from August 2004 through March 2006</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">All persons or entities throughout the United States and its territories who from August 2004 through March 2006 purchased, paid for, and/or reimbursed for branded Flonase in any of the following four states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, or Wisconsin. These persons or entities must have also purchased, paid for, and/or reimbursed for an AB-rated generic fluti-casone propionate nasal spray equivalent of branded Flonase (\u201cgeneric FP\u201d) from March 2006 to March 2009 in the same designated state in which the Flonase purchase was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">(2) <em>For the Class Period from March 2006 through March 2009</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">All persons or entities throughout the United States and its territories who from March 2006 to March 2009 purchased, paid for, and/or reimbursed for generic FP in the following states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, or Wisconsin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">B. <em>With respect to the unjust enrichment claims</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">(1) All persons or entities throughout the United States and its territories who from August 2004 through March 2006 purchased, paid for, and/or reimbursed for branded Flonase in any of the following three states \u2014 Arizona, Massachusetts, or Wisconsin. These persons or entities must have also purchased, paid for, and/or reimbursed for generic FP from March 2006 to March 2009 in the same designated state in which the Flonase purchase was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">C. For purposes of the class definition, the Flonase and/or generic FP drugs must have been intended for consumption by the class members, their families or their members, employees, plan participants, beneficiaries, or insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">D. The following are excluded from the class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-15\">(1) GSK and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-16\">(2) all governmental entities (except for government funded employee benefit plans);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-17\">(3) all persons or entities that purchased FP nasal spray, including Flonase, for purposes of resale or directly from GSK to the extent and solely to the extent of such purpose for resale or as a direct purchase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-18\">(4) insured individuals covered by plans imposing a flat dollar co-pay that was the same dollar amount for generic as for brand name drug purchases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-19\">(5) fully insured health plans, i.e. plans that purchased insurance from another third-party payor covering 100% of the plan\u2019s reimbursement obligations to its members; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-20\">(6) insured individuals who purchased only generic FP (never branded Flo-nase) and whose health plans imposed a flat dollar co-pay applicable to generic drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-21\">E. From August 2004 through March 2009 will be referred to as the \u201cClass Period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>A. <em>Rule 23(a) Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">I will first consider the Rule 23(a) requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. These prerequisites must be satisfied to bring any class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">1. Numerosity</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The first prerequisite in Rule 23(a) requires that the proposed class be \u201cso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Although \u201cno minimum number of plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a class action,\u201d in general sufficient numerosity exists \u201cif the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40____\u201d <em>Stewart v. Abraham, </em>275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir.2001). This requirement is plainly satisfied as Indirect Purchasers seek to certify a class of tens of thousands of consumer class members and hundreds of TPP class members. <em>See In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., </em>282 F.R.D. 126, 136-37 (E.D.Pa.2011) <em>(\u201cWellbutrin XL </em>\u201d). GSK conceded the nu-merosity requirement. Accordingly, IPPs have established the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">2. Commonality</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The second prerequisite in Rule 23(a) requires that \u201cthere are questions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2). To establish commonality, plaintiffs must demonstrate that their claims \u201cdepend upon a common contention,\u201d the resolution of which \u201cwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011). \u201cHowever, where an action is to proceed under Rule 23(b)(3), the commonality requirement is subsumed by the predominance requirement\u201d because \u201cit is far more demanding than the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement.\u201d <em>Danvers Motor Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>543 F.3d 141,148 (3d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is therefore appropriate to \u201canalyze the two factors together, with particular focus on the predominance requirement.\u201d <em>In re War-farin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Although Indirect Purchasers assert state law claims of monopolization, UDTP, and unjust enrichment, proof of the essential elements of these claims will be common across the class and focused on GSK\u2019s behavior, not that of the individual class members. The common issues presented in each of the class members\u2019 claims include: (1) whether GSK unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize the market for Flonase; (2) whether GSK unlawfully possessed and/or extended its monopoly power over the Flonase market; (3) whether GSK\u2019s actions caused the price of FP to be maintained at supra-competitive levels; (4) whether GSK\u2019s citizen petitions were intended to prevent generic entry and/or constitute unlawful conduct; (5) whether the class members suffered antitrust injury; and (6) whether GSK was unjustly enriched to the detriment of the class members. Resolving the allegations surrounding GSK\u2019s alleged conduct in delaying generic entry will resolve issues that are \u201ccentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d Therefore, I find the commonality requirement satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">3. Typicality</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">The third prerequisite in Rule 23(a) requires that \u201cthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). \u201cTypicality entails an inquiry whether the named plaintiffs individual circumstances are markedly different or the legal theory upon which the claims are based differs from that upon which the claims of other class members will perforce be based.\u201d <em>Hassine v. Jeffes, </em>846 F.2d 169, 177 (3d Cir.1988) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe typicality requirement is intended to preclude certification of those cases where the legal theories of the named plaintiffs potentially conflict with those of the absentees.\u201d <em>Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>83 F.3d 610, 631 (3d Cir. 1996). \u201cThe inquiry assesses whether the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with those of absent class members so that the absentees\u2019 interests will be fairly represented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFactual differences will not defeat typicality if the named plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>claims arise from the same event or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members and are based on the same legal theory.\u201d <em>Danvers Motor Co., Inc., </em>543 F.3d at 150 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In this case, Indirect Purchasers allege that the same unlawful conduct injured both the class representatives and the absent class members. IPPs\u2019 state law claims for monopolization, UDTP, and unjust enrichment arise from an identical course of conduct \u2014 GSK\u2019s allegedly monopolistic \u201cbrand maturation strategy.\u201d GSK implemented this strategy without reference to individual purchasers, and all members of the proposed class seek to recover for the resulting overcharge injury, or unjust enrichment at their expense, based on the same legal theories. <em>In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., </em>220 F.R.D. 672, 688 (S.D.Fla.2004) (\u201c[I]f one class representative is able to prove that Defendants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive acts caused an overcharge for [the brand drug], or that Defendants were unjustly enriched at Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 expense, such proof will likewise prove the case on liability for every other class member.\u201d). GSK does not contest the typicality requirement. I find that Indirect Purchasers have satisfied Rule 23(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">4. Adequacy of Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The fourth prerequisite in Rule 23(a) requires that \u201cthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). The adequacy determination \u201cdepends on two factors: (a) the plaintiffs attorney must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation, and (b) the plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.\u201d <em>New Directions Treatment Servs. v. City of Reading, </em>490 F.3d 293, 313 (3d Cir.2007). Indirect Purchasers\u2019 lead counsel has presented evidence of its extensive experience in complex antitrust actions, including cases involving delayed entry of generic pharmaceuticals. After reviewing Indirect Purchasers\u2019 submissions, I find that the first prong of the adequacy inquiry is satisfied, as Indirect Purchasers\u2019 counsel are \u201cqualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.\u201d <em>New Directions, </em>490 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The absence-of-conflict requirement \u201cseeks to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 532. \u201cA class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.\u201d <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 625-26, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Adequacy will not be denied simply \u201cbecause of a potential conflict of interest that may not become actual.\u201d <em>Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC, </em>571 F.3d 672, 680 (7th Cir.2009). GSK has not raised any conflicts with the class. Each class member purchased and/or reimbursed for FP at some point during the Class Period at a supracompetitive price. Each class member holds a strong common interest in establishing GSK\u2019s liability for these alleged overcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Because the class suffers from no conflicts and is represented by qualified counsel, I conclude that the class meets both prongs of the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">B. <em>Rule 23(b) Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Once the Rule 23(a) requirements are met, other requirements under Rule 23(b) must be satisfied based on the type of class action. Indirect Purchasers seek certification under section (b)(3), requiring proof of predominance and superiority. Indirect Purchasers must demonstrate \u201cthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\u201d and \u201cthat a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">1. Predominance</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">The parties in this matter directed their arguments regarding certification almost exclusively to the question of predominance.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>259 F.3d 154, 172 (3d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The predominance inquiry \u201cbegins, of course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action.\u201d <em>John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2179, 2184, 180 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011). Importantly, the parties agree that the essential elements of Indirect Purchasers\u2019 remaining state monopolization and UDTP claims are the same, paralleling their federal counterparts, the Sherman Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. <em>See App. A. </em>(outlining the elements of the monopolization and UDTP state statutes). To satisfy Rule 23(b)(3), Indirect Purchasers must show that common evidence can establish: (1) liability on each of their claims; (2) injury-in-fact, and (3) measurable damages. I will address each of these elements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\n<em>a. Common Proof on Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Indirect Purchasers have successfully plead, <em>and </em>survived summary judgment on, the following state law claims: (1) monopolization under the laws of Arizona and Wisconsin, (2) unfair and deceptive trade practices under the laws of Florida and Massachusetts, and (3) unjust enrichment under the laws of Arizona, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin. To prove liability on each of these state law claims, each class member will rely on the same evidence focused on GSK\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive conduct aimed at preventing a generic version of Flonase from entering the market. The issues relevant to proving liability \u2014 relevant market, monopoly power, exclusionary conduct, and causation \u2014 can be proven through class-wide, common evidence because these issues focus on GSK\u2019s conduct, not on the actions of the individual class members. <em>See Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 528 (explaining that liability for anticompetitive conduct centers on the defendants\u2019 conduct, not the actions of individual class members). Although Indirect Purchasers also assert three state unjust enrichment claims, they will utilize the same operative evidence to establish GSK\u2019s liability for these claims, as with their monopolization and UDTP claims. <em>See Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>667 F.3d 273, 301 (3d Cir.2011) (emphasizing that any minor variations between state laws will not defeat class certification \u201cas long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together\u201d); <em>Terazosin, </em>220 F.R.D. at 697-98 (certifying a class of indirect purchasers in part because \u201cthe same common operative facts that form the basis for each of the state classes\u2019 antitrust claims form the basis for the unjust enrichment claims\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> GSK admitted that, with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>to proving liability, the evidence would be the same for each of Indirect Purchasers\u2019 state law claims. Therefore, I find that common issues of fact and law will predominate on this element of Indirect Purchasers\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>b. Antitrust Impact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Indirect Purchasers next must demonstrate individual injury, i.e. antitrust impact or fact of damage (as opposed to the extent of damage). \u201cIn antitrust eases, impact often is critically important for the purpose of evaluating Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement because it is an element of the claim that may call for individual, as opposed to common, proof.\u201d <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 311. The Third Circuit has explained plaintiffs burden in establishing antitrust impact at the class certification stage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 burden ... is not to prove the element of antitrust impact, although in order to prevail on the merits each class member must do so. Instead, the task for plaintiffs at class certification is to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members. Deciding this issue calls for the district court\u2019s rigorous assessment of the available evidence and the method or methods by which plaintiffs propose to use the evidence to prove impact at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">552 F.3d at 311-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Indirect Purchasers contend that class members were injured through overcharges</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">for purchases and/or reimbursements of FP during the Class Period, as a result of delayed generic entry into the market. To support their argument on common impact and damages, Indirect Purchasers present expert declarations and testimony from Gordon Rausser, Ph.D., an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rausser opines that general economic principles and actual market data establish common impact in this case, and that through a \u201cyardstick\u201d methodology \u2014 comparing prices in the actual world with prices in a hypothetical \u201cbut-world\u201d without GSK\u2019s misconduct\u2014 he can demonstrate that across all types of end-payors and all distribution channels, injury and damages occurred in this case as a result of GSK\u2019s delaying generic entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">This common evidence is capable of establishing two types of injury in the purchase of FP during the Class Period: (1) \u201cswitcher overcharge,\u201d from August 2004 through March 2006, that applies to class members who purchased Flonase before generic entry and would have switched to the less expensive generic FP if it had been available; and (2) \u201cgeneric overcharge,\u201d from March 2006 to March 2009, that applies to class members who purchased generic FP at a supracompet-itive price because delayed generic entry prevented earlier generic price competition and a lower initial generic price. I will refer to the first group of class members as \u201cswitchers\u201d and to the second group of class members as \u201cgeneric only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">GSK challenges Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claim that antitrust impact is capable of proof at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to each class member. Specifically, GSK raises three arguments: (1) Rausser\u2019s methodology, which relies on aggregated data, masks considerable variation in the actual prices paid by class members, the purchasing patterns of class members, and the prescription drug formu-laries possessed by TPP class members, and therefore cannot determine whether a given class member was in fact injured; (2) uninjured class members remain in the class; and (3) complex and individualized inquiries are necessary to prove impact, as well as damages. In rebutting Dr. Rausser, GSK relies on the expert opinions of Dr. Robert Navarro, a trained pharmacist and expert in pharmacy benefit programs, and Dr. Bruce Stangle, an economist.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">I will first discuss how Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated that impact to the class is capable of proof through their common evidence. Then I will address how GSK\u2019s arguments fail to show that individual inquiries will predominate in determining impact to this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>(1) Impact to All Class Members</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgT\">To meet their burden in demonstrating impact to purchasers of generic FP, Indirect Purchasers must show that generic FP prices would have been lower absent GSK\u2019s conduct through common evidence. Rausser described how certain general principles demonstrate that impact for generic FP purchasers occurs through basic market mechanisms, and how the actual market data confirms that these market mechanisms were present in this case. First, he explained that by delaying generic entry, GSK can capture an extended exclusivity period for a brand drug like Flonase during which time large numbers of consumers are willing to pay elevated prices because the drug is effective for them and less expensive alternatives are unavailable. In this case, the price per unit of Flonase showed a steady increase from the beginning of the Class Period until just prior to generic entry, moving from around $60/bottle to $70/bottle. When the first generic drug then enters the market, that generic drug is invariably priced at a discount to the brand drug\u2019s price at that same time. Upon generic entry in March 2006, both Roxane and GSK introduced generic FP drugs at a price 25% below the price of Flonase. While the initial generic price was lower than the brand price, absent GSK\u2019s conduct it would have been even lower because it would have been discounted off the brand price in August 2004, not the higher brand price in March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Rausser further explained that by delaying generic entry, GSK prevented generic price competition that would have resulted in lower generic FP prices for those class members purchasing generic FP between March 2006 and March 2009 in this case. Specifically, he noted that after its initial discount off the brand price, the generic FP price steadily declined over the first eighteen months after entry with only two generic drugs on the market. Rausser explained that this decline was consistent with extensive historical data and academic studies detailing how generic price declines, while spurred on by new generic drug entries, are not dependent on additional generic drugs entering the market. As more drug manufacturers launch additional generic drugs, competition intensifies and drives the generic price down further. In 2007, when a third generic drug (Apotex) launched, the generic price dropped even further; a fourth generic drug (Hi-Tee) arrived on the market in 2009 initiating yet another generic price decrease.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">These basic market principles, confirmed by historical data and actual market data in this case, demonstrate how class members would have paid less for generic FP \u201cbut-for\u201d GSK\u2019s exclusionary conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">To meet their burden in establishing \u201cswitcher overcharge,\u201d Indirect Purchasers must show through common evidence not only that generic FP prices would have been lower than Flonase prices between August 2004 and March 2006 (the period during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>which GSK prevented generic entry), but also that those class members who purchased Flonase prior to generic entry would have switched to the generic product if it had been available. Many of the same market mechanisms described above explain the cost differential that existed between brand and generic FP. Upon generic entry, the first generic drug is invariably priced at a significant discount to the brand. Two years after generic entry, as a result of generic drug competition, Rausser stated that the generic price is on average 70% less than the brand price. In this case, although the average price of Flonase decreased after generic entry\u2014 dropping to approximately the same price as the generic three months after entry \u2014 from that point on, the generic price stayed consistently and significantly below the price of Flonase.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">For the \u201cswitcher\u201d class members that actually purchased and/or reimbursed for generic FP after entry in March 2006, it is reasonable to assume \u2014 based on their observed decisions between the brand and generic' \u2014 that if the generic had been available earlier, they would have purchased and/or reimbursed for it over the higher-priced brand drug. <em>See In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., </em>200 F.R.D. 326, 343 (E.D.Mich. 2001) (\u201cEvidence that class members have purchased a generic [drug] after it became available gives rise to the inference that they would have similarly done so in the \u2018but-for\u2019 world at the \u2018but-for\u2019 price. There is no need for individual analysis of switching behavior as to these putative class members.\u201d); <em>see also Wellbutrin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. at 142-43 (making similar finding regarding TPPs that purchased and/or reimbursed for a generic drug after it became available). This inference is further supported by the rapid conversion to generic drugs that occurred in this case. Rausser stated that one month after generic entry in March 2006, Flonase had lost 88% of the total bottle sales of FP at pharmacies. Within the first year following entry, 95% of the FP sales became generic. By the end of the Class Period, Flonase made up only 1% of the FP market, as the generic captured the remaining 99%. The erosion of brand-name Flonase was even faster than GSK had initially expected, and was one of the most rapid Rausser had ever examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Such rapid conversion can be explained not only by the purchase price differential between the drugs, but also by state generic substitution laws that make the substitution of generic drugs for prescribed brand drugs either mandatory or within the discretion of a pharmacist. Furthermore, TPPs offer prescription drug formularies, i.e. tiered pricing, with lowers co-pays and coinsurance to encourage insured consumers to purchase a generic equivalent over the brand drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">This common evidence is capable of demonstrating that the \u201cswitchers\u201d would have purchased the generic drug over Flonase prior to March 2006 absent GSK\u2019s exclusionary conduct. It further shows the price of generic FP would have been lower than that of Flonase.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\n<em>(2) Rausser\u2019s Yardstick Methodology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">To further demonstrate impact, as well as damages, Rausser proposes to utilize a \u201cyardstick\u201d methodology through which he can compare prices paid for FP in the actual world (i.e. with GSK\u2019s alleged misconduct delaying generic entry until March 2006) with the prices paid in a hypothetical \u201cbut-for\u201d world (i.e. with generic entry nineteen months earlier in August 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">To construct the actual world of FP prices in each class state, Rausser utilized monthly nationwide data on the actual volume and dollar sales of Flonase and generic FP that took place within each distribution channel throughout the Class Period. These distribution channels are pharmacy (or retail), mail order, long-term care, clinics, HMOs, home health care, non-federal hospitals, and miscellaneous. He then computed the average brand and generic price each month within each channel by simply dividing the dollar sales with the volume data.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Rausser subsequently constructed a \u201cbut-for world\u201d to estimate how the prices paid for FP would have changed if generic entry had not been delayed. In doing this, he used the market data of what actually occurred in the FP market after generic entry, along with generic economic principles and historical studies in generic pricing and entry. Raus-ser first assumed that, as in the actual world, GSK\u2019s generic product (Par) would have launched simultaneously with Roxane\u2019s generic FP drug because historically brand drug companies usually decide to launch their own authorized generic alongside the first non-authorized generic as a means to offset any losses inevitably resulting from generic entry. He conservatively assumed that the launch dates for the third and fourth generic FP drugs \u2014 Apotex in October 2007 and Hi-Tech in February 2008 \u2014 would not be accelerated in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Rausser explained that his analysis of the rhinitis drug market revealed no other substantial differences between the markets before and after generic entry that would have caused a material change in the pricing of Flonase or its generic substitutes. The competitive therapies available were substantially the same, consumer demand did not materially change, and reimbursement practices were essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">To construct the \u201cbut for\u201d price of Flonase and generic FP across the Class Period, Rausser used the price changes, discounts and conversion rates observed in the actual market data after March 2006 as a yardstick for estimating what the effect of generic entry would have been in 2004. Rausser explained that he set the initial \u201cbut-for\u201d generic price at 25% below the Flonase price in August 2004; this discount is consistent with industry practice and with the initial price discount set in this case. Rausser then used price data observed in the available industry market data to map out the generic prices in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world. Generic prices eventually leveled out in the actual world in March 2009 at $20, and Rausser used this same price in his \u201cbut for\u201d world as a benchmark for the end of the Class Period</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">From this yardstick analysis, Rausser showed that the \u201cbut-for\u201d generic prices would have been lower than the actual generic FP prices between March 2006 and March 2009, as well as the actual Flonase prices between August 2004 and March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">However, within the prescription drug market, Rausser noted that two characteristics might be thought to distinguish the price experience of one class member from another: (1) type of end-payor, i.e. uninsured consumer, insured consumer, or TPP; and (2) sales channel (i.e., retail/pharmacy, mail order) through which the class member paid and/or reimbursed for FP. Rausser contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>that available market data enables him to examine each of these distinctions and conclude that there is no significant group of class members who were not impacted as a result of GSK\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">To test the robustness of his methodology-considering these distinctions, Rausser conducted a sensitivity analysis. First, he analyzed the uninsured consumers\u2019 prices across each sales channel and for each generic manufacturer (Roxane, Par, Apotex, Hi-Tech). Rausser concluded that his average was robust for this group of consumers \u2014 of course, uninsured consumers capture the entire price difference between Flonase and generic FP across all sales channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Next, Rausser analyzed the insured consumers, whose cost burden for an FP purchase derives from the contractual arrangement with their TPP. As a result of this contractual arrangement, an insured consumer may pay a percentage of a drug\u2019s purchase price (coinsurance), a flat dollar amount of the purchase price (co-pay), or the full purchase price (if they have not met their deductible or have exceeded their annual benefit maximum). The payment amount can also vary between brand and generic drug purchases, as set by a TPP\u2019s formulary or tiers. For example, a three tier formulary could include generic, preferred brand, non-preferred brand tiers, each with different copay or coinsurance amounts. Generally, Rausser noted, co-pay and coinsurance rates are lower for generic drugs than for brand drugs, as TPPs often place brand drugs on a less favorable formulary status than generic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In testing the impact of plan provisions in each class state, Rausser separated out insured consumer cost-sharing by state by using data on the net consumer contribution for commercial and Medicare third-party payer plans. This data showed that, in each of the four class states, insured consumers contributed more money per claim for brand purchases prior to generic entry than for generic purchases. In each class state, the difference was greater than eight dollars per claim. Moreover, because this data revealed net consumer contributions, it took into account all the complexities of a plan\u2019s provisions, i.e. co-pay, coinsurance, deductible. Rausser noted that his analysis of insured consumer contributions excluded two groups of consumers whose plan provisions do not allow for injury \u2014 specifically, insured consumers with the same flat dollar co-pay for brand and generic drug purchases (\u201cone-tier plans\u201d), and insured consumers with a flat dollar co-pay for generic drug purchases and who only purchased generic FP, not Flonase, during the Class Period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Finally, Rausser analyzed the robustness of his yardstick methodology for TPPs, whose net cost for FP purchases during the Class Period is determined by subtracting the applicable consumer contribution (i.e. copay, coinsurance) and drug manufacturer rebates from the gross drug cost.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As the literature and actual market data indicated, generic entry has the following effect on each of these three variables: lowers the gross FP price, lowers the co-pay/coinsurance rate, and reduces the number of manufacturer rebates. Therefore, Rausser explained, the effect of generic entry on the net cost to TPPs depends on whether the decline in gross FP drug price exceeds the reductions in co-pays, coinsurance, and manufacturer rebates.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Rausser tested whether TPPs still suffer injury when extreme values are used for the reduction in co-pay/coinsurance rates and manufacturer rebate rates. For example, the average difference in the co-pay/coinsurance amount between brand and generic drugs averaged $15. Rausser analyzed whether impact still occurred for a TPP if that differential was actually $40. The average rebate price reduction for Flonase after generic entry was 12%. Rausser examined whether TPPs were still injured if the rebates offered were 50% of the gross drug price. Even using these extreme values, Rausser stated that TPPs still suffer monetary loss during the Class Period as a result of GSK\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Additionally, Rausser examined the actual transaction data from the named Plaintiff TPPs. Utilizing his yardstick methodology, Rausser demonstrated that each of the TPPs suffered at least some injury in each of the class states in which it purchased and/or reimbursed for Flonase or generic FP.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Through this common evidence and Raus-ser\u2019s methodology, Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated that they can establish impact to this class of consumers and TPPs through class-wide evidence. GSK raises several objections to Rausser\u2019s methodology and Indirect Purchasers\u2019 assertions, which are addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>(3) GSK\u2019s Objections: Aggregated Data and its Effect on TPP Cost-Sharing Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">GSK attacks the reliability of Dr. Raus-ser\u2019s methodology for its use of aggregated data sources, which this section addresses, that allegedly mask the presence of injury and exaggerate the extent of damages for the class. According to GSK, this aggregated data, particularly concerning pricing and distribution of purchases, fails to represent the actual FP prices paid by class members in the class states or the actual distribution of purchases reimbursed by TPP class members in the class states. As a result, GSK argues that Rausser\u2019s methodology cannot adequately assess injury or measure damages for TPPs at the state level.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">In addressing the argument regarding the use of aggregated data and its effect on TPP cost-sharing provisions, GSK relies on the expert opinions and declarations of Dr. Robert Navarro, a trained pharmacist and expert in pharmacy benefit programs, and Dr. Bruce Stangle, ah economist. Dr. Navarro explained that TPPs and prescription benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) offer widely variable prescription drug programs. Several commonly used mechanisms and incentives can influence the amount of cost-sharing and price for any given prescription drug transaction. Navarro outlined each of these, including patient eopaymenVcoinsuranee, deductibles, benefit caps, drug formularies, participating pharmacy networks, and use of mail service. Each of these provisions is highly varied among the named Plaintiff TPPs, and, Navarro opined, this variation is consistent with that seen among TPPs across the country. Furthermore, Navarro explained that each of these plan features can alter the cost burden imposed on insured consumers and TPPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">As a result of this variation in the structure of prescription drug benefit programs, Stangle opined that it was impossible for Rausser\u2019s class-wide methodology to assess fact of injury. He explained that the various plan provisions detailed by Navarro (i.e. co-pays, deductibles, benefit m\u00e1ximums) must be considered in the impact analysis. Stan-gle opined that only through an analysis of individual transactions, considering each TPP\u2019s provisions, could impact be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Rausser\u2019s sensitivity analysis, though, tested his methodology against each of these various plan provisions. Using state-specific data, Rausser showed that even considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>all the various plan provisions that determine an insured consumer\u2019s cost burden for an individual FP purchase, insured consumers\u2019 net contribution per claim would have been much lower in each class state absent GSK\u2019s conduct. GSK ignores the fact that this data takes into account more than simply co-pays and coinsurance. By looking at the net contribution per claim, this data factors in all the plan provisions \u2014 including deductibles \u2014 that Stangle and Navarro highlighted as factors that could alter the price experience for consumers and undermine Rausser\u2019s analysis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Rausser additionally analyzed whether extreme drug formularies \u2014 in particular, a copay/coinsurance differential of $40 between brand and generic drugs, as opposed to the average $15 differential \u2014 could alter impact to TPPs in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He concluded that TPPs still suffered impact. He also examined whether impact would still occur for TPPs if GSK offered extreme rebates (50% off the gross Flonase price as opposed to the average 12%), contrary to pharmaceutical industry practice. Again he found that his methodology did not mask injury, as the TPPs continued to be impacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In response, GSK grasps onto the possibility that certain TPPs might be uninjured \u2014 \u2022 even benefitted \u2014 by delayed generic entry if they only reimbursed for a few FP purchases. Specifically, GSK points to the following testimony by Rausser: \u201c[I]n the early part of the \u2018but for\u2019 period, because the [TPP] is losing the rebates and there is a more favorable co-pay for generics in the early part of the damage period ... it takes a while before the [TPPs] catch up with what ... they have foregone ... in the first part of the period.\u201d (2/28 AM H\u2019rg Tr. 31-32). Rausser noted that if a TPP only had a couple transactions in the first nineteen months of the Class Period you could not show injury for them. GSK asserts that many TPPs could potentially exhibit this same reimbursement pattern because many class member TPPs, like the named plaintiff TPPs, may be from outside the class states and may have made only a few reimbursements for FP purchases during the Class Period. Stangle emphasized that Rausser\u2019s methodology could not account for these TPPs because he applied an average distribution of purchases/reimbursements for TPPs across.the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">It is apparent that underlying GSK\u2019s contention is its belief that the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide </em>requires Indirect Purchasers to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that impact can be established for <em>every </em>class member through common proof. GSK cites to a statement, however, that concerns plaintiffs\u2019 burden at the <em>merits </em>stage of the litigation \u2014 \u201cindividual injury (also known as antitrust impact) is an element of the cause of action; to prevail on the merits, every class member must prove at least some antitrust impact resulting from the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 311; <em>see In re Neurontin Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 02-md-1390, 2011 WL 286118, at *8 n. 23 (D.N.J. Jan. 25, 2011) (considering a similar argument by defendants and noting that this passage relates to plaintiffs\u2019 burden at the merits stage of the litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The Seventh Circuit has explained this distinction regarding uninjured class members in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">[A] class will often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct____ Such a possibility or indeed inevitability does not preclude class certification, despite statements in some cases that it must be reasonably clear at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>outset that all class members were injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct. Those cases focus on the class definition; if the definition is so broad that it sweeps within it persons who could not have been injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct, it is too broad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN_\"><em>Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Management Co. LLC, </em>571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). I agree with the analysis in <em>Kohen </em>and with other courts that \u201chave routinely observed that the inability to show injury as to a few does not defeat class certification where the plaintiffs can show widespread injury to the class.\u201d <em>In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., </em>200 F.R.D. 297, 320-21 (E.D.Mich.2001) (citing <em>In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., </em>169 F.R.D. 493, 523 (S.D.N.Y.1996)); <em>see also Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings, Co. III, Ltd., </em>246 F.R.D. 293, 309-310 (D.D.C.2007) (same); <em>In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 01-1652, 2008 WL 2699390, at *18 (D.N.J. April 14, 2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">GSK\u2019s speculative concern does not undermine the ability of Rausser\u2019s methodology and the available common evidence to demonstrate widespread injury to the class. For one, Rausser has shown that all named plaintiff TPPs \u2014 who fit a similar profile, i.e. out-of-state TPP with a select number of FP reimbursements \u2014 suffered injury as a result of GSK\u2019s alleged misconduct. Additionally, by removing from the class all TPPs and consumers that only purchased and/or reimbursed for Flonase, never generic FP, during the Class Period, <em>see infra, </em>this concern largely disappears. Therefore, I am satisfied that the class definition is not so overly broad as to defeat certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">GSK also asserted that Rausser\u2019s methodology was flawed because its use of aggregated data masked varied pricing at the end-payor level in each of the class states. With regard to pricing, Stangle criticized Raus-ser\u2019s use of a national average price for both the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d FP prices. Stangle labeled these national average prices as \u201csynthetic prices\u201d \u2014 computations derived from national data on FP volume and sales dollars \u2014 that mask the actual transaction prices paid by class members in the class states.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Stangle spent significant time comparing the actual state price data of named plaintiff TPPs with Rausser\u2019s national average generic price, both in the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d worlds. However, Stangle only offered one concrete example of Rausser\u2019s national average generic price masking injury \u2014 named plaintiff AFL. Stangle looked at the actual transaction prices for AFL in Florida for generic FP after generic entry in March 2006 to construct his own \u201cbut for\u201d generic price lines for assessing impact to AFL. Based on this analysis, he concluded that AFL actually benefitted from the alleged delay of generic entry in the state of Florida. Yet, as Raus-ser explained, Stangle\u2019s analysis was lacking in two critical respects: (1) Stangle failed to consider that earlier generic entry in August 2004 would typically mean a lower initial generic price, because the generic price in August 2004 would be discounted off the Flonase price at that same time, not the higher Flonase price in March 2006; and (2) Stangle failed to account for the full price decline that occurred over the first nineteen months after generic entry.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, he averaged the generic prices that occurred for the first year after generic entry and applied that same average price across the first nineteen months of the \u201cbut-for\u201d world. By making these two corrections, Rausser showed that AFL suffered injury in Florida during the Class Period.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Stangle also compared Rausser\u2019s national average generic price to the prices actually paid for the FP generic in ten states, based on data from the named plaintiff TPPs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although Stangle demonstrated that the prices exhibited some level of variation around Rausser\u2019s national average generic FP price, GSK fails to explain how any price variation that may exist for FP purchases is masking injury, i.e. that class members would have actually paid and/or reimbursed more for FP absent GSK\u2019s conduct. In fact, in analyzing the state-specific prices paid by AFL and IBEW during specific time increments, Rausser demonstrated that the price variation across the states was less than 1%. Much of the price variation is merely a reflection of the changes in brand and generic prices over time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And because Rausser computed average prices for each month \u2014 he did not compute average prices over time\u2014 his analysis factored in price variation across the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Rausser also testified that although he lacked state-specific FP pricing data, he did consider what differential between state prices and national prices would need to exist for his national average to mask injury. He explained that prices would have to move outside the realm of the data outliers to reach a point where there was no injury. Furthermore, as noted above, Rausser conducted a sensitivity analysis, using state-specific data, to test whether his national average price masked injury for TPPs or insured consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Courts, under certain circumstances, have found averaged data to be unreliable on the question of common impact and class-wide damages. <em>See Reed v. Advocate Health Care, </em>268 F.R.D. 573, 591 (N.D.Ill.2009) (explaining that \u201caveraging by definition glides over what may be important differences\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., </em>253 F.R.D. 478, 502 (N.D.Cal. 2008) (same).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Regarding the use of averages in econometric analyses, the American Bar Association has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">Sometimes the prices used by economists are averages of a number of different prices charged to different customers or for somewhat different products. Using such averages can lead to serious analytical problems. For example, averages can hide substantial variation across individual cases, which may be key to determining whether there is common impact. In addition, average prices may combine the prices of different package sizes of the same product or of somewhat different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>products. When this happens, the average price paid by a customer can change when the mix of products that the customer buys changes-even if the price of the single product changed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">ABA Section of Antitrust Law, <em>Econometrics: Legal, Practical, and Technical Issues </em>220 (2005). It is critical to note that this case does not involve several different products or different markets of supply and demand. The allegations in this case involve two bioequivalent substitutable drugs with a supply and demand market that exhibited no significant changes during the relevant time periods. Within this homogenous market, Rausser has demonstrated through common evidence that between March 2006 and March 2009, after generic FP became available, the actual price for generic FP was higher than the corresponding generic FP price would have been in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world, and that between August 2004 and March 2006, the \u201cbut-for\u201d generic FP prices would have been lower than the actual Flonase prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">I recognize, though, that certain variables \u2014 in particular co-pay/coinsurance and deductibles \u2014 can alter the FP price experience for a given class member, such that an average price differential by itself may not answer the question of impact for the class members under all circumstances. <em>See Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health &amp; Welfare Plan v. GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, </em>No. 04-5898, 2010 WL 3855552 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 30, 2010) <em>(\u201cWellbutrin SR </em>\u201d) (\u201cJust because an average price was increased or decreased by the alleged foreclosure does not mean that all members of the proposed class paid supra-competitive prices or that any damage for an individual end-payor or that any damage for an individual end-payor could be calculated in any formulaic way by common proof\u201d). But as I have already thoroughly discussed above, Rausser did much more than simply compare a monthly average FP price in the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d worlds to demonstrate common impact. He conducted a sensitivity analysis to test whether his methodology was robust in assessing impact for all three types of class members. He also showed that each named plaintiff TPP was injured during the Class Period, applying the available common data and his yardstick methodology. I am satisfied that the data variation in this case is not so extreme as to mask the absence of injury for a significant number of class members.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Finally, GSK contests whether Indirect Purchasers must show that the overcharges for FP had been \u201cpassed through\u201d to the indirect purchaser class, as opposed to merely demonstrating that the actual FP prices paid by the class were greater than the prices it would have paid but-for GSK\u2019s delaying generic entry. Rausser testified that in a case alleging foreclosed competition like this one, conducting a formal pass-through analysis to trace the economic damages throughout the distribution chain was unnecessary. Rather, he explained that by comparing the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d FP prices as he did in his yardstick methodology, he could observe the clear price differential in the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d worlds that shows impact. He further stated that unlike a price-fixing case, where an end-payor can mitigate or even avoid the prices increases through various measures, in a foreclosed competition case, impact can be measured in terms of what product the end-payor was actually forced to buy because of the delayed entry, versus what product(s) they would have purchased, absent the forestalling of competition. I agree that in the instant case Indirect Purchasers need not conduct a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>pass-through analysis, and that Rausser\u2019s methodology is sufficient. <em>See In re Cardiz-em CD Antitrust Litig., </em>200 F.R.D. 326, 344 (E.D.Mich.2001) (\u201c[A]n indirect purchaser must estimate only the \u2018but-for\u2019 price that it should have paid, which is a far less exacting exercise than apportioning the overcharge throughout the entire chain of distribution\u201d) (quoting Roger D. Blair &amp; Jeffrey L. Harrison, <em>Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick in Modem Antitrust Analysis, </em>68 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 1, 29 (1999)); <em>see also Wellbut-rin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. at 143-44 (finding pass-through unnecessary to establish antitrust impact).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">I find that Indirect Purchasers have shown that impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members for \u201cgeneric only\u201d and \u201cswitcher\u201d overcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>(b) Proposed Class Members That Never Purchased Generic FP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Indirect Purchasers proposed class included certain types of consumers and TPPs that either were not impacted by GSK\u2019s conduct, or will be unable to show impact through the class-wide evidence presented. These include the following class members: (1) uninsured consumers who purchased Flonase after generic entry; (2) all consumers who purchased Flonase prior to generic entry and did not purchase Flonase or generic FP after entry; and (3) TPPs that only purchased and/or reimbursed for Flonase, never generic FP, during the Class Period. Each of these class members possesses a common attribute \u2014 they never purchased and/or reimbursed for generic FP during the Class Period. For the reasons detailed below, I am unwilling to certify these class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>(i) Uninsured Consumers Who Purchased Flonase After Generic Entry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Consumers purchasing Flonase after generic entry are known as \u201cbrand loyalists.\u201d Indirect Purchasers\u2019 proposed class excludes \u201cbrand loyal consumers,\u201d defined as insured consumers who purchased only the branded version of Flonase after generic entry. GSK pointed out that this exclusion failed to include uninsured consumers who purchased only the branded version of Flonase after generic entry, i.e. uninsured \u201cbrand loyal consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The only plausible theory by which \u201cbrand loyalists\u201d can show damage in a delayed generic entry case is \u201cbranded overcharge\u201d\u2014 paying supracompetitive prices for Flonase because earlier generic entry would have lowered Flonase prices. Stangle declared that according to Dr. Rausser\u2019s own data, brand prices actually increased in some distribution channels \u2014 in particular, the retail/pharmaey channel \u2014 after generic entry, even though Rausser\u2019s national average brand price exhibited a decrease in brand prices after generic entry. The limited data from Indirect Purchaser TPPs \u2014 showing only twenty purchases of Flonase after generic entry \u2014 further confirmed this trend as the large majority of those purchases were at a price equal to or greater than the price of Flonase just prior to generic entry. Rausser admitted that Flonase prices within the retail channel stayed high and increased slightly over the course of the damage period. Raus-ser further admitted that such uninsured consumers would not have been injured as a result of GSK\u2019s conduct. He also acknowledged that Flonase prices may have risen in at least one other channel during certain periods after generic entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">In this particular instance, therefore, Rausser\u2019s national average Flonase price after generic entry does mask price increases, and in turn fact of injury, across certain distribution channels for uninsured consumers. Because his methodology is not reliable in establishing injury for uninsured consumers that purchased Flonase after generic entry, I excluded these members from Indirect Purchasers\u2019 proposed class.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">\n<em>(ii) Consumers Who Purchased Flonase Before Generic Entry and Made No Brand or Generic Purchases After Generic Entry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">A select number of consumers who purchased Flonase before generic entry made no drug purchases, either brand or generic, after generic entry. For these consumers, there were no observed transactions in which they chose between the brand and the gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ic drug.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indirect Purchasers argue that nearly all of these consumers would have switched to generic FP if generic entry had occurred in August 2004. GSK contends that, without resorting to individualized proof of a consumer\u2019s personal medical-decision-making, Indirect Purchasers cannot establish which class members would have switched to generic FP and which class members would have continued purchasing Flonase.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">To demonstrate that these consumers would have converted to generic FP in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world, Rausser points out that 91% of FP volume switched from brand to generic after generic entry. He also noted that each of the four class states have generic substitution laws that facilitate conversion to the generic drug, either by mandate or at a pharmacist\u2019s discretion. Finally, given the cost difference between the generic and brand drugs, whether in co-pay/coinsurance rates for insured consumers or full purchase price for uninsured consumers, general economic principles hold that in choosing between equivalent products, consumers will choose the less-expensive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This common evidence, however, is cannot establish which of these consumers would have switched to the generic. Indirect Purchasers attempt to transpose a volume statistic \u2014 generic conversion rate of FP prescriptions \u2014 on a group of entirely different customers, who did not exhibit a preference for the generic during the Class Period. Rausser acknowledged that this data only concerned volume conversion and failed to display the number of individuals who switched to the generic.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Regardless of what other features might exist to encourage generic conversion, I do not find that injury is capable of being established for these individual through evidence common to the class. An individual consumer might continue to purchase Flonase for various reasons, i.e. the nature of her health insurance coverage, a perceived difference in the relative quality between Flonase and generic FP, or some other personal reason. Only through knowledge of an individual consumer\u2019s personal medical decision-making can this determination be made. For these reasons, I have excluded these consumers from the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\n<em>(in) TPPs That Never Purchased and/or Reimbursed for Generic FP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">GSK has repeatedly stressed that, based on the difficulties noted above with regard to consumers that only purchased Flonase, Indirect Purchasers have failed to meet their burden to show that impact is capable of proof through common evidence for TPPs that only paid and/or reimbursed for Flonase during the Class Period.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Indirect Purchasers, meanwhile, have continually ignored any explanation as to why TPPs that never paid for and/or reimbursed for generic FP remain in the class. Asked about a TPP\u2019s burden regarding brand loyal consumers, Rausser stated that a TPP is going to end up paying exactly what it paid in both the actual and \u201cbut-for\u201d world in reimbursing for those insured consumers\u2019 purchases. He explained that the injury for a TPP derives from the cumulative effect on the TPP across all its reimbursed transactions \u2014 in other words, transactions that produce \u201cswitcher\u201d or \u201cgeneric only\u201d overcharges in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">For a TPP that only paid and/or reimbursed for Flonase during the Class Period, this argument rests on the underlying assumption that in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world, at least some of the TPP\u2019s reimbursements would be for purchases of the generic product. Whether a TPP would have continued to reimburse for Flonase, or would have switched to make some reimbursements for generic FP, turns on the personal medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>decision-making of its plan members, who decide to make the purchases underlying those reimbursements. Therefore, the same significant individual issues are present in the impact analysis for TPPs that only reimbursed for Flonase, as they are for consumers that only bought Flonase prior to generic entry. <em>See Wellbutrin XL, </em>282 F.R.D. at 141-43 (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a probability analysis can establish impact for TPPs that never reimbursed for generic purchases because significant individual issues concerning a plan member\u2019s purchasing behavior undermine the reliability of the analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I find that Indirect Purchasers have failed to establish that impact is capable of proof through common evidence for class members that never purchased and/or reimbursed for generic FP during the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">c. <em>Measurable Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The last prong of the predominance inquiry is whether Indirect Purchasers \u201chave demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common proof.\u201d <em>Behrend v.

Due to the \u201cinherent difficulty of identifying a \u2018but-for world,\u2019 \u201d the Third Circuit has explained that such damages need not be \u201cmeasured with certainty,\u201d but rather may be \u201cdemonstrated as \u2018a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-204 (quoting <em>Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., </em>282 U.S. 555, 563, 51 S.Ct. 248, 75 L.Ed. 544 (1931)); <em>see also Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 452, 483 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that for class certification purposes, \u201c[i]t is not necessary to show with total certainty the amount of damages sustained\u201d); <em>In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., </em>998 F.2d 1144,1176 (3d Cir.1993) (noting that a \u201crelaxed measure of proof is afforded to the amount\u201d of damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\n<em>i. Monopolization and UDTP Overcharge Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">To measure class-wide damages, Rausser relies on the same \u201cyardstick\u201d methodology he utilized to establish common impact. Through the use of \u201cyardsticks,\u201d Rausser compares the prices actually paid by purchasers of FP to what prices would have been paid in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world. The model is relatively straightforward as aggregate class-wide damages equal the difference between the costs paid by class members for FP in the actual world versus the costs class members would have paid for FP in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world; Rausser calculates these costs and isolates certain sales because of the class exclusions (i.e. federal facilities, Medicare reimbursements, HMO direct purchasers, GSK rebates) through the use of available industry data.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">The before-and-after \u201cyardstick\u201d methodology has been accepted by courts as a means to measuring damages in both indirect and direct purchaser antitrust actions. GSK does not attack the validity of the methodology generally, but instead attacks the data on which Rausser relies to implement his methodology \u2014 specifically, again, that the data is not representative of state-specific pricing. To calculate damages within each of the class states, Rausser utilized state-specific data on FP prescriptions in retail and mail-order channels to allocate the nationwide data on FP unit sales and dollars to each of the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>states. GSK is correct that through this allocation, Rausser is essentially implementing nationwide prices in measuring state damages. However, Rausser did utilize certain state-specific data to more precisely calculate damages in the class states (i.e. co-pay data, prescription data by payer type). He also demonstrated, based on the named plaintiff TPPs\u2019 transaction data in several class states, that FP prices exhibited minimal variance from state to state. Although, as Stangle pointed out, Rausser\u2019s national average generic price is consistently below the state prices observed in the named plaintiff TPPs\u2019 data, Rausser explained that named plaintiff TPPs\u2019 data comes from a small set of individual transactions, and is not representative of the full volume of FP purchases in the class states that will drive the damages calculation. While of course Rausser\u2019s methodology would have been even more reliable had he been provided with state-specific FP pricing, \u201cit is important not to let a quest for perfect evidence become the enemy of good evidence.\u201d <em>Messner, </em>669 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">GSK\u2019s other challenges to Rausser\u2019s methodology \u201care concerns that relate primarily to the allocation of damages among individual class members, not to the computation of aggregate damages on a class-wide basis. Assuming the jury renders an aggregate judgment, allocation will become an intra-class matter accomplished pursuant to a court-approved plan of allocation, and such individual damages allocation issues are insufficient to defeat class certification.\u201d <em>Tera-zosin, </em>220 F.R.D. at 699; <em>see also In re Potash Antitrust Litig., </em>159 F.R.D. 682, 697 (D.Minn.1995) (\u201cThe amount of damages largely involves individualized questions. This is typically true in antitrust actions, however, and does not preclude certification.\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">I am satisfied that although the magnitude of overcharges will vary across class members, Indirect Purchasers have set forth a just and reasonable estimate of the class-wide overcharge damages in each of the four class states.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\n<em>ii. Unjust Enrichment Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In addition to his yardstick methodology measuring damages resulting from the anticompetitive overcharge, Rausser has also proposed a methodology to calculate unjust enrichment damages for the class by comparing GSK\u2019s actual profits to what its profits would have been in the \u201cbut-for\u201d world. This methodology would rely on common evidence in the form of profit and loss statements for Flonase possessed by GSK. Rausser further explained that this data could be adjusted to calculate state-specific damages by relying on available state-specific data on FP prescriptions and their penetration in the class state markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Neither of GSK\u2019s experts challenged the reliability of Rausser\u2019s proposed methodology to calculate unjust enrichment damages in Arizona, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin. GSK asserts that because Rausser has failed to show an actual calculation of unjust enrichment damages, based on his proposed methodology, his methodology is unreliable and incapable of measuring class-wide damages. However, at this stage of the litigation, this bare contention is simply insufficient. <em>See In re Wellbutrin SR Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., </em>2008 WL 1946848, at *9 (E.D.Pa. May 2, 2008) (explaining that the court\u2019s inquiry is \u201climited to whether or not the proposed methods are so insubstantial as to amount to no method at all\u201d) (quoting <em>Potash, </em>159 F.R.D. at 697); <em>In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., </em>209 F.R.D. 251, 268 (D.D.C.2002) (\u201cAt the certification stage, the preliminary inquiry in assessing the proposed methods of proving damages is limited: The inquiry is not whether the methods are valid, but is only to assess whether the methods are available to prove damages on a class-wide basis.\u201d). I find that, based on Rausser\u2019s testimony and declarations and the available common data possessed by GSK, that Indirect Purchasers have demonstrated that unjust en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>richment damages can be calculated on a class-wide basis using common evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">2. Superiority</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Rule 23(b)(3) also requires that a class action be \u201csuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). Assessing superiority requires a court \u201cto balance, in terms of fairness and efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of \u2018alternative available methods\u2019 of adjudication.\u201d <em>Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>83 F.3d 610, 632 (3d Cir.1996). The Supreme Court explained in <em>Amchem </em>that, similar to the predominance requirement, the requirement of superiority ensures that resolution by class action will \u201c\u2018achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote ... uniformity of decision without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 615, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (quoting Advisory Committee\u2019s Note on Fed.R.Civ.P. 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">GSK reiterates its arguments regarding predominance in contending that a class action is not superior to other available methods of adjudication. However, both fairness and efficiency dictate that I certify the class in this case; otherwise, the numerous individual class members would be forced to file suit individually, producing numerous identical issues in each case that would waste judicial resources and leave all parties vulnerable to unfair inconsistencies. I agree with the vast majority of district courts that in a delayed generic entry case such as this, class action treatment is superior to other available methods of adjudication. Therefore, I find that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">C. <em>Daubert </em>Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Both Indirect Purchasers and GSK moved to exclude the other party\u2019s respective expert(s) (Rausser, Stangle, Navarro) on class certification issues. The party offering an expert must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the expert\u2019s qualifications and opinions comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 702. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592-93,113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (citation omitted). Rule 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Fed.R.Evid. 702. Rule 702 has \u201ca liberal policy of admissibility.\u201d <em>Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., </em>520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">The Third Circuit has explained that to survive a <em>Daubert </em>challenge, an expert must satisfy three \u201crestrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability, and fit.\u201d <em>Schneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, </em>320 F.3d 396, 404 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted). The qualification inquiry examines whether a witness possesses specialized expertise. The Third Circuit \u201chas interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>35 F.3d 717, 742 (3d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">For an expert\u2019s testimony to be reliable, it \u201cmust be based on [] methods and procedures ... rather than subjective belief \u25a0or speculation.\u201d <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d 613, 670 (3d Cir.1999). \u201c[T]he admissibility inquiry thus focuses on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions generated by principles and methodology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. Furthermore, an \u201cexpert\u2019s testimony must be accompanied by a sufficient factual foundation before it can be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Elcock v. Kmart Corp., </em>233 F.3d 734, 754 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony fit the issues in the case. Testimony \u201cfits\u201d a case when it is \u201crelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>for the purposes of the ease and ... assist[s] the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>320 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Third Circuit has not explicitly addressed the question of whether expert testimony must satisfy <em>Daubert </em>at the class certification stage. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has strongly suggested that a full <em>Daubert </em>examination may be necessary at class certification. <em>See Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 2553-54 (\u201cThe District Court concluded that <em>Daubert </em>did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action proceedings. We doubt that is so ....\u201d (internal citation omitted)). Furthermore, in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>the Third Circuit explained that \u201copinion testimony should not be uncritically accepted as establishing a Rule 23 requirement merely because the court holds the testimony should not be excluded, under <em>Daubert </em>or for any other reason.\u201d 552 F.3d at 323. \u201cInherent in that statement is the conclusion that a court could, at the class certification stage, exclude expert testimony under <em>Daubert.\u201d Behrend, </em>655 F.3d at 215 n. 18 (Jordan, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Regardless, I will not exclude any of the expert testimony and declarations on class certification, even making a full <em>Daubert </em>examination. Both parties concede the issue of expert qualification and focus their arguments on the reliability and fit of each expert\u2019s testimony and declarations. From a review of this opinion, it is clear that the expert opinions of Rausser, Stangle, and Navarro were reliable, relevant, and significant contributions to the issues raised by Indirect Purchasers\u2019 class certification. Therefore, I will deny all of the following <em>Daubert </em>motions: (1) GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude the Expert Report and Testimony of Gordon Rausser; (2) Indirect Purchasers\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Report and Testimony of Bruce Stangle; and (3) Indirect Purchasers\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Report and Testimony of Robert P. Navarro.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">For the reasons explained above, I conclude that Indirect Purchasers have carried their burden under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3). In reaching that conclusion, however, the indirect purchaser class was limited to class members that purchased/or reimbursed for generic FP during the Class Period. I will therefore grant in part and deny in part Indirect Purchasers\u2019 motion for class certification. Additionally, I will deny the three <em>Daubert </em>motions that seek to exclude each party\u2019s respective expert(s) on class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"AXZ\">\n<em>State Monopolization Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Arizona Arizona\u2019s monopolization statute, Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 44-1401, <em>et seq., </em>permits any \u201cperson threatened with injury or injured in his business or property\u201d to sue for redress of a violation of the statute.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 44 \u2014 1408(b).

At this stage in the litigation, with discovery already closed and without any evidence raising a genuine issue as to whether GSK engaged in deception, I do not find that Indirect Purchasers can now seek certification of a class pursuant to Arizona\u2019s UDTP statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b258-33\">. The remaining state law claims have been outlined in \u201cAppendix A\" at the end of this opinion. The statutes at issue are often labeled <em>\"Illinois Brick </em>repealers\u201d in light of the Supreme Court's decision prohibiting federal antitrust suits by indirect purchasers. <em>Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 728, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). Numerous states across the country have subsequently passed <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealers\u201d enabling an indirect purchaser to bring an antitrust claim under state law. Furthermore, in those states with a repealer statute, indirect purchasers are not barred from recovery for unjust enrichment damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-36\">My previous opinions have detailed <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealers\u201d and the similar theories underlying each of Indirect Purchasers\u2019 remaining state law claims. <em>See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>815 F.Supp.2d 867, 882-85 (E.D.Pa.2011); <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>692 F.Supp.2d 524, 534 (E.D.Pa.2010); <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>610 F.Supp.2d 409, 413 (E.D.Pa.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b258-37\">. Indirect Purchasers first moved for class certification on December 12, 2008. Since that time, I have twice denied Indirect Purchasers' motion for class certification without prejudice to re-brief the issue in light of opinions by the Third Circuit, first in <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation, </em>552 F.3d 305 (3d Cir.2008), then in <em>Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>667 F.3d 273 (3d Cir.2011). In December 2011, Indirect Purchasers re-filed their previous two motions for class certification and accompanying memoranda and expert declarations, along with new supplemental memoranda. GSK responded to Indirect Purchasers' motion in the same fashion. All of the re-filed motions, memoranda, and declarations that have been filed since December 2011 have been taken into consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. I recognize that the elements of the remaining state unjust enrichment claims are not exactly the same as those of the monopolization and UDTP state statutes. In general, to state a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show that the defendant received a benefit from the plaintiff, that the defendant accepted and retained the benefit conferred, and that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain that benefit without paying. <em>See Powers v. Lycoming Engines, </em>245 F.R.D. 226, 231 (E.D.Pa.2007); <em>Undoing the Otherwise Perfect Crime </em>\u2014 Applying <em>Unjust Enrichment to Consumer Price-Fixing Claims, </em>Daniel R. Karon, 108 W. Va. L.Rev. 395, 409 (2005). Indirect Purchasers have successfully plead, and survived summary judgment on, unjust enrichment claims under the laws of Arizona, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin. While there are minor variations amongst these claims, <em>see App. A, </em>I do not find, nor does GSK assert, that the variation among the remaining state unjust enrichment laws is material to this decision on certification.</p>\n<p id=\"A2l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>To prove their unjust enrichment claims, all class members will rely on common evidence focused on whether: (1) GSK's conduct delayed generic competition; (2) the delay of generic entry enriched GSK as a result of overcharges and monopoly profits in the Flonase market from August 2004 to March 2006; (3) this additional enrichment came at the expense of the class; and (4) whether, as a matter of equity, the retention of this benefit would be unjust. \"As is the nature of unjust enrichment claims, this common evidence will focus on the defendant\u2019s gain and not on the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\u201d <em>Terazosin, 220 </em>F.R.D. at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The class proceeding under unjust enrichment claims will only be limited to the extent that (1) \"generic only\u201d class members (March 2006\u2014 March 2009 generic FP purchasers only) and (2) class members who only purchased and/or reimbursed for FP in the state of Florida cannot recover damages based on a theory of unjust enrichment. <em>See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>692 F.Supp.2d 524, 544 (E.D.Pa.2010) (dismissing Indirect Purchasers\u2019 unjust enrichment claim under Florida law because Florida requires that a plaintiff confer a direct benefit upon a defendant in order to state a claim for unjust enrichment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b264-15\">. Rausser\u2019s opinions can be found in three separate expert declarations (January 2010, May 2010, and October 2010 Declarations), two depositions (March 2010, January 2012), and his testimony at Indirect Purchasers\u2019 class certification hearing on February 27-29, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">. Stangle\u2019s opinions can be found in three expert declarations (April 2010, June 2010, February 2012) and one deposition (May 2010). Navarro issued one expert declaration in April 2010 and was deposed in May 2010. Both Stangle and Navarro testified during the class certification hearings on February 27-29, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b266-5\">. Indirect Purchasers repeatedly emphasize that this evidence of general economic principles and actual market data is the same evidence that a group of direct purchasers relied on in seeking certification in a related action, alleging injury through overcharges as a result of delayed generic entry into the market. <em>See American Sales Co., Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., </em>274 F.R.D. 127 (E.D.Pa.2010). Because in November 2010 I granted that motion for class certification, Indirect Purchasers claim that their proposed class should be certified. However, this motion for class certification presents certain issues and complexities that were absent in my certification of a direct purchaser class. For one, GSK neither contested that motion nor asserted a <em>Daubert </em>challenge against the direct purchaser plaintiffs\u2019 two certification experts. More importantly, though, the issues of antitrust impact and damages are different in the context of an indirect purchaser class, largely as a result of the cost and payment structure present in the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the indirect purchaser class is much larger than thirty member direct purchaser class.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">To the extent Indirect Purchasers assert that impact can be proven based solely on GSK\u2019s alleged exclusionary conduct, in accordance with the presumption of impact established in <em>Bogo-sian v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), I do not find such a presumption compatible with the record of this case. <em>See In re OSB Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 06-826, 2007 WL 2253425, at *6-7 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 3, 2007) (noting that courts in the Third Circuit apply the <em>Bogosian </em>doctrine almost exclusively in direct, not indirect, purchaser actions, and explaining that even in direct purchaser actions \"the Third Circuit also requires proof of actual classwide economic inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ry \u2014 a 'belt and suspenders\u2019 approach to establishing impact.\u201d). In addition, the continued existence of the <em>Bogosian </em>presumption appears uncertain within the Third Circuit. <em>See Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 326 (\"We emphasize that actual, not presumed, conformance with the Rule 23 requirements is essential.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Regardless, Indirect Purchasers do not rely exclusively on general economic principles and GSK\u2019s alleged anticompetitive conduct to demonstrate impact. As discussed <em>infra, </em>Rausser utilizes a yardstick methodology and sensitivity analysis, relying on available industry nationwide and state-specific data, to show that impact to these class members is capable of proof through common evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. In a similar delayed generic entry case, the presence of these consumers in a proposed class of consumers and TPPs was a critical reason behind the court\u2019s denial of class certification. <em>See Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health &amp; Welfare Plan v. GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, </em>No. 04\u2014 5898, 2010 WL 3855552, at *26 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 30, 2010). At the early stages of this litigation. Indirect Purchasers\u2019 proposed class included these consumers. Stangle and Navarro pointed out the existence of these uninjured parties in their initial expert declarations. Indirect Purchasers subsequently amended their class definition to exclude these consumers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\">. Rausser explained that rebates are offered by manufacturers of branded drugs to create incentives for moving volume. Rebates, of course, offset the net cost of a brand drug; therefore, they only make sense economically if the revenue decrease GSK experiences is more than outweighed by the volume increase that they are able to capture as a result. Because generic entry triggers a steady decrease in brand drug volume, drug manufacturers typically reduce the number of rebates offered after generic entry. This case was no different, as Rausser reviewed internal GSK data demonstrating such a reduction in rebates after generic entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. It must be noted that Rausser\u2019s analysis of TPPs does not include fully-insured TPPs, which have been excluded from the class because they do not bear the cost burden for an FP purchase. At the early stages of this litigation, Indirect Purchasers\u2019 proposed class included these TPPs \u2014 one named plaintiff, in fact, was a fully-insured TPP. Again, Stangle and Navarro explained the presence and uninjured nature of these TPPs in their initial declarations. Indirect Purchasers subsequently amended their class definition to exclude these TPPs. All of the remaining named plaintiff TPPs are self-insured plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. Moreover, some of these plan provisions, though present in a particular TPP prescription drug program, are unlikely to effect this analysis because they are rarely triggered. For instance, Stangle admitted that it is unlikely that benefit m\u00e1ximums will ever affect an individual plan member. Named plaintiff Painters utilizes a participating pharmacy network, requiring its plan members to absorb more of a drug's cost if purchased outside that network. In reviewing all of Painters\u2019 actual claims data, Rausser noted that no prescriptions were filled in non-participating pharmacies during the Class Period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b270-14\">. Stangle challenged the sufficiency of Raus-ser's sensitivity analysis by claiming that it only accounted for a two-tier drug formulary. However, Rausser explained that by using such an extreme value ($40 differential in consumer contribution between brand and generic drugs), his sensitivity analysis encompassed more than a two-tier prescription drug plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. Rausser does not argue with the notion that he uses an average price. As he explained: \u201cIt's a price that\u2019s used throughout the pharmaceutical industry. I look at the total dollars, I look at the extended units, and I\u2019ve got a price for which those extended units moved through the market. It is an average price, there is no question about that.\u201d (H\u2019rgTr. 33.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">. Rausser pointed out a third mistake in Stan-gle's analysis: the inclusion of a transaction that fell outside the Class Period. While correcting for this mistake also changed the calculation such that AFL was injured in Florida, this mistake/correction does not carry the same weight as the other two corrections noted above in attempting to ascertain whether Rausser s methodology is capable of establishing impact to this class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">. GSK and Stangle repeatedly note the significant variation between the actual generic prices paid in a given state and Rausser's \u201cbut-for\" generic price. For example, they noted that al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>though Rausser\u2019s \"but-for\u201d generic price never exceeds $50/bottle, named plaintiff Painters reimbursed for generic FP purchases in 2006 at prices as high as $63.97/bottle. Therefore, GSK appears to argue that the \"but-for\u201d prices in 2004 should match up more closely with the actual prices paid in the class states in 2006. However, this contention again fails to recognize that earlier generic entry in 2004 would allow for a lower generic entry price than in 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">. The ten states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">. The rest of the price variation, as Rausser explained, existed because Stangle included prices from the mail-order distribution channel, all of which were found in named plaintiff Painters\u2019 internal data. Rausser demonstrated that these prices also exhibited little price variation. Furthermore, although the prices in the mail-order channel do not exactly parallel those seen in the retail channel, Rausser analyzed each of the distribution channels for FP and found that consumers of FP were injured by GSK's exclusionary conduct. Unlike Rausser\u2019s average brand price for Flonase after generic entry, discussed <em>infra, </em>I do not find that Rausser's average generic price is masking the absence of injury for class members purchasing FP in certain distribution channels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b272-12\">. GSK cites to <em>Reed, </em>in particular, where plaintiffs relied on Rausser\u2019s expert testimony, and the court did not find that he had applied his econometric principles and methods reliably to the particular facts of that case. Yet this case and <em>Reed </em>are simply inapposite. <em>Reed </em>involved allegations of wage-suppression by a class of hospital-based registered nurses. The court noted that numerous factors could affect the wages of an individual nurse \u2014 age, nurse performance and merit, sign-on or retention bonuses, and non-wage compensation (i.e. employee benefits, overtime). Defendants presented evidence that, because of these various factors, the wages paid varied greatly and, more importantly, certain nurses actually received pay increases during the class period. Although Dr. Rausser\u2019s methodology failed to control for all the relevant factors in <em>Reed, </em>I find Rausser\u2019s methodology to be sufficient for the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. In <em>Weiss v. AstraZeneca, </em>No. BC323107 (Ca. Sup.Ct.2008), Rausser criticized the usefulness of similar aggregated data from third-party vendors to establish impact and class-wide damages to a class of uninsured consumers, insured consumers, and third-party payors. Much of the testimony, admittedly, appears contradictory to that set forth by Rausser in the instant case. Rausser explained that <em>Weiss </em>required a different analysis because the class was alleging that a drug manufacturer issued misleading advertisements concerning the effectiveness of one drug compared to another drug with a chemically different makeup, different dosage requirements, and a relatively similar price. On the other hand, this case concerns allegations of foreclosed generic competition, involving two bioequivalent substitutable drugs with vastly different prices. I am satisfied that the market dynamics of the two cases are sufficiently different so as not to undermine Rausser\u2019s testimony in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Both Stangle and Rausser agreed that approximately 21.5% of insured consumers fit this purchasing pattern. Neither expert offered an estimate as to how many uninsured consumers only purchased Flonase before generic entry and made no purchases after generic entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. Navarro and Stangle noted that it is quite possible that TPPs may have only reimbursed for Flonase purchases during the Class Period; for example, a TPP may have shut down in the period between May 2004 and May 2006, or it may only have a few reimbursements in a class state during the Class Period, all concentrated between May 2004 and May 2006, because it is an out-of-state TPP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">. Rausser also explained that common data was available to enable him to \"back out\u201d of his damages calculation transactions by consumers purchasing only Flonase during the Class Period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. Both Rule 23(c)(1)(C), which allows for the amendment of class certification orders at any time before final judgment, and Rule 23(d), which authorizes courts to make appropriate orders to facilitate class action proceedings, provide adequate methods through which I can address any potential difficulties associated with damage allocations as they may arise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
