At trial, the court allowed defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the evidence offered of his prior conviction because it failed to show that he had been previously convicted of a DUII offense. The prosecution offering no further evidence of the prior offense, defense counsel moved for an acquittal on the grounds that an essential element of the traffic crime had not been proven. The state maintained that the defendant was still on trial for the Class A traffic infraction as provided in ORS 487.540<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a lesser included offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>since the jury had already been advised of the prior conviction, it would be prejudicial to allow it to try the traffic infraction, and that the court should grant the acquittal. The state responded that the defendant\u2019s proper remedy, if any, would be a motion for a mistrial because it would be improper to grant an acquittal where a lesser included offense was involved. The state moved to proceed with trial on the offense of DUII as an infraction. The court granted the motion of judgment of acquittal on the DUII crime and denied the motion to proceed on the infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\">Two weeks later the state filed a new complaint charging defendant with the DUII infraction. The defendant responded with a motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy. The court granted the motion to dismiss and the state appeals the granting of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The state argues that the denial of the motion to proceed to trial on the lesser included DUII infraction was the \"functional equivalent\u201d of the declaration of a mistrial because it was based on the fact that the jury had heard about the prior offense. The state proceeds to argue that since the first action ended in a mistrial, double jeopardy does not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\"> The court should have entered an order of mistrial in the first proceeding; instead it entered a judgment of acquittal. A judgment of acquittal bars any further proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-5\">ORS 484.365(1) and (3)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">\"(1) Any Class A traffic infraction, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, shall be prosecuted and be punishable as a Class A misdemeanor if the defendant has been convicted of a Class A traffic infraction, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, or traffic crime within a five-year period immediately preceding the commission of the offense, and the previous conviction was not part of the same transaction as the present offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">\"(3) As used in this section, 'Class A traffic infraction\u2019 means: \"(a) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-8\"> ORS 487.540 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">\"(1) A person commits the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if he drives a vehicle while:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-10\">\"(a) He has .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood as shown by chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine or saliva made under ORS 487.805 to 487.815 and 487.825 to 487.835; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-11\">\"(b) He is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, a dangerous drug or narcotic drug; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-12\">\"(c) He is under the influence of intoxicating liquor and a dangerous drug or narcotic drug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-13\">\"(2) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants is a Class A traffic infraction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-14\">In <em>State v.

Because <em>Mink </em>preceded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown v. Multnomah County Dist. Ct., </em>280 Or 95, 570 P2d 52 (1977), we concluded that the infraction could not be submitted to a jury trial for the infraction but that it could be tried to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
