Prayer for <em>subpoena </em>to the children aforesaid and <em>William Byrnes, </em>and that the land aforesaid be sold for the payment of complainant\u2019s claim. The defendant answered the bill, confessed the claims, and consented to a decree. On the 8th January, 1817, a decree passed <em>for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>sale of the land, and <em>Samuel Richardson </em>was appointed trustee. On 21st January, 1817, the trustee gave bond for his trust, with <em>Benjamin, G. Jones </em>and <em>William Richardson </em>as his securities. On the 25th February, 3817, <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>as trustee, reported a sale to the Chancellor, of the premises mentioned in the bill, to <em>Benjamin Richardson, </em>as the highest bidder, for $j995 50. On the 6th March, 1817, this sale was confirmed \u00abis\u00ae the 15th May ensuing, according to the usual terms. On the 4th November, 1817, proof of publication of the order of ratification <em>nisi </em>was filed. The trustee filed the bond of <em>Benjamin Richardson, Abraham Jarrett </em>and <em>William Richardson, </em>dated 25th February, 1817, to him, as trustee aforesaid, for the amount of the purchase money, conditioned to be paid on the 25th February, 1818. On the 15th July, 1818, <em>Abraham Jarrett </em>filed a petition in the Chancery Court suggesting the death of <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>the trustee, before he had completed the duties of his trust. The Chancellor thereupon appointed <em>Robert Richardson </em>trustee. In July, 1822, <em>Jarrett </em>filed another petition, suggesting that <em>Robert Richardson </em>would not act as trustee, whereupon the Chancellor appointed <em>Stephen Jones </em>to complete the said trust. <em>Jones </em>bonded on the 28th November, 1832, which was approved on the 7th January, 1833. On the 39th August, 1838, the sale made and reported by <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>was finally ratified by the Chancellor. On the 31st March, 1839, <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>filed a petition in the cause aforesaid, setting forth the hill, answer and decree aforesaid, and alleged that, <em>\u201c </em>as the day appointed for the sale approached, the said <em>Samuel Richardson </em>and <em>Abraham Jarrett </em>came to your petitioner, and informed him they had come to a determination to buy said land for their own use, and begged your petitioner to act as their bidder at the sale ; they informing your petitioner, at the same time, that it was necessary when a trustee bought in property for himself on speculation, to have a third person to bid it off for him, and assigned as a reason, that he must make the deed, and he could not deed to himself. Your pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>titioner refused to do this, saying, he did not understand the business, and knew nothing about the Chancery Court; but, on the said trustee\u2019s urgent importunity, and his positive assurance that it was all right, and that the trustee, and <em>A. Jarrett, </em>would pay the Chancellor for the land, he consented to oblige them, to bid in said land, and afterwards on their like assurance, and that it was all innocent matter and form, and that he must bond as the nominal purchaser, he consented to bond for said property in the manner and for the sum the trustee pointed out to him. The petition further stated, that immediately after the sale, the said trustee and <em>Jarrett, </em>entered into the exclusive possession of the land, and on the 22d April, 1817, they began to sell off said land as proprietors thereof; they sold a part to one <em>Wallace, </em>as will appear by a written receipt of <em>Jarrett, </em>hereafter to be exhibited. In the winter after <em>Samuel Richardson\u2019s </em>death, the said <em>Abraham Jarrett </em>took the surveyor of the county, and had the land laid off into three parts. In December of the .same year, the petitioner was induced by <em>Jarrett </em>to give his consent, that he, <em>Jarrett, </em>should sell said land in his own name and the name of petitioner, but with the perfect understanding, that he, the petitioner, had no sort of interest therein, and was only consenting to have his name used as it was used in the bid. The said <em>Jarrett </em>sold the first part to <em>Benjamin Gibson, </em>the second to <em>James Wallace </em>for $335 50, and the third part to <em>Samuel BradfordSov </em>$678, and took obligations to himself, <em>Jarrett, </em>and this petitioner. A bond of <em>Wallace, </em>and <em>Bradford\u2019s </em>note were handed to the petitioner, but he has never received a cent on them, he has no claim on them, and wishes to deliver them to whomsoever the court may direct. The petition then shows the appointment of <em>Jones, </em>as trustee, and alleges that by the procurement of <em>Jarrett, Jones </em>caused a suit at law to be instituted in <em>Harford </em>County Court, upon petitioner\u2019s bond, given under the circumstances aforesaid ; that before the said suits came to trial, the widow and administratrix of <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>feeling and knowing the unjust and fraudulent nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>same, gave a receipt in full, as the readiest means of arresting so wrongful a procedure, and sheilding an innocent dedefendant. On the production of the receipt at the trial, the said suit was non-suited. The petition also alleged, that the said <em>Jarrett </em>received much money from his own sales of the said land, and that after <em>Jarrett </em>had sold said land in parcels, as aforesaid, and received the notes and bonds aforesaid, for the purchase money, he caused several suits at law to be brought on them in his own name, and that of the petitioner; that the petitioner knowing that he had no rightful demand against the makers of said notes and bonds, had those suits struck off the docket. And that the said <em>Jarrett </em>thus being frustrated in all his attempts to reap the fruits of his fraudulent collusion with the said Samuel, and fraudulent imposition on this petitioner, resolved on another course, and on the 7th February, 1825, caused the said <em>Stephen Jones </em>to file a bill on the equity side of <em>Harford </em>County Court, to compel the payment of said bond. To this bill your petitioner filed his answer, as did his secuities on the bond, setting forth fully the circumstances of fraud aforesaid; a commission issued, and your petitioner, upon a very full inquiry into all the circumstances, and producing proof of them, was enabled to satisfy the court of the iniquity and injustice of the suit. At August term, 1828, the cause was finally argued, and the said court thereafter dismissed the said bill with costs. All these proceedings will be exhibited, and are prayed to he considered as part of this petition. Your petitioner also shows, that after the argument of the cause aforesaid, and before a decision of it, the counsel of the complainant <em>(Jones,) </em>applied to the Chancellor, procured a final ratification of the sale, and laid it before the judges of <em>Harford </em>County Court, before the decree of dismissal aforesaid was pronounced. Your petitioner further shews, that notwithstanding all the proceedings aforesaid, and notwithstanding the whole matter has been solemnly passed on after a full investigation by a tribunal of the complainant\u2019s <em>{Jones) </em>own choosing; your petitioner is now menaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>with an application for an attachment, or some other compulsory process, to compel your petitioner and his sureties to pay the amount of the bond aforesaid. Prayer to be protected therefrom by order of the Court of Chancery, that his bond may be given up to be cancelled; that the said <em>Stephen Jones </em>may report to this court on the matter of this petition and his trust; that notice may be given to the parties in the original suit, viz: <em>Abraham Jarrett, Arthur Rider, Jr. William Byrnes, </em>and <em>Sarah, </em>his wife, to answer the petition, and for general relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\"><em>Arthur Rider </em>answered the petition of <em>Benjamin Richardson, </em>and stated, that with many of the facts of the petition he was entirely unacquainted, and consequently could neither confess nor deny them; that he now is, and has long since, been entirely convinced that there was a fraudulent collusion between <em>Abraham Jarrett </em>and the late <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>in the sale of the land mentioned in the petition, and unites in the prayer, that the same may be set aside; that he has a brother, <em>Richard Rider, </em>who resides in <em>England, </em>but who was not a party to the original bill, who is, one <em>of </em>the children and heirs at law of <em>Arthur Rider, </em>deceased :\u2014prayer to be dismissed without costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\"><em>William Byrnes </em>and wife also answered the petition, declaring their ignorance of most of the facts, and belief <em>in </em>a fraudulent combination between <em>A.

That <em>Samuel </em>soon after died, leaving his affairs out of order, and respondent being importuned by <em>Benjamin R., </em>who had now become uneasy as well for himself, who had bonded as purchaser, as for his deceased brother\u2019s wife and children, suggested to said <em>Benjamin, </em>that they might raise the purchase money by a re-sale of the land; he assented, and it was agreed that the land should be re-sold at public auction, by respondent and petitioner\u2014to that end the land was divided and sold as alleged by the petitioner, in three parcels; one to <em>Samuel Bradford, </em>who bought, as this respondent understood, for himself and for <em>William Richardson, </em>the security of the petitioner; another parcel was sold to <em>Wallace ; </em>another to <em>Benjamin Gibson. </em>After the sale, and the purchasers had given bond, at least <em>Bradford </em>and <em>Wallace, </em>and the said <em>Bradford </em>had permitted the said <em>William Richardson, </em>who was a party to the bond for the purchase money, to take and purchase for his own separate use, in consequence thereof the said <em>William R. </em>entered into the possession of said land. &gt; When the purchase money became due, the respondent, who held the bonds for the same in his possession, at the request of the petitioner, instituted suits in <em>Harford </em>County Court, against said <em>Bradford </em>and <em>William </em>ft.,.and hearing no complaint or objection to his recovery, expected at the trial term, to obtain a judgment, when, to his astonishment, the said petitioner, who was a co-obligee in said bonds, came into court and had the suits therein discontinued. The respondent then informed said petitioner, if he intended to claim the bonds for the purchase money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>arising from the <em>second </em>sale, he must expect to pay the original purchase money, and the said petitioner desired to have said bonds, which were delivered to him. Respondent then declined any further interference with said land, andapplied for the appointment of <em>Stephen Jones </em>as trustee, to complete original trust. That suit was brought upon the bond for the first sale, and defeated by collusion, as stated in the petition; that the trustee <em>(Jones) </em>then filed a bill on the equity side of <em>Harford </em>County Court, and at the hearing thereof, it was objected by the said petitioner, that said court had no jurisdiction, and the cause properly belonged to the Court of Chancery, and that the said sale had not been finally ratified, and the bill aforesaid was then dismissed upon these grounds, and not upon the merits; that after said petitioner had maifested his intention of being considered the real purchaser by the course he pursued, respondent assigned his claim on the premises and has now no interest <em>? </em>and he denies that <em>Jones </em>has acted except in the course of his duty, and in good faith. That since the sale in 1819, <em>William Richardson </em>and <em>James Wallace </em>have been in the posses-\u2019 sion of the land sold by them, enjoyed its rents and profits, cut a large quantity of wood and timber, and diminished its value one-half, and that oth\u00e9r persons than respondent are interested in the sale of said land; that the second sale was made at the request of <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>William Richard~ </em>son, and would have paid the original claim but for the misconduct aforesaid, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\"><em>Stephen </em>Jones, the <em>trustee, at the </em>same time reported to the Chancellor, that he ascertained what the records of the Court of Chancery showed to have been done prior to his appointment, and not knowing any thing concerning the circumstances attending said sale, and believing he had nothing to do but to collect the purchase money, instituted a suit on the bond ; at the trial term, under a plea of payment, the defendant produced the receipt of the administratrix of the former trustee, in whose name the suit was brought, for the use of the trustee; upon which your trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tee was compelled to non-pros said suit. Your trustee, believing said receipt to be fabricated and ante-dated, filed a bill on the equity side of <em>Harford </em>County Court\u2014-his action at law, at this time, being gone, by one of the sureties in said bond becoming, on the death of the said administratrix, (which had then occured) the administrator d. b. n. of the former trustee, to whom said bond was given ; and by the answers filed to the bill, your trustee was first informed of the alleged circumstances attending the original sale. That bill was objected to at the hearing, on the ground of want of jurisdiction, and the sale not being finally ratified ; and therefore was dismissed as he has understood. The report then states the possession, use and enjoyment of the land, after the first and second sales, as alleged in <em>Jarretfs </em>answer, and denies all collusion. <em>Prayer </em>that the sale may not be set aside, and that <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>and his sureties, <em>William R. </em>and <em>Abraham J. </em>may be ordered to pay the original purchase money, according to the condition of the bond given therefor, which is herewith exhibited, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">The bill on the equity side of <em>Harford </em>County Court, referred to in the proceedings aforesaid, was filed by <em>Stephen Jones, </em>on the 7th February, 1825.

The bill states that the plaintiff sold to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Arthur Rider, </em>who is since dead, intestate, a tract of land, and that a large balance of the purchase money still remains unpaid; that the late <em>Arthur Rider </em>became indebted to the plaintiff, on other accounts, which sums also remain unpaid, and that the late <em>Arthur Rider\u2019s </em>personal estate is insufficient to pay his debts. His administrators and heirs are made defendants ; and by their answer, they substantially admit the truth of the allegations of the bill. Upon which, by assent of the parties, on the 18th of January, 1817, a decree was passed, in the usual form, directing the real estate of the late <em>Arthur Rider </em>to be sold, and appointing <em>Samuel R. </em>trustee, to make the sale, who reported that he had, on the 25th of February, 1817, sold the lands to <em>Benjamin </em>R.; upon which, on the 6th of March, 1817, an order was passed that the sale be ratified, unless cause be shown to the contrary, before the 15th day of May then next. <em>Samuel R. </em>the trustee, died in the month of February, 1818, and by an order passed on the 18th of July, 1822, the present trustee, <em>Stephen </em>Jones, was appointed to complete the trust, after which no further proceedings were had in this court, until <em>the 29th of </em>August, 1828, when the sale <em>was absolutely ratified and confirmed.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">If the plaintiff had asked no more than the payment of the balance of the purchase, and to have his equitable lien enforced for that purpose, he would have assumed the position, and stood upon the ground of an equitable mortgagee, claiming the benefit of specific lien, and consequently the insufficiency of his deceased debtor\u2019s personal estate, would have formed no essential part of the foundation of his claim to relief. <em>Ellicott vs. Warfield, July, </em>1829. But the plaintiff has introduced into his bill another claim against the intestate, in addition to that of the purchase money, for which he can only be allowed to obtain satisfaction out of the realty, on the ground of the personal estate of his deceased debtor being deficient. This claim gives to this suit, the nature and character of a creditor\u2019s bill, and in such a bill, a plaintiff may introduce all his claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>for the payment of money, however various, even although some may be made in his own right, and others in representative character of executor and administrator ; considering this as a creditor\u2019s bill, the decree itself should have directed the trustee to give notice to the creditors of the <em>late Arthur </em>Rider, to bring in their claims. It is not however, now too late to obtain an order for that purpose, since the trustee cannot be authorised to distribute in payment, any of the proceeds of sale, until the creditors of the deceased have been thus notified, and an account has been stated by the auditor, and confirmed by the court. It is certainly now too late, especially in this way, to inquire into the regularity of the decree of the 8th of January, 1817. I therefore put aside every thing upon that head, which was so much urged in the argument. The petitioner, <em>Benjamin R. </em>admits that he became the purchaser, as reported by the trustee, and that he gave bond for the payment of the purchase money, with <em>A. J. </em>and <em>W. R. </em>as his sureties, but he avers that he consented thus to be named and reported as the purchaser, with no view whatever to his own benefit, but for the sole and exclusive use and behoof of <em>Abraham J. </em>and the late trustee, <em>S. R., </em>at whose express solicitation, and in whose behalf alone, he acted, and consented to be represented as the purchaser, because, as was distinctly understood and stated at the time, the trustee, <em>Samuel, </em>could not himself become a purchaser at his own sale; and such appears to have been the fact and truth of the matter. There was nothing improper in <em>Jarrett\u2019s </em>becoming a purchaser. But a sale, however apparently fair, or in whatever way covered to a trustee, is forbidden by the policy of the law ; and therefore, had this sale been objected to on that ground, within any reasonable time, it certainly could not have been ratified. But I know of no instance in which a mere <em>particeps fraudis, </em>one who has lent himself as a cover to a sale to the trustee himself, has been allowed to come in, and have it vacated, merely because of its having been in fact made to the trustee, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>that ground alone. Looking to all the circumstances of this case ; the time that has been suffered to elapse,\u2014the good price for which the land has been sold, and the waste and injury it has since undergone, I should doubt the propriety of simply rescinding this sale, even at the instance and special prayer of the defendants themselves. But I can see no good reason why the petitioner, <em>B. R. </em>should have it vacated, or why he should be released from the responsibility to which he voluntarily, and with a perfect knowledge of all circumstances, has subjected himself. In allowing himself to be reported, and his bonds to be returned here, as the purchaser, when, in truth, he was not the purchaser, he practiced an imposition upon this court; and in availing himself of the form of the action at common law, in the name of the administratrix of the late trustee, <em>Samuel </em>Richardson,'because his bond had been so made payable, to procure a receipt in full for the purchase money from the nominal plaintiff in that action, when, in truth, he had paid no part of it, for the purpose of preventing a recovery, he practiced a fraud upon the agent of the court, and an imposition upon the court of common law. Surely he who comes here openly avowing all this, ought to be allowed again to shore by justice, to baffle the court, and to scoff at the law. Under all such circumstances, <em>to set aside this sale </em>would be to allow a man openly to profit by his own wrong; it would be to make that sound general rule of equity, which prohibits a trustee from becoming a purchaser at his own sale, a direct instrument of gross fraud.

These positions of fact, he contended, were established by the evidence in the cause. He said the sale made by the trustee to himself, through an agent, was void, not voidable ; and that the heirs of Rider, the original defendant, never having acquiesced in that sale, it was void, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and gave the present trustee, <em>Jones, </em>no right to claim the purchase money upon that sale. That the fact of the sale being public, a fair price' being obtained, and even if the sale' had been ratified in season, would not alter the rule of the Chancery Court. <em>State vs. Reed, </em>4 <em>Harr. and McHen. </em>11. <em>Davis vs. Simpson, </em>5 <em>Harr. and Johns. 147. Sinstack vs. Harding, 4 Harr. and Johns. </em>186. <em>Davou vs. Fanning, </em>2 Johns. Chan, <em>Rep. </em>252. He contended there had been no acquiescence in the original sale, on the part of the defendants: that the first trustee, and the complainant, had managed the pi\u2019operty among, themselves: that for five years there had been no trustee, in fact, and the original parties never notified of the fraud, and therefore never in a situation, nor called upon to acquiesce: that this petitioner was not too late to contest the validity of his purchase with <em>Jarrett: </em>he had always opposed the claim, whenever <em>Jarrett </em>attempted to enforce it against him, and had never acquiesced in it: that for these reasons, the decree of the Chancellor should be reversed. To sustain it, would only permit <em>Jarrett </em>to reap the benefit of a legal fraud, upon the practice and proceedings of the court, and that in fact, he was the only party in interest before the court, as complainant. The trustee, <em>Jones, </em>was acting for his benefit, or of those who took the demand, subject to subsisting equities against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-4\"><em>Taney, </em>(Attorney General U. S.) <em>Gill, </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOK\">contended, that as to <em>William Richardson's </em>appeal, it must be dismissed. In relation to him, the decree was a mere order to pay the purchase money into court by a given day, or shew cause to the contrary, on or before that day. Such an order settled no right in relation to him. Upon showing cause, he might avail himself of any meritorious, or even technical objection to his paying the money. As to the effect of such orders, they cited, <em>Anderson vs. Foulke, </em>2 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>373. Upon the question of appeal from such an order, at once, upon its being passed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>they cited, <em>Hagthorp vs. Hook, </em>1 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>270. <em>Daniels vs. Taggart, Ib. </em>311. The only inquiry here is, whether the chancellor had <em>prima facie </em>grounds for passing such an order. We contend he had. The report of <em>Jones, </em>the trustee, discloses, that to the bond for the purchase money in this case, <em>William Richardson </em>was a party obligor. He was also the administrator <em>d. b. n. </em>of <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>the first trustee. Under such circumstances, an action at law upon, which must necessarily be in the name of the appellant, could not be resorted to. Even if the action could have been maintained, he could not have been induced to sue himself. A resort to equity was manifestly necessary. The facts fully justified the Chancellor\u2019s order. Although it is insisted here, that <em>William Richardson\u2019s </em>appeal must he dismissed, yet the only motive for dismissing it, would be to prosecute the Chancellor\u2019s order. It has been objected here, that the Chancellor could not enforce that order, and compel the appellant, <em>William R. </em>to pay the bond for which he is surety, by attachment, &amp;c.; that over a mere surety he has no jurisdiction; that the bond is his contract, and he cannot compel the payment of that; the remedy is at law: we answer to that, our remedy at law is gone ; the position which <em>W. R. </em>now occupies, as <em>ad. d. b. n. </em>of the first trustee, denies us that right. Upon general principles, then, we may resort to Chancery to counteract the effect of the appellant\u2019s own proceedings, and obtain relief, which we could not procure in a court of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">The remedy which we seek against <em>W. R. </em>will also prevent litigation. His contract shews that he was covenanting with an officer of the Court of Chancery; his bond refers to the original proceedings in this cause, the sale under the authority of the court. The object of Chancery, is to give relief; to grant full and complete redress. The original complaint was within its jurisdiction. This incidental right, upon which granting relief at last depends, the right of enforcing its contracts, ought not to be refused : that would strip the court of its natural and appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>power: to refuse it, would be to place the court at the feet of other tribunals. Convenience sanctions this mode of redress. There is no fact in this case, which requires the intervention of a jury. The sealed contract of the party admits the debt. The relief to which <em>W. R. </em>is entitled, if any, is in equity, and that must be the case with all securities who occupy his situation. What sound principle, then, denies jurisdiction to the court to enforce this contract, and thus put an enid to litigation ? The practice under <em>English </em>chancery sales, furnishes no light here ; nor do we know of any instance in which our Court of Chancery has actually exercised the power. But considering it fit and reasonable that the court should possess it, we claim it for that tribunal, as essential to that forum which grants full relief, by giving a complainant the fruits of his demand, the money. <em>2. </em>We contend that a party who purchases at a trustee\u2019s sale, with a full knowledge of what he is doing, cannot have that sale set aside. That if the same party so far affirms the sale, as to give his bond with security for the purchase money, that is an additional reason, why he should not have the power to set the sale aside. If such a power exists in the purchaser, while all the parties to a cause are satisfied, a court of equity never can be certain that a sale has been made. There can be no such general rule; there must be some peculiar equity to sanction such an application; some defect of title, some misrepresentation, some fraud; a case in which a purchaser bids in one thing, and is about to get something else. The pretended equity here is, that <em>William Richardson </em>purchased for another, and not for himself.\u2014That his principal was the trustee, whose duty it was to make the sale. That as a trustee cannot buy, so, neither can he employ an agent to buy \u00a1for him. We do not deny, that as a general position, it is true that a trustee cannot, and ought not to purchase at his own sale : good policy forbids such an act. He is not to be tempted to turn his duty to his own profit. The object and sole design of this rule is to protect the <em>cestui que trusts. </em>If they do not complain, the law presumes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>that there is no ground for complaint; for though the law forbids a trustee to buy at his own sale, it is yet true, that he may give a full and fair price for the property, and thus the interests of the c. <em>q. t. </em>be as safe under his purchase, as any other. These considerations have established the rule, that if a trustee purchases for his own benefit, the sale is good till set aside by <em>c. q. t. </em>who alone has the right to object. <em>Wilson vs. Troup, 2 Cowen, </em>195. <em>Lester vs. Lester, </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>631, <em>(a.) Campbell vs. Walker, </em>6 <em>Vesey, </em>678. This appellant claims through his principal. To the same extent we conceive he has rights, but no further. The <em>c. q. t. </em>do not object here: the sale is therefore valid. But again; an application to set aside a trustee\u2019s sale, must be made in a reasonable time. 1 <em>Cain\u2019s Cases in Er. </em>1. <em>Chalmers vs. Bradley, </em>1 <em>Jac. and Walk. </em>59. <em>Wilson vs. Troup, 2 Cowen, </em>195. It appears here, from the answer of <em>Arthur Rider, jr. </em>the only c. <em>q. t. </em>who asks the court to set aside the sale, that he has long known of these transactions. The sale took place on the 25th February, 18L7: the petition to set the sale aside, was filed in June, 1829; after a lapse of twelve years, can such an objection, even from c. <em>q. t. </em>be listened to? We contend that the delay has been most unreasonable. It appears, however, from the proof, and the evidence is not contradicted, that the property sold, has been greatly deteriorated ; from 2 to 500 cords of wood have been cutoff the land. The court cannot do justice by vacating this sale. If it could restore the parties to their original rights, and give them the same property, in substantially the same condition, as when sold, the court might, with some color of justice, rescind the sale, but that now is impracticable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">The decree in <em>Harford </em>County Court is no bar, it is not relied on as estoppel in the petition. <em>Neafie vs. Neafie, 7 Johns. Ch. R. </em>1. The petition, to be sure, states the fact, but not by way of estoppel; but as the attitude of the parties is changed, the decree referred to, would not have constituted a bar if pleaded as such. If a defendant, in whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>favor a bill has been dismissed, thinks proper himself, to bring the same matter before the court, he may do so ; and then, the plaintiff in the first bill, is entitled again to be heard by the court. 3. The high Court of Chancery, and the <em>Harford </em>County Court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, are courts of concurrent jurisdiction, and as the proceedings originated in the former tribunal, the latter should not have taken cognizance of it. The trustee who made the sale was the officer of the Court of Chancery, and his conduct as such, was not a subject for inquiry in <em>Harford </em>County Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2z\">Johnson, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atv\">This case is not tobe decided as though <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>alone, was asking to vacate the sale ; the new trustee, Jones, may be considered as uniting in the application. <em>Samuel Richardson </em>was the actual purchaser. The answer of <em>Jarrett </em>shews, that he joined merely to enable <em>Samuel Richardson </em>to pay the purchase money, and without any view himself of becoming interested in the property. <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>was treated by <em>Jarrett, </em>as a party having no interest in the purchase. There can be no doubt that shortly after the sale, and at any time before ratification, the Chancellor would have vacated the sale upon the application of the heirs of <em>Rider, </em>whether it was beneficial, or otherwise. The sale was <em>not </em>ratified until August, 1828, before which, acquiescence cannot be imputed to the parties. One of the objects of the petition of <em>Benjamin Richardson, </em>was to vacate the sale, and have the bond for the purchase money given up; it also called on <em>Jones, </em>the trustee, to report. The order of the Chancellor is in conformity with the prayer of the report filed by <em>Jones, </em>except that part which dismisses the petition of <em>Richardson. </em>The Chancellor erred in affirming in 1829, the sale made in 1818. No assent on the part of <em>Rider\u2019s </em>heirs is proved, nor is it shown that' they acquiesced with a knowledge of the circumstances, without which they cannot be affected with the consequences of acquiescence. . 3 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>410. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The ground upon which a party is precluded from objecting to a sale after acquiescence, is that it would be a fraud upon the purchaser, who may have gone on to put expensive improvements on the property ; but here, so far from improvements, the property has deteriorated. The record exhibits no creditor hut <em>Jarretl; </em>and <em>Rider\u2019s </em>heirs, consequently, are the only <em>cestui que trust, </em>and to them acquiescence is not to be imputed. Now, as these heirs unite with the purchaser in the application to vacate the sale, there does not seem to he any valid objection to it. If, however, the sale be valid, still the Chancellor erred in ordering the purchase money to be brought into court in this summary way. This ' cannot be done when the purchaser has given bond with security, to the trustee. The rule is general, that a legal remedy supersedes the jurisdiction of Chancery ; the principle upon which the right of the court summarily to order the purchase money to be brought in rests, is, that before bond is given, legal proceedings cannot be instituted to enforce its payment. Courts of law cannot he resorted to, to enforce the decrees of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, having authority itself to compel obedience to its own judgments. <em>Anderson vs. Foulk, 2 Harr. and Gill, </em>364. 3 <em>Barn. and Ald. </em>52. 5 <em>Serg. and Low, </em>225. But suppose the <em>purchaser </em>himself, who has bonded, is subject to be dealt with in this summary way, still it is contended, that his securities cannot be; if such an order can be passed against them, it may be enforced by attachment, which is founded alone on a contempt of the court. The securities cannot he guilty of a contempt, because they enter into no engagement of any sort with the court; their contract is contained in, and is evidenced by the bond, which the trustee alone can enforce, by a proceeding at law. If sureties in a bond of this description are subject to attachment, then securities in injunction bonds may be treated in the same way, and thereby the right of a trial by jury would be denied to them. The appeal was not prematurely taken, though the order to bring the money into court, or show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>cause, was not final; still the validity of the sale was conclusively settled, and the rights of the parties, in that particular, finally adjudicated upon.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-5\">Buchanan, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWR\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We entirely concur with the Chancellor, in the view he has taken of the wily conduct of <em>Benjamin </em>Richardson, the appellant, whose whole course in relation to the subject of his petition, bears upon the face of it, the deep impress of trick and fraud; and in his refusal to set aside the sale, and exonerate <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>from his responsibility for the purchase money of the land, to which he had become subjected, by lending himself as a cover, to the violation of his duty, by an unfaithful trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The policy of the law forbids, that a trustee shall become a purchaser, directly, or indirectly, at his own sale, and if he does, such sale may, and will be set aside, on the proper and reasonable application of the parties interested. In this ease, <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>alleges in his petition, that he became the purchaser of the land at the instance, and for the exclusive benefit of <em>Abraham </em>Jarrett, and <em>Samuel Richardson, </em>a trustee appointed by the Chancellor, for the sale of it. Thus shewing, that although the purchase was nominally by him, the trustee was, with another, virtually the purchaser at his own sale. And upon that ground, and charging also a fraudulent collusion, between <em>Jarrett </em>and the trustee, to whose abuse of trust he admits that he lent himself as a cover, seeks to have the sale vacated; not for the benefit of any whose interest it was that the land should be sold to the best advantage, but to rid himself of a liability in which he has been involved by his own improper conduct. Every step he appears to have taken throughout the whole of his devious course, in connexion with this subject, merits the reprobation, rather than the favorable consideration, of a court of equity. The rule, that a trustee shall not become a purchaser at his own sale of the trust property, was not adopted in favor of trustees, but for the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>interest of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>It is not, therefore, On the application of a trustee, to be relieved from his purchase of trust property at his own sale, that Chancery will interpose to set aside such sale. It is only done in behalf of those who are interested in the faithful execution of the trust. To vacate a sale by a trustee, at which he was himself the purchaser, either directly or through the agency of another, (merely on the principle that a trustee shall not become a purchaser at his own sale,) on the application either of such agent, or of the trustee, whenever it may befound convenient, or to his interest, <em>to get rid </em>of <em>the </em>purchase, would be an abuse of the rule to the prejudice of the <em>cestui que </em>trustand in the emphatic, and very appropriate language of the Chancellor in this case, to make the rule, \u201ca direct instrument of gross fraud.\u201d The order therefore, of the Chancellor, so far as it relates to the dismission of the petition'of <em>Benjamin Richardson </em>with costs, will be affirmed. But so far as it directs <em>Benjamin Richardson, </em>and <em>Abraham Jarrett, </em>and <em>William Richardson, </em>his sureties, to pay the purchase money to the present trustee, or bring it into court, or show cause to the contrary, it is purely interlocutory, and professes to settle nothing between the parties; but affords them an opportunity to show, if they can, that they are not bound to pay, or bring the money into cout as directed, and is not as to that matter, an order from which an appeal will lie. But as doubts are entertained whether a purchaser at a trustee\u2019s sale, who has given bond for the purchase money, can regularly be compelled in this summary way, to pay, or bring the money into court; and a desire has been suggested by counsel, after argument, that we should express an opinion on the question; in order that it may be put at rest, we will very briefly present our views of the subject. Where a sale is made under a decree or order in Chancery, and no bond or security is given for the payment of the purchase money, a practice has grown up in Chancery, and sanctioned by this court, in <em>Anderson vs. </em>Foulke, <em>2 Harr. and Gill, </em>346, to compel ihe purchaser to complete his purchase, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>an order on him in a summary way, to pay or bring the money into court, and that from necessity arising out of the peculiar character of such transactions. No action at law will lie to enforce a decree in Chancery, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. An order of the Court of Chancery ratifying such a sale, is considered as amounting to a decree for the payment of the money; and if that court could not enforce the execution of it, it could not be enforced at all. Before ratification the trustee cannot sue, because until ratified, the sale is not complete and binding; the contract is not perfect\u2014nor can he sue at law after the ratification, because it thereby becomes a sale by the court; a contract with the court; and being but an agent, he cannot sue on a contract between the vendee and the court, and not a contract made and concluded with himself, and the order of ratification vests him with no authority to sue at law for the enforcement of the contract. There is, therefore, in such a case, no person to sue at law, if an action at law would lie to enforce a decree or order in Chancery, and the remedy must be in Chancery. But it may be asked, whence Chancery derives the authority to proceed in a summary way, by order, to enforce the payment of the purchase money; and why not proceed by bill in equity ? The answer to which is, that a <em>Court of </em>Chancery having a clear right to enforce its own decrees, and an order of ratification being considered as amounting to a decree for the payment of the purchase money, a purchaser who neglects or refuses to comply with such decree, is in contempt, and may be dealt with accordingly, by an order in the first instance, (in this State) to bring the money into court, as preparatory to an attachment. And that looking to an order of ratification, as amounting to a decree for the payment of the purchase money, there is no reason for requiring a proceeding by bill, to compel a compliance with such a decree, which would not apply to any other decree; and that such a course of proceeding would lead to endless and unnecessary circuity, without any beneficial result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>But where a bond is given to the trustee for the purchase \u25a0money, under an order of sale from Chancery, requiring bond to be given, the terms of sale are complied with, and a contract entered into, not with the court, but the trustee, on which, after ratification, he has a full and perfect remedy at law, for enforcing the payment of the purchase money, that is recognised and sanctioned by the order of ratification, which, in such case, is not a decree for the payment of the purchase money, but a confirmation only, of what has been done. And though the contract of sale, being perfected by the order of ratification, it is thereby said to become a sale by court, yet the terms of sale bein.g complied with, and the purchase completed, by giving to the trustee as required, a bond to secure the payment of the purchase money, the purchaser is not in contempt by the non-payment of it. The contract on the bond not being with the court, but with the trustee, under the sanction of the court, and the remedy is by suit on the bond in a court of law ; and Chancery cannot enforce it, as a mere bond for the payment of money, by which the original simple contract of purchase is extinguished. And if the payment of the bond, as such, cannot be enforced by a bill in Chancery, <em>afortiori, </em>can it not be enforced in a summary way, by an order to bring the money into court. There must be a deeree, or order of ratification amounting to a decree, for the payment of the purchase money, as a foundation for an order to bring it into court. It is not merely on the ground, that the purchase money is remaining unpaid, that such an order is passed, but it is on the principle that there is a decree, for the payment of the purchase money, and the purchaser being in contempt, the order has for its object the enforcement of that decree. Where there is not such a decree, there can be no such order; and an order of ratification sanctioning and confirming a contract of sale, by which bond and security is given for the payment of the purchase money, cannot we think, be construed to amount to a decree for the payment of it. Where the sale is a cash sale, the order of ratification is held to amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to a decree for payment, which must be enforced in Chancery, there being no remedy at law. But where it is not a cash sale, and bond is given for the purchase money, the order of ratification adopts the bond, which stands in the place of a decree for payment, and is a legal contract, to be enforced at law. Every difficulty has, in this case, been thrown in the way of the recovery of the purchase money by the appellant, <em>Benjamin Richardson; </em>and by lapse of time, and otherwise, the subject is surrounded by some embarrassment. But he cannot expect to avail himself of a lapse of time, brought about by his own improper conduct) and there is no doubt, that under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the trustee, <em>Stephen Jones, </em>may by a bill properly framed, and against the proper parties, coerce the payment of the purchase money still due.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">DECREE AFFIRMED, AND APPEAL FROM THE INTERLOCUTORY ORDER DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
