At the trial the plaintiff proved the endorsement of <em>Charles Green, </em>who resided in the city of <em>Baltimore </em>at the time the note became due; and also proved the signature of said <em>Pic, </em>the maker; and then read in evidence the testimony of <em>John G.

I then prepared a notice of the non-payment, addressed it to <em>Charles Green, </em>and a similar notice addressed to <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>the Second endorsers on the note; which notices I enclosed and put into the post office in the city of <em>Washington, </em>on the evening of the same day, addressed to <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. Baltimore, Maryland; </em>the next morning I returned the note to the <em>President and Directors of the Bank of Washington, </em>accompanied with the protest made by me.\u201d And for the purpose of shewing that the notice of non-payment addressed to <em>Charles Green, the </em>defendant, and mailed at <em>Washington, </em>on the 6th day of February, 1826, under cover to <em>Henry Payson Sf, Co. </em>the next succeeding endorsers to the said defendant, as set forth in the evidence,of <em>John G.

That from the general course of their business, and from the particular custom of their counting house, in respect to such notices, he believed that the notice in question had been duly transmitted to the defendant., And the plaintiff further offered similar evidence, by all the clerks of the house of <em>H.

I now feel you, as the endorser, bound for the payment of the note, and I shall hold you as such, and shall expect the payment of the same in the course of to-day or to-morrow. <em>James Flack.\u201d </em>; is in his hand writing, and that at the time it bears date, he was a clerk in the employ of the plaintiff, and that by the direction of the plaintiff he delivered a notice, of which the above is a true copy, on the 9th of February, 1826, at the store of <em>Coley and Green, </em>of which firm the said defendant was a partner. And the plaintiff then proved by <em>Henry P. Sumner, </em>that soon after Messrs. <em>Flack Sf Co., </em>of which firm the plaintiff was a partner, became known to <em>Henry Payson Co. </em>Mr. <em>Samuel B. </em>Coley, the partner- of the plaintiff, stated, that from the nature of their business as brewers, or mixers of liquors, and manufacturers of cordials, that they would require foreign liquors and wines, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>use in their establishment, and that he stated at the same tim\u00e9, that they were strangers in <em>Baltimore, </em>and did not wish to keep a bank account, and would therefore wish <em>Ilenry Payson Sf Co. </em>to collect their bills receivable, and that in purchasing such articles as suited their business, they would buy from <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>when they could get them upon as favorable terms as from other persons; that after such understanding, the house of <em>James Flack Sf Co. </em>dealt largely <em>with llenry Payson 8f Co., </em>purchasing various articles of merchandise, on credit, and placing with them v\u00e1rious promissory notes, from time to time, as they received them in the course of their business; that <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>occasionally advanced sums of money to said <em>Flack Sf Co. </em>as they required them, which they so advanced, as well for their personal confidence in <em>Flack Sf Co. </em>as in the faith of the said notes, which they had deposited with them in the course of their dealings as aforesaid. And also proved by the same witness, that the amount of notes credited <em>Flack Sf Co. </em>in their account current with the house of <em>Payson Sf Co., </em>included the note on which the present suit is instituted; and that the charge therein afterwards stated of the said note, to the debit of <em>James Flack, </em>was in consequence of the said note having been returned protested for non-payment, by the drawer, who resided In the city of <em>Washington, </em>and that the dealings of the said house of <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>with <em>James Flack, </em>continued after the dissolution of the partnership of <em>James Flack Sf Co., </em>without any now understanding between them as regards advances, and that such advances were made after such dissolution, in the same manner as before; that they kept a mutual interest account with each other, both before and after the dissolution aforesaid, and that from the nature and course of their dealings with tlie said'house of <em>Flack Sf Co. </em>and with the said plaintiff, aftei; the dissolution aforesaid, \u2022 they considered themselves as the hankers of the said <em>Flack Sf Co. </em>and of the plaintiff, after the dissolution aforesaid; and the said witness being asked by the counsel for the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>dant, to give a definition of the word \u201cbanker,\u201d as he applied it to this particular case, stated, that he meant thereby to express \u201ca sort of combined agency in the purchase of goods, and collection of notes, and making advances of money.\u201d It was proved on the part of the defendant, by the cross examination of the said witness, that <em>Henry Pay-son Sf Co. </em>when they received the notes for collection from <em>Flack Sf Co., </em>placed them in their books as hills receivable* and when they were paid, placed the amount thereof to the credit of <em>Flack Sf Co.; </em>that <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>did not consider themselves in any way bound by the receipt of such notes, unless the money,due oh them was paid at their maturity; that all the expenses of collecting, said \u25a0 notefi were paid by <em>Flack Sf Co.; </em>that no advance was made by <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>on the note on which ';the suit Was brought, and that if the same had been paid at maturity,, and <em>Flack </em>had called for the money paid thereon, it would, have been given to him as his own money; and that if the note had not been paid, and <em>Flack </em>had asked, for, the advance of that amount of money, it would have been given to hint on his personal credit; that <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>were not in the habit of receiving notes for collection from persons residing in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and that witness had no knowledge that any other note was placed in the hands,of <em>Henry Payson Sf Co. </em>for collection, except those received from <em>Flack Sf Co., </em>and that they were not the bankers of any other house in the like manner in which they were the bankers of <em>Flack Sf Co.; </em>and further proved, that the store of <em>Coley and Green </em>Was about five hundred yards distant from the store of <em>Flack; </em>and further proved, that the said note was not endorsed,by <em>James Flack-, </em>the plaintiff, at, the time it fell, due; and that the mail from <em>Washington </em>for <em>Baltimore,left </em>the former place early in the morning,every day for the latter, where it arrived at an early hour in the same afternoon: whereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and assigned the following reasons,: , 1. That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>plaintiff had not used due and resonable diligence in the delivery of notice to the defendant, of the dishonor of the note on which this suit was brought. 2. That such notice being delivered on the 9th of February, 1827, was one day too late; and 3. That there was no evidence of notice, to charge the defendant as endorser of the note on which this suit was brought; which instruction the court (Archer, Ch.

The general issue was pleaded, and on the trial of the cause, the plaintiff proved the endorsement of the payee on the note, who re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>sided in the city of <em>Baltimore </em>at the time the note became due, and also the hand writing of the maker. <em>John Pic, </em>the maker of the note, residing in the city of <em>Washington, </em>the note was transmitted to the bank of <em>Washington </em>for collection, by <em>Henry Payson </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Co. </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>as the agents of <em>James Flack, </em>by whom it had been placed in their hands, for a similar purpose. When the note became due, it was placed by the bank, in the hands of a notary, who demanded payment thereof, which being refused, he prepared a notice thereof, addressed to <em>Charles Green, </em>and a similar notice addressed to <em>Henry Payson Co., </em>who were endorsers on the said note; which notices the notary endorsed, and put in the post office, in the city of <em>Washington, </em>on the evening of the same day, addressed to <em>Henry Payson fy Co. </em>at <em>Baltimore. </em>In this case, two bills of exceptions were taken in- the court below. In the first exception, for the purpose of showing that the notice of nonpayment, addressed to <em>Charles Green, </em>the defendant, and put into the post office at <em>Washington, </em>on the 6th February, 1826, the day the note became due, under cover to <em>Henry Payson fy Co. </em>the next endorsers, was transmitted to the defendant in due time; the plaintiff offered to prove by sundry witnesses, that it was the invariable, and uniform practice of that house, to forward such notices immediately upon receipt of them, and that they had no doubt from the course of their business, that they had forwarded this particular notice to <em>Charles Green, </em>the defendant, but that they had no recollection upon the subject of forwarding this particular notice to the defendant. That from the general course of their business, and from the particular custom of th\u00e9ir counting house, in respect to such notices, they be- . li\u00e9v\u00e9d the notice in question had been duly transmitted to the defendant. To this evidence the defendant objected, as being incompetent, and inadmissible to prove that notice, of the non-payment of the said note was received by, or given to him ; which objection the court sustained, and refused to permit the said evidence to be given to the jury.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>In this opinion of the court we do not think there is any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the opinion given by the court in the second exception, we also entirely concur. The note became due on the 6th February, 18.26, and the proof offered in this exception established the fact, that <em>Green, </em>the defendant, never received notice, until the 9th of that month, which was unquestionably one day too late. The name of <em>Flack </em>was not endorsed upon the bill; and in <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>23, the principle is stated to be a general one, \u201c that no person can become a party to a bill, unless his name appears on some part of it.\u201d For this rule he refers to the opinion of <em>Fuller, </em>in the case of <em>Fenn vs. Harrison, </em>in 3 <em>Term, </em>759, where he says : <em>\u201c </em>In the case of a bill of exchange, we know precisely what remedy the holder has, if the bill be not paid. His security appears wholly on the face of the bill itself. The acceptor, the drawer, and the endorsers are all liable in their turns, but they are only liable, because they have written their names on the bill.\u201d The law seems to be well settled, that where all the parties reside in the same place, each party has a day to give notice. In 1 <em>Wheat. Selw. </em>295, the law is laid down to be, \u201c where there are several endorsements, and the holder gives notice of dishonor to his endorser, neither that endorser, nor any prior endorser is bound to transmit the notice of dishonor on the very day on which he receives it. Each successive endorser will be considered as having used due diligence, if he transmit the notice of dishonor, on the day after it is received, in a ease where all the parties live in the same place; but if he neglect giving the notice on that day, and the day after, it will be too late.\u201d In <em>Jameson vs. Swinton, </em>2 <em>Camp. N. P. C. </em>373, the same rule was recognized by Lawrence, J. viz: \u201c that each party to the bill has a day to give notice.\u201d The name of <em>Flack </em>not being upon the bill in this case, he was not entitled to the benefit of the principle, that each party is entitled to an entire day for the purpose of giving notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201c The putting of a letter into the post office, giving the notice, is sufficient, without proof of its having been actually received, and if the party to be affected with the notice, reside in a different place from the holder, the notice may be sent through the post offiee, to the post office nearest the party entitled to such notice;\u201d 1 <em>Wheat. </em>298. <em>Bank of Columbia vs. </em>Magruder, 6 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>181. According to the admission of the parties, it appears, that the mail left <em>Washington </em>city early in the morning, and arrived in Baltimore, at an early hour the same afternoon. In legal presumption, the notice must have reached <em>Payson fy Co. </em>on the 7th February, who were legally bound to deliver notice to <em>Green </em>on the following day. This not having been done, we are of opinion, that the court below were right, in the opinion expressed by them in the second exception, and affirm their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
