B. </em>was, after the death of her father, lawfully married to a certain <em>George W. Bailey ; </em>that before payment of any part of the said sum of $255:40&amp;, she departed this life; that after the death of his wife and before payment of the said sum of $255:40\u00bf- or any part thereof, and on the 7th December, 1826, <em>G. W. B. </em>then a resident of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>applied to <em>the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors in and for the city and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>county of </em>Baltimore-, for the benefit of the Insolvent Laws, and obtained a personal discharge, and on the same day, the said <em>John Sands </em>was appointed by the said commissioners, provisional trustee of the said <em>G. W. B. </em>and as such gave bond with security; that on the 15th January, 1827, a certain <em>Ritson Browning </em>was appointed by the said commissioners, the permanent trustee of the said <em>G. W. B. </em>but never gave bond as such permanent trustee, and no deed of assignment was executed by said <em>John Sands </em>to said <em>R. B.; </em>that on the 21st day of April, 1827, the said commissioners made the following report-:\u2014\u201cIn the case of <em>George W. </em>Bailey, an applicant for the benefit of the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland, </em>the undersigned commissioners of insolvent debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>in pursuance of the act of Assembly, do report to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, that having diligently inquired and examined into the nature and circumstances of the said application, it appears, Upon such examination, that the said <em>Baity </em>hath <em>not </em>complied with the terms and conditions of the said insolvent laws, and hath <em>not </em>acted fairly and <em>bona fide; </em>and the said commissioners now return to the office of the clerk of the said court, there to be recorded, the schedule, and all the proceedings which have been had before them in the matter of \u2022the said application. Given under our hands this 21st April, 1827, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">It is further admitted, that on the 10th of May, 1828, the said <em>John Sands, </em>who was recommended by a majority of the creditors of the said <em>G. W. B. </em>was appointed by the said commissioners the permanent trustee of the said <em>G. W. B., </em>and as such gave bond, with security, which security was approved of by the said commissioners, and a copy of which bond is as follows, &amp;c. <em>\u201c </em>That after the application to the said commissioners of the said <em>G. W. B., </em>and on the 14th February, 1827, <em>Bailey </em>executed and delivered a release to <em>Glasgow, </em>in consideration of $50, of his claim in right of his wife, under her father\u2019s will. That at the time the said <em>G. W. B. </em>signed the release, there was written on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the same, and signed by <em>William T. Browning, </em>a memorandum, guaranteeing the said <em>Glasgow, </em>from any claim from <em>Ii. B. </em>as trustee of <em>Bailey. </em>It is further admitted that the release, together with the memorandum thereon, was delivered to <em>W. R. G. </em>on the day it bears date, and that <em>W. R. G. </em>then knew that <em>G. W. B. </em>had applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws, and was informed by <em>Bailey </em>that he intended to withdraw his application, which was in fact never done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">Upon the foregoing statement of facts, the parties, <em>John Sands </em>and <em>William R. </em>Glasgow, pray the opinion of the Orphans Court of <em>Baltimore </em>county, as to the right of said <em>W, R.

Bailey, </em>and for which proportion the said <em>Glasgow </em>now claims to be allowed the sum of $255 40&amp;, as paid or satisfied to the said <em>George W. </em>Bailey; the court being of the opinion, that inasmuch as it is admitted that no part of the same was paid by the said Glasgow, before the said <em>Bailey </em>applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this <em>State, </em>and had a trustee appointed, and that said <em>Glasgow </em>had information that said <em>Bailey </em>had thus applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws, that said <em>Glasgow </em>ought not to have paid any part of the same to the said <em>Bai</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>ley. </em>It is therefore on this ninth day of February, 1829, ordered and decreed, that <em>William R. </em>Glasgow, administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, &amp;c. of <em>Peregrine G. </em>Browning, deceased, pay to <em>John Sands, </em>trustee of the said <em>George W. Bailey, </em>the sum of $255 40^, being his proportion of the personal estate of the said deceased, in right of his wife, <em>Mary Ann; </em>and that he also pay costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">From this decree <em>Glasgow </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b107-6\">This cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

That after the commissioners of ins^hftW^fa^nd for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>h^l^jS^AjSl^lort, upon the application of an insolvent^JttjS?', for the bMiMt of the Insolvent laws of the State of <em>M^mar\u00edd, ti\u00a10\u00cdl^l\u00ednork </em>County Court, they are divested of allR^iwer over thgiampication and proceedings of the insolvenfceht(\u00bb|^i^:aniia^therefore, appoint a permanent truste^auer sueVfeport; and having no authority to appoint the tnfstee/To/in <em>Sands </em>is not in fact, permanent trustee, and cannot therefore, act as such. That the distributive share of <em>Browning\u2019s </em>estate, to which <em>Bailey </em>was entitled in right of his wife, was a <em>chose in action, </em>could not be, and was not assigned to the provisional trustee. It was not <em>Bailey\u2019s </em>property till reduced into possession. The provisional trustee had no right to reduce it into possession, <em>Bailey </em>being then the only person who could reduce it into possession, and having reduced it into possession for valuable consideration received from the administrator\u2014the administrator should not be made to pay the amount to the trustee appointed after the execution of the release from <em>Bailey </em>to the administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\"><em>He cited </em>1816, <em>ch. </em>221, <em>sec. </em>2. 3. 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub. </em>5, <em>sec. </em>8. <em>Brown vs. Brice, </em>2 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>24. <em>Leadenham vs. Nicholson, </em>1 <em>Ib. </em>278. <em>State vs. Krebs and </em>Warner, 6. <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>34.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Gill </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5y\"><em>cited Schuyler </em>vs. Hoyle, 5 <em>John, C R. </em>206. <em>Stewart vs. Stewart, 7 Ib. </em>247. <em>Hurt vs. Fisher, 1 Harr. and Gill, </em>96. 2. <em>Madd, </em>636. <em>Mitford vs. Milford, </em>9 <em>Ves.

First\u2014whether the commissioners of insolvent debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>after having appointed a permanent trustee, and certified to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court that the applicant hath <em>not </em>complied with the terms and conditions of the insolvent laws, can, upon the neglect of such trustee to give the requisite bond within a reasonable time, appoint a new trustee ? <em>Secondly; </em>whether a <em>chose in action </em>of a deceased wife is vested in the trustee of her surviving husband, an insolvent petitioner ? By the act of 1816, which provides for the appointment of these commissioners of insolvency, applications for the benefit of the insolvent laws were made to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, who referred them to the commissioners, who, after proceeding to the appointment, first, of a provisional, and then of a permanent trustee, were required to examine into the nature and circumstances of all such applications, and if, upon such examination, it appeared that the petitioner had complied with the terms and conditions of the insolvent laws, and had acted fairly and <em>bona fide, </em>they were to report the same to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, \u201cand return the schedule and all proceedings which may have been had before them, to the office of the clerk of <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, there to be recorded.\u201d Under this law, the County Court were authorized to grant either a personal or final discharge to the petitioner: and jf the examination by the commissioners resulted unfavorably to the applicant, no report thereof was to be made to the County Court, nor the schedule, or any of the proceedings before the commissioners returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>With a view to relieve <em>Baltimore </em>County Court from many of the duties connected with applications for releases under our insolvent laws, to which it was still subject, the Legislature passed the act of 1819, <em>ch. </em>84, investing the commissioners with the power of granting personal discharges, directing all applications of insolvents to be presented to them, instead of the County Court, and transferring to them all the powers of Baltimore County Court, or the judges thereof, in relation to such application, except the granting of final discharges and trying allegations, &amp;e. It also enjoins the commissioners, \u201c in case it shall appear to them that the applicant hath not complied with the terms and conditions of the insolvent laws, to certify the same to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, and also to transmit to the clerk thereof, all deeds of assignment executed by any such applicant, or applicants, and all such other papers relating to the estate of such applicant or applicants, and brought before them as they may deem it proper to have preserved and recorded.\u201d But it does not require, as in the case of their favorable report, a return of the schedule and all proceedings which may have been had before them. These, when their report is unfavorable to the applicant, remain in their custody, in order that they may comply with the injunction in the 6th <em>sec. </em>of the act of 1819, which declares that \u201cwhen the report of the commissioners shall be unfavorable to the applicant or applicants, the said commissioners shall cause the trustee to proceed in the execution of the trust, in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, regulations, and restrictions, as if the report of the said commissioners, had been favorable to such applicant or applicants. By the 4th <em>sec. </em>of the act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, which this court has said is part of the insolvent system, applicable as well to <em>Baltimore </em>city and county, as to the rest of the <em>State of </em>Maryland, the trustee before he proceeds to act, shall give bond to the <em>State of </em>Maryland, for the use of the creditors of the petitioning debtor, in such penalty as the County Court shall direct, and upon his \u201cneglect to give bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>as aforesaid in a reasonable time, to be judged of by the County Court,\u201d the County Court shall appoint such person as they shall think proper, in his place, who shall give bond as aforesaid.\u201d Upon viewing these several acts of assembly in connexion with each other, we think that the commissioners were authorized, under the circumstances in which they did so, to appoint <em>John Sands </em>the permanent trustee of Bailey, and to take bond from him as such. That the commissioners are invested with the power in the first instance, of appointing a permanent trustee, is obvious from the 3d <em>sec. </em>of the act of 1816, and the act of 1820, <em>ch. </em>182 ; and by adverting to the 4th <em>sec. </em>of the act 1805, and the 1st and 6th <em>sections </em>of the act of 1819, we deem it equally clear, that they acted within the scope of their powers in making the appointment objected to in the case before us. The schedule of the petitioner in legal contemplation remained with the commissioners, and they only, perhaps, could therefore properly direct the penalty of the bond to be given by the trustee. By the act of 1819, their investiture with all the powers of <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, is as full and comprehensive as language could make it, and the peculiar and exclusive fitness of the commissioners for the discharge of the duty which they have assumed in this case, leaves no doubt in our minds of the legality or propriety of its exercise. Had the County Court have made the appointment, having no knowledge of the amount of debts due from or to the petitioner, or the value of his property, they would have had nothing to guide them in prescribing the penalty of the trustees\u2019 bond, which by law, it would be their duty to direct. Against the exercise of the power by the commissioners, no solid objection has been urged. \u2019Tis true in this case the schedule and all the proceedings before them, were returned to the clerk of the <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, to be recorded. But this does not vary the general principle applicable to like cases; it was done in obedience to no mandate of the law, in contemplation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>which the schedule and their proceedings were still in their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In our present decision, we mean to intimate no opinion as to the power of the commissioners to make an appointment like the present, where their report to the County Court has been in favor of the insolvent debtor, and the schedule and all their proceedings returned therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The second question we deem too clear to require either authority or illustration to sustain our opinion upon it. By the act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub-ch. </em>5, <em>sec. </em>8, it is enacted that \u201c if the intestate be a married woman, it shall not, as heretofore, be necessary for her husband to take out letters of administration, but all her <em>choses in action </em>shall devolve upon her husband, in the same manner as if he had taken out such letters.\u201d Under the provision of the. act of assembly, <em>Bailey </em>might have collected the claim now in controversy, and have applied the same to his own use ; he was competent to release, compromise, assign or dispose of it, in any way he might see fit; and to all the purposes of this controversy, it is to be regarded in the same light as if it were a debt or <em>chose in </em>action, due to <em>Bailey </em>himself, and consequently vested in the appellee upon his giving bond as required by law. The statutory assignment of the petitioner\u2019s estate, is of all property which he has a claim, title to, or interest in, and of all debts, rights and claims, which he has, or is in any way entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">DECREE AEIURMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
