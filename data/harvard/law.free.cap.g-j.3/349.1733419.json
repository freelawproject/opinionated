The plaintiff was then put into possession, under a writ of <em>habere facias </em>regularly executed. In 1837, C, claimingtitle to the land, by petition, in which the tenant in possession united, prayed the <em>County Court </em>to set aside the judgment, restore the possession, and admit the petitioners to defend the action, upon the usual terms; this being granted, the defendants after-wards moved the court, to stay all proceedings, upon payment to the lessor, the rent due to him at the time of bringing the suit and the costs. This motion being also granted, the plaintiff appealed.

About nine years afterwards, (to wit, November 23, 1827,) a petition was filed by <em>Sarah Carey, </em>and the tenant in possession, to set aside the judgment against the <em>casual ejector, </em>and to be permitted to appear to, and defend the said action, they making the usual confession of lease, entry, and ouster, and that a writ of restitution might issue, to restore the possession to the tenant in possession, and that a rule might be laid upon the lessor of the plaintiff, to shew cause why the said motion should not be granted. Upon this petition the court ordered the judgment to be set aside, the cause to be brought up by regular continuances, and a writ of restitution to issue to restore the possession to <em>Sarah Carey, </em>who claimed the title, and that she be admitted as defendant. To declaration filed against her, <em>Sarah Carey, </em>put in the plea of not guilty; and afterwards, on the 8th day of January, 1829, moved the court, that the proceedings in the cause might be stayed, upon payment to the lessor the rent due to him, at the time of the suit brought, and the costs of suit. On the 21st day of February, 1829, the court, \u201cordered, that the proceedings in this cause be stayed, upon the defendants paying to the lessor of the plaintiff,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>all rent in arrear, which accrued from the time of the conveyance of the reversionary right to him, up to the day of the delivery of possession of the premises to the lessor.\u201d Whereupon the plaintiff prayed an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b359-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

The motion to set aside the judgment in this case was too late in point of time. Whenever the acquiescence is so long, that the party may be presumed to have submitted to the judgment complained of, the court will not disturb it. No judgment from which an appeal will not lie, can be considered a recent one. If an opportunity of trial has been lost by the delay, the judgment must stand, even though the motion to strike out, be founded upon an affidavit of merits. <em>West vs. Davis, 7 East. </em>363. <em>Harris vs. Masters, </em>9 <em>Serg. and Low. </em>158. <em>Aslin vs. Parkin, 2 Burr. </em>665, 756. <em>Jackson vs. Stiles, 4 Johns.

She had no notice of the proceeding, or at least there is no evidence of notice. The court is not at liberty to infer notice from circumstances, when positive proof might have been adduced. <em>Klinefelter\u2019s </em>affidavit, or the affidavit of <em>Richards, </em>could certainly have been .procured, if notice in fact existed.

Wherever a judgment in ejectment has been stricken out, upon the'tenants failing to appear, it has always been one of recent date, and never of such long standing as the one involved in the present1 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>troversy. It has generally been where the period had been too short, for improvements of importance to have been made, in the intermediate time, and where, as the books say, no trial had been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">If this case were to be governed by a rule adopted by analogy to that prescribed by the Legislature, for the limitation of appeals, the proceeding would be clearly unwarrantable. But it is not deemed necessary to rely upon that legislative enactment as the basis of our decision, as it may be fully sustained by considerations drawn from other sources. It is true, that actions of ejectment, being creatures of their own, courts of justice will lend a more favorable ear to applications of this nature, than in other <em>cases; </em>but still there are certain limits prescribed by reason, and the policy of the law, whicJfe\u00a3agf?t'&lt;siQt to be transcended. In <em>Jackson vs. Stiles, </em>the court say,\u2014\u201cIn ejectment, as it i//t^c^creature of v^he courts, every thing will be done to pk&gt; mote iba^pwrce tmthe case, according to right, and the com^wm go further t| protect the possession, when it can beldone-^^\u00edftdhr injjiry to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, than it is willin^^other chisto proceed. As therefore, there was a full knowlMgem October last, of an intention to make this application, and the transactions are all of a recent date, we are of opinion that the default entered against the casual ejector, the judgment thereon, and the writ of possession sued out, be set aside, and a writ of restitution issue, on payment of costs.\u201d So in <em>Jackson vs. Stiles, </em>4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>490, the court also say: \u201cThe excuse given by the attorney of the defendant, for not entering into the consent rule in season, is frivolous and inadmissible. But here the tenant swears to merits, and as no trial has been lost, we will not let the possession be changed in an action of ejectment, without an opportunity to the defendant to defend it. It was said in the case of <em>Jackson ex. Dem. Rosekraus vs. Stiles, </em>1 <em>Caines, </em>503, that the court would set aside a default, to protect the possession of the tenant, in an action of ejectment, when they would not do</p>\n<p id=\"AXH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>it in any other action. We therefore grant the motion, on payment of costs, and on the tenants entering into the consent rule, and pleading within ten days, so that the cause may be tried at the ensuing circuit in <em>Ulster.\u201d </em>In <em>Runn. Ejec. </em>120, the law is stated to be as follows.: \u201cIf a judgment be signed against the casual ejector, and it be made appear that no declaration was rightly served, the court will set it aside. Also, where a judgment has been obtain-, ed against the casual ejector, but no trial lost, the court will, on payment of costs, and the tenants entering into the common rule to confess lease, &amp;c., set aside such judgment, as in other actions; and not put the tenant to the charge and hazard of recovering back his possession by another action.\u201d So in <em>1st Richardson\u2019s Prac. </em>506, the law is laid down to be as follows: \u201cWhere judgment is obtained against,, the casual ejector, and a trial is not lost, the court will, on payment of costs, and entering into the common rule for confessing lease, entry and ouster, set aside such judgment, as in other actions, and not put the tenant to the charge and hazard of recovering back his possession by another action.\u201d In <em>Spurrier\u2019s Lessee vs. </em>Yieldhall, 2 <em>Harr. and McHen. </em>173, the case was as follows: \u201cAn action of ejectment was brought to <em>May </em>term, 1785, and at <em>May </em>term, 1786, a judgment was confessed for possession and costs. A writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>issued <em>to October </em>term, 1786, and the sheriff returned, \u201cpossession delivered.\u201d At <em>May </em>term, 1787, it was ruled by the court, \u201cthat <em>Resin Spurrier </em>show cause, this term, why the writ of possession, and judgment entered at <em>May </em>term, 1786, for his lessee, and <em>Benjamin </em>Yieldhall, should not be set aside.\u201d And on the 21st of <em>May, </em>in the same term, the following <em>entry </em>was made: \u201cIt appearing to the court, by the affidavit of <em>Upton Scott, </em>that \u00e1t the time of commencing the suit of <em>ReSi\u00f1 Spurrier\u2019s </em>lessee, against <em>Benjamin </em>Yieldhall, the said <em>Upton Scott </em>was in possession of nine and a quarter acres of the land, for which the ejectment was brought, and that no copy of the declaration in ejectment was - served upon him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>and that the said <em>Scott </em>claims the said nine and a quarter acres of land, as tenant in fee simple, and a rule having been served on the plain tiff to show cause, &amp;c., and the said <em>Upton Scott </em>now praying that the judgment and execution be set aside, as to the said nine and a quarter acres, and that he be admitted defendant in this cause, as to the said acres: <em>Ordered, </em>that the judgment be struck out, as to the said nine and a quarter acres claimed by the said <em>Upton Scott\u201d </em>By all these cases the principle seems to be affirmed, that it is only where the judgment is a recent one, that the court will interfere for the purpose of setting it aside, to enable the tenant to appear and defend his possession. But no case it is believed can bo found, where a judgment has been stricken out, after such a lapse of time, and under the circumstances existing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">judgment reversed, <em>and a writ of Restitution awarded, to restore the possession to the appellant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
