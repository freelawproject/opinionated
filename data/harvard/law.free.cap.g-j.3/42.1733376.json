The plaintiff gave in evidence the following contract, to wit: \u201c Agreement between <em>Charles L. Boehme </em>and <em>E. L. Finley. E. L. Finley, </em>intending to build a dwelling house and other houses, on his farm at <em>Canton, </em>and to have all the bricks for such houses made on the farm; and <em>Charles L.

Boehme, </em>contracts to make for the said <em>Ebenezer L. Finley, </em>300m bricks, on said farm; the bricks to be made and burnt in a workman-like maimer, and in the following proportions :\u2014not less than one-fifth to be of salmon bricks, two-fifths of red bricks, and two-fifths to be of black bricks. The first kiln of bricks to be ready for delivery in the month of May next\u2014the number of bricks to be ascertained by the carters3 tickets, which are to be given on the delivery of each load\u2014in consideration of which <em>E.

As wit-witness our respective hands and seals, this seventeenth day of February, 1830.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">And then proved by <em>Charles Brown, </em>a competent witness, that he examined the bricks manufactured by the plaintiff, for the defendant, at <em>Canton </em>farm: that there was a clamp of bricks burnt\u2014he recommended <em>Boehme </em>to take off nine inches from the clamp, which <em>Boehme </em>did\u201479,300 remained; there was six cords of wood remaining, and casing sufficient for all the raw bricks\u2014then 130,000 bricks in the shed, as nearly as they could ascertain\u2014the 79,300 bricks were burnt as well as the clay would admit, the clay was weak, the bricks were merchantable\u2014the unmerchantable bricks taken down, were seven or eight thousand. That <em>Finley </em>refused to deliver the wood to burn the other bricks with, unless paid for in cash\u2014that the bricks under the shed were well prepared for burning, and were not burnt for want of wood. The conversation with <em>Finley </em>was on the 3d day of November. That the bricks would have worked up well on the ground, but would not bear transportation\u2014merchantable bricks were from $5,50 to $6\u2014 would have made no difference in price by selling 300,000. <em>Finley </em>told <em>Boehme </em>that he had not complied with his contract\u2014that he, <em>Finley, </em>was in advance, and would furnish no more wood unless paid for in cash\u2014half a cord of wood requisite to burn 1000 bricks. And also proved by <em>James Shields, </em>that the witness is a brickmaker\u2014selected the clay himself\u2014commenced where he found the best clay, convenient to water\u2014dug clay for 300,000 bricks\u2014was detained three or four weeks for want of plank\u2014the clay was all dug and the floors ready\u2014applied to the carpenter for plank\u2014 never saw <em>Finley </em>at the brick yard, although he staid there constantly, the carpenter furnished the plank\u2014he applied to <em>Finley </em>at his office\u2014in two or three days the plank came\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>he moulded about 200,000 bricks\u2014Mr. <em>Boehme </em>would not have more moulded\u2014after they stopped, <em>Boehme </em>and witness called on <em>Finley\u2014Finley </em>refused to deliver wood unless for cash\u2014clay was selected with care\u2014there is none better there\u2014and more bricks have been since made out of it\u2014the bricks were well burned, well moulded, and well tempered\u2014115,000 to 120,000 in the clamp\u2014shed would hold 160,000 to 170,000\u2014never saw <em>Finley </em>at the yard\u2014\u25a0 when he applied to <em>Finley </em>for plank, <em>Finley </em>said he thought he had it, and in two or three days the plank came\u2014they were afterwards delayed six or seven days from burning for want of plank\u2014he never applied to <em>Finley </em>for plank, for the <em>clamp\u2014Boehme </em>was there once or twice a week\u2014 there was wood enough cut upon the place, in the same field, to have burnt another clamp. The plaintiff also offered evidence to the jury, that he delivered 4100 bricks to defendant, which were received by defendant. The defendant to support the issue on his part, gave evidence of the following payments, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>Cash payments made C. L. Boehme.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">1820, May 9, Cash paid him - - $100 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">\u201c May 11, Cash paid him ... g00 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-8\"><em>u </em>Juno 17, Cash paid him - - 250 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-9\">And of the delivery of 43\u00a3 cords of wood, at $2.50 per cord. The defendant then moved the court to direct the jury, that if they believed that the defendant Finley, was in advance in money to the plaintiff upon the contract, he was not bound to deliver the wood demanded, until paid for\u2014which direction the court [Archer, C. J., Haj\u00edsobt,, and Kell, J.] refused to give; but instructed the jury, that the defendant under the contract was bound to deliver any wood demanded, which might be necessary for the burning of the bricks, in the progress of the contract\u2014the defendant excepting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-11\">2d Exception. The plaintiff and defendant, having given the evidence as stated in the defendant\u2019s first exception, the defendant prayed the court to direct the jury. 1st. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the plaintiff is not entitled in this case, to recover any other damages than the excess between the price of so much fire wood delivered at <em>Canton </em>farm, as would have been necessary to burn so much of the 300,000 bricks, as were not burnt by plaintiff; and the price at which said wood was by the contract in this case, to have been furnished by defendant. 2d. That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, unless the jury shall find from the evidence, that the first clamp of bricks was ready for delivery by the time stipulated in the contract, provided they find that the delay was not caused by the defendant; or that if entitled to recover at all, nothing on account of the bricks burnt in said first clamp, which directions and each of them, the court refused to give. Defendant again excepting, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b56-4\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, O.

Because to entitle the plaintiff to recover at all in this form of action, it was necessary for him both to aver and prove that the first kiln of bricks, mentioned in the agreement given upon, Was ready for delivery in May, 1821, the time stipulated for that purpose in the agreement. 2d. That if he was entitled to recover upon other parts of the agreement in relation to the remainder of the bricks, he was not authorised to recover for this first kiln. He cited, 1 <em>Saund.

To test the correctness of the court below, in refusing this direction, the only inquiry to be made is, does the argreement between the parties make this stipulation, as to the time, within which, the first hundred thousand bricks were to be ready for delivery, a condition precedent, the performance of which by the plaintiff, must precede his right to require the defendant to comply with any of the covenants, the infraction of which is made the basis of this action ? That such is not the construction given to this contract by the appellant\u2019s counsel is obvious, or he would not have made the prayer he did, in the first bill of exceptions; nor the first part of the prayer in the second bill of exceptions; both of which are founded on the admission, that the defendant\u2019s engagement to deliver the wood is an independent covenant, not at all depending on the time of the burning of the first kiln of bricks. That it was the design of the contracting parties that a portion of the 350 cords of wood should be used in burning the bricks, will not be denied. If so, a part of it must of necessity be delivered before the burning of any bricks. But there is nothing in the contract itself, nor in the intention of the parties to be collected from it, to show that the wood was to be delivered in parcels, as the burning of the bricks progressed. If so, the argreement would have been shaped accordingly, and not have provided, as it has done, that it should be delivered at the stump <em>\u201c when called </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>for.\u201d </em>Its terms negative such an interpretation. The wood was to he given as a payment of half the price of the whole quantity of bricks to be burnt, and not merely to be used in burning them: as for that purpose, 150, instead of 350 cords, would have been sufficient. We regard therefore, this engagement for the delivery of wood, as an independent covenant on the part of <em>Finley, </em>and with which, he was bound to. comply, without waiting for the burning of the first kiln of bricks within the time limited by the articles of agreement. This disposes of the <em>first </em>branch of the <em>second </em>prayer, in the <em>second </em>exception. But the <em>second </em>part of that prayer presents a different question. It concedes the plaintiff has a right to recover, but it invokes an instruction of the court to the jury, that nothing is recoverable on account of the bricks burnt in the first clamp. If this point could arise under the pleadings in this cause, it would distinctly present the question, whether the stipulation as to time, is to be regarded as of the essence of the contract, and in the nature of a condition precedent; or as a mutual or independent covenant. Believing as we do, that we are not imperiously required to decide this question as to time, under the issues in the case before us, we mean to express no opinion upon that subject; and we are the more inclined to do so, from the consideration that this point has not been fully argued, and that it will come before us in a much more important suit, now upon our docket. Under the issues joined on the 2d, 3d and 4th pleas, it is manifest as regards time, that no question could arise, as those pleas by legal implication admit the truth of all the facts stated in the declaration (of which the time, &amp;c. is one,) except those, which they specifically deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It is under the issue joined then, on the plea of general performance, that the appellant must avail himself, if at all, of the violation .of the stipulation as to time. And in considering his right to do so, it may not be amiss to premise, that the plaintiff can recover damages for no other breaches than those charged in the declaration, as the specification thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>is an implied admission, that the defendant, in all other respects, has complied with, his contract. It follows, as a corollary, that the plea of general performance in this case, applies only to those covenants which are alleged to have been broken. If it were otherwise, and according to its literal import, the plea of general performance put in issue every covenant on the part of defendant to be performed, it might produce this strange absurdity, that the plaintiff would recover damages for breaches of covenants, whereof he had never complained; but on the contrary, the performance of which by legal intendment, he had admitted by his declaration. To any imaginable declaration which could be framed on the articles of agreement, that form the ground work of the present action, the plea of general performance is inapplicable and vicious. If it be pleaded, even to a debt on a bond conditioned for the performance of covenants, and issue he taken thereon, a verdict on such issue forms no basis on which a judgment can be entered, but a repleader must he awarded. To a declaration like that before us, assigning specific breaches, it must either he regarded as a nullity, or as putting in issue, the acts of omission or commission imputed to the defendant, as violations of his compact. In either aspect, the court below were right in refusing the instruction. The plaintiff avers in conformity to the agreement, that in the month of May, <em>\u201c </em>he did make and burn in a workman-like manner, on the said farm of the said defendant, called <em>Canton, </em>one kiln of bricks, containing ] 00m bricks, and then and there had the same ready for delivery to the defendant, and did then and there offer to deliver the same.\u201d Instead of traversing this fact as he ought to have done, if he intended to rely upon its falsehood as a bar to a recovery, either in whole or in part, the defendant pleads \u201c that the said plaintiff never did deliver to the said defendant, any good merchantable brick whatever;\u201d thus, by legal intendment distinctly admitting the allegation, that the first kiln of bricks was burnt and ready for delivery at the time stipulated. This fact there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>fore, the plaintiff need not prove, and the defendant is precluded from controverting it on the trial. The County Court then, could not do otherwise than refuse the direction to the jury which they were called upon to give. Concurring with them in their opinions in both hills of exceptions, we affirm their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
