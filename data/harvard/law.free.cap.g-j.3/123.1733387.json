Where the real truth and substance is ascertained to bo a loan of money, a lending on one side, and a borrowing on the other, at a rate of interest exceeding six <em>per centum, </em>the form given to the transaction is not material; no shift or device can take it out of the Act of Assembly.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b131-7\">Appeal from <em>Anne Arundel </em>County Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-8\">This was an action of <em>Debt </em>commenced on the 13th of January, <em>1825, </em>by the appellees, <em>George Eliicott, </em>and ethers, as surviving partners of <em>John Eliicott, of John, </em>against the appellant, <em>Richard G. Stockelt, </em>on the following single bill: \u201c I promise to pay unto <em>Eliicott and Co., </em>in one, two and three equal annual instalments, the sum of \u00a3594 3s. 9&lt;L with interest from the date hereof, for value received, as witness my hand and seal, this 28th day of July, 1815.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-9\">The defendant pleaded usury, and payment, to which there were issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-10\">At the trial, the defendant in support of his plea of usury, read in evidence the account stated between the parties, and the receipt put thereon at the time of settlement, and for the balance of which the above single hill was given; and to show that in said account the plaintiffs had estimated and charged more interest than would have been allowed upon the principal sums, for the times for which credit was given, at the rate of six <em>per cent, per annum, </em>specified the charge in said account of \u00a325 14s. <em>7d. </em>as and for interest upon the principal sum of \u00a3509 Is. <em>Id. </em>for the space of eight years, one month and five dajrs ; and also the charge \u00a39 14s.4d. as and for interest upon a principal of \u00a34118s.2\u00a1W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>for the space of three years, ten months and one day ; and insisted that <em>thereby </em>the said defendant was charged with interest above the rate of interest allowed by law, and that the same was evidence of usury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">At the foot of the account so read in evidence by the defendant, there was the following receipt, signed by the plaintiff: \u201c July 28th, 1815\u2014Received his note in full for the above account, it being understood, in case of error either way, should any be discovered, that it shall be corrected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">The plaintiffs then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that there was not sufficient evidence of usury in the transactions between the parties, which instruction the court (Kilgour and Wilkinson, A. J.) gave. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b132-8\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

The receipt shows clearly, that nothing corrupt was intended. All the principal sums are admitted by the plea to be due, and therefore, the whole office of the. re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ceipt, was to guard against errors in the calculations of interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-5\">As this defence involves a forfeiture to the plaintiffs, the defendant was bound to adduce the same evidence, as if he was prosecuting for the penalty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-6\">Buchanan, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9E\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">This is an action upon a single bill, the defence relied upon was usury, and the case is brought up on an exception taken at the trial, to an instruction by the court to the jury, \u201c that there was not sufficient evidence of usury in the transaction between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Every case of usury must depend upon its own circumstances. It is the intention, and not the words used, that gives character to the transaction, and that intention when it can be reached, must govern. Where the real truth and substance is ascertained to be a loan of money, a lending on one side, and a borrowing on the other, at a rate of interest exceeding six <em>per cent, per annum, </em>the form given to the transaction is not material; no shift, or device, can take it out of the Act of Assembly. Here the bill in question was given for the amount of an account rendered against the appellant, in which interest was charged upon the different items. Every item of principal charged in the account, is admitted; but it is said, that the interest charged on different items of principal, exceeded the rate of six per <em>cent, </em>a year, and therefore, that the bill being given for the whole amount, including the interest so charged, it was an usurious transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Whatever might have been the case, if it had appeared that the alleged over charges of interest were, by agreement of the parties, made and allowed, in consideration of forbearance, and giving day of payment to the appellant, of the several principal sums of money due from him, on which such charges of interest were made, there is in this record no evidence, express or implied, of any such agreement or intention, or tending to show, or prove any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>agreement or intention, without which there could have been no usury. The agreement, the intention of the parties, constituting a principal ingredient of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">But it is contended, that whether it was an usurious contract or not, was a question which ought to have been left to the jury, and that the court did wrong in instructing them, \u201c that there was no sufficient evidence of usury.\u2019 If there had been any evidence tending to prove an usurious contract, it should properly have been left to the jury; but there was no such evidence, and surely in the absence of any evidence tending even to prove it, the court cannot have erred in instructing the jury, \u201c that there was not sufficient evidence of usury.\u201d So far from there being any evidence tending to prove usury, or from which the jury could have inferred an usurious agreement, the evidence set out in the record tends to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The only evidence in the case is, the single bill, the account for the amount of which it was given, and a receipt on the back of the account by the obligee, for the bill in full of the account, of the same date with the bill; which receipt contains a stipulation, <em>\u201c </em>that in case of error either way, should any be discovered, it shall be corrected.\u201d That receipt, if it tends to prove any thing, it is, that there was perfect fairness in the transaction; it seems to presuppose that there might possibly be mistakes in the charges, either of items of principal, or of interest, and provides for the correction of them, if they should be made to appear, and thus tends to show that there was not any usurious intention or agreement, rather than that there was. For can it be, that -if there were known charges of interest exceeding the legal rates, intended and agreed upon between the parties, as a consideration for forbearance, and time given to the appellant for payment of the several sums of principal charged in the account, the obligee would at the same time, have armed the appellant with a stipulation for the correction of those very over charges, the price of forbearance !</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The evidence goes to negative the allegation of usury, and no other inference can be drawn from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The court therefore, we think, did right in giving the instruction complained of. It was the least it could do, to tell the jury there was not sufficient evidence of usury, when there was no evidence at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
