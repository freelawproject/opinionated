It is to be observed, that this agreement in no wise obligates the above named <em>Richard, </em>to defend any of the lands by him to be deeded, against any person or persons, but those who claim immediately from, by, or under him.

The complainant, he argued, had sought relief in a Court \u2022of Equity, and she must therefore be dealt with according to the principles which govern that court. \u2022 One of the leading principles of the court is, to consider as actually done, that which ought to be done. The case of <em>Dimond\u2019s Adr\u2019x vs. Billingslea, </em>2 <em>Harr. and </em>Gill, 264, decides, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>an equitable right to dower, will be defeated by a previous contract to convey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">If the contract of 1789 was previous to the marriage of the complainant to her husband, then <em>Richard Hall </em>became a trustee of the lands therein mentioned, for the benefit of his mother <em>Martha. </em>A Court of Chancery would have compelled <em>Richard Hall </em>to fulfil his part of this contract ; but he has fulfilled it by the execution of the deeds of 1807. That those deeds were designed as an execution of the contract of 1789, is evident from the circumstance of <em>Martha </em>being a grantor in them, if they had no connexion with that contract, why should she unite in them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-6\">The fact that the contract was recorded together with the deeds, elearly shows that the parties supposed, and intended the latter, as an execution of the former. He insisted that the answer was evidence of the time of complainant\u2019s marriage, as being responsive to the bill. There is no proof of a marriage at all, except in the answer, which must be as competent to prove <em>the </em>time, as the fact, lie admitted that a deed executed upon the eve of marriage without consideration would be void, but that is not the case here. The consideration was a valuable one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-7\"><em>A. C. </em>Magruder, and Murray, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-8\">The fact of the marriage, and the seizin of <em>Richard Hall </em>is admitted, and it is not shown that the contract of 1789 was anterior to it. But if it was, they insisted that a Court of Chancery would not now enforce it specifically. The marriage certainly took place some time in 1789, and ho lived until 1823. The deeds were not executed until 1807, so that the contract was dormant for 18 years. Such an agreement cannot be set up against the title of the widow, who is a purchaser for a valuable consideration. The deeds do not appear upon their face, to be in execution of the agreement of 1789; nor is there any evidence to show them to have been so. Suppose a bill had been filed .on this contract, limitations would have been a bar to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>relief. A specific performance will not be decreed, upon a contract which has lain dormant for many years. <em>2 Eq. Cases, </em>19. <em>Arden vs. </em>Arden, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>313. If the agreement was prior to the marriage, it was but a very-short time before, and is fraudulent and void as agaipst the wife. <em>Swaine vs. Perine, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>482. All knowledge of the contract was kept from the wife, from the time of its execution until it was recorded with the deeds of 1807, and as it was a paper not required to be recorded, she was not bound to take notice of it. A secret contract cannot be set up to defeat dower,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-5\">Buchanan, Uh. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Abqp\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Under the agreement of the 14th January, 1789, between <em>Richard </em>Hall, the deceased husband of the complainant, <em>Sarah Hall, </em>and his mother, <em>Martha </em>Hall, by which, for the consideration expressed, he contracted to convey to her in fee, or to such of her younger children, his brothers or sisters in fee, as she should direct, the lands therein mentioned, he became in equity a trustee for his mother, of all the lands embraced by that agreement. And the circumstance of that agreement, and the three deeds of the 13th July, 1807, from him and his mother Martha, for the same lands, two of them to <em>Edward </em>Hall, and the other to <em>Thomas W. Hall, </em>and <em>John Hall </em>his brothers, and the children of <em>Martha, </em>all standing recoi\u2019ded on the same day, and immediately following each other in the same book, together with the deeds being to three of the younger children, for whose benefit the agreement was entered into, and their mother having joined in the deeds, to whom, or to whose appointment the lands were contracted to be conveyed, shows satisfactorily, that <em>Martha Hall </em>had complied with the terms of the agreement on her part, and entitled herself to a compliance on the part of <em>Richard Hall, </em>and that the deeds were made in pursuance of that contract. For what Other purpose could the agreement have been recorded with the deeds, (not being an instrument required by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to be recorded,} than to show the inducement to the deeds, and that it had been complied with ? And the additional .fact appearing in evidence, that the lands covered by the agreement of the 14th January, 1789, were from the time of the execution of that instrument in the possession of <em>Martha </em>Hall, and never from that day in the possession of <em>Richard </em>Hall, is worthy of notice, and assists in leading to the conclusion, that she had performed all that Was required of her to be performed, and had thereby entitled herself to a conveyance, in pursuance of the agreement, whenever she might choose to require it. Or why was she permitted to remain in the undisturbed possession and enjoyment of the premises ? which is not accounted for in any other way, and as far as appears from this record, can only be accounted for on the ground that she was entitled to the beneficial interest. The lands were by the contract, to be conveyed to herself, or to such of her younger children, sons or daughters, as she should from timo to time direct; and her uniting in the deeds to her three younger sons was a good appointment, and equivalent to a direction to <em>Richard Hall </em>to convey to them, at a time selected by herself, and which by the agreement she had a right to select, and when she thought proper to give them the property, and to cause the conveyances to be made. And it may be, that the deeds were not executed sooner, because she did not deem it proper or expedient to have it sooner done.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">A widow is not dowable in equity of lands, which were held by her husband in the character of a trustee; and as the complainant seeks to be endowed of lands, embraced by the agreement between her husband and his mother <em>Martha </em>Hall, of the 14th January, 1789, of which he, on that day became a trustee for his mother, her right to recover must depend on the time of their marriage ; and be determined according to the fact of the marriage having taken place, before, or subsequent to the execution of that instrument, as shown in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In her bill, she alleges tha1: it took place \u201c on or about the year seventeen hundred and\u201d <em>blank, </em>and calls upon the defendant to answer, whether, \u201c she was not married as stated.\u201d Not confining the interrogatory to the fact of marriage alone, but requiring a response, as well in relation to the time, as to the fact of marriage. And the answer setting out the agreement of the 14th January, 1789, which is stated to have been faithfully performed, denies the complainant\u2019s title to dower, and alleges that the marriage took place some time after that agreement was executed, that is, sometime after the 14th January, 1789, which allegation, both as respects the fact, and time of the marriage, is responsive to the bill, and is not contradicted by a single witness in the cause. On the contrary, the evidence of the only two witnesses who gave testimony upon that subject, so far from contradicting, is perfectly consistent with the answer, and goes to support it. They swear that they were married themselves on the 18th of December, 1788, and that the complainant, and her deceased husband, <em>Richard Hall, </em>.were married about one month afterwards, reaching a few days beyond the 14th January, 1789, the date of the agreement, when <em>Richard Had </em>stood seized of the lands, in which she claims to be entitled to dower, as trustee for his mother. But the answer alleging the marriage to have been after the date of the agreement, does not require the aid of that testimony to support it; but being responsive to the bill, and not contradicted, or shaken by any other evidence, must stand, as conclusive of the fact it asserts, that is, that the marriage was after the execution of the agreement of the 14th January, 1789. We are consequently constrained to say, that the eompl\u00e1inant is not entitled <em>to </em>dower, in any of the lands embraced by that instrument, and of which her deceased husband, was at the time of their marriage, and afterwards seized\u2019 only as trustee. But the land described in the deed, from <em>Martha Hall </em>and <em>Richard </em>Hall, to <em>Edward </em>Hall,^ marked exhibit B, as \u201cpart of a tract of land called <em>Wade\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Increase,\u201d </em>containing about twenty-five acres, not being embraced in the agreement of the 14th January, 1789, and of which <em>Richard Hall </em>was beneficially seized, during his coverture with the complainant, and not as trustee, she is entitled to dower in that land.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The decree of the chancellor therefore, must be reversed with costs, so far as it relates to the lands embraced by the agreement of the 14th January, 1789, between <em>Richard Hall </em>and <em>Martha Hall; </em>and the complainant will be decreed to have her dower, in the other parcel of land described in the exhibit B, as a part of a tract of land called <em>Wade\u2019s Increase.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">With respect to the case of Glenn, adm\u2019r of <em>Thomas W. </em>Hall, and <em>Julius Hall vs. Sarah </em>Hall, which has been submitted to us on the same pleadings and evidence, the whole of the land in which dower is claimed, being embraced by the agreement between <em>Richard Hall </em>and <em>Martha Hall, </em>of the 14th January, 1789, and consequently, held by <em>Richard Hall, </em>at the time of his marriage to the defendant in the appeal, and afterwards, as a trustee only for his mother, the defendant is not entitled to dower in any part <em>of it, </em>and the decree of the chancellor must be reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Decree. It was thereupon adjudged, &amp;c. by the Court of Appeals, that the decree of the chancellor in the case of <em>Joseph E. Cowman, et al. vs. Sarah Hall, </em>be reversed, with costs to the appellants in this court, and the Court of Chancery. But it appearing to this court, that the appellee is entitled to dower in the land described in exhibit B, as part of a tract of land called <em>Wade\u2019s </em>Increase, it was therefore, further adjudged, ordered, and decreed, that the record in this case, be remanded to the Chancery Court, and that the said court pass such order, and decree therein, as may be necessary to assign dower to the appellee in the said land, with such rents and profits accruing out of said land as she may be entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
