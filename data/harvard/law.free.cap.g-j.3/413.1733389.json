The bill alleges that the late <em>William Duncan, </em>the father of the complainant <em>Anne Maria, </em>died about the 25th March, 1819, having first duly made and published his last will and testament, and leaving the complainant <em>Anne Maria, </em>his only issue, by a first marriage, and two children, <em>William J.

And the parties were permitted to take the depositions of witnesses before a justice of the peace, on giving three days\u2019 notice, as usual to the opposite party, or his solicitor.

B. Duncan, </em>as joint tenants; and also gave them all, his personal property, and to his other child he gave in those words: <em>\u201cItem. </em>I give and bequeath to my daughter <em>Anne Maria Duncan, </em>the sum of sixty dollars, current money, as an annuity, t\u00f3 be paid to her out of the profits of my real estate above mentioned, annually, for and during the term of her natural life, withholding from her however, the power of selling or transferring the above mentioned annual allowance, to any person or persons whatever, under p.en-: alty of forfeiture.\u201d On the 4th of March, 1819, without having made any alteration of this his will, he, died,, and the will was soon after proved in the usual form, by. two of the subscribing witnesses. <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>the widow\u00bb qualified as executrix under the will, and was the guardian, of the infant children, and after her death, which happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>some time in the latter end of the year 1824, <em>Joseph Robinson </em>was appointed guardian to the two infant children, and administration <em>de bonis non </em>was granted to <em>Thomas Iglehart. </em>Upon this state of things, <em>Anne Maria, </em>with her husband <em>Perry </em>Townshend, on the 17th of August, 1826, filed their bill against <em>Iglehart, Robinson, </em>and the two infant children, alleging that the annuity has not been paid, and praying that the arrears might be decreed to them, and that the land might be sold for the payment thereof. The infant defendants answering by a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>admit nothing, and put the plaintiffs upon the proof of their case. The defendants, <em>Iglehart </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>having failed to answer, the usual interlocutory decree for the default was passed against them, after which <em>Thomas Iglehart </em>died, and administration <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of the late <em>William Duncan, </em>was granted to <em>John </em>Iglehart; and this suit having been revived against him, and he having failed to answer, an interlocutory decree for the default went against him also, after which the case was submitted for a final decision; but conceiving that some further information was indispensably necessary to enable me to frame such a decree as was best suited to the nature of the case, I passed the order of the 21st of February, 1828, in answer to which the auditor made his report of the 26th May, 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">The defendants have excepted to the auditor\u2019s report of the 26th of May last, for several causes. 1st. Because they had not the credits to which they were entitled, which, so far as it relates to the sum of twenty dollars, since admitted to have been paid by the late <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>is well founded. The next special exception of the defendants to that report of the auditor, is, that there is no evidence whatever, in the cause, duly and regularly taken, according to the course of chancery proceedings. It was the well settled practice of the Court of Chancery of <em>Maryland, </em>under the provincial government, and has continued tobe so ever since the establishment of the republic, without any doubt or interruption, that in all cases where an ae= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>count was required by the court, or the parties, a special commission might issue, directing the commissioner's to t\u00e1ke testimony, \u201cand also to state, audit, settle and adjust all accounts relating to the matter in dispute, that should be produced to them,\u201d and to reduce into writing such account, and to return the same with the depositions of the witnesses. <em>Pro. Chan. </em>1763, <em>lib. D. D. No. </em>I. 315. The <em>act of </em>1785, <em>ch. </em>73, <em>sec. </em>17, which authorised the court to appoint an auditor, does not in any respect impair or abrogate the previous ancient practice, and therefore special commissions, calling for the return of an account along with the proofs, have often been issued since the passage of that act. <em>Rutland vs. Yates, </em>25th August, 1789. Hence, as the court might clothe commissioners appointed to take testimony with the authority to state an account, from tire proofs collected by them, so it has been held ever since the passage of the act of 1785, that when a case is referred to the auditor by an interlocutory decree to account, or by an order directing him to state an account, or make estimates, as in this instance, from the proofs in the cause, or any other proofs that may be laid before him, such a reference in itself, places him in the same situation he would have stood according to the ancient course, had a special commission been directed to him to take testimony, and also to state an Account, which indeed is affirmed by the act of 1785 itself, by its authorising him to administer an oath to all witnesses, and persons proper to be examined upon such account. <em>Norwood vs. Norwood, </em>2d Nov. 1801. <em>Barney vs. Hollins, </em>4th January, 1810. Consequently, all the testimony collected and returned by the auditor in this case, has been taken, according to the long and well established course of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">With regard to the taking of testimony under the authority of a special order of the court, before a justice of the peace, I have not been able to ascertain the origin of this practice, or to trace it back to so remote a period as that of taking testimony before an accounting officer of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>court; but I have seen it spoken of more than five and twenty years past, as a well settled practice. <em>The State vs. Brooke, </em>27th May, 1803. And the court has gone so far as to compel a witness to submit to an examination before a justice of the peace, where it had been authorised by a special order. <em>Onion vs. McComas, </em>1804. This mode of collecting testimony, it is believed, is peculiar to our chancery proceedings, for I have met with no mention of any such practice in the <em>English </em>books. It is, however, not only in some respects the cheapest form of gathering proofs, but in many instances it greatly facilitates and expedites the progress of the cause; and the proofs are thus taken under all the principal safeguards which can in any manner insure fairness and fulness of evidence; that is, the special order of the court, on oath, publicity, the right to cross examine, and a final responsibility. It is upon these grounds, that I think this mode of taking testimony de serves the continued sanction, approbation, and protection of this tribunal. <em>Winder vs. Diffenderffer, </em>4th May, 1829. The testimony taken under the order of the 21st February, 1828, before a justice of the peace, has therefore been brought in, according to the regular course of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The will of the late <em>William Duncan </em>it appears, has been proved and recorded, according to the act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>39, <em>sec. </em>2, which declares\u201c that it shall and maybe lawful for the judge of the probate of wills to take the probate, or cause to be proved, any last will and testament within this province, although the same concerns titles of land,\u201d which for this purpose is still in full force. A probate so made of a will devising real estate, it has always been held, is at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its validity. 1 <em>Harr, and McHen. </em>162. 4 <em>Harr, and Johns. </em>145. 10 <em>Wheat. </em>465. And there being in this case no evidence which so far questions the validity of the will, as to throw the burthen of sustaining its verity upon the plaintiffs, and these infant defendants, as well as the plaintiffs, claiming under it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>certified copy offered, must be considered sufficient for all the purposes for which it is produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">From the pleadings and proofs in the cause, it is very clear that this will cannot be so construed, as to authorise a sale of the real estate, for the purpose of raising or securing the payment of this annuity; nor can it be construed to give the plaintiff, <em>Anne Maria, </em>an estate for life, or any other less estate, in the lands charged with the payment of th\u00e9 annuity. These infant devisees could only take this estate, subject to the charge upon it, and the annual rents and profits, as it is now shown, so far exceed the annuity in amount, as to demonstrate, that it is much to their benefit so to.take it, and consequently all their property, in respect of this large amount of assets thus placed in their hands, is liable for the payment of this annuity. For the arrears which accrued since the death of the testator, and were left unpaid by their late guardian, <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>her sureties, if she gave any, or her legal representatives, may be held responsible to these infant defendants.- But their estate is liable to these plaintiffs, to whom the sureties or legal representatives of the late <em>Deborah Duncan </em>ar\u00e9 in no way responsible; and the present guardian of these infant defendants, <em>Joseph Robinson, </em>not having answered, and having thereby tacitly admitted that he had received a sufficiency of rents and profits from his ward\u2019s estate, must be held absolutely liable for the whole amount of the annuity which accrued, and has been left unpaid during the time of his guardianship. For the purpose of having a statement made upon these principles, the c.ase was again sent to the auditor* who as directed, reported the statements on the 13th inst.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">\u25a0Whereupon it is on this 17th day of August, 1829, by <em>Theodrick Bland, </em>chancellor, and by the authority of this court, adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the bill of comr plaint be taken <em>pro confesso, </em>against, the defendant, <em>Joseph Robinson, </em>and that the infant defendants* or the said <em>Robinson, as </em>their guardian, out of the estate and property of said wards, now in his hands; of which may hereafter come into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>his hands, pay to the said plaintiffs, or bring into this court to be paid to them, the sum of $354 1G, with interest on $255, part thereof, &amp;c.

That there is no evidence in the cause to charge the appellant. The infant defendants were not in default, and as their answers denied any knowledge of the statements of the bill, the latter should have been supported by proof, taken in the usual way under a commission. Evidence taken under a reference to the auditor is not sufficient. The act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, <em>sec. </em>17, defines the powers of the auditor, and the chancellor cannot enlarge them : that act merely empowers the auditor to ascertain the <em>extent </em>of a liability, and not its actual existence. 3. The relief granted by the decree is inconsistent with the relief sought by the bilk They admitted that the chancellor might decree a different relief from that which the bill asked for, provided the statements and charges of the bill would justify it, but not otherwise. But in this case, there is no allegation, that the infants or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>their guardian received the rents and profits, and therefore the decree against them in <em>personam </em>is erroneous. <em>Coop.

He contended that the eases cited on the other side, upon the point of jurisdiction, were cases of rent charge, created by deed, reserving the right of distress, as incident thereto. In the case at bar, there is a mere equitable lien, unaccompanied by.any such right, and of: course there is no remedy at law.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWB\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The bill alleging the annuity bequeathed to the complainant, <em>Anne Maria Townshend, </em>by her father, William. <em>Duncan, </em>to be a rent charge upon the land devised by the same ancestor, to his two other children, <em>William Joseph Bend Duncan </em>and <em>Caroline Duncan, </em>both infants of tender years, seeks a sale of the laud so supposed to be charged for the payment of the arrearages of the annuity stated to he due, and an investment of the surplus proceeds of sale, to meet the accruing annuity as it shall become due. <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>now dead, the widow of <em>William Duncan </em>the testator, administered on his estate, and was the guardian of the infant devisees, and on her death, <em>Joseph Robinson </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>appointed guardian to the children. The bill as amended, is against the two infant devisees, and <em>Joseph Robinson </em>their guardian, and <em>John Iglehart, </em>the administrator of the administrator <em>u. b. n. </em>of the testator, <em>William Duncan. Robinson </em>and Iglehart, neither of them answered the bill, and the infant defendants in their answer, neither deny nor admit any of its contents, but say they know nothing of them, and put the complainants to proof, &amp;c. It appears from the proof taken by the auditor, that from the time of the death of the testator, <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>who was the guardian of the children, received the rents and profits until her death, and that from the time of her death, they have been received by <em>Robinson, </em>the present guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The chancellor in his decree, has taken the bill <em>pro </em>con<em>fesso, </em>as against <em>Robinson, </em>and dismissed it as against <em>Iglehart, </em>and directed that the infant defendants, or <em>Robinson </em>their guardian, shall pay to the complainants out of the estate of his wards, or bring into chancery, to be paid to them, the amount of the annuity accruing during the life of <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>their former guardian, and stated by the auditor to remain unpaid, with interest, and that <em>Robinson </em>shall pay to the complainants, out of the property of his wards in his hands, if there he any, or if not, out of His own estate, or bring into the Court of Chancery to be paid to them, the amount of the annuity accruing since the death of <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>and stated by the auditor to remain unpaid, with interest and costs of s\u00fcit. Which decree, independent of the objection urged, that it is not consistent with the relief sought by the bill, but of a different character, that being for a sale of the land on the ground that the annuity was a charge upon the land, cannot wc think bo sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">If we have taken a correct view of the subject, it was passed upon the evidence taken by the auditor, and not upon the case made by the bill. The bill contains no allegation or suggestion, of the receipt of the rents and profits by the infant defendants, or either of their guardians, or of the annual value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the land, or of the application of the rents and profits of any part of them, for the benefit of the infants, by either of their guardians. Nor is either of the defendants called upon to make any answer or disclosure in relation to the annual value of the' land, or to the receipt, or amount, or application of the rents and profits: there is therefore no issue, to which the proof in relation to the receipt of the rents and profits, and to the annual value of the land upon which the annuity claimed is alleged to be a charge, is applicable, and consequently none to support the decree, however correct it might have been, if there was such an issu\u00e9 in the case. The neglect of the defendant <em>Robinson, </em>to answer, amounts to an admission only of th\u00e9 allegations in the bill, and nothing more; and th\u00e9 answer of the infant' defendants, calling upon th\u00e9 complainants to prev\u00e9 the bill, only puts them to the proof of what is charged in the bill, and entitles them only to a decree on the case made in the bill, when proved. If it was nec\u00e9ssary to prev\u00e9 th\u00e9 receipt of the rents and profits, and the amount, by the infant defendants, or their guardians respectively, or the annual value of the land, to entitle the complainants to the relief decreed, it was equally necessary to av\u00e9r in the bill such receipt, or annual value, to make a case in the pleadings for such a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The annuity bequeathed to <em>Anne Maria, </em>one of the complainants, is not a rent charged; it is directed' to be paid out of the profits of the real estate, and there is no right or power of distress given <em>; </em>and there is no proof in the cause that any portion of the rents and profits was ever applied by either of the guardians, to the benefit of the infant defendants: nor does it appear that any personal property belonging to them ever came to the hands of the defendant, <em>Robinson, </em>or that they have any. <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>the former guardian, may .have applied the whole .of the rents and profits received by her, (except so much as was applied to the discharge of the annuity,) to her own purposes, to'the prejudice of the infant defendants ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and the defendant, Robinson, may have done the same, and they are by the decree, subjected to the discharge of the whole of the annuity, accruing from the death of the testator, and remaining unpaid, to be paid by them or by the defendant, <em>Robinson^out </em>of their estate, which is not directed to be sold. So far as the decree is against <em>Robinson, </em>and he is directed to pay the money out of the estate of the infant defendants, if he has in his hands no personal property belonging to them, and none should come into his hands, the decree cannot be complied with, as he is not authorised to sell the real estate. And as to that amount of the annuity which has accrued since the death of <em>Deborah Duncan, </em>and remains unpaid, we think that the defendant, <em>Robinson, </em>should not he made to pay it out of the property of the infant defendants, hut his own, if he has appropriated no part of the rents and profits received by him for their benefit, but applied the whole to his own purposes, which for any thing appearing in the record, may have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We do not mean to say, that the complainants would not be entitled to relief on a proper case, made against the proper parties, and supported by appropriate proof. All we do say is, that in our opinion, this is not such a case, and that the decree must he reversed, with costs in both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
