The mother and daughter both declined taking the money ; the mother telling <em>Mr. D. </em>that her daughter did not want, nor had any use for the money, and that they preferred it all should remain in his hands (except fifty or sixty dollars for which the daughter then had immediate occasion,) and receive interest for it, inasmuch, as if the money was taken from <em>Mr. D. it </em>would \u2019be deposited in bank, and the daughter would <em>not receive </em>the -benefit of interest. <em>Mr. D. </em>then said, he would keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the money, and pay interest therefor, and gave the daughter his note for the amount.

That if the jury believe, that at the date of the appointment of <em>Owen Dorsey </em>as guardian, the said <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>had a natural guardian, that then the said court exceeded its jurisdiction in making the said appointment, and that the bond being void, this action cannot be\u2019 maintained. 3d. That if the jury believe <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>is under the age of twenty-one years at this time, this action cannot be maintained. 4th. That if the jury believe <em>Owen Dorsey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the person appointed guardian, was the same <em>Owen Dorsey </em>who acted as one of the judges of the Orphans Court named in the certificate of appointment of guardian, which has been given in evidence, that then, this action cannot be maintained. 5th. That if the jury believe that <em>Owen Dorsey, </em>after the 15th day of July, 1824, when <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>attained the age of sixteen years, offered to pay, and counted out to the said <em>Eliza Ann Kirk, </em>the sum of four or five hundred dollars, which she declined to receive, and afterwards took the note of <em>Owen Dorsey </em>in preference, as given in evidence, that such tendering and counting out the money, was an extinguishment of the claim which she, the said <em>Eliza Ann Kirk, </em>might have had, to the extent of such sum as the jury may believe was so tendered.

In an action on a bond at law, a surety can make no defence, not open to his principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">The <em>third </em>objection he insisted could not he maintained, as the <em>State </em>was the legal plaintiff; hut at all events the objection should have been presented by a plea in abatement, which is the only mode, in which the infancy of a plaintiff can be taken advantage of. 2 <em>Saund. </em>212, <em>and note, </em>5. <em>James, et al.

But the circumstance of the contract being between guardian and ward, of itself renders it void. 5.

It is insisted on the part of the defendant below, <em>First, </em>That if <em>Eliza Ann Kirk, </em>for whose use the action was brought, had a natural guardian at the time of the appointment by the Orphans Court of <em>Baltimore </em>county, of <em>Owen Dorsey, </em>the principal in the bond as her guardian, the court exceeded its jurisdiction in making the appointment, that the bond is void, and the action cannot be maintained. <em>Secondly, </em>That if <em>Owen Dorsey, </em>the person appointed guardian, was at the time of making the appointment, sitting as a judge of the court, with only one other judge, the appointment was invalid, and the bond void. <em>Thirdly, </em>That supposing <em>Owen Dorsey </em>to have been regularly appointed guardian, if after <em>Eliza Jinn Kirk </em>attained the age of sixteen years, he offered to pay, and counted out to her the sum of four or five hundred dollars, which she refused to receive, and afterwards took the note of <em>Dorsey </em>in preference, such offering and counting out the money, was an extinguishment of her claim, to the extent of the sum so offered and counted out. <em>Fourthly, </em>That if after <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>attained the age of sixteen years, she executed to <em>Dorsey </em>a release of all claims and demands, with a full understanding of its import and effect, the aetion cannot be maintained. <em>Fifthly, </em>That if she was under the ago of twenty-one years at the time of instituting the aetion, it cannot be maintained; and evidence of the facts upon which these questions are raised, was offered to <em>the jury, </em>and is set out in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>First then, suppose <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>had a natural guardian at the time of the appointment of <em>Owen Dorsey </em>as her guardian, were that appointment and the bond given in pursuance of it void, for want of jurisdiction in the Orphans Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">By the <em>Act of </em>1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub-ch. </em>12, <em>sec. </em>1, the several Orphans Courts, had the power to appoint a guardian to an infant until the age of twenty-one years if a male, and until the age of sixteen years if a female, if such infant has no natural guardian, nor guardian appointed by last will. And by the <em>3d sect, </em>of the same <em>sub-ch. </em>12, on the application of any friend of an infant, &amp;c. to call on any natural guardian, or guardian appointed by last will, to give bond for the performance of his or her <em>trust; </em>and on failure or neglect of such guardian, to appoint another guardian. The distinction between an erroneous judgment by a tribunal having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the judgment of a tribunal having no cognizance of the subject, is well known and acknowledged. If the mother of the infant in this case, who is claimed to have been her natural guardian, had asserted her rights as such, and taken upon herself the management and conduct of the infanUs estate in the Orphans Court; or being called upon, had given bond for the performance of her trust, the Orphans Court, with a knowledge of the existence of such a guardian acting in pursuance of her trust, could not properly during the continuance of her authority, have appointed another guardian, and thereby have divested her of her rights. And as the rights, and authority, and power over the property and person of the infant, would be incompatible in two, such an appointment would have been void. If the natural guardian had assumed and entered upon her trust, and as such, taken upon herself the management of the estate of her ward in the Orphans Court, the appointment of <em>Owen Dorsey, </em>would have been an act not within the jurisdiction of that court, no more than would be the appointment of a second guardian, while the prior appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ment of another by the same court, was remaining in full force and unrevoked. Unless the natural guardian had failed or neglected to give bond for the performance of her' trust, on being called upon to do so, in pursuance of the <em>3d section </em>of the <em>12th sub-chap, </em>of the <em>Act of </em>1798, <em>ch. </em>101, or had been removed for cause, under the provisions of the 12th <em>section </em>of the <em>sub-chap. </em>15, it would not have been the case, of an erroneous judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, but the act of a tribunal having no cognizance of the subject, and therefore unauthorised and void, the Orphans Court having no power to create a guardian of its own appointment, in the case of an infant having a known, authorised, and qualified acting natural guardian. Rut though in relation to such a case, of a known, natural guardian asserting and exercising his rights, the Orphans Court is without jurisdiction; yet the appointment of a guardian, being a subject ordinarily cognizable in that court, and only excluded from its jurisdiction, by the circumstance of there being a natural guardian, or a guardian appointed by will, it does not follow, that the mere existence of a person ordinarily entitled to assume the office and trust of a natural guardian, is alone sufficient to divest it of its jurisdiction. That person, though known to the Orphans Court, may nevertheless reject or abandon the trust; in which event, a case in which a guardian may be appointed, a case within the jurisdiction of the court, is presented. That, may have been the case here; the mother of the infant, who might have assumed the office of natural guardian, may have rejected or abandoned the trust; or on being required to give bond for the performance of her trust, may have failed, or neglected to do it; and if so, in either case, the Orphans Court have the power to appoint another guardian. It does not indeed appear in this record, whether there was or not, such an abandonment of the trust, or failure or neglect by the natural guardian to give bond for the performance of it ;\u2022 but the Orphans Court having appointed another guardian, and there being nothing to show the absence of authority to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>do so, it is to be taken, that it acted within the sphere of its ordinary jurisdiction, and that what was done, was rightly done. And it not appearing to this court, to be the act of a tribunal, having no cognizance of the subject matter, it cannot be impeached here, coming thus incidentally in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">And secondly, with respect to the appointment of <em>Owen Dorsey </em>as the guardian, he being present and sitting as one of the judges of the court, supposing it be so, yet being the act of a court of competent jurisdiction, whether that act was correct and regular, or not, still it was <em>the </em>judgment, the act of that court, the correctness or regularity of which, it is not for this court collaterally to inquire into. The question of jurisdiction, is a question that may be examined into, and the acts of a tribunal having no jurisdiction may be reviewed by another court; but the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is, as to all matters decided by it, conclusive, and cannot be afterwards questioned by any other tribunal, when coming in incidentally. This is a doctrine too well established to admit of being enlarged upon. Besides Owen <em>Dorsey </em>having given his bond, in which he is stated to be the guardian of <em>E. A. K., </em>and having obtained possession of her property, it would not in a suit against him, have lain in his mouth to deny that he was guardian, in the very face of the recital in his bond, or to set up any supposed irregularity in obtaining the appointment; the recital in the bond being evidence as against him, that he was guardian. Nor does it lie in the mouth of his surety, against whom, the recital is equally evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\"><em>Thirdly, </em>the offer by <em>Owen Dorsey </em>to pay to <em>E. A. K. </em>four or five hundred dollars, and counting out the money, cannot avail the party here as a tender, being an offer of only a part of the amount due, and a creditor not being under any obligation to accept less than the full amount; nor is it insisted upon as a tender. And if it was a tender, it could not, as such, operate as an extinguishment of the claim <em>pro tanto. </em>But it is contended, that it amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and must be considered as a payment, to the extent of the sum so offered and counted out. But surely her express refusal to receive the part offered, and his agreeing to keep and pay interest upon the whole amount, could not constitute a payment, to the amount of the sum offered, and consequently was no extinguishment of any part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Fourthly, by the <em>Act of </em>1798, <em>ch. </em>101. <em>sub-chap. 12, sec. </em>1 <em>and </em>15, power is given to the Orphans Court to appoint a guardian to an infant female, until she attains the age of sixteen or is married, when the guardianship ceases; and the ward or her husband, as the case may be, is entitled to receive from her guardian all her property. It has been decided by this court in <em>Davis vs. Jacquin &amp; Pomarait, </em>5 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>100, that although that act confers on an infant female a new capacity, the capacity to receive from her guardian the whole of her estate, it does not take away or destroy her state of legal minority, nor remove her other disabilities ; but leaves them as they were before, except in relation to the disposition of her real estate, which she is empowered to do hy will at the age of eighteen years. And the same principle is recognized in <em>Bowers\u2019 Adm\u2019r vs. State use of Dryden, </em>7 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>32. The legal infancy, therefore, of a female, not ceasing at the age of sixteen, <em>Eliza Ann Kirk, </em>not having attained the age twenty-one years, at the date of the release set up in this case, was, in reference to her capacity to execute such an instrument, in contemplation of law, a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Some contracts made by infants are binding, such as contracts for necessaries. Some are void, and others voidable only, such as contracts that may be for the benefit of the infant. But a contract that a court can see and pronounce to be to the prejudice of the infant, is void. And such, we think, is clearly the character of the instrument in question. It was executed on the ward\u2019s receiving from her guardian his promissory note, for the amount belonging to her in his hands; and being a release in the language of it, <em>\u201c </em>of and from all and every action, suit, claim or demand, &amp;c.\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>good, it discharged hira and his sureties from all responsibility on his guardian\u2019s bond, a higher and a better security than his promissory note alone, and was therefore to the prejudice of the infant. But independent of the peculiar circumstances of this case, we think a female infant between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one, incapable of executing a valid release to her guardian; considering from the character of the relation subsisting between the parties, the state of ignorance in which an infant usually is in relation to the condition of her affairs, and the conduct of the guardian in the execution of his trust, and the inducements to a guardian who has abused his trust, to seek that shelter behind a release improperly obtained, which a mere receipt would not afford him, that such instruments are in their nature and tendency to the prejudice of infants, and opposed to sound policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Fifthly, it does not appear to us to be at all material, whether <em>Eliza Ann Kirk </em>was of the age of twenty-one or not, at the time of instituting the suit. She is not the legal plaintiff; the bond is to the <em>State, </em>the suit was brought in the name of the <em>State, </em>the legal plaintiff, and she is only the <em>cestui que use; </em>and it was not necessary for the purposes of the suit, to enter the use at all; though it is usually done in such cases, it might have been carried on as well without it, as with it. And being done, her non-age could not form the fit subject of a plea, the action not being brought in her name. We cannot distinguish this from the case of the <em>State vs. Dorsey </em>and others, <em>ante </em>75. The same principle pervades both cases. We concur therefore with the court below on the first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The question arising upon the exception taken on the part of the plaintiff below is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the balance found to be due to <em>Eliza Ann Kirk, </em>the <em>cestui que use, </em>and from what period ? Which question the court below refused to decide, but left it to the jury to determine. The dealings between man and man are ip their nature so various, that scarcely two cases occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>presenting the same aspect. The question of interest therefore, has been found to be one, not susceptible of the application to it, of any fixed and general rule, each case mainly depending upon its own peculiar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This same question of interest, however, arose and was discussed in <em>Newson's Adm\u2019r vs. Douglass, </em>7 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>417, in which it was decided by this court, that the question was properly submitted to the jury by the court below, to be determined by them according to the equity and justice appearing between the parties, on a consideration of all the circumstances of that particular case, as disclosed at the trial. But it is there said, <em>\u201c </em>there are indeed cases, not to speak of bonds, &amp;c., in which interest is recoverable as of right\u2014such as on a contract in writing to pay money on a day certain; as in the case of a bill of exchange or a promissory note; or on a contract for the pay ment of interest, or where the money claimed has actually been used,\u201d which in any aspect of this case would seem to be applicable to it. The guardian gave his bond for the performance of his duty as such, and by law it was his duty, on the arrival of the ward at the age of sixteen, to exhibit a final account to the Orphans Court, and to deliver to the ward all her property in his hands. Here was a contract, (so far as the property of the ward in his hands consisted of money,) to pay money wThen she attained the age of sixteen, which was a day sufficiently certain. The proof is, that when the ward had arrived at the age of sixteen, she called on the guardian for a settlement on a day appointed by him for that purpose; when he told her, that, <em>\u201c </em>he had been disappointed in getting all the money, but had procured a part, which he offered to her ; \u201d that she declined taking it, preferring its remaining in his hands on interest, and that he agreed to keep the money on interest, and after paying her fifty or sixty dollars, gave her his promissory note for the balance due to her in his hands with interest. Here then is a case, in which the money was actually used; for he had so applied or disposed of it, that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>called on for a settlement, he could only procure a part of it; it was not, therefore, lying by him unused. There was too, an express contract for the payment of interest, independent of the promissory note, which has a provision for the payment of interest, and is evidence of his keeping the money on those terms. The plaintiff is therefore, entitled to recover interest from that time, on the amount of the balance retained by the guardian in his hands. And the court below erred we think, in not having so directed the. jury, and in leaving the question to be decided by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
