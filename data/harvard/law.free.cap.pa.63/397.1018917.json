And the said party of the second part, for themselves, covenant and agree to and with the said party of the first part, that they, the said party of the second part, bore or dig one or more wells, not less than two hundred feet deep, if necessary to obtain salt or oil from the same to the best advantage, working with proper skill and energy for the interests of both parties, and give to the party of the first part the one-fourth part of all the oil obtained on or out of said premises; and should said second party think proper to engage in the manufacture of salt from any salt water they may find on said land, then they are to give said first party one-twelfth part of said salt so manufactured, said first party to be at no expense whatever, and to receive his share of the oil and salt at the mouth of wells and salt works on the first secular days in each month after oil in profitable quantities shall be found and salt manufactured. And should other valuable minerals be found in boring, digging or operating on said premises for oil and salt, the said party of the first part shall <em>receive </em>at the pit\u2019s mouth the one-fourth part thereof, to be delivered monthly, in like manner as the oil and salt are delivered, if the business of mining and operating for the said minerals should be found profitable for both parties.

J., Watson testified for defendants that they had commenced operations on the east side, and had taken others into partnership with them ; the operations had been successful; the wells on the west side had not been productive ; they yielded a little; the failure to get oil there was not conclusive that there was no oil there ; they had ceased working on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">By another witness it was testified that up to 1865, seventeen wells had been sunk on the west side; one was sunk in 1866; the engine had been recently taken away; all the wells were tested; the machinery was moved away from all the wells that did not produce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-7\">The plaintiff, in rebuttal, gave evidence tending to show that the defendants had put buildings, &amp;c., on the land not necessary for carrying on their mining business; they also gave evidence of the failure and abandonment of the wells on the west side and the removal of the machinery; of sub-lettings; the rates of the leasing, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim for the 114 acres, was on the ground that it was not occupied by the defendants and was not necessary to work the wells which were yielding oil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s 1st and 3d points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">1. The agreement of 19th January 1860, gave-a license to Watson and Angier to take salt and oil from his lands, and was revocable by Rynd at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-11\">3. The agreement of 2d July 1861, gave only a license to Watson and Angier to confer the same privilege they had upon third persons, for the benefit of Rynd, and was Revocable by him at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-12\">These points the court (Trunkey, P. J.) denied, and further said in his charge:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-13\">* * \u201c In very words, Watson and Angier, their heirs and assigns, shall have perpetually the exclusive right of boring and operating for oil and salt on the whole farm, except the part reserved by defined bounds, and may assign and sub-let their right as to fractional parts of the premises; they, their heirs and assigns, may use all the surface necessary and convenient for their full enjoyment and operations under the grant, and not to interfere further with the Owner of the land for farming purposes. The consideration for this grant is the covenant already stated on the part of Watson and Angier. They are bound, amongst other things, to commence work by a certain date, to work with skill and energy for the interest of both parties, to deliver a certain portion of the oil or salt to Rynd at certain times, to survey and divide the premises into lots, sub-lease and have them worked to the best advantage. [With such grant, upon such consideration, it would seem that the parties had made the right of the grantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>to take the oil and salt exclusive of the grantor, as well as other persons. The important right to divide and sub-let is not consistent with the claim that Rynd retained the right to .take oil and salt in common with the grantees.] This right .was given after he had ample time for reflection and observation of the manner in which the grantees were performing their covenant in the first article. The exclusive right to take oil from the land, and to divide and grant small lots in severalty for oil operations, would be essentially interfered with in case the grantor would go on when and where he pleased to operate for oil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\"><em>\u201c </em>[If oil is discovered in paying quantities, and of this no question is made, the grant is perpetual, not of a part, but of the whole, Rynd and those under him reserving the fee simple estate, with right to occupancy of the soil, when the same is not necessary and convenient for the object contemplated by the lease. The article makes no provision for a return of the land in parts, as to oil rights, when oil is not found thereon. It does not provide for forfeiture of the rights granted in whole or in part in case of breach of covenants. The grant and reservations, covenants and restrictions, are similar to those in case of Funk <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 8 P. F. Smith 229. The similitude is such that I do not hesitate to conclude, on the authority of this case, that Rynd granted to Watson and Angier in fee simple, an incorporeal hereditament, made divisible by the terms of the grant, by the parties made exclusive in the grants within the designated lines; that whatever rights are reserved to Rynd for agricultural and other purposes, within the lines, he has no right to take oil or salt therein, and can have none until the grantees and those claiming under them have forfeited their rights by breaches of the covenant.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\"><em>\u201c </em>This action is to cover that part of the tract lying on the west side of Oil creek. It is unnecessary to inquire why it is not for the whole tract, or for all of it not actually operated upon for oil purposes. Whether or not the entire eastern side is operated upon we are not advised, nor is it material. The defence is rested on the same ground as if the action were for the whole instead of a part. The plaintiff may recover this part if the defence is not good. The plaintiff claims a verdict for the land not actually occupied by producing oil-wells, being all except about two acres on the west side of the creek. Rynd has the right of possession and enjoyment of the surface for all purposes, save of so much as may he necessary and convenient for the object of the grant. If oil has been found in profitable quantities, and the granted rights have not been forfeited, the grantees, or the defendants holding under them, have a right of possession to all the surface necessary and convenient for the object given them. Should the evidence satisfy you that the defendants have taken and occupied the land for other purposes than the right given, and that they have ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>eluded Rynd from possession of the surface when it is not required for oil operations, preventing him from enjoying the right of which he had not divested himself, then he ought to recover the premises wrongfully taken from him. But if there is not evidence to show that the defendants have taken and held the land to any greater extent than required for their oil operations, and have not otherwise interfered with Rynd\u2019s enjoyment of the premises, he cannot recover for this reason : Each party has certain rights, and when one has not wrongfully interfered with the other\u2019s premises, there can be ho recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">\u201cDid the defendants, or Watson and Angier, within the time mentioned in the agreement, make search and find oil in profitable quantities ? Have they expended large sums of money in sinking wells? Have they prosecuted the work of obtaining oil with reasonable diligence, obtaining large quantities, averaging some 25,000 or 30,000 barrels annually ? If you find they did all this, then although they may have failed to perform the covenant to the full extent, their rights are not forfeited. Forfeitures at law, as well as in equity, are odious. They may be answerable for non-payment of rent for use of improved land, for not making the survey, for not working with greater diligence; but if they have performed their covenants to the extent stated, the grant is not forfeited. It is not a question here how much damage could be recovered in an action of covenant, or whether Rynd contracted with as much or greater wisdom as others who have leased their lands. There is no allegation that the grant was obtained by fraud or imposition, and the defence is not available that he might have had more favorable covenants. You will observe that your attention has been directed to some facts, while there has been little question made as to them. They are for you to pass upon, and under the instructions given, as you find the facts, your verdict will be for the plaintiff or defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">The verdict was for the defendants.

But this does not arise in the form of action adopted by the plaintiff. The action is ejectment and relates to the possession only of the land. Assuming that the defendants had taken possession and occupied the premises for other purposes; or to an extent greater than that provided in the contract; or that the license was revocable by Rynd; or had been forfeited by the defendants, the form of action would be a suitable remedy. But the right of Rynd to bore for and take oil from the land cannot be tested in this form of action. Should he attempt to exercise this right, a conflict would arise with the defendants, claiming a right exclusive of Rynd, who might test his claim by an action for a breach of the contract, or possibly by a bill in equity; but the exclusiveness of their right is not a question in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The court below in clear and explicit language left to the jury the fact whether a possession had been taken by the defendants to a greater extent than was necessary for their oil operation; or so as to interfere with the possession reserved by Rynd to himself. The fact has been found by the jury against the plaintiff, and this leaves only the questions of revocation and forfeiture. We agree with the learned judge, and the authorities cited by the defendants as plaintiffs in error show, that this license, when entered upon and made effectual by the performance of the covenants of the defendants, and a successful result according to the terms of the agreement, is perpetual and irrevocable. We think he also fairly submitted the question of forfeiture with proper instructions, in terms consistent with the provisions of the agreement. That fact being determined against the plaintiff, nothing remains but to affirm the judgment, leaving o.ut of view the question of the exclusiveness of the license. This point not fairly arising in the case, it would be improper to state an opinion, which would not be binding as a decision in a future controversy. It admits of argument, and may not be ruled by Funk <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 3 P. F. Smith 243, but we forbear to express an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
