L. 603, Purd. 666, pi. 31, against wilfully furnishing intoxicating drinks to minors, &amp;c., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201c for use as a beverage.\u201d The punishment for the first offence is a fine from $10 to $100; for a subsequent offence a fine from $25 to $100, and imprisonment in the discretion of the court, with forfeiture of license.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>\u00b6.

By section 9, a person selling to one to whom it is unlawful by the act to sell, shall be liable to all damages occasioned by such sale. By section 10, persons violating the provisions of this act shall be fined not more than $25, or in default of payment, imprisonment not more than five days. This act was repealed by the Act of April 6th 1868, \u00a7 1; but it does not reinstate the Act of 1854, because that being a penal act, is not revived by the repeal of the repealing act: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>King, 1 Wharton 460; Anonymous, 1 Wash. C. C. Rep. 84; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Duane, 1 Binney 601; Norris <em>v. </em>Crocker, 13 Howard 435.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ASC\">The opinion of the court was delivered, November 4th 1869, by</p>\n<author id=\"Ap4\">Read, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AEL\">The defendant was indicted under the Act of the 8th May, 1854, for wilfully furnishing intoxicating drinks, by sale or gift, to minors, arid on the 8th September 1868, he pleaded guilty, and on the 3d March 1869, the court arrested the judgment. No reason was assigned, but the counsel for the defendant says the Act of 1854 was repealed by the Act of the 17th April 1867. But this is a clear mistake, for the acts are not inconsistent, and it contains no repealing clause, and the Act of 1867 is itself repealed by the Act of the 6th April 1868, and the of-fence is charged to be committed on the 18th April.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Any formal defect in the indictment was cured under the Criminal Procedure Act by the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Arrest of judgment reversed, and Court of Quarter Sessions ordered to proceed to sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Sharswood, J., dissented, being of opinion the indictment was substantially defective in not charging that the sale was for use as a beverage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
