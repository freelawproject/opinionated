The action was for a legacy under the will of Margaret A. Hutchman, the wife of Josiah Hutchman, the above-named decedent. The will of Mrs. Hutchman was dated April 2d 1849, and directed amongst other things as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-13\"><em>\u201c </em>It is my will that if Esther Maria Bredin shall continue under the direction of my husband, Josiah Hutchman, until she arrives at the age of twenty-one years, she shall receive the sum of one hundred dollars.\u201d * * * \u201c The whole residue of all my estate of every kind or description, I will and bequeath to my well beloved husband, Josiah Hutchman, and I hereby constitute and appoint him the sole executor of'this my last will and testament, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-14\">Esther Maria Bredin is the plaintiff in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-15\">On the 7th of June 1861, on motion of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the court directed judgment for the plaintiff for default of appearance, the prothonotary to liquidate the damages; they were assessed June 22d, at $210.66.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-16\">On the 10th of January 1865 the court granted a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, which on the 28th of June 1867 was made absolute, \u201c the plaintiff to file a declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u25a0within ten days \u2014 the defendant to plead, and put the case to issue within five days thereafter.

The lien of the judgment to continue and no objection to be taken to the form of action or jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">The plaintiff declared in debt against Gilliland as executor of Hutchman\u2019s will, for the legacy under Mrs. Hutchman\u2019s will. The defendant, amongst other pleas, pleaded \u201c nil debet, payment and payment with leave, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">He pleaded also that the plaintiff did not continue under the direction of Plutchman till she came of age, &amp;c.; also that Hutchman had only the estate of Mrs. Hutchman in his hands as her executor, and never became liable to pay her legacy, &amp;c.; also, that the declaration was <em>\u201c </em>against an executor of an executor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">He demurred also for the same reason as the last plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s replications was: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-10\"><em>\u201c </em>That she did remain under the direction of the said Josiah Hutchman so far as in her power, that when she was but about seventeen years of age said Josiah Plutchman was taken sick and on some time prior to his death he did not assume the direction or control of said plaintiff \u2014 that he, the said Josiah Hutchman, had left his home for medical treatment and remained away from home a long time; that when said plaintiff was between eighteen and nineteen years of age he, the said Josiah Plutchman, died, making it altogether impossible for said plaintiff to remain under his direction until she was twenty-one years of age. That her parents, both father and mother, were living, and by the laws \u00f3f God and man her guardians and to whom she owed obedience, all of which the said Mrs. Hutchman well knew at the time she made her will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-11\">She also replied that Hutchman was residuary legatee as well as executor and took possession of all the decedent\u2019s estate; that he never filed an inventory or settled an account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-12\">On the trial before McGoffin, P. J., it appeared that letters testamentary were granted to Hutchman, the executor, who took possession of all the estate, but never filed an inventory. Hutch-man afterwards married a second time. There was evidence that the plaintiff in 1854, when she was about eighteen years of age and after the second marriage of Mr. Hutchman, left his residence during his absence from home; stating that she left because she she was going to be married, and because she and Mrs. Hutch-man did not agree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-13\">The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-14\">1. That the plaintiff cannot recover against the executor on the first count in the declaration because therein she claims to charge him as the executor of an executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>4. That if she (plaintiff) did not comply with and perform the condition of the will, she is not entitled to the legacy, and cannot recover on the first count in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">5. That by the plaintiff\u2019s replication she has driven herself into the Orphans\u2019 Court for her remedy, if she has any, and cannot recover in this Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The court answered:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">\u201c 1. The answer to this depends on the fact as to whether Mr. Hutchman in his lifetime, or Mr. Gilliland as his executor, appropriated the estate to their own use or the use of the estate of Mr. Hutchman. In that case it would become an ordinary debt of Hutchman, and his executor would have to account for it as any other debt, Mr. Gilliland not being held as trustee himself in any way. This has reference to the legacy bequeathed by Mrs. Hutchman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">\u201c 4. We answer this point in the negative, and we hold and so instruct you that inasmuch as this is a devise of personal property and the non-performance of the condition would not defeat the vesting of the right to recover, inasmuch as there is no limitation over, nor under its provisions does it pass into the devise of the residue of the estate \u2014 there being no provision that it shall so become a part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-10\">\u201c 5. This point we <em>pro forma </em>answer in the negative, and instruct you that the plaintiff need not originate her proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, reserving the question for decision hereafter, as to whether the remedy is in the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-11\">The jury found for the plaintiff for $337.08.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">The court afterwards entered judgment on the verdict on the reserved point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-13\">The defendant took out a writ of error' and assigned for error, that the court erred :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-14\">In opening the judgment on the terms that the defendant should take no objection to the jurisdiction or form of action; in deciding that the defendant had waived objecting by accepting the terms and going to trial; in the answers to the points and entering judgment on the reserved question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-15\"><em>I).

Act 24th February 1834, \u00a7 50. The mode of proceeding is regulated by the six sections following: On a plea of want of assets, the case goes into the Orphans\u2019 Court, for an account, the action of the Common Pleas being, meanwhile, suspended. It is only when the legacy is charged on real estate, and the purpose is to enforce the charge, the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is exclusive. The opening of the judgment will not be inquired into upon this writ of error. It may be remarked, however, that the judgment was by default, and not on trial and verdict. The plaintiff in error cannot complain of the terms on which the judgment was opened. The Court of Common Pleas having jurisdiction for the recovery of legacies, there was no apparent want of jurisdiction in the record. It did not appear that the plaintiff sought to charge real estate. The court was, therefore, not precluded from prescribing terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">But there are two grounds fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery. First. The executor of an executor cannot be sued for a legacy under the will of the first testator: Act 15th of March 1832, \u00a7 19, Purdon 275, pl. 16. After this came the 31st section of the Act of 24th February 1834, Purdon 287, pl. 95, vesting in the administrator, <em>de bonis non, </em>the power to recover the assets from any predecessors in the administration of the estate. Many decisions under this section maintained that no action for \u2022 assets can be brought, except by the administrator, <em>de bonis non, </em>with or without the will annexed, as the case may be: 9 Watts 479; 7 Barr 315; 6 Harris 313; 7 Harris 201; 11 Harris 164; 4 Casey 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The second objection to recovery is, that the legacy under Mrs. Hutchman\u2019s will was contingent \u2014 depending on a condition precedent, before it could v\u00e9st. The clause in her will reads thus: \u201c It is my will that if Esther Maria Bredin shall continue under the direction of my husband, Josiah Hutchman, until she arrives at the age of twenty-one years, she shall receive the sum of $100.\u201d The condition was inseparably connected with the gift of the legacy, and not merely its payment. The right to it depends upon living out the prescribed time, under the direction of the husband. The legatee was a mere dependant, and the testatrix may have had good reasons for the condition. The interests of her husband may have been the consideration of the bequest, or it might be the interests of the legatee, to preserve her in a course of good conduct. There are numerous authorities, that where the contingency is attached to the legacy itself, and not merely its payment, the legacy itself is contingent: Lamb <em>v. </em>Lamb, 8 Watts 184; Moore <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Watts 403; Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 503. The legacy not vesting until the condition had been performed, the want of a bequest over makes no difference. It becomes merged in the residue, if it never vests.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
