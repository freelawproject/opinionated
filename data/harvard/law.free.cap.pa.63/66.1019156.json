The act required the District Court of Allegheny county to appoint three. commissioners, who, after giving notice of the time and place of their meeting, should <em>\u201c </em>examine the shores, surveying and marking thereon lines of ordinary low water and high water marks along the rivers Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio, within the following limits (designating them), * * * and around the shores of all the islands in the rivers aforesaid, and within the limits aforesaid, * * * such lines of low and high water to be laid out along said shores in such manner and position as will most perfectly secure and perpetuate the navigable channels of said rivers, and best promote the safety and convenience of vessels, rafts and persons navigating the same, and as will be most suitable in all respects for the general benefit of the public at large.\u201d The act also required the commissioners to make a correct map of their work, and return it to the District Court, the prothonotary to file it for public inspection, and give notice by publication in newspapers, of the day \u2014 to be fixed by the court \u2014 when objections would be heard, and after hearing the objections and making alterations, if any should be found necessary, the Court should direct the map to be recorded, and thenceforth it <em>\u201c </em>shall be taken and allowed for the purposes herein mentioned and contained, and the lines so approved shall forever after be deemed, adjudged and taken firm and stable for the purposes aforesaid.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The act also vested'the riparian right which was in the state in the \u201c corporations within whose limits the same is or hereafter shall lie.\u201d Also, the record of the appointment of commissioners under the act, with their report and final order of confirmation, June 22d 1861. The defendant further gave evidence by drafts and oral testimony for the purpose of showing the location of his own and plaintiff\u2019s land; the building of defendant\u2019s mill, the character of the channel between the island and the main land, &amp;c., and other matters deemed proper to meet the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">The land claimed by the plaintiff lies between the low water line fixed by the commissioners, which is next the island, and the centre of the old channel as it existed prior to the filling up occasioned by McCullough\u2019s dam, being the portion of land embraced between the high and low water lines of the defendant\u2019s island as fixed by the commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">The plaintiff submitted ten points, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">1. By the patent to Winebiddle his title extended to the middle of the channel as it was in December 1787, the Allegheny river then not having been declared a highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-9\">2. The act subsequently declaring the river a highway did not divest Winebiddle\u2019s title between the centre of the channel and the low water line on the main shore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-10\">3. The Act of 1858 and the action of the commissioners could not divest the title of those claiming under Winebiddle to the ground between low water mark and the centre of the channel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-11\">4. The Patterson patent gave to him and his successors in title, a right, at least to a front on a navigable stream, of which the Commonwealth could not deprive them; the same principle applies to the Winebiddle patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-12\">5. The effect, if any, on the rights of the plaintiff of the establishment of lines under the Act of 1858 ceased as soon as the branch was closed up. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-14\">6. As the river was forced by the acts of the defendant from that part of its channel between the island and mainland, the ground on the plaintiff\u2019s side pertains to him to the centre of the low water channel as it was before the acts of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-15\">7. \u201c The articles of agreement and the deed are to be construed with reference to the circumstances at the time, to wit, the island as an island and the intervening ground to the east shore as the bed of that part of the river, and the privileges or liberties granted continued only as long, at the most, as the island continued an island, the ground between it and the east shore continued to be a part of the river\u2019s bed, and the shore a part of its shore, and when they ceased to be such, the privileges or liberties ceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-16\">8. \u201c The liberty of using as, much of the shore belonging to Wain wright as may be between the water and the trees growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>along the same,\u201d in the article and deed, is restrictive, and confines McCullough within narrower bounds than if the clause had not been inserted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">9. \u201c The privilege of erecting any mills, &amp;c., between said island and the east shore,\u201d continued only as long as there was an island on one side of it and a shore on the other; and at most it was only an agreement that McCullough might obstruct that part of the river by erecting \u201cmills,\u201d &amp;c., in it, and Wainwright would not do anything to prevent him from doing so. It cannot be applied to the <em>locus in quo </em>after it ceased, by the acts of the defendant or of the Commonwealth, to be a part of the river and became a part of the main land, at a distance from the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">10. If the jury believed, under all the evidence, that that part of the river was filled up by sediment in consequence of the acts of defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to recover to the centre of the low-water channel, as they may find it to have been before the defendant did the acts that occasioned the filling up.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">The court, after referring to the facts, the Act of 1858 and the proceedings under it, charged: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-9\">\u201c This ejectment is not brought for any portion of the main land belonging to the plaintiff or his testator, nor for any part of the land embraced between the high and low water lines, as established by the commissioners along the bank or shore of the said main land, nor for any portion of the bed of the channel or stream as laid down and fixed by the commissioners, but the land embraced between the high and low water lines of the defendant\u2019s island, as the same was fixed by the commissioners and established by the decree of this court confirming the same. It seems to me, therefore, that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming any portion of the land embraced within the high and low water lines of defendant\u2019s'island, as thus fixed and established; and that it is too late for him to raise the question whether the land in controversy constituted, at one time, a part of the channel between the island and the main land, and whether it was situated on the main land side of the centre of the island channel. If the Act of Assembly is of a,ny validity, and if the proceedings of the commissioners under it, and the decree of this court confirming the same, are to have any force or effect, they are conclusive upon the rights of the parties. If the Act of Assembly has no validity \u2014 if the proceedings under it have no legal force or binding obligation, it is time that the riparian owners and the public understand it. The county has expended a large sum of money in carrying out the provisions of the act for establishing the high and low water lines authorized by it, and as we all know, the riparian owners and the public have acquiesced in and conformed to the lines thus established. If this expenditure has been all in vain, it is time that the community understand it. The very small number of except-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ants, not exceeding three or four, shows that the commissioners must have performed their work with judgment and discretion, and to the general satisfaction of the parties interested in it. It seems to me that the riparian owners are hound hy the high and low water lines thus established, and that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming the land in controversy, or of raising the question whether the same was or was not a part of the bed of the channel and situate on the south-eastern or main land side of its centre. And the court instructs the jury that, under the evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and that their verdict should be for the defendant. This view of the law renders it unnecessary to consider the numerous points presented by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and so far as they have not been answered in the charge, they are refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">The verdict was for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">The plaintiff took a writ of error.

The court below ruled the case upon the effect of the low and high water lines as established by commissioners under Act of 16th April 1858, Pamph. L. 326, which excluded the plaintiff from the land described in his writ, and prevented his recovery. In order to arrive at the legal effect of the lines established by the commissioners under that act, we must ascertain its true purpose; and to reach this, it becomes necessary to examine the navigable character of the rivers Allegheny, Monongahela aqd Ohio, and the rights of the riparian proprietors upon their banks. These rivers are among the largest in the state; larger than the Schuylkill and Lehigh, recognised as navigable in the early history of the province, and have been repeatedly held by name to be rivers naturally navigable, and therefore classed with the Delaware and Susquehanna: Carson <em>v. </em>Blazer, 2 Binney 478; Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Nav. Co., 14 S. &amp; R. 79, 80; Hunter <em>v. </em>Howard, 10 Id. 244. Many acts have been passed declaring tributaries of these rivers navigable. But an act perhaps most pertinent to this controversy is that of 8th April 1785, 2 Sm. Laws 317, regulating the taking up of lands within the new purchase, of which the 13th section expressly excepts <em>islands </em>in the Ohio, <em>Allegheny </em>and Delaware. The exception bears directly on the claim of title by the plaintiff to the middle of the stream, under the patent of Conrad Winebiddle, dated December 31st 1787.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Wainwright\u2019s Island, involved in this controversy, lies on the eastward side of the middle thread of the stream, and separated from the eastern shore by a small branch, so that the plaintiff\u2019s title to the middle of the stream, if allowed, would embrace the island. But the reservation of the islands by the Act of 1785, passed before the inception of the Winebiddle title, recognises the navigable character of the Allegheny, and the title can extend only to ordinary low-water mark on the eastern shore of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">This being the navigable character of the stream, the rights of the riparian owners are settled by numerous decisions, a few of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>which may be referred to: Carson <em>v. </em>Blazer, <em>supra; </em>Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Nav. Co., <em>supra; </em>Ball <em>v. </em>Slack, 2 Whart. 508; Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Union Canal Co., 1 W. &amp; S. 346; Bailey <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, 7 Casey 37; McKeen <em>v. </em>Delaware Div. Canal Co., 13 Wright 424; Tinicum Fishing Co. <em>v. </em>Carter, 11 P. F. Smith 21, opinion by Sharswood, J., decided last winter at Philadelphia. From these and other cases, it will appear that the absolute title of the riparian proprietor extends to high-water mark only, and that between ordinary high and ordinary low water-mark, his title to the soil is qualified, it being subject to the public rights of navigation over it, and of improvement of the stream as a highway. He cannot occupy to the prejudice of navigation or cause obstructions to be placed upon the shore between these lines, without express authority of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The case of Bailey <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, 7 Casey 37, decided in 1856, doubtless had something to do in turning public attention to the shores of the streams surrounding the city of Pittsburg, which led to the passage of the Act of 1858, for the purpose of defining the low and high water-lines. It referred to the mistaken idea entertained by some proprietors of making ground for their mills, by depositing cinders on the shore between low and high water marks. \u201c The Allegheny and many other navigable rivers\u201d (says the opinion) \u201c do not, at the time of low water, occupy over one-third of their bed; and it would be most disastrous to allow every owner to fill out his land to low water-mark.\u201d This state of affairs, for these rivers had been seriously encroached upon at and opposite Pittsburg, no doubt led to the Act of 16th April 1858, Pamph. L. 326. It begins by a recital, \u201cWhereas, The lines of lands on and along the shores at the rivers at and near the city of Pittsburg, in the county of Allegheny, have never yet been clearly ascertained, and as it is important to the owners of such lands, the persons navigating the waters of, and the corporations adjacent to, such rivers, and to all parties interested, to know and to have their several rights and privileges in extension and limitation ascertained and defined; therefore,\u201d &amp;c. The first impression arising from this language might seem to be that the law was intended to ascertain and fix these high and low water lines to end all controversies, <em>private </em>as well as public. But a careful consideration of its purpose and provisions shows that it is not applicable to disputed boundaries between private owners, but was intended to regulate the respective rights of the public and the landowners, over whose property the right of navigation extends between high and low water lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The subject itself is incompatible with a regulation of boundaries between landowners, for the bed of the stream belongs to the state, and necessarily lies between and excludes controversy with an opposite owner, while the act itself refers to no other lines than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>those of low and high water. It exhibits no purpose to define boundaries between private owners running in toward the stream. The boundary adjusted is therefore necessarily between the state and the riparian owner, for low and high water lines on a navigable river can concern no other. owners. This accords with the parties enumerated in the preamble, to wit, \u2014 the owners of the lands, the persons navigating the waters, and the corporations adjacent \u2014 that is, the cities and boroughs which regulate the landings and ways to and from the rivers. The second and third parties exercise the rights of the public, and therefore are deeply interested in the establishment of the lines of low and high water, but can have no interest in a dispute about boundaries between individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Coming to the duties of the commissioners as set forth in the second section, the law says: \u2014 \u201c Such lines of low and high water to be laid out along said shores aforesaid in such manner and position as will most perfectly secure and perpetuate the navigable channels of said rivers, and best promote the safety and convenience of vessels, rafts, and persons navigating the same, and as will be most suitable in all respects for the general benefit of the public at large.\u201d In the third section they are required not only to hear the parties interested, but to examine experienced hydraulic civil engineers, scientific men and others for the purpose of obtaining accurate information in regard to flowing water in navigable streams, and in regard to the location of the lines aforesaid. Evidently the parties interested are the private owners of the lands extending to the river on the one hand, and the parties navigating and corporations adjacent to the river on the other, while the mere ascertainment of the actual position of a private boundary between owners is inconsistent with the discretion required by the act to be exercised in locating the high and low water lines, so as to preserve the channels of navigation, and promote the safety and convenience of vessels, rafts and persons navigating the same, and for this purpose to call in the aid of scientific men. The effect of the lines as established is thus stated: <em>\u201c </em>the lines so approved shall for ever after be deemed, adjudged and taken, firm and stable for the purposes aforesaid.\u201d If we seek for the \u201c aforesaid\u201d purposes, the act discloses none but those relating to the public interest and that of the riparian owner. Then if we advert to the power of the state over navigable streams, as stated in the authorities cited, we discover that it is plenary over the subject of navigation and the improvement of these natural channels of commerce, while the ownership of the riparian proprietor is qualified between the lines of low and high water. The legislature may, therefore, with great propriety define the bounds of high and low water, by means of a suitable commission, for the purpose of regulating the public right, so as not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to conflict with private interests, and to prevent private rights from being exercised to the prejudice of' public interests; for example, to prevent the shores from being filled up with great banks of cinders. But if the intent were to regulate disputed boundaries between private owners, what machinery compatible with the lawful determination of private rights has the legislature provided ? No right of appeal is given as in the case of party-walls and partition fences. And the private right would be determined by commissioners in derogation of the right of trial by jury. Now, without determining whether this is constitutional or not, it is a circumstance against the interpretation of the act in that way. In the case of Wells <em>v. </em>Eox, 1 Dali. 308, we have some analogy to the present question. There it was determined that the feigned issue to be ordered on an appeal from the determination of the regulators of party-walls, could determine only whether the regulators had acted correctly or not, but not the title. Eor the latter purpose an ejectment was considered the proper remedy. Eor these reasons we are of opinion that the commission under the Act of 1858 settled no disputes, and ascertained no boundaries, as between private owners. The effect of this conclusion would be to reverse the judgment \u00f3f the court below, but for another difficulty which meets the plaintiff below on the very threshold of his case. By his own showing he had no title to the land described in his ejectment. The writ describes the land claimed by the plaintiff as lying between the low-water line of the island as fixed by the commissioners and the top of the island bank. The land thus described, therefore, is a part of the island and lies westward of the channel or branch which runs between it and the main land. The title of the plaintiff given in evidence was under the Winebiddle patent for the main land lying on the eastern bank of this branch. Thus the channel of the branch which belonged to neither the owner of the main land nor the owner of the island, but was the property of the state, intervened between the land owned by the plaintiff and the shore of the island for which he brought his suit, and effectually cuts off his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, this was no case of mere alluvion, or of a river forsaking its bed from ordinary and natural causes. He gave evidence to show; and indeed proved, by many witnesses, that the old channel ran next to the island, and began to fill up after the defendant had built his dam from the island to Denny\u2019s land on the main shore; that the process of filling was accelerated by the abutment built by the defendant above the dam, and was finally consummated by the bridges built across from the main land to the island.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">From what has been said of the Allegheny as a river naturally navigable, recognised by statute law and judicial decisions, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>clear that the ownership of its bed between islands and the shore, as well as its main channel, belongs to the state. A wrongful diversion of its waters from its bed does not extinguish the title of the state, or add to that of individuals. This is evident upon principle, and finds an analogy in the decision in Allegheny City <em>v. </em>Reed, 12 Harris 39, holding that after Smoky or Killbuck Island had been swept away by the floods, leaving only a bare sand and gravel bottom, it was the property of the state, and not liable to appropriation as an island.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Having shown no title whatever to the land described in the writ of ejectment, the plaintiff\u2019s case is at an end. And for this reason the bills of exception to the rejection of certain evidence relating to acts of the defendant, his conviction and sentence, the former action of trespass, &amp;c., became immaterial. The plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
