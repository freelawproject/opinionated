The defendants claimed that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>had no title to any land between the exact spot of his monuments and the low-water line, that is that his south or lower line was a line between his east and west corners on the top of the river bank, or if plaintiff\u2019s line should go to the low-water line, it should be by extending his western line according to the oblique course by which it reached the monument or at the top of the banks, that is North 63J' E. through \u201c the post on the bank of the river.\u201d This, as was alleged by the plaintiff, and as appeared to be sustained by the evidence, would leave him little or no front at the low-water line. The annexed diagram will explain the claim of each. In the lease to the plaintiff from Mrs. Denny, the west line was stated to be from a point in the east line of \u201c Crawford\u2019s property\u201d (the west line of Mrs. Denny\u2019s) \u201cN. <em>65\u00b0 10' </em>E., to low-water mark in the Ohio river. The perpendicular line claimed by the plaintiff from <em>\u201cthe </em>post on the bank of the river,\u201d would be S. 28\u00b0 W., and between that line and the line as stated in' plaintiff\u2019s lease there would be a triangle whose apex would be \u201c the post,\u201d &amp;c. which would be east of what was claimed as Mrs. Denny\u2019s west line. The plaintiff alleged that so stating the line was a mistake of description by the scrivener who drew the lease, and that it is controlled by the general description in the lease, demising <em>\u201call </em>that piece of ground belonging to the party of the second part lying between the Washington Turnpike road and the Ohio river in West Pittsburg.\u201d (See accompanying diagram.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">The plaintiffs gave evidence by surveyors and others showing that the land in dispute was included within the lines of his deeds; also the exercise of acts of ownership over it by his predecessors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">The defendants gave evidence to prove surveys and the manner in which the land had been used for many years, as bearing both on the question of title and the Statute of Limitations. They also gave evidence to show that if the theory of the plaintiff was correct, the shore below him was such that West Elliott could not have any landing at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s 1st and 2d points were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-9\">\u201c 1.

In ascertaining the extent of the river front of the plaintiffs\u2019 lessor, Elizabeth F.

The true meaning of the deed of West Elliott to O\u2019Hara as construed by the prohibitory clause and calls therein contained, is, that the river front or landing, now in dispute, was not intended to be conveyed by said deed, therefore, the prohibition of a ferry was not necessary, but a <em>ferry-house, </em>or <em>tavern, </em>was prohibited, as they could be erected outside of the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-8\"><em>\u201c </em>11.

The first question of law is, does the plaintiffs\u2019 title extend to the water\u2019s edge, or low-water mark, or is it limited to the mark called for on the top of th'\u00e9' bluff bank where the distances run out ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-19\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the lines are to be extended to the water\u2019s edge, are they to be so extended by their last courses or by right angles from low-water mark to the corners on the top of the bank ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cLet us now examine the first question, viz.: Whether or not the plaintiffs\u2019 title carries him to the water\u2019s edge ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">\u201c The patent under which both parties claim, dated April 20th 1785, calls for 640 acres of land, situate on Saw Mill run, on the south side of the Ohio river, in the county of Washington, bounded as follows: \u2018 <em>Beginning at a corner hickory of Pittsburg Manor, standing on the bank of said Ohio river; thence by said Manor line\u2019 </em>a certain distance, and thence by various courses and distances \u2018 <em>to a corner ironwood tree, standing on the bank of said Ohio river ; </em>thence up the same 233 <em>perches to the first-mentioned hickory and place of beginning.\u2019 </em>When partition of this tract of land was made in the Orphans\u2019 Court, among the heirs of Daniel Elliott, deceased, that portion adjoining the Manor line and embracing the disputed land, as now claimed by the plaintiffs, was awarded to West Elliott, one of his sons. West Elliott, by his deed heretofore referred to, conveyed 15 acres and 175 perches of this land to William Price, described as lying on the south side of the Ohio river, and running by land of said West Elliott, by various courses and distances, <em>\u201cto a stake </em>on the bank of the <em>aforesaid </em>river, and thence up the same south 62\u00b0 east, 4 perches to the place of beginning.\u2019 Price afterwards conveyed the same land to James O\u2019Hara. West Elliott, by his deed heretofore referred to, conveyed 98 acres, part of the aforesaid tract of land taken at the appraisement, and containing, as it is said, the 15 acres last described: this tract of land is bounded and described as follows, viz.: Beginning at a post on the bank of the Ohio river and running thence by the \u2018Manor line\u2019 210 perches, and thence.by sundry courses and distances <em>\u2019to a post on the bank of the Ohio river, and thence up the run to the place of beginning.\u2019\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">\u201c Such are the boundaries described in the plaintiffs\u2019 chain of title, and it only remains to inquire whether the law carries it to the river\u2019s edge, or whether it must be limited to the hickory and post called for in the deeds ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">\u201c It may be worthy of observation just here, that, as both parties claim under the patent to Daniel Elliott, and as the boundaries therein described are in substance the same as those in all the deeds from West Elliott down, if the patent did not go to the river, the title to the whole river front must still be in the Commonwealth and liable to be patented any day by any one who might choose to apply for the same. A title or claim of this kind I apprehend would be as stoutly resisted by the present defendant as by the plaintiffs. The principle has been too long and too well settled in this state, by numerous decisions, to admit of doubt or question, that whenever natural boundaries are called for in a survey, more especially navigable rivers, they control the distances and artificial marks on the ground, and this rule has been adhered to with such tenacity, that nothing but the clearest and most satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>factory intimation of the parties to the contrary will prevent its operation. This rule of law is based not only on the general practice, experience and convenience of men, but on the soundest principles of reason. In the early history of this country one of the strong inducements to purchase lands adjoining our rivers, or large streams of water, was the facility they afforded of taking their produce, lumber, minerals, &amp;c., to market, as well as to enjoy water-power for their mills. Prior to the construction of turnpikes, railroads or canals, the pack horse and the wagon roads, the latter a great portion of the year almost impassable \u2014 were the only other modes of conveyance the early settlers had \u2014 and hence the importance and convenience of having their farms extend to the river, thus affording free and unobstructed access to, and use of these great natural highways. Another reason for the rule was that any artificial marks on the banks of these rivers were liable to be swept away or entirely obliterated by the frequent floods to which they were subject. And still an additional reason might be stated, that by these floods, the banks on which these marks were made were liable to be and frequently were actually washed away, thus leaving no trace of the lines on the ground. In many instances also, extensive deposits of earth washed from other places were made, extending out into the river for many feet or rods, which under any other rule of law would lead to great inconvenience, hardship and litigation. But under the rule above stated, he who owns the land adjoining, goes t,o the low-water line, wherever that may be, subject to the use by the public of navigating the river between low and high water marks, and the right of the public to construct wharves or public landings thereon, whether he lose or gain by the action of the water, in washing away a portion of his ground or adding thereto by forming \u2018flats,\u2019 as those deposits are called. Without extending our remarks further on this point [I am clearly of opinion that the boundaries called for in the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds carry the title to low-water mark, subject only to the right of the public to use the space between high and low water lines for the purpose of navigation.] Only a very few of the numerous cases in this and other states will be referred to in support of this ruling. * * * These authorities, if there were no others, are abundantly sufficient to warrant us in ruling- that the plaintiffs\u2019 title here extends to low-water mark, and therefore we instruct you as a matter of law, that so far as the question is concerned, the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict for all the land in dispute embraced by these lines, so extended to the water\u2019s edge or low-water mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">2d. \u201c The next question to be determined is, how are the plaintiffs\u2019 lines to be extended; by the last course, when they reach the top of the bank, or at right angles with the low-water line to the point where the lines stopped on the bank, so as to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>plaintiff the same front at low-water mark that he has on the bank ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The manor line extended to the river, would be nearly at right angles with lines of low water at that point, so that the question here arises chiefly on the extension of the western line, which, if produced on the same course as it was at the \u2018 post\u2019 on the bank, would intersect the low-water line only a few feet from the manor line \u2014 in other words, it would leave to the plaintiff only a few feet on his water line; whereas, he has some 8 or 9 perches on his line between the post and hickory on the bank; this would cut him off almost entirely from any river front at all. A rule of this kind would render nugatory nearly all the decisions relative to surveys bounding on our navigable rivers.; because it is very rare indeed, that the lines, on both sides of the survey, approach the river at right angles to the edge of the water; a slight change, therefore, in the course of either line, might cause it to intersect the other before it reached low-water mark; and a slight change in the course of the other line in an opposite direction, might give the whole river front of two tracts, to one owning the intermediate one. This course of proceeding would work great injustice to riparian owners, and produce endless strife and litigation. [The true legal as well as equitable rule, then, undoubtedly is to give each riparian owner the same front at low-water mark that he has on the shore or bank at the termination of his lines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">, \u201c This is done by starting at low water line and running at right angles therewith to the last corner on the hank by the approaching lines, or, which is the same thing, to its intersection therewith. By this simple rule, all difficulty is avoided, and every owner of land along the shores of our rivers, has his equal share or proportion of the beach, or landing, and water privileges, down to low-water mark.] I am not aware that this question, in its present aspect, has ever been brought before our own Supreme Court, but it has been expressly ruled in some of the other states.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-8\">\u201c In Knight <em>v. </em>Wilder, 2 Cushing 199 (Mass.), it was held that in running out the side lines of a riparian proprietor, on a river not navigable, they are to be extended from their respective termini on the shore at right angles with the course of the river, to the centre of the stream: unless otherwise established by the terms' of the grant or conveyance under which he claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-9\">In several of the New England States, the rule of the common law of England has been adopted, giving to the riparian owner the right of soil <em>usque ad filum aquae. </em>But the rule is different in Pennsylvania: here, the riparian owner goes only to low-water mark, and that right is subject to the right of the public for purposes of navigation between high and low water mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-10\">\u201c These authorities, with others that might be cited, show clearly that the rule we have suggested is the true one, and that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s deeds, thus construed, embrace the land in dispute, then so far as this question is concerned, your verdict should be for him.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">The remainder of the charge related to the Statute of Limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">The defendants removed the case to the Supreme Court and assigned for error the answers to the points and the portions of the charge included in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-9\"><em>J.

There are cases where lines run near or along the river in which the line and not the river are taken to be the boundary: Wharton <em>v. </em>Garvin, 10 Casey 340; Kelly <em>v. </em>Graham, 9 Watts 116; Brolaskey <em>v. </em>McClain, 11 P. F. Smith 146. The court was wrong in ruling that the lines should run from the marks in the bank at right angles with the low-water line. When natural boundaries are called for the lines will stop when the boundary is reached and will be extended to reach it: Cox <em>v. </em>Couch, 8 Barr 147; Wharton <em>v. </em>Garvin, Kelly <em>v. </em>Graham, Brolaskey <em>v. </em>McClain, <em>supra. </em>The rule of the court would be proper only when the course of the stream is straight and the line on the bank parallel with it. If the shore curved outward there would be gores; if intvard the lines would overlap. The constant change of the shores would prevent the preservation to each owner of the same river front. The simplest rule is to preserve the direction of the side lines; each owner to take his chance of gain or loss. The conveyance of West Elliott manifests that he intended to retain for himself a ferry and landing. By the application of Judge Plampton\u2019s rule the ferry of the defendants and their predecessors would be destroyed or transferred to the plaintiff. If the rectangular rule is to be established it should be with reference to the actual low-water line as it existed when the deed was made, not the artificial line established by commissioners under the Act of 1858. In Pennsylvania the limit of a riparian owner\u2019s title is to the low-water line, the marks on the hank are used to fix the <em>direction </em>by which the line shall reach the low-water mark. Such has been the understanding of the people and the decisions of the courts of this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\">The lease of the plaintiff which is very precise in its description would exclude a triangle which is included in the plaintiff\u2019s abstract of title, all of which is recovered by the verdict.

The reservation as to the ferry-house would have been unnecessary if Elliott had in fact retained the title for the whole front. His object was to keep away a ferry-house, &amp;e., to compete with one he might erect on his own land. The running of the lines from the marks on the bank to the river is not to be made as running the lines of a farm where the points are fixed, for riparian rights pass as incidents to the land on the bank. Riparian owners have the right of property opposite their land: 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 411; Ex parte Jennings, 20 Johns. 90. In order to get the extent of the riparian owner\u2019s line in the bed of the stream, lines are to be drawn from the points on the bank where the shore-lines terminate at right angles with bank to the thread of the river: Carter <em>v. </em>Murcot, 4 Burrows 2162. The riparian owner has a portion of the bed of the stream in proportion to his line on the margin, lying in front of his upland: Angell on Water Courses, sect. 11; Price on Lim. 63; Ball <em>v. </em>Slack, 2 Whart. 508; Jones <em>v. </em>Janney, Naglee <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, <em>supra; </em>Knight <em>v. </em>Wilder, 2 Cush. 199; Rust <em>v. </em>Boston Mill Co., 6 Pick. 158; Deerfield <em>v. </em>Arms, 17 Id. 41; Sparhawk <em>v. </em>Bullard, 1 Metc. 106; Flanagan <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 6 Wright 219; Barton <em>v. </em>Bouvier, 1 Phila.

Variety in the language of the return matters little, so that the intention to make the stream a boundary appears sufficiently in the description and diagram. In determining this both are taken together. The variety of expression in the decided cases is very great. In Carson <em>v. </em>Blaser, <em>supra, </em>the description in the patent (taken, of course, from the return of survey) was \u201c beginning at a birch <em>by the river;\u201d </em>thence running outward and returning \u201cto a red-oak <em>by the same river, </em>and thence <em>by the same, </em>the several courses thereof, to the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In Hart <em>v. </em>Hill, 1 Wharton 124, the counsel of defendant contended (p. 131) that the deeds of the plaintiff were bounded by \u201c stakes and stones on the banks of the river,\u201d but Kennedy, J., interposed, saying: \u201c This is universal in the country, surveyors never go into the water for the purpose.\u201d And Huston, J., said: \u201c It has often been decided that the owners of land hold to low-water mark, notwithstanding such boundaries.\u201d They were both eminent as land lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Klingensmith <em>v. </em>Ground, 5 Watts 458, decided in 1836, was the case of a private deed describing the land as beginning at a sugar tree on the bank of the river and running up the same north 59 degrees south 59 perches to a stump <em>near </em>the creek, thence <em>up the creek </em>north 14J perches to a stone. The court below thought that the word \u201cnear\u201d indicated an intention not to make the creek a boundary, but this court held the creek to be the boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">In Ball <em>v. </em>Stark, decided in 1837, 2 Wharton 508, the description in the proprietary\u2019s grant began at the \u201c mouth of Gunner\u2019s creek,\u201d thence running up the several courses of the Delaware and returning \u201c to a corner white-oak standing <em>near </em>unto the above said Gunner\u2019s creek, from thence following <em>down the several watercourses thereof </em>to the place of beginning.\u201d It was held this description led into the mouth of Gunner\u2019s creek at its junction with the Delaware at low water, notwithstanding at high tide running a mile up Gunner\u2019s creek the plaintiff would have been cut off from the creek at its mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The patent in Coovert <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 8 Watts 470, described the land next to Mahoning creek, a branch of the Big Beaver, thus\u2014 \u201c to a birch <em>on </em>Big Beaver, thence <em>down the said creek </em>the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ing courses: south 76 degrees east 75 perches, north 83 degrees east 40 perches, south 62 degrees east 125 perches, north 55 degrees east 23 perches, to a post.\u201d In this case the hirch tree stood on the hank of the stream, and the survey ran from it by courses and distances actually run along the bank, yet it was held that the description \u201c down the said creek\u201d carried the title <em>ad tfilum aquce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The principle which thus abandons the courses and distances for the stream itself is thus stated by Gibson, C. J., in Cox <em>v. </em>Couch, 8 Barr 154: \u2014 \u201c By reason of imperfection of instruments as well as inequalities of surface, and carelessness of assistants, extreme accuracy is not to be attained by the compass and chain ; while, on the other hand, calls for natural objects, or what is much the same, known and established lines of contiguous tracts, admit of perfect certainty. Where a vendor, therefore, conveys, by established land-marks, the subject of the grant will neither overrun nor fall short of them. They form the true boundary, and the courses and distances serve but to point to the place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In the analogous case of Paul <em>v. </em>Carver, 2 Casey 223, the boundary was described as \u201c thence southeasterly along the northerly <em>side </em>of the said Tidmarsh street,\u201d and it was held to carry the title to the centre of the street. The same was decided in Cox <em>v. </em>Freedly, 9 Casey 124, upon a deed calling for stakes on Egypt and Race streets, \u201c <em>thence along the north-east side of Egypt,\u201d. </em>and \u201c along the south-east side of Race,\u201d although in the same deed another boundary on an alley called for a stake in the <em>middle </em>of the alley, \u201cthence along the <em>middle of said alley.\u201d </em>Woodward, J., there remarks that in surveys bounded on streams and streets the marks must necessarily stand on the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">There are cases supposed to be exceptions to the rule I have stated, but they are not so. The principal of these are Kelly <em>v. </em>Graham, 9 Watts 116, and Wharton <em>v. </em>Garvin, 10 Casey 340. The report of the former omits the return of survey, but Justice Kennedy says in his opinion: \u2014 \u201c The survey, as returned here by the deputy surveyor, as also all the other evidence on the subject, <em>shows most unequivocally that the river is not made a boundary in it, </em>and indeed that it could not have been so intended. The draft of the survey returned is made out according to the courses and distances actually run and marked upon the ground, and not made to call for the river on any side oP&gt; point whatever. <em>At some distance from the survey, </em>however, the Allegheny river is laid down upon a straight line without any regard to its meanders, as if it were intended by the artist merely to show that the land included within the survey lay near to the river.\u201d The case is'therefore not an exception to the rule, but is distinguished from it by the fact that the river was not made or intended to be, a boundary. The real difficulty in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>was that the patent by mistake called for the river, but the court corrected the mistake by a reference to the survey itself, which negatived the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Wharton <em>v. </em>Garvin stands in exactly the same attitude. The north and south lines found upon the ground did not reach the river by 40 perches on the north and 19 perches on the south. The diagram exhibited no protraction to the river, and the closing line was represented as a straight line of 238 perches long, leaving a large vacancy between it and the river. The return did not call for the river as a boundary, but it was represented at some distance off with the words written within representation, \u201c up Allegheny.\u201d The opinion was written by Justice Thompson, the present Chief Justice, who was careful to distinguish the case upon its facts. He remarked that generally a survey is to be carried to its calls unless there are actual lines on the ground excluding them; that a call to stand as a boundary must be indicated to he such with sufficient certainty to show that it was so intended. The representation of an object at a distance from a closing line without any words indicative of an intent to make it a boundary would hardly be sufficient to constitute it such. The line plotted at a distance would have little weight, he remarked, if the river had been made the call, and as it is not so made in terms and appears to be excluded by the draft, it is a circumstance of controlling influence, as held in Kelly <em>v. </em>Graham, <em>supra. </em>Thus it was the intent of the surveyor (appearing clearly in the return of survey) to bound the survey on the 238 perch line, and not on the river, which controlled the decision. Instead of impugning the general doctrine the case supports it, and the judge remarked: \u201cWe are <em>predisposed </em>to presume the existence of an intent to bound surveys on navigable waters by the stream, not only on account of the supposed advantage arising from such location, but because it is in accordance with practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Some inference has probably been drawn from that case, as an exception, from the fact that the closing line (238 perches) did not appear to be marked on the ground. But this had no real influence on the decision, for the river being out of the question as a boundary not called for at all, the closing line must necessarily be run from the corners standing 40 and 19 perches from the river, on the principle stated by Justice Thompson in Hunt <em>v. </em>McFarland, 2 Wright 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The governing principle of the rule before stated is found also in Walker <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Barr 43, and Thomas <em>v. </em>Mowrer, 3 Harris 139, qualifying the generality of the opinion in Martz <em>v. </em>Hartley, 4 Watts 262, and holding that where the lines of adjacent surveys are both found run and actually marked on the ground, they overcome the call for each other or even calls for a natural or other boundary. An old case strongly illustrating the principle is Mageehan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>v. </em>Adams, 2 Binney 109, where the survey and patent called for a black-oak on the state line, thence <em>by the </em>same, 130 perches to a post; yet evidence was received to show that the black-oak and line actually stood 30 perches from the line of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The result of the cases is, that when a return of survey calls for a stream as its boundary, or to run by, along, up or down it; the title will run to the stream, and the marking of trees on the bank or margin of the stream to identify the lines run to the river, as well as the return, of courses and distances measured along the margin, necessarily to ascertain the quantity of land in the survey, will not restrain the title to the bank or margin only. As was said in Klingensmith <em>v. </em>Ground, <em>supra, </em>a corner tree is not always to be had where it is wanted, and then the next most convenient must be taken; or as in Ball <em>v. </em>Stark, <em>supra, </em>a surveyor cannot run a curved line with compass; but if a creek is returned as the line there can be no mistake as to it, and the courses and distances along it are to be disregarded. See also Cox <em>v. </em>Freedley, 9 Casey 130. It is held also that public and private surveys are alike in this respect, and a private deed is judged of by the same rule: Cox <em>v. </em>Couch, 8 Barr 154; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Holler, 4 Wright 168. In navigable streams the title runs to ordinary low-water line, and in unnavigable to the middle of the stream. But if the stream is not made the boundary, or if a line is actually run and marked for the survey apart from the stream, the rule changes to suit the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Then to come to the case before us: Daniel Elliott\u2019s patent described the land as <em>\u201c </em>beginning at a corner hickory of Pittsburg Manor <em>standing on the bank of the Ohio </em>river; thence by said Manor line outward, then returning \u201c to a corner ironwood tree <em>standing on the bank of said Ohio river, thence up the same </em>233 perches to the first-mentioned hickory and place of beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">West Elliott\u2019s deeds to Wm. Price and to James O\u2019Hara, are in language precisely similar as to the river, excepting that a less quantity of land is embraced, with less river front. There can be no doubt that both the patent and the deeds extend the title to ordinary low-water mark of the river. The proviso in the deeds to Price and O\u2019Hara, we think, does not control the description in the deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Another question more difficult, \u2014 and new in Pennsylvania, so far as we can discover, \u2014 is as to what river frontage these deeds convey. The upper or Manor line runs to the river at right angles nearly, but the lower or Crawford line runs to the river very obliquely, meeting the Manor line by compass course on the shore, at about low-water mark. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The court below held that the lines running to the bank or margin of the river, instead of continuing in the same course by the compass, must run from their terminating points on the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>directly to the stream, at right angles to it; or in other words, each line on leaving the bank must run over the shore by the most direct and shortest route. The plaintiff in error argues that the lines should run by the same compass course to the stream, whether they cross each other before reaching the stream or diverge widely apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We have no precedents in this state to guide us, while foreign cases are not governed by the same principles which prevail here. We must decide this case upon'what we deem to be common understanding and usage, and the reason and convenience of the thing. As we have already seen, the practice of surveyors, in coming to a stream, is to stop upon its bank or margin, at the nearest convenient approach to the stream, and there to mark the corner indicating where the line strikes the stream. This is necessary to preserve the monuments of survey, as well as for convenience in making it. When the corner is set upon the high bank the stream may be one or many perches off, according to the character of the stream or its stage of water. In March or April a surveyor would probably find this river bank full, while in August or September he would find the water many perches away from the bank. The Allegheny and Ohio rivers at a low stage in many places fill less than one-half of their breadth between the banks. It is obvious, therefore, when the surveyor, running in toward the river, stops on its bank and makes his corner, he means, in the absence of other evidence found in his return, to indicate his nearest convenient approach to the stream, and thus to mark where his line strikes the stream, and the river front it gives to the owner of the survey. If he intended to continue his line by the compass course to the water\u2019s edge, we would expect to find something in his return to indicate this intent. The very fact that he. runs a line along the stream from the end of one line to the end of the other line, where it reaches the bank, is the evidence that he does not intend to continue his line to an apex on the shore, otherwise he would have returned no such intermediate line. Thus it is hardly supposable that he intended the oblique line to run to an apex on the shore with the Manor line, and to cut off the owner of the survey from all the river front in low water, and dispensing also with the intermediate line.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The serpentine course of the stream, or its relative distances from the bank at different points, can make no serious difference as to the line of approach to the water\u2019s edge. Starting from the bank, a direct course to the stream, or at right angles to the stream, must always afford the shortest and m\u2019ost certain boundary of river frontage. Of course the rule as now laid down applies only to a case where no other intention is disclosed by the return of survey, or the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In relation to the lease to Appal, it is sufficient to say that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>think that the recital of the land intended to be leased, and the provision that no reduction in the rent should be made for interference by parties in possession of the Crawford or Wood property, show an intention to include all the land to the river, and the course of the oblique line over the shore is evidently an error of the scrivener, which is corrected by the other'parts of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
