Ihmsen is to assume the debt owing to the firm of A. Arbogast &amp; Co., by his wife and daughter; on account of this debt he obligates himself to pay a certain note for five thousand dollars held by Thomas Baily, of Pittsburg; and should this amount be over what is owing by his wife and daughter, he is to have the difference refunded to him; and if, on the other hand, it falls short of the amount he is to make good the difference.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">On the 18th of June 1867 judgment was entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence county on Ihmsen\u2019s bond against Arbogast for $6000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">On the 28th of June 1867 a fieri facias, No. 17, to September term 1867, was issued on Ihmsen\u2019s judgment, under which Arbogast\u2019s property was sold on the 11th, 24th and 25th of July.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">On the 20th of July 1867 W.

They also alleged that there were material facts in dispute relating to the distribution of the proceeds of sale, and prayed for an issue to try those facts. There were five allegations of disputed facts; the court awarded an issue to try two, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-12\">1. Ihmsen\u2019s judgment was fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-13\">2. The bond was paid by investing it in the partnership, and entering judgment on it afterwards and proceeding upon it were fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-14\">The issue was between W. Cunningham &amp; Son, plaintiffs, and Charles T. Ihmsen, defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-15\">On the trial, February 16th 1869, before McGoffin, P. J., the facts above stated were given in evidence; also other facts for the purpose of proving fraud. The bond of Ihmsen had credits endorsed on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-16\">The plaintiff\u2019s points were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>1. The investment of the bond in question as capital stock in the firm of A. Arbogast &amp; Co., amounted to payment and release, and discharged Alexander Arbogast from the obligation thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">2. The bond having become the property of A. Arbogast &amp; Co., was extinguished, together with the warrant of attorney thereto attached, and the judgment subsequently entered thereon by virtue of said warrant was without authority and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">3. During the time said bond was held by A. Arbogast &amp; Co., the right of action thereon was suspended, and being thus suspended by the act of the parties, it could not again revive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">The defendant\u2019s points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\">1. The placing of the bond and warrant of attorney in the firm of A. Arbogast &amp; Co., as stipulated for in the articles of copartnership, would not operate as a legal payment or satisfaction of the same, but the bond and warrant of attorney, during the continuance of said copartnership, wmuld be good and valid at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-10\">2. The return of the bond and warrant of attorney to Ihmsen, according to the stipulations of the articles at the dissolution, would have the legal effect to render the same so returned in the hands of said Ihmsen as good and valid as before they had been placed as capital in the said copartnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-11\">3. The placing of the bond and warrant of attorney in the firm of A. Arbogast &amp; Co., stipulated for by the articles of copartnership, and their return to C. T. Ihmsen in pursuance of the agreement at dissolution, would render the bond and warrant good and valid in the hands of Ihmsen after their return, and no fraud having been proved, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-12\">The court answered the plaintiff\u2019s points as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">\u201c 1. Under the stipulations in the articles of partnership, and of the terms of the agreement made at the time of the dissolution of the firm in evidence before the jury, and in the absence of any proof as to the payment of the debt due on the bond by Alexander Arbogast in fact, we answer this point in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-14\">\u201c 2. The first branch of the point in the negative, there being no proof before the jury that the bond in fact had been paid. And to the latter part of the point we say to the jury, that if Alexander Arbogast, upon the dissolution of the firm, with the consent of Mr. Grloniger, his partner, redelivered or handed back the bond with warrant of attorney attached, intending it to be a valid, subsisting obligation, he, Ihmsen, as the holder thereof, could, for his protection in the collection of the amount which might still be due thereon, enter up judgment under the said warrant of attorney as a valid, subsisting authority so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-15\">\u201c 3. The right of an action at law upon the said bond by the firm of Alexander Arbogast &amp; Co., against Alexander Arbogast, one of the firm, might be considered as suspended during the existence of the firm, yet equity would keep it in force as a binding obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tion for the protection of the interest of Ihmsen and Gloniger, his partners, and for the creditors of the firm, if any there were. And if, upon the dissolution of the firm under the agreement of partnership, as well as the stipulations of the contract at the dissolution thereof, Alexander Arbogast, with the consent of his partner, delivered the bond in good faith as a debt still unpaid by him over to Charles T. Ihmsen, after credits were endorsed thereon, he, Ihmsen, could subsequently enter it upon record and proceed to its collection unless the proof satisfied the jury it was aotually paid, but kept on foot to hinder, delay, or to prevent the creditors of A. Arbogast from realizing their debts out of the property of said A. Arbogast.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">The court affirmed the defendant\u2019s points. The verdict was for the defendant, and the plaintiffs took a writ of error, assigning for error the answers to the points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\"><em>B. MeOoomhs, </em>for plaintiffs in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6kR\">The bond was merged in the articles of partnership: Lord Crompton <em>v. </em>Oxenden, 2 Ves.

It should have been raised on appeal from a decree of distribution, not by writ of error. Without fraud the bond was, by agreement of the partners, in the same condition as if a new bond had been given.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AMb\">The opinion of the court was delivered, January 3d 1870, by</p>\n<author id=\"AJU\">Thompson, C. J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">We must regard this as an issue ordered by the court to inform its conscience about some matter of distribution arising between the parties. But the records show that when the money was made, it belonged incontestably to the defendant, as between him and the plaintiffs; they had not even a judgment until after the levy and sale on his execution. It seems to us a novelty to grant an issue to try the validity of that judgment. The judgment was claiming nothing, it was the execution, and it had no competitor. There is a want of regularity and order about the whole proceeding which does not entitle the exception to much attention here. We shall therefore dismiss the case with this remark upon the assignments of error, that none of them are sustained. If Arbogast chose to redeliver his bond and warrant of attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to Ihmsen to be entered up or otherwise as he chose, the transaction being sound between them, no stranger could assail it on this ground. In so holding, the court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
