Isaac Wood by his will, proved April 9th 1852, devised part of his farm to Thomas and Elizabeth, adding: \u2014 \u201c If either of my children Thomas and Elizabeth, should depart this life without issue, his or her or their share or shares shall go to the other surviving brothers and sister, or as the case may be.\u201d On the 2d of October 1858, Thomas Wood and Elizabeth Wood executed and delivered to Edward Wood, the plaintiff, a deed for the land devised to them, for the consideration of $800, \u201c and also for the purpose of barring the estate tail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-14\">The deed was duly acknowledged by the grantors before a justice of the peace on the day of its date, and on the 27th of the same month, on motion of E. Sayers, Esq., in open court, \u201c was duly ordered to be entered among the records thereof in the manner commonly used with respect to sheriffs\u2019 deeds, in pursuance with the Acts of Assembly relating thereto, entitled an act to facilitate the barring of estates tail \u2014 which is accordingly so done in sheriff\u2019s deed book.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-15\">The land in dispute is part of the tract mentioned in the deed. The defendants are in possession under John Wood, one of the brothers of Thomas and Elizabeth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-16\">The plaintiff having closed his case, the defendants offered to prove \u201c the incapacity of the grantor to make a deed for any purpose, at the time this deed was executed, and before that date and since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-17\">\u201c The plaintiff objected to the evidence on the ground that no evidence can be received to show incapacity in making a deed to bar an estatetail.\u201d Th\u00e9 court (Gilmore, P. J.) admitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>evidence, <em>saying: </em>\u2014 \u201c <em>We </em>think it competent for the defeat of the deed barring the estate tail, to show either that Elizabeth was non compos mentis at the time the deed was made, or that being weak minded she was imposed upon.\u201d A bill of exceptions was sealed for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">A number of witnesses were examined as to the capacity of Elizabeth, and the jury rendered a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The plaintiff took out a writ of error and assigned for error the admission of the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>R.

As to the effect of a <em>valid </em>deed this is true, but that is not the question before us. The court received the evidence, to which exception was taken, to prove the incapacity of the grantor to make a deed; and the true question is whether the making of a deed stands on the same footing as the entering of judgment in a court of record. The reason why the infancy or insanity of a party who suffers a common recovery, cannot be set up against it, is, that it cannot be done without attacking the iudgment of the court, which to every intendment is presumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>be regular and valid, until reversed or set aside in due course of law. The judgment of the court is the solemn act of a competent legal tribunal, and cannot be impeached collaterally. It is presumed to have had legal and competent parties before it. But a deed is an instrument <em>in pais, </em>and must have proper parties able to contract and be contracted with. An essential element of this competency, is, that the party be of sane mind. Without this the writing is not his deed, and can be avoided under the plea of <em>non est factum. </em>The defect therefore lies behind the act of executing the writing; and the purpose of the evidence was not to deprive the instrument, as a <em>good </em>deed, of its statutory operation and effect, but was to show that it never had any legal existence whatever as a deed. There was no error therefore in receiving the evidence and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
