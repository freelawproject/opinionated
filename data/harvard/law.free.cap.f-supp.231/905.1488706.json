Messick, Inc., Extention-Explosives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its report and order the Commission granted the applicant Messick a permit to operate as a contract carrier by motor vehicle transporting \u201cexplosives, blasting agents, blasting materials and supplies; materials used in the manufacture of explosives; empty containers used in the transportation of any of the aforementioned items\u201d under contract with the Hercules Powder Company (hereinafter Hercules) between its plants near Carthage, Mo., McAdory, Ala., and Kenvil, N. J., on the one hand and, on the other, points in numerous states surrounding each plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">L- For the purpose of this opinion it is unnecessary to review the proceedings before the Commission antecedent and subsequent to the issuance of its report of July 8, 1963, since it is conceded that plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">In addition to other services characterized by the Commission as \u201cdistinctive and highly specialized\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under its contract with Hercules Messick would allow its trailers to be retained up to fourteen days, without additional charge, for the purpose of storing nitro carbo nitrate (hereinafter NCN).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">After reviewing the legislative history of the 1957 amendments, the Supreme Court in I.C.C. v. J-T Transport Co., 368 U.S. 81, 87, 88, 82 S.Ct. 204, 208, 209, 7 L.Ed.2d 147 concluded that their direct effect was to change the result of its decisions in United States v. Contract Steel Carriers, 350 U.S. 409, 76 S.Ct. 461, 100 L.Ed. 482. Thus it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-12\">\u201cSection 203(a) (15), however, was amended, so far as material here, by adding to the description of the term \u2018contract carrier by motor vehicle\u2019 one who furnishes \u2018transportation services designed to meet the distinct need of each individual customer.\u2019 And \u00a7 209(b) was amended by adding a sentence which sets forth five factors the Commission shall consider in determining whether the permit should issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether issuance of a permit will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy declared in this Act, the Commission shall consider (1) the number of shippers to be served by the applicant, (2) the nature of the service proposed, (3) the effect which granting the permit would have upon the services of the protesting carriers and (4) the effect which denying the permit would have upon the applicant and/or its shipper and (5) the changing character of that shipper\u2019s requirements.\u2019 (Numerals added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">The precise holding of the Court in J-T Transport is that, in its opinion and order under review, the Commission indulged an impermissible presumption that existing service must be found to -be reasonably adequate until proven inadequate by the applicant and its supporting shipper. The Court concluded that the burden of proof was misplaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>and that the existing carrier must prove affirmatively the adequacy of its service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">On other occasions this Court has been impressed with the awareness of a heavily burdened Commission that it is a clearly defined national transportation policy <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which it is engaged in enforcing. In the language of the Court in J-T Transport:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">\u201cHad the Commission, having drawn out and crystallized these competing interests, [the situation of protesting carriers and the situation of supporting shippers], attempted to judge them with as much delicacy as the prospective nature of the inquiry permits, we should have been cautious about disturbing its conclusion.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">But a careful review of the record in this case has convinced us that the Commission, in discussing the five criteria which the Congress directed it to consider and in its application of them to the facts found by the examiner and adopted by the Commission, erroneously assumed that these criteria might be treated as though they were factors in an algebraic equation which might be solved mechanically.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">We recognize that the Commission ex- \u2022 plicitly stated: \u201cHaving evaluated the pertinent evidence of record in the light of the criteria enumerated in section 209(b), we are satisfied that the weighing of all five factors warrants, on balance, a finding that issuance of a permit,, authorizing operations to the extent hereinafter indicated, will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">But we are persuaded by a careful reading of its opinion and the entire record which it was considering that it attached equal weight to each criterion, thereby employing a standard which, under the circumstances of this case, was not a proper one.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">Having arrived at the opinion that these proceedings must be remanded to the Commission for further consideration of the present record, supplemented in any manner which it regards appropriate, we deem it prudent to comment by way of caveats on two issues mightily belabored by all parties in briefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>and oral arguments before us. The first concerns the express finding of the Commission that: \u201cAlthough trailer retention is a service auxiliary to over-the-road movements, it is clearly a transportation service within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While we are not disposed at this time to decide that such finding or conclusion either was, or was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, we are constrained to suggest that the Commission should take another look at the facts in the light of National Trailer Convoy, Inc. v. United States, 227 F.Supp. 730 (N.D.Okl.1964). That Court concluded, and we agree, \u201cthat before the Commission may give weight to the shippers\u2019 distinct needs it must first determine that those needs pertain to a transportation service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The Court there had before it the report and order of the Commission entered in its Docket No. M.C.-124190, Griffin Mobile Home Transporting Co., Contract Carrier Application,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which was urged upon this court in oral arguments in behalf of defendants as supporting their position in this case. While the Commission there did not explicitly find that the services in question, sometimes characterized as \u201caccessorial,\u201d \u201cancillary,\u201d \u201cadditional,\u201d and \u201cpersonalized\u201d, were transportation services within the meaning of the Act, it was apparently more preoccupied with the distinct needs of the shippers, and made no attempt to draw a distinction between their transportation and nontransportation needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The undisputed fact that Hercules has demonstrated a distinct need for trailer retention up to fourteen days at the jobsite or magazine, without additional charge, for the purpose of storing NCN merely frames the question as to whether such service is tailored to meet its transportation needs, on the one hand, or its sales needs on the other. We agree with the opinion of the Court in National Trailer Convoy, supra, that: \u201cActivities pertaining to sale are beyond the scope of transportation.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-17\">Both Baggett and Whitten hold certificates authorizing them to transport \u201cexplosives and blasting supplies.\u201d They complain that the interpretation placed by the Commission in its conclusion that \u201c * * * nitro carbo nitrate may not be transported under authority to transport blasting supplies and explosives\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was capricious or arbitrary, that it constituted an abuse of discretion, or that it did violence to some established principle of law. Twice before we have had occasion to enunciate our understanding of the rule on judicial review of a Commission certificate interpretation. Floyd &amp; Beasley Transfer Co. v. United States, 185 F.Supp. 390 (N.D.Ala.1960), and Malone Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, 107 F.Supp. 946 (N.D.Ala.1952), aff\u2019d, 344 U.S. 925, 73 S.Ct. 497, 97 L.Ed. 712.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">While we are presently unwilling to disagree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of a certificate of its own creation, we note that the record in this area is so confusing that the Commission apparently felt compelled to resort to artificial semantics and to reason by inapposite analogies. NCN, by definition an oxidizing agent,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> accounts for approximately one-half of the total volume of sales of explosives and blasting agents in the United States. The Commission concluded that it is a \u201cblasting material\u201d; the examiner found that it was both a \u201cblasting supply\u201d and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>\u201cblasting material\u201d ; Hercules advertises it as, and considers it to be, a \u201cblasting agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">It would seem that the Commission\u2019s task would be lightened if the parties hereto would supplement the present record by evidence relating to the functional use of NCN and the construction which other shippers and carriers have historically placed upon the term \u201cblasting supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">We conclude that' the order of the \u25a0Commission is due to be set aside and the case remanded for further action by the Commission in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-28\">.
