The plaintiffs seek to enjoin the reading of five verses of the Holy Bible and the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in unison by the pupils in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>public schools of Delaware on every school day. The defendants assert numerous defenses. We will discuss only those which we deem to merit consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Having in mind the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963), in Murray v. Curlett, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, and in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962), and regarding these principles in the light of Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962), and Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 353-354, 82 S.Ct. 805, 7 L.Ed.2d 762, we issued a rule upon the parties to show cause why this three-judge court, constituted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284, 28 U.S.C., should not be dissolved and the case remitted to a single Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for adjudication. The parties have responded to this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The statutes attacked are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"agg-dedup-0\">\u00a7 4101. Religious service or exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\u201cNo religious service or exercise, except the reading of the Bible and the repeating of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, shall be held in any school receiving any portion of the moneys appropriated for the support of public schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">\u00a7 4102. Reading of the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">\u201cIn each public school classroom in the State, and in the presence of the scholars therein assembled, at least five verses from the Holy Bible shall be read at the opening of such school, upon each school day, by the teacher in charge thereof. Whenever there is a general assemblage of school classes at the opening of such school day, then instead of such classroom reading, the principal or teacher in charge of such assemblage shall read at least five verses from the Holy Bible in the presence of the assembled scholars as directed in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aip-dedup-0\">\u00a7 4103. Penalties for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 4101 and 4102.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">\u201cAny teacher or principal who fails to comply with the provisions of sections 4101 and 4102 of this title shall be subject to a penalty of $25 for the first violation, and, for a second violation, his or her certificate shall be revoked by the proper authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The adult plaintiffs are the. parents and natural guardians of the minor plaintiffs, their children, who attend, a public school in Delaware. The plaintiffs ar\u00e9 citizens of and reside in Delaware. Delaware has a compulsory education law which, with certain exceptions-not pertinent here, requires children to-remain in attendance in public schools-during regular school hours. 14 Del.C. \u00a7 2702. The defendants are members of' the State Board of Education and of local school boards. Jurisdiction is conferred\" upon this court by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, substantial issues involving the violation of' federal constitutional rights being involved. The adult plaintiffs as well as the-infant plaintiffs have the standing to-maintain the suit at bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">The State Board of Education is vested with the supervision of the public-schools and of the educational interests of the State of Delaware by 14 Del.C. \u00a7 101. Despite the decisions of the Supreme Court in Abington School District. v. Schempp, and in Murray v. Curlett, supra, the Attorney General of Delaware by an opinion letter dated August 12,. 1963 addressed to Dr. George R. Miller, Secretary of the State Board of Education of Delaware, made clear his view-that the statutes quoted above, viz., \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4103, 14 Del.C., required the reading of the Bible and the repeating of\" the Lord\u2019s Prayer as stated in the public-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>schools of Delaware. On August 19, 1963, acting upon this ruling of the Attorney General, Dr. Miller directed the \u201cSchool Administrators\u201d and the \u201cTeachers\u201d of the public schools of the State of Delaware \u201cto continue the reading of the Bible and the reciting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in accordance with 14 Delaware \u25a0Code, Chapter 41, \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4103 beginning with the opening of the school year, September 1963.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The plaintiffs object to the reading \u2022of five verses of the King James version \u25a0of the Bible and the reciting in unison of the Lord\u2019s Prayer by the pupils. This practice has been carried on for many years in the public schools of Delaware .and has continued throughout the school year in 1963-1964. We find that the practice may reasonably be expected to \u2022continue and will continue throughout the school year commencing in September 1964 and thereafter unless enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">It can be contended that it appears from the face of the statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4103, and therefore from the pleading, that the practice of reading the Bible and reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer referred to in \u00a7\u00a7 4102 and 4103 is a religious service or exercise because \u00a7 4101 so describes them. The three sections are part of the Delaware Code of 1953, being the first three sections of Chapter 41, \u25a0\u201cGeneral Regulatory Provisions\u201d, relating to \u201cEducation.\u201d The Delaware Code \u25a0of 1953 is substantive law and not a mere recodification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each of the three sections was intended to have and does have its individual effect and vitality but to arrive at the legal fact that the three sections must be read together and that each may and must be employed to \u25a0explain and to integrate the others requires judicial interpretation and construction. We now hold that each of the three sections, 4101-4103, must be so interpreted and construed, and must be \u2022considered for the purposes of this case as part of one integrated whole. To this must be added one relevant operative fact as found immediately hereinafter. We have already found that the practice of reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the public schools of Delaware is one of many years standing and we entertain no doubt and we take judicial notice of and find it to be the fact that the General Assembly of Delaware had this circumstance in mind when it enacted \u00a7\u00a7 4101 and 4103 as well as \u00a7 4102. We refer again to the directive of the State Board of Education. It follows that the \u201creligious service or exercise\u201d referred to in \u00a7 4101 is the reading of the Bible as prescribed by \u00a7 4102 and the penalties prescribed by \u00a7 4103 are for failure to read the Bible as required by \u00a7 4102 or to permit any other devotional or religious exercise than that of repeating the Lord\u2019s Prayer in accordance with the long established Delaware practice. Because the foregoing interpretation is required we conclude that it cannot be justly said that the unconstitutionality of the attacked statutes appears from the statutes themselves or from the pleading. Contrast Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962), and Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 353-354, 82 S.Ct. 805. See Clemmons v. Congress of Racial Equality, 201 F.Supp. 737, 745-746 (D.C.La.1962); Patterson v. Hardin, 145 F.Supp. 299 (D.C.Ind.1956). See in particular, Ex parte Collins, 277 U.S. 565, 48 S.Ct. 585, 72 L.Ed. 990 (1928); and Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 61 S.Ct. 480, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">There is, however, another point involved and the defendants have raised it. We have said that despite the necessity of reading the three statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4101\u2014 4103, in the light of each other and as an integrated whole, that nonetheless each of the three statutes possesses individual eifeet and vitality. This is peculiarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>true of \u00a7 4102 which can stand by itself and can and does have a mandatory effect without reference to \u00a7\u00a7 4101 or 4103. So regarding \u00a7 4102, the defendants take the position, as we understand their contention, that the reading of the Bible and the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer as carried on in the public schools of Delaware are not religious services or exercises but are of a cultural, educational and moral nature. Here again a fact finding is required. The defendants\u2019 contention is based in part at least, we believe, on language employed in the Schempp case, 374 U.S. at 223, 83 S.Ct. at 1572. That language is as follows: \u201cApplying the Establishment Clause principles to the cases at bar we find that the States are requiring the selection and reading at the opening of the school day of verses from the Holy Bible and the recitation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer by the students in unison. These exercises are prescribed as part of the curricular activities of students who are required by law to attend school. They are held in the school buildings under the supervision and with the participation of teachers employed in those schools. None of these factors, other than compulsory school attendance, was present in the program upheld in Zorach v. Clauson [343 U.S. 306, 72 S.Ct. 679, 96 L.Ed. 954]. The trial court in No. 142 [Schempp] has found that such an opening exercise is a religious ceremony and was intended by the State to be so. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding as to the religious character of the exercises. <em>Given that finding, the exercises and the law requiring them are in violation of the Establishment Clause.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The provisions of the statute in the Schempp case are substantially identical with those of \u00a7 4102, disregarding the latter\u2019s compulsory attendance provision, and the Supreme Court in Schempp pointed to the finding of fact made by the trial court that the Bible was read not as a educational and cultural study, a sectarian pursuit, but as a religious service or exercise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The teachers who testified in this court made it clear that both teachers and pupils assumed a reverential attitude when the reading of the Bible took place and that they continued the same reverential attitude when the Lord\u2019s Prayer was recited in unison. We cannot and do not entertain the slightest doubt, in view of the manner in which the Bible was read and the Lord\u2019s Prayer was recited in the public schools of Delaware, including that attended by the infant plaintiffs, that these daily proceedings were devotional and religious in nature. The demeanor of certain teachers on the witness stand in this court made it obvious that they regarded the reading of the Bible and the reciting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer as a religious exercise or service carried on by them and their pupils in a devout and reverent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>The Bible has to be read on every school day under \u00a7 4102. If the Bible is not read any teacher or principal of any public school in Delaware charged with the duty of seeing to it that the Bible is read is liable to the penalties prescribed by \u00a7 4103. Accordingly we hold that the reading of five verses of the Bible was required by \u00a7 4102, and that the practice thus compelled by the State of Delaware was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in the light of the Schempp and Murray decisions supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Section 4101 presents a different and more difficult problem. We point out that if the excepting clause, viz., \u201c, except the reading of the Bible and the repeating of the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d be stripped from \u00a7 4101 there would be doubt as to whether or not the statute would be constitutional. See Schempp, supra, 374 U.S. at p. 225, 83 S.Ct. at p. 1573 where it was said: \u201cIt is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a \u2018religion of secularism\u201d is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a \u2018religion of secularism\u2019 in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus \u2018preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.\u2019 \u201d But it is clear that \u00a7 4101 as written gives legislative sanction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> both to the reading of the Bible and to the reciting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer and even if the excepting clause were obliterated that which would remain obviously would be contrary to the intent of the General Assembly of Delaware for the statute would then read that no religious service or exercise should be held in any school receiving any portion of the moneys appropriated for the support of public schools and would fly in the teeth of \u00a7\u00a7 4102 and 4103. No severability of the excepting clause \u00a7 4101 is possible under the circumstances. Cf. \u00a7 308, 1 Del.C. Section 4101, 14 Del.C., puts the imprimatur of the State of Delaware on practices in the public schools of Delaware that the Supreme Court has declared impermissible under the Establishment Clause. Therefore, the statute falls within the proscription of Schempp, Murray, and of Engel v. Vitale, supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">The issue of the constitutionality of \u00a7 4103 need not detain us long. Section 4103, as we have seen, prescribes penalties for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 4101 and 4102. Insofar as \u00a7 4103 relates to \u00a7 4102, it is so clear as to require neither argument nor discussion to demonstrate that \u00a7 4103 imposes sanctions on the school superintendent, principal or teacher on whom the duty is imposed to see that the Bible is read as required by \u00a7 4102, if he or she fails in that duty. But it seems to be contended by the defendants that no statute of Delaware requires the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer and that therefore that portion of \u00a7 4103 which relates to that part of \u00a7 4101 which sanctions, as we have put it, the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer is without legal effect and therefore should not and cannot be declared to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">We conclude that the defendants\u2019 position cannot be maintained for a number of reasons. First, it is not asserted by the defendants that \u00a7 4103 is severable as to its prayer-saying and Bible-reading provisions. Even if the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>had been raised and argued by the defendants we could not accept it as valid in view of the words and phrases employed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly saw fit to employ the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d to join \u00a7\u00a7 4101 and 4102 together in a single undifferentiated clause in \u00a7 4103. The Bible-reading provisions (\u00a7 4102) and those relating both to Bible reading and to the reciting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer (\u00a7 4101) are put at parity in \u00a7 4103. Each provision is equally important in \u00a7 4103. Neither should be separated from the other insofar as legal effect is concerned. To do so would, we think, set at naught the clear intention of the General Assembly. We conclude that \u00a7 308, 1 Del.C., cannot be fairly said to support severability of the provisions of \u00a7 4103 ^ referred to. It follows, therefore, that since \u00a7 4103 is not severable and one portion, that relating to the reading of the Bible, is unquestionably unconstitutional, the whole statute must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"asj-dedup-0\">But even if our conclusion as to the inseverability of the provisions of \u00a7 4103 be erroneous, though we are of the contrary view, nonetheless, as we have already held, the provisions of \u00a7 4101, those relating to the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer as well as those pertaining to reading the Bible, constitute a sanetion and this has been proscribed by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. It follows that since \u00a7 4103 gives sanction to the practice of reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, sanctioned also by \u00a7 4101, \u00a7 4103 falls within the proscription of the Establishment Clause. Therefore, that portion of \u00a7 4103 relating to the Lord\u2019s Prayer, whether severable or not from the rest of the section, must also be deemed to be unconstitutional. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"A-S\">Since the statutes specifically attacked, viz., \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4103, 14 Del.C., require interpretation and construction as we have indicated, and a finding of fact based on judicial notice must be made in respect to all three statutes, as well as a finding of fact in respect to \u00a7 4102 respecting the religious or devotional character of Bible reading carried on as in the public schools of Delaware, before the rulings of the Supreme Court, in Schempp, Murray, and Engel v. Vitale can be brought to bear squarely on-the three statutes, it is clear that the-lack of constitutionality does not appear from the face of the statutes or the-pleading and that, therefore, this three-judge tribunal possessed and possesses; the jurisdiction, the power, to adjudicate the questions of constitutionality presented insofar as the three statutes are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-0\">It will be borne in mind that. the plaintiffs seek to enjoin not only the reading of the Bible but also the-recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in unison by the pupils and that although they have attacked the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 4101\u2014 4103, they have not attacked the constitufaonality of \u00a7 101, 14 Del.C. In fact, the-plaintiffs could scarcely do so for it was-unquestionably constitutional and proper for the General Assembly of Delaware to-confer on State Board of Education-the supervision of public schools and of the educational interests of Delaware as-Inscribed by \u00a7 101. Nonetheless, the-Pontiffs seek to enjoin as unconstitutlonal not only the readmg of tbe Biblebute also the reciting of the Lord s Prayer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear that the practice of re-\u00abting the Lord s Prayer m unison as re-fiuired by the opinion letter of the Attorney General of Delaware and by the dlrectlve of the State Board of Educatl0n\u2019 authorized, as we have said, by \u00a7- 101\u2019 constitutes an establishment of rellglon ^ stete of\u00edicers and state ena' Ployees m vlolatlon of the First Amendment 111 the ^ ?f the Schempp and Murray cases. This three-judge court, constituted pursuant to \u00a7 2281, Title 28 U.S.C., so holds and is entitled to do so, even though no statute of Delaware com-pels the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, \u00a7 101 merely conferring authority on the State Board of Education to enact its directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>We state that it is well established law that if there is a clear case ior the convening of a three-judge court, the case can be disposed of \u201con any ground\u201d whether or not it would have .justified the calling of a three-judge \u2022court. See United States v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 371 U.S. 285, 287-288, 83 S.Ct. 397, 9 L.Ed.2d 317 (1963). It follows logically that if jurisdiction inheres in a three-judge case on the face \u2022of the pleading any and all cognizable issues in the case whether or not federal in nature or whether or not any of them \u2022when tried would support the jurisdiction of a three-judge court, can and \u2022should be adjudicated by the three-judge 'tribunal. This was stated succinctly in R. R. Comm\u2019n v. Pacific Gas Co., 302 U.S. 388, 391, 58 S.Ct. 334, 337, 82 L.Ed. 319 (1938), where the Supreme Court said: \u201cBecause of the federal question \u25a0raised by the bill of complaint, the District Court had jurisdiction to determine -all the questions in the case, local as well as federal.\u201d The decision from which we have just quoted was cited with approval in United States v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra. See the additional authorities cited in R. R. Comm\u2019n v. Pacific Gas Co., supra, at p. 391, 58 S.Ct. 334. We hold, therefore, that since this three-judge court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy respecting the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 4101-4103, it also has the power to \u2022decide the constitutionality of the practice required by the directive of the State Board of Education respecting the recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the public schools of Delaware, whether or not that practice be sanctioned by the Delaware statutes last referred to or any of them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Other issues raised by the parties have been considered carefully.

These interests surely suffice to give the parties standing to complain.\u201d See also in the same case the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan at p. 266, n. 30, 83 S.Ct. 1560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">.

See the enabling Act, entitled \u201cAn Act to revise, recodify, arrange and consolidate into a code the public and general statutes of the State of Delaware.\u201d Section 1 provides: \u201cThe Delaware Code of 1953 as hereinafter set forth is hereby adopted and enacted into law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b904-4\">. See also the Schempp decision, 374 U.S., at p. 225, 83 S.Ct. at p. 1573, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">\u201cIt is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a \u2018religion of secularism\u2019 is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a \u2018religion of secularism\u2019 in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus \u2018preferring 'those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.\u2019 Zorach v. Clauson, supra, 343 U.S., at 314 [72 S.Ct., at 684, 96 L.Ed. 954], We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one\u2019s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall <em>into </em>those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\">.

To sanction can mean and we use the phrase liere to mean \u201cto give approval to, to give countenance to.\u201d See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 3rd edition.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">We refer the reader again to the very brief history of repeating or of reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the public schools of Delaware at an earlier point in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. It is quite obvious that the Delaware statutes under attack are also unconstitutional because they serve to prefer one religion, i. e., the Christian religion, over any other. The Bible is a Christian document. The Lord\u2019s Prayer is contained in the New Testament of the King James version of the Bible, used in the public schools of Delaware. See St. Matthew, 6; 9-13; St. Luke, 11; 2-4. The practices complained of, therefore, aid and prefer the Christian religion. See Schempp v. School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania, 177 F.Supp. 398, 405 (D.C.E.D.Pa.1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AcE\">.
