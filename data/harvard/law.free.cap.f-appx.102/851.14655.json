He argues that the district court plainly erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), when that same offense is punishable only as a misdemeanor under federal law. This issue, however, is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1021, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, Gonzales-Velasquez has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise, on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">For the first time on appeal, Gonzales-Velasquez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Gonzales-Velasquez acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he wishes to preserve the issues for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Accordingly, Gonzales-Velasquez\u2019s arguments are foreclosed, and his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
