Riccio appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants in Riccio\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>alleging wrongful termination in violation of Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\u201412213 (2000). To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory firing under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the job in question; and (3) he was discharged because of his disability. <em>Baird v. Rose, </em>192 F.3d 462, 467-70 (4th Cir.1999). We agree with the district court that Riccio failed to establish that he was \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d for the position from which he was terminated. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (defining \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d); <em>Myers v. Hose, </em>50 F.3d 278, 281-82 (4th Cir.1995) (applying two-prong analysis for determining whether a person is \u201can otherwise qualified individual\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
