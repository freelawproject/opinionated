Turner, Texas prisoner # 498120, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) and certification that his appeal would not be -taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Turner argues that the district court mischaracterized his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as challenging his disciplinary hearing and that he alleged facts sufficient to support his claims of deliberate indifference and verbal abuse by prison employees. Turner has abandoned any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>argument he had concerning his disciplinary proceeding. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The district court dismissed Turner\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Turner has failed to raise a nonfrivolous issue for appeal with respect to the dismissal of his deliberate indifference and verbal abuse claims. <em>See Bender v. Brumley, </em>1 F.3d 271, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Turner\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of this lawsuit as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). In <em>Turner v. State of Texas Board of Pardons, </em>92 Fed. Appx. 98, No. 03-51260, Turner was notified that he had accumulated two strikes. Turner has therefore accumulated four strikes, and he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal brought in a United States court unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
