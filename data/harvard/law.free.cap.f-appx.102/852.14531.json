This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of an inmate\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Richardson v. Spurlock, </em>260 F.3d 495, 499 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">Castro admits that he did not file a Step 2 grievance before he filed his civil rights complaint. Castro asserts that he did not file a Step 2 grievance because he was unaware of the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) and because the Interoffice Communication from the Internal Affairs Division (\u201cIAD\u201d) was a decision from the highest authority in the grievance system, and, as a result, Castro was not required to file a Step 2 grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>First, ignorance of the law will not reheve Castro of his obligation to exhaust the available administrative remedies. <em>See Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 712-14 (5th Cir.1999). Second, the administrative decision to the Step 1 grievance informed Castro that his complaint was mandatorily referred to the IAD and that if he was \u201cdissatisfied with the Step 1 response, [he] may submit a Step 2 (1-128) to the Unit Grievance Investigator within 15 days from the Step 1 response.\u201d There was no indication on the Step 1 administrative decision that Castro should not appeal, did not have the right to appeal, or should wait for IAD\u2019s response to appeal. Castro has not shown that the district court erred in its ruling. <em>See also Crain v. Prasifka, </em>97 S.W.3d 867, 870 (Tex.App.2003) (Step 2 grievance still mandatory even though Step 1 grievance forwarded to the IAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
