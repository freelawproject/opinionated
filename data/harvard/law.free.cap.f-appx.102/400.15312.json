Although the basic outline of Flores\u2019s story of how he obtained the truck that was used to deliver 5.58 kilograms of marijuana appears believable, his answers to some of the district court\u2019s specific questions about this matter suggests that he was not being entirely forthcoming about his role in the offense. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Flores\u2019s testimony about his role in the offense was not fully credible or \u201ctruthful.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) (Nov.2002); <em>United States v. Ridgeway, </em>321 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">For the first time on appeal, Flores maintains that the sentencing scheme of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Flores concedes, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). Flores raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
