Johnson could show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>excusable neglect with regard to his untimely notice of appeal. Because Johnson did not make a showing of excusable neglect, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 1, 2003. Johnson\u2019s notice of appeal was executed on August 21, 2003. On limited remand to the district court for a determination of excusable neglect, Johnson filed a motion to withdraw and indicated he no longer wished to pursue his appeal. This does not constitute a showing a excusable neglect. Because Johnson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny Johnson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
