California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but suggesting that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Collins. Although informed of his right to do so, Collins has not filed a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-25\">We review a district court\u2019s order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 438, 442-43 (4th Cir.1995). Moreover, because Collins\u2019 sentence does not exceed the maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000), we review the sentence to determine only whether it is plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). Upon review of the record, we conclude that Collins\u2019 twenty-one-month sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-26\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>affirm Collins\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
