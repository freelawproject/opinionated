Ramirez, an employee of the United States Army between 1988 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>1990, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d), in Ramirez\u2019s \u201cpetition for review\u201d challenging the administrative decision to suspend his workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The OWCP Director has argued that the federal courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b), which states that \u201c[t]he action of the Secretary [of the Department of Labor] or his designee in allowing or denying payment under this subchapter is\u2014... (B) not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.\u201d Although 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b) bars Ramirez\u2019s action insofar as he challenges the administrative decision to deny him FECA benefits, the statute does not prohibit review of \u201csubstantial\u201d of \u201ccognizable\u201d constitutional claims. <em>See Benton v. United States, </em>960 F.2d 19, 22 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Duncan v. Department of Labor, </em>313 F.3d 445, 446 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Czerkies v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>73 F.3d 1435, 1441 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Ramirez had been paid FECA benefits since the early 1990s. In July 1999, Ramirez was directed by the OWCP to appear for two second-opinion medical appointments. He failed to do so. After Ramirez failed to provide written reasons for such failure, the OWCP suspended his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Even if it is assumed <em>arguendo </em>that Ramirez\u2019s \u201cpetition for review\u201d was sufficient to establish a \u201ccognizable\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d due-process claim, the documentary evidence submitted by the parties in connection with the OWCP Director\u2019s summary-judgment motion is sufficient to show that no genuine issue of material fact remains as to such claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). It is true that the record shows that, in January 2001, during Ramirez\u2019s administrative appeals, the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board castigated the OWCP for failing to reconstruct and properly assemble Ramirez\u2019s case record. The Appeals Board\u2019s decision remanding the case to the OWCP for reconstruction of the record was intended to protect Ramirez\u2019s administrative appeal rights and effectively corrected any due-process violation that might have occurred. The record otherwise shows that Ramirez was repeatedly warned of the consequences of failing to appear for medical appointments, that he was repeatedly informed of the procedures for challenging the OWCP\u2019s position that he was required to appear at those appointments, and that his administrative challenges to the suspension of FECA benefits were repeatedly reviewed. Ramirez has not established a due-process violation. <em>See FDIC v. Bank of Coushatta, </em>930 F.2d 1122, 1130 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
