Connelly argues that the district court erred in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he was responsible for over 20 grams of methamphetamine, as the testimony upon which this finding was based was not sufficiently reliable. The testimony upon which the district court relied for sentencing did possess \u201csufficient indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>See United States v.
