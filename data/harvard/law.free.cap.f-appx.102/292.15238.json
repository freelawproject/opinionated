Pridgen appeal their convictions and sentences for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty kilograms or more of marijuana, and less than 100 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Vander Gore argues an undercover informant\u2019s credibility was improperly bolstered when the district court permitted testimony that the informant had participated in numerous other drug buys. Because Vander Gore did not object to the admission of this evidence at trial, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>303 F.3d 539, 543 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n appellate court may correct an error not brought to the attention of the trial court if (1) there is an error (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three of these conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1138, 123 S.Ct. 929, 154 L.Ed.2d 832 (2003). In light of the overwhelming evidence against Vander Gore, we conclude the admission of this testimony did not seriously affect the fairness of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Vander Gore also argues that the testimony of several witnesses was bolstered when they were allowed to testify that they had received downward departures for their substantial assistance to the government. Because Vander Gore did not object to this testimony at trial, we also review this issue for plain error. <em>Carr, </em>303 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Government may introduce a witness\u2019s plea agreement during direct examination if: \u201c(1) the prosecutor\u2019s questions do not imply that the government has special knowledge of the witness\u2019s veracity; (2) the trial judge instructs the jury on the caution required in evaluating the witness\u2019s testimony; and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument contains no improper use of the witness\u2019s promise of truthful cooperation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 369 (4th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>717 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1983)). Because we conclude the Government did not make improper use of this testimony and the district court gave a limiting instruction, we affirm Vander Gore\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Johnny Gore argues it was plain error for the Government to inform the jury that three co-defendants had pled guilty and to mention the convictions of other family members. Evidence of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea should not be put before the jury. <em>United States v. Blevins, </em>960 F.2d 1252, 1260 (4th Cir. 1992). The test for reversible prosecutorial misconduct generally has two components: that (1) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks or conduct must in fact have been improper and (2) such remarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The factors to consider when evaluating the issue of prejudice to the defendant are (1) the degree to which the prosecutor\u2019s remarks have a tendency to mislead the jury; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) absent the remarks, the strength of competent proof introduced to establish the guilt of the accused; and (4) whether the comments were deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters. <em>Id. </em>at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The Government concedes its comments were improper. However, because Johnny Gore admitted he had been involved in the conspiracy and the crux of his case centered on whether he had adequately withdrawn from the conspiracy, we conclude the Government\u2019s statements were not so prejudicial that they deprived Johnny Gore of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Johnny Gore also argues the Government improperly vouched for and bolstered the credibility of several witnesses. Because Johnny Gore did not object to the Government\u2019s statements during trial, we review for plain error. <em>Carr, </em>303 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">A prosecutor may neither vouch for nor bolster the testimony of a witness in its arguments to the jury. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1997). Vouching occurs when the prosecutor indicates a personal belief in the credibility of a witness. A prosecutor may not make explicit personal assurances that a witness is trustworthy. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>10 F.3d 1086, 1089 (4th Cir.1993). Bolstering is an implication by the Government that the testimony of a witness is corroborated by evidence that the Government knows, but that the jury does not know. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">If improper vouching or bolstering has occurred, we then consider (1) the degree to which the comments could have misled the jury; (2) whether the comments were isolated or extensive; (3) the strength of proof of guilt absent the inappropriate comments; and (4) whether the comments were deliberately made to divert the jury\u2019s attention. <em>Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d at 198. However, because we conclude the Government did not commit any improper vouching or bolstering, we affirm Johnny Gore\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Pridgen argues he was denied a fair trial because it was obvious to the jury that the district court was biased against him and his attorney. A judge\u2019s participation during trial should never reach the point that it appears clear to the jury that the judge believes the accused is guilty, or becomes so pervasive in his interruptions and interrogations that he may appear to usurp the role of either prosecutor or defense counsel. <em>United States v. Godwin, </em>272 F.3d 659, 677 (4th Cir.2001). \u201c[Jjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.... [They] can only in the rarest circumstances evidence the degree of favoritism or antagonism required [to make fair judgment impossible] ... when no extrajudicial source is involved.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">We conclude the district court\u2019s comments about which Pridgen complains are insufficient to show any deep-seated or unequivocal antagonism that rendered a fair judgment for Pridgen impossible. We therefore affirm Pridgen\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Vander Gore\u2019s, Johnny Gore\u2019s, and Pridgen\u2019s convictions and sentences. We also deny Johnny Gore\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
