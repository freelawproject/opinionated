We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We find the Board\u2019s decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s discretionary decision that Khatib was not eligible for asylum was not manifestly contrary to the law or an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(D)(2000). We further find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s findings. We do not find the evidence so compelling that it warrants a different conclusion. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Finally, we find no error in the Board\u2019s summary affirmance. <em>See In re Burbano, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
