Metro has moved for expedited consideration of this appeal and waived oral argument. We grant Metro\u2019s motion to expedite and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is proper when there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The parties agreed before the district court and on appeal that there are no material facts in dispute. We have considered the thorough opinion of the district court, the briefs of the parties, and the record. Our review leaves us convinced that the district court correctly analyzed the cross motions for summary judgment and concluded that the SBA\u2019s actions were neither arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Metro Mach. Corp. v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>305 F.Supp.2d 614 (E.D.Va. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
