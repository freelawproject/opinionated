We reverse and remand with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of Dishong.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">A. <em>The Prior Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">This case has been before this court once before, also on interlocutory appeal from an order denying summary judgment. <em>See Martin v. Dishong (Dishong I), </em>57 Fed. Appx. 153 (4th Cir.2003) (per curiam). As we explained in the prior appeal, this case concerns the shooting death of Matthew Martin by Dishong, a deputy sheriff in Georgetown County, South Carolina. <em>See id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In <em>Dishong I, </em>we explained the relevant facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">Before the shooting, a deputy sheriff [other than Dishong] ... observed Martin in a place that made her suspect he was planning to dump trash illegally. When she approached to investigate, Martin fled in his truck. A second deputy saw Martin about fifteen minutes later and began pursuing him. This vehicle chase culminated at an intersection where Dishong and another deputy had set up a roadblock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">The deputies assert that when Martin reached the roadblock, he rammed Dishong\u2019s vehicle, backed up, collided with the vehicle again, backed up a second time, and then drove forward toward Dishong\u2019s vehicle once more. By contrast, Martin\u2019s wife (Plaintiff) alleges that Martin collided with Dishong\u2019s vehicle accidentally and then tried to turn away from the roadblock. It is undisputed that Dishong fired several shots at Martin during these events ... and that a shot fired by Dishong caused Martin\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">The parties offered conflicting evidence concerning the relative positions of Dishong and Martin at the moment when Dishong fired the fatal shot. Evidence presented by the defense placed Dishong next to his vehicle and in the path of Martin\u2019s oncoming truck. By contrast, Plaintiff offered evidence indicating that Dishong was safely inside his vehicle as Martin came toward it. Another scenario supported by Plaintiffs evidence placed Dishong behind his vehicle while Martin was attempting to drive away from the intersection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">In response to her husband\u2019s death, Plaintiff filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 2003), alleging that Dishong violated Martin\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by employing deadly force without justification. After discovery, Dishong moved for summary judgment, contending that he was entitled to qualified immunity. Dishong maintained that at the time of the shooting, Martin was trying to kill him by ramming his vehicle and that he was therefore entitled to use deadly force in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">The district court denied Dishong\u2019s motion. Noting that the parties had presented conflicting evidence concerning Martin\u2019s actions prior to the shooting, the court reasoned that a jury could find that (i) Martin did not act with intent to harm Dishong and (ii) no reasonable officer could have concluded otherwise. In light of these possible findings, the court ruled that the evidence in the record created a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether Dishong could reasonably have concluded that Martin posed a threat to his life or safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">In <em>Dishong I, </em>we affirmed this ruling. <em>See Dishong I, </em>57 Fed. Appx. at 155-56. Citing <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), we explained that the Supreme Court has \u201capprove [d] the use of deadly force by a police officer against a fleeing suspect if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>the suspect (1) poses a threat to the officer, (2) poses a threat to others, or (3) has committed a serious violent crime.\u201d <em>Dishong I, </em>57 Fed. Appx. at 155. We concluded that conflicts in the evidence precluded the entry of summary judgment based on the first <em>Gamer </em>category (self-protection by the officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In addition, we declined to consider alternative arguments invoking the other two <em>Gamer </em>categories. In support of these arguments, Dishong alleged that Martin committed at least two violent felonies by deliberately colliding with Dishong\u2019s vehicle, and that Dishong was therefore permitted to use deadly force to effect the arrest of a dangerous criminal and to prevent Martin from harming others in the community. Because the district court had not addressed these issues, we did not decide whether summary judgment on these grounds would be appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 155 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">B. <em>Proceedings on Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On remand, Dishong asked the district court to address the arguments it had not earlier considered (concerning <em>Garner </em>categories 2 and 3). The court once again denied summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Regarding the second <em>Garner </em>category (use of deadly force to prevent harm to others), Dishong argued that Martin had already driven at high speeds to avoid arrest and that he was likely to do so again if he escaped from the corral of police vehicles; in light of this risk, Dishong contended, he was justified in using deadly force to prevent Martin from fleeing the scene in a manner that posed a threat to others. The district court rejected this basis for summary judgment, relying on evidence that Dishong fired the fatal shot as Martin\u2019s truck rolled slowly away from the roadblock.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The court also rejected Dishong\u2019s claim that he was justified in using deadly force to prevent a felon from escaping (the third <em>Gamer </em>category). Dishong argued that Martin\u2019s attempts to ram Dishong\u2019s vehicle amounted to felonious assaults. The court ruled that summary judgment on this basis would be inappropriate because Dishong\u2019s argument rested on the premise that Martin\u2019s collisions with Dishong\u2019s vehicle were intentional, and the court had already found that there was conflicting evidence on the question of whether Dishong reasonably determined that Martin collided with Dishong\u2019s vehicle intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">On appeal, Dishong renews his claim that he is entitled to summary judgment on the question of qualified immunity. The doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for conduct that \u201cdoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a law enforcement officer is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to a claim that the officer used excessive force, we must evaluate the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Thus, an officer is entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable officer under the same circumstances would have determined that the force used was necessary. <em>See Jones v. Buchanan, </em>325 F.3d 520, 527 (4th Cir. 2003). Applying this standard, we conclude that a reasonable officer in Dishong\u2019s circumstances at the time of the fatal shooting could validly have inferred that Martin posed a continuing danger to oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ers. We therefore hold that the district court erred in denying summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Under the second prong of <em>Garner, </em>the use of deadly force was permissible if Martin posed a danger to others. Certainly, Martin\u2019s high-speed flight through a residential neighborhood posed such a danger. And once he had freed himself from the corral of police vehicles, which apparently occurred shortly before the fatal shot was fired, Martin could have resumed his risky flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Plaintiff contends that Martin did not intend to flee. In support, she relies on evidence that, once Martin left the corral, his truck moved at \u201cwalking speed\u201d before rolling to a stop. J.A. 254 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on this evidence, Plaintiff asks us to infer that Martin only intended to pull over to the side of the road. We do not find this inference plausible, however, in light of Martin\u2019s earlier conduct. In any event, Dishong could reasonably have reached the opposite inference\u2014namely, that Martin was attempting to accelerate away from the scene. Moreover, while Martin or his truck may have been so disabled that he could not have escaped regardless of his intentions, there is no evidence that Dishong was aware of such a condition. Accordingly, Dishong was entitled to qualified immunity on the question of whether he properly used force to prevent Martin\u2019s escape.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of Dishong.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> In light of our holding, we need not consider whether Dishong\u2019s conduct was reasonable under the third <em>Gamer </em>category, which permits the use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
