He first argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior state misdemeanor conviction for sexual abuse of a person under fourteen qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and erred in increasing his offense level by eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We have reviewed the record and briefs and conclude that the district court did not err in applying the eight-level increase, because Galvez\u2019s state sexual abuse conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). <em>See United States v. Urias-Escobar, </em>281 F.3d 165, 166-68 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 913, 122 S.Ct. 2377, 153 L.Ed.2d 196 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Galvez argues next that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional sentencing provisions. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Galvez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
