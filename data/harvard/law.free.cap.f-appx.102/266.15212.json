Mendez pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (2000). Mendez\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue as to whether the magistrate judge complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Mendez\u2019s guilty plea. Mendez has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-23\">On appeal, counsel questions whether the magistrate judge properly conducted the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, specifically raising the issue as to whether the magistrate judge adequately informed Mendez regarding the potential length of his sentence. This court indulges a strong presumption that a plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 hearing is adequate. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1999). We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing conducted before the magistrate judge and are satisfied that Mendez was afforded the protections of Rule 11. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>345 F.3d 281, 285 (4th Cir.2003) (holding that taking guilty plea is permissible as an \u201cadditional duty\u201d for a magistrate judge). Furthermore, a review of the record indicates that the magistrate judge did inform Mendez of the potential length of his sentence and Mendez stated that he understood. This claim is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We further conclude that the claims raised in Mendez\u2019s pro se supplemental brief are without merit. We therefore affirm Mendez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
