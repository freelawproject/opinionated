Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). The district court dismissed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint without prejudice as frivolous. Joseph did not file a notice of appeal; almost two years later, he moved to proceed IFP and requested a copy of the record. After the district court denied both this motion and a motion for reconsideration, Joseph filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-24\">By moving for IFP status, Joseph has challenged the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. The IFP \u201cmotion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court\u2019s inquiry into good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>We first conclude that Joseph\u2019s notice of appeal is timely only as to the denial of his motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to proceed IFP. Because this motion for reconsideration was filed more than 10 days after the entry of the order it challenged, it is properly construed as a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). This court reviews the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enter., Inc., </em>88 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">As the district court noted, when Joseph filed his motion to proceed IFP, he had no pending appeal, and the time for filing a notice of appeal had passed. Therefore, we conclude that the grant of IFP status would have been an empty gesture as it would have allowed Joseph to proceed IFP on a non-existent appeal. The district court correctly concluded that Joseph\u2019s appeal from the denial of reconsideration of this meaningless IFP motion would be frivolous. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994) (noting appeal was \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The district court\u2019s certification that Joseph\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, his motion for IFP status on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. The dismissal of Joseph\u2019s complaint in the district court as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Joseph that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
