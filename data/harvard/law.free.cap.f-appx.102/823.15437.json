See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b855-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b855-23\">In 2001, Jerry Singletary filed a request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from the district court\u2019s 1996 denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Because Singletary\u2019s appeal is almost five years late, his appeal must be dismissed as untimely, and his request for a COA is denied as moot. <em>See </em>F.R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">Despite the label Singletary attached to his motion, it appears, in reality, to request authorization to file a second or successive motion under \u00a7 2255. Consequently, we construe his motion as a request for such authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Singletary does not satisfy either of these conditions. Singletary\u2019s sole argument is that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), announced a new rule of law that should be made retroactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>on collateral review. Singletary\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, we decline to authorize Singletary to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Accordingly, we deny the certificate of appealability as moot and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Singletary authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
