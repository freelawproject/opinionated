Applying the same test as the district court, <em>e.g., Skotak v. Tenneco Resins, Inc., </em>953 F.2d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1992), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">We hold that the district court did not err in its determination that Officer Tina Perez was entitled to qualified immunity; brandishing her weapon was objectively reasonable under the circumstances, and Gonzales suffered no injury as a result thereof. <em>Cf. Hinojosa v. City of Terrell, </em>834 F.2d 1223, 1231 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see Williams v. Bramer, </em>180 F.3d 699, 703 (5th Cir.), <em>clarified, </em>186 F.3d 633, 634 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, the district court did not err in failing to consider Randy Moore\u2019s statement for purposes of resolving the summary judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">Gonzales has inadequately briefed the district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 36 application, and that issue is therefore waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Gonzales has similarly aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>doned his excessive force claim against Officer Darrell Flanagan. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Gonzales\u2019s claim that the absence of medical facilities at the City of South Houston Jail constitutes per se deliberate indifference is raised for the first time on appeal and is therefore not considered. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). His claims regarding the medical treatment he received while detained at the Harris County Jail fail as a matter of law because they amount to nothing more than a disagreement over the type of care received. <em>See Gibbs v. Grimmette, </em>254 F.3d 545, 548-49 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
