Luongo pleaded guilty to making a false statement before a grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (2000). In May 2002, the district court sentenced Luongo to two months of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. We especially note that special condition 6 of the conditions of supervision for supervised release states that \u201cthe defendant shall make an effort to settle all law judgments against him in any court within the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-24\">In March 2003, the Government filed a motion seeking to modify this term of Luongo\u2019s supervised release. Specifically, the Government sought to compel Luongo to begin making payments on a default judgment entered against him in 2001. After a hearing, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and ordered Luongo to submit to a deposition to determine his assets and then to begin making payments toward the judgment. Luongo timely appeals this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-25\">District courts have wide latitude in imposing special conditions on supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>lease. <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>324 F.3d 256, 260 (4th Cir.2003). A district court may impose any condition it considers appropriate as long as it is \u201creasonably related\u201d to the factors referred to in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1) (2000). <em>Id. </em>These factors are: \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (2000); the need for the condition to deter criminal conduct, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (2000); the need to protect the public from any further criminal behavior by the defendant, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (2000); and the need to provide the defendant with training or medical care, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (2000). <em>Id. </em>Additionally, special conditions must be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements and may not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary to achieve the specified goals. <em>Id. </em>A district court\u2019s imposition of special conditions of supervised release is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Dotson, </em>324 F.3d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Luongo contends that the district court abused its discretion by requiring him to submit to a deposition to determine his assets and to begin making payments on the civil default judgment. The district court found that Luongo\u2019s offense of conviction\u2014lying to the grand jury\u2014and his failure to satisfy the outstanding default judgment against him demonstrate a lack of respect for the legal system. Therefore, the district court found the modification appropriately related to the factors referred to in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
