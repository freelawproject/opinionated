California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Lively has filed a response to counsel\u2019s motion. Lively\u2019s claims alleging ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel are not cognizable in the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Our independent review of the brief, response, suppression hearing, jury trial, sentencing, and record discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Lively\u2019s motion to allow counsel to withdraw is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">COUNSEL\u2019S MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED; LIVELY\u2019S MOTION TO ALLOW COUNSEL TO WITHDRAW DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
