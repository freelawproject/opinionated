He argues that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that Quintero was not credible and that he was not eligible for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">We may review the IJ\u2019s decision, given that the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 77 (5th Cir.1994). Both the IJ\u2019s credibility finding and the determination that Quintero was not eligible for withholding of removal are supported by substantial evidence; certainly the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also Lopez De Jesus v.
