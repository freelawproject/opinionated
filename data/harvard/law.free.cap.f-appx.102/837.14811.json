We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003). <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (stating abuse of discretion standard); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999) (same). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, as immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings where the motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(2) (2003). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
