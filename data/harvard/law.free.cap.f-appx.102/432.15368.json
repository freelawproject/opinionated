A certif\u00edcate of appealability was granted for the issue of whether the imposition of Mississippi\u2019s habitual offender statute was proper where Wall\u2019s service of one prior sentence was interrupted by an interstate transfer between jails. Wall contends that the evidence was insufficient to sentence him under the habitual offender statute and that his counsel ineffectively failed to challenge the imposition. Wall also asserts that the district court erroneously failed to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">This court must defer to the determination implicit in the denial of state habeas corpus relief that the interruption did not vitiate the service of the sentence under state law. <em>See Young v. Dretke, </em>356 F.3d 616, 628 (5th Cir.2004). That legal determination is dispositive of all of Wall\u2019s constitutional claims. Therefore, there was no factual dispute necessitating an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Ward v. Whitley, </em>21 F.3d 1355,1367 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
