Willis is subject to a pre-filing review order with regard to actions against the Town of Trenton, which was named as a defendant in the present complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Willis v. Town of Trenton, </em>No. CA-03-7MC-H (E.D.N.C. Jan. 7, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
