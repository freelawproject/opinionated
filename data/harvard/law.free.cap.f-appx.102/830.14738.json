On appeal, he alleges that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Because the district court granted a certificate of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>pealability on the sufficiency of the evidence claim and because we find no reversible error on appeal, we affirm the dismissal of this claim on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Wilson v. Lee, </em>No. CA-02-551-3 (E.D.Va. Apr. 4, 2003). Regarding Wilson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance, a certificate of appealability is pending. This portion of the order is not appealable, however, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Wilson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
