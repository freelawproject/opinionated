Randall appeals his conviction, following a conditional guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). Randall contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained following his arrest. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-23\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Randall\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the arresting officer\u2019s failure to comply with Virginia law when arresting him constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Because the \u201cconstitutional standard is not affected by the fact that state law may impose a more stringent arrest standard upon state police officers,\u201d <em>Fisher v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>690 F.2d 1133, 1138 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Cir.1982), and Randall concedes that there was probable cause to arrest him, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Randall\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Randall\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
