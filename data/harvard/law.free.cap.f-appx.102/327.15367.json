To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Mes-fin fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Mesfin seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
