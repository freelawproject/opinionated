He requests a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. We previously remanded this case to the district court to determine when Graham submitted his notice of appeal to prison authorities for mailing. The district court determined that Graham\u2019s notice of appeal was submitted for mailing on October 29, 2003. Graham does not challenge this finding. The last day for filing a timely notice of appeal was October 27, 2003. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a); Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3). Because the notice of appeal is untimely, we dismiss Graham\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny his motion for a COA as moot. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Machado, </em>845 F.2d 492, 493 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; COA DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
