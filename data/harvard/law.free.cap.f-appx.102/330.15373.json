A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Calloway has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> Calloway\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion is not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a); <em>Dove v. CODESCO, </em>569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir.1978). In addition, Calloway has waived appeal of the district court's denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>59(e) motion because he failed to present argument on the issue in his informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
