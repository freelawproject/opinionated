His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court failed to follow the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 at the plea hearing. Although notified by both this court and his attorney of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Choice has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-28\">Choice contends his plea hearing failed to comport with Rule 11. As Choice raised no objection to the Rule 11 proceeding below, we review this claim for plain error. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 394 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 950, 122 S.Ct. 2643, 153 L.Ed.2d 821 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>(2002). In light of the district court\u2019s thorough plea colloquy, we find Choice was fully aware of his rights and the consequences of his plea and that his plea was knowing and voluntary. We find the district court complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in accepting Choice\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We have reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Choice\u2019s conviction and sentence. This Court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
