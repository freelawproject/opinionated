Farquhar, federal prisoner #28074-077, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his conviction for mail fraud. He argues that he is entitled to proceed pursuant to \u00a7 2241 because the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate given that his claims could not be raised in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and, further, because <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">A prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, or the inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, does not make the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate, however. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). Additionally, Farquhar cannot show that his claims were foreclosed at the time of his \u00a7 2255 motion because <em>Neder </em>was decided before that filing. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827. Farquhar therefore has not shown the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate, and he cannot proceed pursuant to \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
