See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Following a jury trial, Emmett Lee Cahoon was convicted on two counts of possession of stolen firearms and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j), 2 (2000). The district court sentenced Cahoon to concurrent twenty-one month prison terms on each count. Cahoon timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court should have granted Cahoon\u2019s motion for a new trial because the government improperly brought a number of guns into the courtroom that proved to be inadmissible. To obtain a new trial on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct or remarks were improper, and that the conduct or remarks prejudicially affected his substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Scheetz, </em>293 F.3d 175, 185 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 963, 123 S.Ct. 397, 154 L.Ed.2d 320 (2002). We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 619 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">We find, as did the district court, that the prosecution acted improperly in bringing the guns into the courtroom. To determine whether this improper conduct prejudicially affected Cahoon\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial, this Court considers several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">(1) the degree to which the prosecutor\u2019s [conduct] had a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the [conduct was] isolated or extensive; (3) absent the [conduct], the strength of competent proof introduced to establish the guilt of the defendant; (4) whether the [conduct was] deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters; (5) whether the prosecutor\u2019s [conduct was] invited by improper conduct of defense counsel; and (6) whether curative instructions were given to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-17\"><em>Scheetz, </em>293 F.3d at 186. Given the substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, the fact that the district court found as a fact that the guns were brought into the courtroom in good faith, and taking the remaining factors into consideration, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct did not prejudicially affect Cahoon\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial. Accordingly, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>elude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cahoon\u2019s motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Cahoon\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
