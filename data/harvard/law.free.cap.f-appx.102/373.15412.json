After his term of supervised release commenced, Rodriquez violated the conditions of his release, and he was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment following the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Rodriquez appeals from this sentence, arguing that it is plainly unreasonable and that the district court erred by failing to articulate its reasons for imposition of the sentence or its consideration of the applicable statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Rodriquez\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum and was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 93-94 (5th Cir.1994). Prior to sentencing, the district court was provided with an explanation of Rodriquez\u2019s violations, the Supervised Release Violation Report, stating the sentencing options and updating Rodriquez\u2019s personal history, and the argument of defense counsel. \u201cAbsent a contrary indication in the record, such evidence implies that the district court was aware of and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 440-42 (5th Cir.2000). The district court implicitly considered the necessary factors and, thus, its failure to state its reasons was not plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930-31 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d at 441-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
