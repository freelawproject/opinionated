The district court granted Celanese\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) based on Garrett\u2019s failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We hold that the district court correctly dismissed Garrett\u2019s claims for the reasons given by the district court. Garrett further argues that the district court should have granted her leave to amend her complaint before granting Celanese\u2019s motion to dismiss. While Garrett could have amended her complaint once as a matter of right, she did not exercise that right. She only made cursory mention of a request to amend her pleadings in her opposition to Celanese\u2019s motion to dismiss, and this court has previously held that a request made in this manner does not require the district court to grant leave to amend. <em>McKinney v. Irving Independent School District, </em>309 F.3d 308, 315 (5th Cir.2002). Further, Garrett never apprised the district court or this court of any facts that she would have added to her complaint that would have sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision granting Celanese\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
