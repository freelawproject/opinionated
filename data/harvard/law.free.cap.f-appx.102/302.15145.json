Our review of the briefs and record convinces us that, as the Attorney General asserts, Huamani-Diaz\u2019s claims are barred by res judicata, or claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">In <em>Huamani-Diaz v. Ashcroft, </em>80 Fed. Appx. 293 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished), we denied petitions for review from the Board\u2019s final order of removal and its denial of Huamani-Diaz\u2019s motion to reopen. In denying the petitions, we held we lacked jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (2000), to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision not to grant a hardship waiver. We also held the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Huamani-Diaz\u2019s motion to remand to reconsider his eligibility for adjustment of status. Huamani-Diaz raises the same issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">Res judicata precludes a later claim when \u201c\u2018(1) the prior judgment was final and on the merits, and rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the requirements of due process; (2) the parties are identical, or in privity, in the two actions; and, (3) the claim[ ] in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>second matter [is] based upon the same cause of action involved in the earlier proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grausz v. Englander, </em>321 F.3d 467, 472 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>In re Varat Enterprises, Inc., </em>81 F.3d 1310, 1315 (4th Cir.1996)); <em>cf. Ramsay v. U.S. INS, </em>14 F.3d 206, 210-11 (4th Cir.1994) (applying principles of issue preclusion in immigration context). Those conditions are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Therefore, as we conclude that Huamani-Diaz is barred by res judicata from relitigating the issues he has raised, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
