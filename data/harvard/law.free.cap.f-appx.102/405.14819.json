Weaver contends that his indictment charged a crime narrower than the criminal conduct proscribed by the statute and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction as charged. He argues that although he was charged with transporting aliens who had illegally entered the United States, in furtherance of such violation of law, there was no evidence that he did anything to further the aliens\u2019 entry. We conclude that Weaver\u2019s indictment correctly charged him with a crime under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324(a) (1) (A) (ii) and 1324(a)(1)(B)(i) and that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Nolasco-Rosas, </em>286 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>879 F.2d 1247, 1251-52 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In a variation on his sufficiency argument, Weaver also asserts that the district court\u2019s jury charge constructively amended the indictment and permitted a conviction based on transportation of aliens in furtherance of the aliens\u2019 unlawful presence in this country when the indictment charged only that the aliens had entered and that the transportation was in furtherance of such violation of law. Weaver did not object to the district court\u2019s jury instructions, so we review them for plain error. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>252 F.3d 411, 414 &amp; n. 8 (5th Cir.2001). We conclude that the district court\u2019s jury charge was consistent with our precedent and did not constructively amend the indictment. <em>See id. </em>at 414; <em>Rivera, </em>879 F.2d at 1252. There was no reversible error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
