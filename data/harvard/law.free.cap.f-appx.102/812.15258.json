The court entered summary judgment against Hayslett and dismissed the action. Hayslett now appeals that order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-23\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">In light of this standard, we have carefully reviewed the formal briefs and mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>rials submitted by the parties and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
