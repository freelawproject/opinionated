Kamara argues that his due process and equal protection rights have been violated by imposition of the requirement that he file a grievance with the State Bar of Texas against his former attorney in order to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We construe the Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance as his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">This court lacks jurisdiction to consider Kamara\u2019s arguments because he did not present these claims to the BIA. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
