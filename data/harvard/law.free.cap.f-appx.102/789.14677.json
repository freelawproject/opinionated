In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Crowder claims there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Crowder\u2019s sentence is within the statutory maximum sentencing range, and the district court\u2019s revocation proceedings otherwise comport with due process. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000). Finding no meritorious issues, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
