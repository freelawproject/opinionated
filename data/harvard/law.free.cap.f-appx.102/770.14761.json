He was charged separately with conspiracy to commit bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000), and pled guilty to that offense pursuant to a plea agreement. Thompson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the government breached the plea agreement by its failure to move for a downward departure for substantial assistance, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2002), but asserting that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thompson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief and has chosen not to file a brief. We affirm the convictions and eighty-four-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Thompson\u2019s plea agreement for the conspiracy count provided that the government, \u201cin its sole discretion,\u201d would determine whether Thompson\u2019s assistance was substantial and, if his assistance was deemed substantial, the government \u201cmay make a motion\u201d for a downward departure based on his substantial assistance. At the sentencing hearing, the government informed the district court that it would not move for a substantial assistance departure because Thompson\u2019s assistance was still ongoing. Because the agreement did not obligate the government to move for a departure, the district court was without authority to compel a motion unless Thompson demonstrated that the government\u2019s failure to file the motion resulted from an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate government end. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Thompson did not attempt to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-14\"> Pursuant to the plea agreement, Thompson waived the right to appeal his sentence for the conspiracy conviction, but reserved the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>to raise issues involving prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
