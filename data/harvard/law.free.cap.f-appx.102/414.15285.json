INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Vongphakdy, a Buddhist, contends that he will be unable to practice his religion as he would like to because the Communist Party is in control in Laos. He asserts that he was mistreated when he was in Laos due to his position as a chief monk. Vongphakdy has married and is no longer a monk, but contends that he fears that he would be arrested by the communists if he is returned to Laos. The immigration judge\u2019s determination that Vongphakdy did not meet his burden to show that he is likely to be tortured if removed is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.18(a) &amp; 208.16(c)(2); <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 353 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-24\">Vongphakdy also argues that the BIA erred in applying the summary review procedures in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) to affirm the immigration judge\u2019s denial of relief without opinion. He contends, based merely on the number of such summary affirmances, that this provision is being applied systematically. He asserts, in conclusory fashion, that his case was not thoroughly reviewed and that the regulations were misapplied. We previously have held that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures do not violate due process. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). Vongphakdy has failed to articulate why his case allegedly does not meet the criteria for affirmance without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>opinion, or how his case was not properly-reviewed. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
