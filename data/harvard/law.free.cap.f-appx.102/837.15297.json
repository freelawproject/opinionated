Gemeda contends: (1) mere tardiness is not a failure to appear; (2) he established his failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances; and (3) he was denied the right to due process. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (2003). We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gemeda failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting granting a motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) (2000). In addition, Gemeda was not denied the right to due process. <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 548 (9th Cir.1996). Moreover, we find Gemeda\u2019s argument that the Board failed to follow its own precedent is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
