We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Perez\u2019s sole contention is that the district court clearly erred by enhancing his sentence on the ground that there were more than 50 victims of his offenses. Section 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines authorizes a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The district court based its finding on the presentence report and testimony of a Secret Service special agent that more than 150 government checks were stolen and some 71 check-cashers and other endorsers were victimized during the conspiracy of which Perez was a leader. This evidence was plausible and uncontradicted by any defense evidence. Thus the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous, and Perez\u2019s sentence must be affirmed. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>981 F.2d 180, 185 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
