In his petition, he argued that because he was a pretrial detainee at the time that he committed the offense that led to his disciplinary conviction and because he had not been sentenced to a term of imprisonment at that time, the loss of good-time credits was not an available sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">At the time that Eddlemon was found guilty of the disciplinary case, he was a convicted and sentenced prisoner. Thus, the loss of good-time credit was an available sanction for the disciplinary case. Given the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
