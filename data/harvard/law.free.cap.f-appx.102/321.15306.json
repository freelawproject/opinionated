The district court departed upward from the applicable guideline range and imposed a sentence of 205 months imprisonment. The departure was based on the court\u2019s decision that criminal history category VI did not adequately reflect Hearne\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he would commit future crimes and his use of the illegally possessed firearm in a manner that created a significant risk of death or serious bodily injury to multiple individuals. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., 2K2.1, comment. (n.16(4)) (2003). Hearne appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">On January 26, 2002, Hearne threatened David Horne by putting two firearms to his chest. Horne disarmed Hearne, who left but returned in half an hour with another firearm. Hearne found Horne standing in front of his house and began shooting at him. About ten people were in the immediate vicinity; no one was injured. Horne described the two guns he took from Hearne during the first incident as a MAC-9 and a MAC-10. Later the same day, in a car driven by Michelle Helms, Hearne followed Lindsey Lentz, his former girlfriend, and shot at her. Lentz drove to a police station. When Hearne arrived, the officers obtained Helms\u2019 consent to search the car. They found a Ruger handgun under the front seat, six grams of crack in the console, and fourteen counterfeit $100 federal reserve notes in Hearne\u2019s jacket. At the time, Hearne had been convicted of assaulting Lentz and was awaiting sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">The probation officer recommended the enhanced base offense level of 26 for the felon-in-possession count because the offense involved a semiautomatic assault weapon described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30) (2000) and Hearne had two predicate convictions. USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l). With other enhancements and an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the recommended offense level was 29. Hearne had seventeen criminal history points, which placed him in criminal history category VI. The probation officer recommended an upward departure from the guideline range pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 because criminal history category VI understated the seriousness of Hearne\u2019s past criminal conduct and the likelihood that he would commit future crimes, USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 and because Hearne created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>individuals when he shot at Horne. Application Note 16(4) to \u00a7 2K2.1 provides that an upward departure may be warranted when the offense creates such a risk. The government moved for a departure on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Horne testified that he was not sure of the make of the two firearms he took from Hearne, but that they were \u201cUzi-like guns,\u201d with an ammunition clip. Horne said someone had run off with one of the guns after he threw it on the ground; the second gun he had handed to his brother. He was not sure what happened to either weapon. Hearne sought to impeach Horne\u2019s credibility by presenting testimony from an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. The agent testified that he had been given an Intratec TEC-9 firearm fifteen months after the incident by a man who said he got it from Horne and that it came from Tony Hearne. Horne testified that he knew the man but denied giving him a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The district court determined that Horne was a credible witness and that his testimony established that Hearne threatened him with semiautomatic assault weapons, which was sufficient for application of the enhanced base offense level. The court also decided that an upward departure of one offense level was warranted pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 and \u00a7 2K2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">On appeal, Hearne first contests the enhancement for possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon. The district court\u2019s factual finding that Hearne possessed a semiautomatic assault weapon of the kind described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). The government has the burden of proving facts that may enhance the sentence by a preponderance of evidence. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1239 (4th Cir.1989). A \u201csemiautomatic assault weapon,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 921(a)(30)(A), includes a variety of specific weapons, including any Uzi, the Intratec TEC-9, and the SWD M-10, as well as copies or duplicates of these weapons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Hearne argues on appeal that Horne\u2019s testimony was not rehable because the government failed to establish that he was knowledgeable about firearms. Hearne also maintains that Horne was not a credible witness because he claimed that he did not know what happened to the guns. However, the district court determined that Horne\u2019s testimony was credible and that it established by a preponderance of the evidence that Hearne possessed a MAC-10 semiautomatic assault weapon. The district court\u2019s findings based on its assessment of the credibility of a witness is entitled to great deference. <em>United States v. Hassanzadeh, </em>271 F.3d 574, 580 (4th Cir.2001). We conclude that the court did not clearly err in finding that Hearne possessed a MAC-10 or similar semiautomatic assault weapon and in applying the enhanced base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Hearne also challenges the upward departure. A sentencing court may depart from the guideline range only if the court finds an aggravating or mitigating factor of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b) (West Supp.2004); <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>appeals court reviews the district court\u2019s factual determinations underlying sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 757 (4th Cir.1996). We review the district court\u2019s decision to depart de novo. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West Supp.2003); <em>see United States v. Stockton, </em>349 F.3d 755, 764 n. 4 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(d)(2), 117 Stat. 650, 670, and the application of de novo, rather than abuse of discretion, standard of review to district court\u2019s decision to depart from the guideline range), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1695, 158 L.Ed.2d 385 (2004). The PROTECT Act also requires the district court to provide its reasons for departure with specificity in the judgment and commitment order. <em>See </em>PROTECT Act, \u00a7 401(c)(1), 117 Stat. at 669; 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">An upward departure is encouraged if the defendant\u2019s criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he will commit further crimes. Hearne\u2019s prior record included three misdemeanor assaults (one with a knife) for which no criminal history points were awarded because the sentences were outside the applicable time period. The probation officer recommended two points for Hearne\u2019s 2002 convictions of misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a female, and misdemeanor communicating threats, all of which involved an assault on Lindsey Lentz that occurred before the instant offense. Because Hearne\u2019s conviction was on appeal to the North Carolina Superior Court, the district court decided that no criminal points should be awarded for the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Hearne\u2019s criminal record showed a pattern of repeated criminal conduct, particularly assaults, and thus demonstrated that he had a high likelihood of recidivism.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, Application Note 8 to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 provides that the sentencing court may consider sentences imposed outside the applicable time period if they are evidence of criminal conduct that is similar to the instant offense. Hearne received no points for three outdated sentences for assault, and the instant offense involved assaults by Hearne against Horne and Lentz. The court may also consider whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time he committed the instant offense. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(D). When Hearne committed the instant offense on January 26, 2002, he was pending sentencing for the prior assault on Lentz. We therefore conclude that a one-level upward departure was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Hearne points out that the district court failed to give specific written reasons for the departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 as are now required. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(2). We note that 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(f)(2) (West Supp.2004), provides that, \u201cif the sentence is outside the applicable guideline range and the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons in the order of judgment and commitment ... [the court of appeals] shall state specific reasons for its conclusions.\u201d In accord with this provision, we have stated the specific reasons why the upward departure was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We also affirm the court\u2019s decision to depart on the separate ground that Hearne\u2019s conduct created a risk of death or serious bodily injury to multiple individuals. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l6(4)). Horne testified at sentencing that about ten people were standing in his yard when Hearne began shooting at him. Hearne contends that a departure on this ground was unwarranted because his conduct was adequately considered by the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for use of a firearm in connection with another felony, and because he did not injure anyone. His argument fails because the enhancement he received under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was for use of a fire-arm in connection with his counterfeiting offense; it did not take into account his shooting into a crowd. The departure was based on an encouraged factor and justified by the facts. Because the district court did not provide specific reasons in the judgment order for its departure under \u00a7 2K2.1, we have again stated with specificity why the departure was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.
