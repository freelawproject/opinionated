Mendoza argues that he was not given notice of the charge 24 hours prior to the disciplinary hearing, in violation of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-26\">The purpose of the 24-hour notice requirement is \u201cto inform [the defendant] of the charges and to enable him to marshal the facts and prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Wolff, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>418 U.S. </em>at 564. The incident report, which Mendoza received several days before the hearing, fulfilled this purpose. Mendoza was on notice of the specific acts he would be required to disprove or defend. The report indicated that Mendoza\u2019s possession of the food items was a significant part of the prohibited acts he was accused of committing. He had the opportunity to explain that he possessed the food items pursuant to his assignment of cleaning tables, but he did not do so. Although Mendoza was convicted of a less serious offense, the incident report included sufficient information to meet the notice requirement set out in <em>Wolff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Mendoza also appears to be arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. Mendoza did not present this argument to the district court, and this court will not review the argument for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
