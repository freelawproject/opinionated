He argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6)(4) because the district court failed to make a finding that he acted recklessly in creating a threat of serious bodily injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">Section 2L1.1(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, \u201cIf any person died or sustained bodily injury, increase the offense level according to the seriousness of the injury.\u201d Section 2L1.1(b)(5) provides for a sentence enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d That U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) does not specify reckless conduct as a requirement for the enhancement, while U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5) specifies it, is a clear indication that reckless conduct is not necessary for an increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, </em>313 F.3d 892, 895 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"A8H\">Because Saucedo has failed to demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s application of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6)(4) enhancement, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
