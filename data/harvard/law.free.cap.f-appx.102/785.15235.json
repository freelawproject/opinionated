Felton\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in their view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising three issues. Felton was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but did not do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Counsel contend that the district court erred by revoking Felton\u2019s supervised release. Our review of the record convinces us that the preponderance of the evidence established that Felton violated certain conditions of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004). We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s revocation of Felton\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Counsel also contend that the district court failed to consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004) before sentencing Felton. We find, however, that the district court properly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cA court need not engage in ritualistic incantation in order to establish its consideration of a legal issue. It is sufficient if ... the district court rules on issues that have been fully presented for determination. Consideration is implicit in the court\u2019s ultimate ruling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Finally, counsel suggest that Felton\u2019s sentence is plainly unreasonable. Because the district court sentenced Felton to the low end of the suggested sentencing guideline range, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (2003), we find that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform their client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believe that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
