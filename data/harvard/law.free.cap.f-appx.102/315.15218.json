Pittman, conducted a pat-down of Pittman\u2019s pants pockets, and discovered a weapon. Pittman, a convicted felon, later was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000). After the district court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, Pittman entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. On appeal, Pittman renews his motion to suppress, arguing that the officer\u2019s investigatory detention of him violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Because we find that Pittman\u2019s detention was supported by a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity may have been afoot, and because the subsequent pat-down was justified in the interest of officer safety, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">The evidence adduced at Pittman\u2019s suppression hearing showed the following. At approximately 6:00 PM on October 13, 2002, Officers Tricia A. Hamilton and Eugene J. Provost of the Richmond Police Department, riding separately in their own patrol cars, responded to a report of gunshots being fired in the vicinity of the 3700 block of Moody Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. According to Officer Hamilton, this block was in a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d and was a few blocks away from Midlothian Village, an area with a particularly violent reputation. According to Officer Provost, the 3700 block of Moody Avenue was part of a \u201cresidential neighborhood\u201d that did not \u201chave a high volume of crime,\u201d but was \u201cacross the street from ... Midlothian Village, where we have quite a few shootings and have had quite a few homicides.\u201d (J.A. at 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">Upon her arrival, Officer Hamilton viewed a number of people sitting or standing on a porch and noticed Pittman sitting in a blue car at the curb. Hamilton approached Pittman, spoke briefly with him, and then proceeded to the porch to speak with the people there.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">Officer Provost arrived shortly thereafter and parked in front of Pittman\u2019s blue car. Pittman was sitting in the car with the door open and his feet outside the vehicle. Provost\u2019s attention was drawn to Pittman because Pittman was \u201clooking directly at [Hamilton] and watching her ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ery movement.\u201d (J.A. at 52.) Provost also noticed that Pittman was \u201creaching to the floorboard of the car making furtive movements.\u201d (J.A. at 52.) Based on Pittman\u2019s behavior, Provost \u201cgot a sixth sense\u201d about Pittman and decided to approach the man. (J.A. at 56.) As he approached, Provost saw a large amount of candy wrappers and papers on the floorboard of the car and that Pittman was stuffing those wrappers into his pocket. As soon as Pittman saw him, Provost observed, \u201c[he] looked like a deer in headlights. His eyes got real big, became nervous.\u201d (J.A. at 53.) When Provost asked Pittman if he had heard the gunshots in the area, Pittman became \u201ceven more nervous and started stuffing more stuff in his pockets even quicker.\u201d (J.A. at 53.) Provost then asked Pittman to keep his hands out of his pockets, asked him if he had a gun, and simultaneously placed his hand on Pittman\u2019s pocket. At this point, Pittman told Provost that he had a gun and that he was a convicted felon. Provost called Hamilton over, the two placed Pittman in handcuffs, and removed the handgun, a Derringer .22, from Pittman\u2019s pocket. Provost unloaded the gun and noted that it had been fired one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On January 23, 2003, a grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia returned a one-count indictment against Pittman, charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Pittman filed a motion to suppress the discovery of the firearm, arguing that Officer Provost did not have sufficient basis to stop him and pat down his pocket. After hearing the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the district court made the following findings on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">The court finds on the late afternoon of October 13th, 2002 Officers Hamilton and Provost responded to a call that alerted them to a gunshot being fired in the neighborhood on Moody Avenue. That Officer Hamilton had the primary duty of responding, and her back-up was Officer Provost. That after arriving at the area w[h]ere the notice indicated the shooting occurred Officer Hamilton found a number of people sitting or standing on a porch and the defendant sitting in his blue car at the curb. That she spoke to the defendant, and then decided that her primary assignment ought to be to talk to the people on the porch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">She goes up on the porch and has a conversation with some of the individuals there ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">In the interim, probably within a minute, Officer Provost pulled up in the same area and parked his car in front of the defendant Pittman, who by this time was sitting sideways in the left front seat of the car with his feet on the ground. Was engaged in some form of miscellaneous activity, either cleaning out his car of candy wrappers and things, but he appeared to be stuffing them in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Now, whether, obviously, because of the notice of a shooting in the area these officers were apprehensive about their safety, and whether it was just a hunch, a gut feeling or sixth sense, Officer Provost parlayed it in to a belief that he may be in danger. And he therefore told the defendant, Pittman, to take his hands out of his pocket. And whether he either did it or did not, the officer decided that that pocket was so crammed full of debris and other things that he ought [t]o slap his hand on it. And when he slapped his hand on it, he discovered that there was a weapon of some sort that later turned out to be a .22 caliber Derringer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">(J.A. at 71-72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Based on these factual findings, the district court denied Pittman\u2019s motion to suppress, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>I deny the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and the basic point that you mil have to take to the Fourth Circuit is when you are apprehensive after having been notified to go to an area that is known to be a reasonably high crime area, and you have been notified of a gunshot, can you parlay your hunch, gut feeling or sixth sense into doing what was done here? I am ruling that you can. So that will give you a perfect hand to take to the Fourth Circuit, because I did not mince my findings. Whether you can parlay those three human attributes, hunch, gut feeling, or sixth sense in to a reasonably articulable suspicion is a neat question for the Fourth Circuit to answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">(J.A. at 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Pittman then entered a conditional plea of guilty and later was sentenced. Pittman now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">When considering on appeal a motion to suppress evidence, we review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 320 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause the district court denied the motion to suppress, we construe the <em>evidence </em>in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">At oral argument, counsel for Pittman argued that our review of the evidence is limited only to those historical facts explicitly found by the district court. This assertion misapprehends our standard of review in these cases. While it certainly is true that we are bound to the district court\u2019s non-clearly-erroneous findings of fact, we look not only to those findings of fact, but also to the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing. <em>See Perkins, </em>363 F.3d at 320; <em>cf. United States v. Bethea, </em>598 F.2d 331, 333-34 (4th Cir.1979) (explaining that, when a district court fails to make express findings of fact on the record, we will uphold its denial of a motion to suppress if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, supports its ruling). This standard of review is pragmatic, recognizing that district courts frequently rule on motions to suppress from the bench and, from time to time, may omit relevant factual findings from their express findings of fact. While we certainly are not free, absent clear error, to credit evidence that the district court explicitly or implicitly discredited, our standard of review permits examination of the evidence adduced below and requires us to view that evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Perkins, </em>363 F.3d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment protects citizens from \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 by the government, and its protections extend to brief investigatory stops ... that fall short of traditional arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). In such situations, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer\u2019s action is supported by a reasonable artibulable suspicion that criminal activity \u201c \u2018may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868); <em>United States v. Christmas, </em>222 F.3d 141, 143 (4th Cir.2000). While such a detention does not require probable cause, it requires more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Stated differently, \u201c[a]n investigatory stop must be justified by some objective manifestation that the person stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). Once a stop is conducted, \u201cif the officer believes that the person being stopped \u2018may be armed and presently dangerous,\u2019 the officer may frisk the person by patting his outer clothing \u2018in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault [the officer].\u201d\u2019 <em>United States v. Mayo, </em>361 F.3d 802, 805 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868) (alteration in original). But, there must be a constitutional basis to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop before such a frisk can be conducted. <em>United States v. Burton, </em>228 F.3d 524, 527-28 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A]n officer may not conduct this protective search for purposes of safety until he has a reasonable suspicion that supports the investigatory stop.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In assessing an officer\u2019s justification in making an investigatory stop, \u201cwe look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d to see whether the detaining officer had a \u201c \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744. As we recently have explained, \u201crelevant to the totality of circumstances are various individual factors traditionally relied upon by police officers, such as whether the stop occurred in a high-crime area, or whether the suspect engaged in evasive behavior or acted nervously.\u201d <em>Mayo, </em>361 F.3d at 805-06 (citations omitted). Moreover, the inquiry is objective, not subjective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">Whether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred \u201cturns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u201d and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQV3\"><em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Here, an objective assessment of the totality of the circumstances reveals that Officer Provost\u2019s detention and pat down of Pittman was justified. First, as the district court found, the area in which the stop was conducted was known to be a \u201creasonably high-crime area.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (J.A. at 73.) As explained in <em>Mayo, </em>although this factor may not be sufficient in and of itself to justify stopping an individual, \u201cit is a factor that may be considered along with others to determine whether police have a reasonable suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Mayo, </em>361 F.3d at 807 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">A second relevant factor was Pittman\u2019s nervous demeanor. Officer Provost testified that he saw Pittman eyeball Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Hamilton in a suspicious manner as she walked by him, and as he approached Pittman, Provost noted that Pittman looked like \u201ca deer in headlights,\u201d explaining further that \u201c[h]is eyes got real big, became nervous.\u201d (J.A. at 53.) This too is a factor that we have found may be considered as informing an officer\u2019s reasonable articulable suspicion. <em>Mayo, </em>361 F.3d at 806, 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Third, Provost observed Pittman making furtive gestures. According to Provost, \u201c[Pittman] was reaching to the floorboard of the car making furtive movements. And he was picking something up, or pushing something, I didn\u2019t know if he was pushing something under the seat or picking something up.\u201d (J.A. at 51, 53.) Provost also noted that Pittman \u201cstarted stuffing more [debris] in his pockets even quicker\u201d after being approached by Provost, which is highly unusual behavior. (J.A. at 53.) These furtive gestures in the presence of police officers also are relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Finally, Officers Hamilton and Provost were responding to a call that shots had been fired in the area where the detention occurred. The officers were thus on the look-out for an armed individual and had some reason to suspect that any of the individuals in the area of 3700 Moody might be the person who fired the shot. <em>Cf. Burton, </em>228 F.3d at 528 (noting that officers conducting impermissible detention in that case were in the area serving outstanding warrants and not responding to a call of ongoing criminality).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In sum, the totality of the circumstances justified Provost\u2019s investigatory stop of Pittman. Provost was responding to a promiscuous shooting call in a reasonably high-crime area. He observed the nervous Pittman eyeballing Hamilton in a suspicious manner. When Pittman saw Provost, his anxiety was visibly heightened, and he looked like \u201ca deer in headlights.\u201d (J.A. at 53.) In addition, Pittman was making furtive movements in the floorboard of his car. These factors combined to give Provost a reasonable articulable suspicion that Pittman might be possessing a concealed weapon in violation of Virginia law. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-308 (Michie 1996) (making it unlawful to carry a concealed weapon without a permit). Because, based on the totality of the circumstances, Provost had reason both to detain Pittman and to believe that he was armed, Provost was justified in patting Pittman down in the interest of personal safety. <em>Mayo, </em>361 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Notwithstanding the objective factors apparent from the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, Pittman argues that, because the district court held that an officer could \u201cparlay [a] hunch, gut feeling or sixth sense\u201d into a basis for conducting a <em>Terry </em>stop, and because <em>Terry </em>itself explains that a \u201chunch\u201d is not enough to justify a stop, <em>see </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, the district court must be reversed. Pittman is correct in noting that a subjective \u201chunch\u201d or \u201cgut feeling\u201d on the part of the officer is not enough to support a <em>Terry </em>stop. Indeed, whether the officer developed a subjective sense about impending criminal activity is completely irrelevant. <em>Macon, </em>472 U.S. at 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778. We are not concerned with the officer\u2019s subjective state of mind\u2014only whether, viewed objectively, the facts and circumstances confronting the officer were sufficient to give a reasonable officer a particularized suspicion that criminality was afoot. <em>Id. </em>Thus, to the extent the district court based its ruling solely on the subjective state of mind of Officer Provost, it erred. Nevertheless, the historical facts found by the district court, along with other evidence in the record consistent there with, show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>objectively-viewed circumstances confronting the officers were sufficient to justify a stop-and-frisk detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Atj\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> Pittman argues that this finding was clearly erroneous because Provost testified that the area was not a high-crime area. It is true that Officer Provost stated that the area where Pittman was detained did not have \"a high volume of crime.\u201d (J.A. at 55.) But, when this testimony is read in context, this statement appears much more equivocal: \"It is a residential neighborhood. This area, we don't have a high volume of crime, however, across the street from there is Midlothian Village where we have quite a few shootings and have had quite a few homicides and also a school in that area.\u201d (J.A. at 55.) Moreover, Officer Hamilton testified at the suppression hearing that the area <em>was </em>a high crime area: \"That is primarily categorized as one of our high drug areas, high crime areas. You have got areas of Moody, Lawson, Roanoke and Midlothian. Right down the street from Midlothian, 4000 block you have a lot of shootings within that whole area there, Midlothian Village.\u201d (J.A. at 32.) Based on this testimony, the district court\u2019s finding that the area was a \"reasonably high crime area\u201d was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
