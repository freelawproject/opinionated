Evans was sentenced to 188 months incarceration, 3 years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Evans has timely appealed, raising two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-21\">First, Evans asserts the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, there is substantial evidence to support the conviction. <em>United States v. Glasser, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Evans\u2019 claim is meritless. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, witness testimony was sufficient to sustain Evans\u2019 conviction, and witness credibility is not subject to appellate review. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-22\">Second, Evans asserts the district court erred in issuing a supplemental instruction to the jury. We review the district court\u2019s instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Whittington, </em>26 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.1994). Evans\u2019 challenge to the supplemental instruction is also meritless. Evans fails to establish the instructions, taken as a whole, fail to state the controlling law. <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>905 F.2d 784, 788-89 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Evans\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
