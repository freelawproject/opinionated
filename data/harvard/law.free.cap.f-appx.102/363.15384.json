The BIA made the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination, so we review the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Manuela and the children argue that the IJ erred in concluding that they had not established eligibility for deportation because they had failed to establish the required seven years of continuous physical presence in the United States. Manuela first argues that her admission of the facts alleged in the order to show cause, particularly the alleged date of entry, conclusively establishes those facts. We are unpersuaded by her arguments, and we also note that the order to show cause alleged only that she and the children had entered the United States \u201con or about\u201d a specified date. We conclude that this admission did not establish the actual date she and the children entered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">Manuela next argues that her own testimony was sufficient to establish the date of entry and that the IJ erred by discounting her testimony because it was \u201cself-serving.\u201d The BIA has held that an alien\u2019s testimony should not be disregarded simply because it is \u201cself-serving.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Matter of S-A- </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1328, 1332 (2000) (citing cases). The BIA also has held, however: \u201cWe not only encourage, but require the introduction of corroborative testimonial and documentary evidence, where available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The alien bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>burden of demonstrating eligibility for suspension of deportation. <em>See Hernandez-Cordero v. INS, </em>819 F.2d 558, 560 (5th Cir.1987) (en banc). Our review of the record suggests that, contrary to Manuela\u2019s assertion, the IJ was more concerned with the lack of corroborating evidence than with the \u201cself-serving\u201d nature of her testimony. Manuela has not shown that the evidence in the record compels the contrary conclusion that she established the required seven years of continuous presence. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996) (under \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, findings will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">As the rest of the family was ineligible for suspension of deportation, the IJ concluded that Felix could not establish that he would suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if he too were denied suspension of deportation. We lack jurisdiction to review this conclusion. <em>See Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1012-13 (5th Cir.1999) (denials of suspension based on the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d element are discretionary decisions not subject to review).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">All members of the family challenge the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision, using the \u201cstreamlining\u201d provisions now found at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(i). We have held that the use of the summary affirmance procedures does not raise the inference that the BIA did not conduct the required review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003). In addition, summary affirmance without opinion is not permitted to include a discussion of the IJ\u2019s reasoning or a discussion of the arguments raised on appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii) (stating that an affirmance without opinion \u201cdoes not necessarily imply approval of all of the reasoning of\u2019 the decision below and that Board members are prohibited from including their own explanation or reasoning in the order).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The petition for review includes requests for costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (EAJA). An application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA must be accompanied by proof that the applicant has prevailed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.8.2(a). As we deny the petition for review, the petitioners do not qualify for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; REQUEST FOR COSTS AND FEES DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
