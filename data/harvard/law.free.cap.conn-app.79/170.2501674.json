The defendant claims that (1) the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof to warrant a postjudgment modification of child support as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the court improperly deviated from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>child support guidelines in \u00a7 46b-215a-l et seq. of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies in ordering a modification of the child support award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage on February 14, 1997, and incorporated the parties\u2019 separation agreement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> into its judgment of dissolution. The separation agreement included a parenting plan in which the parties agreed that they would share custody of their minor child and that the plaintiff would have primary physical custody of the child. Regarding child support, the agreement states: \u201c[The defendant] shall pay the sum of $260.00 per week as child support which is in accord with the guidelines of the State of Connecticut.\u201d On March 13, 2002, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the February 14, 1997 judgment of dissolution and to modify the order of child support. The court held a hearing on the motion on April 15, 2002. The defendant appeared pro se. Both parties submitted updated financial affidavits and testified subject to cross-examination. At the close of the hearing, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to open the dissolution judgment and modified the February 14, 1997 child support upward to $650 per week.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we set forth our well settled standard of review in domestic relations cases. We will generally not disturb an order unless the court has \u201cabused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in the facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ignacio </em>v. <em>Montana-Ignacio, </em>57 Conn. App. 647, 647-48, 750 A.2d 491 (2000). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. . . . [W]e do not review the evidence to determine whether a conclusion different from the one reached could have been reached.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) Hathaway v. Hathaway, </em>60 Conn. App. 818, 819, 760 A.2d 1280 (2000). Further, we must accept the factual findings of the court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented in the record as a whole. See <em>Prial </em>v. <em>Prial, </em>67 Conn. App. 7, 10, 787 A.2d 50 (2001). With that deferential standard in mind, we now turn to the specific claims raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s modification of child support was improper because the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof in seeking a postjudgment modification. We disagree and conclude that there was sufficient evidence of a substantial change in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances to warrant the court\u2019s modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 governs the modification of a child support order after the date of a dissolution judgment.\u201d <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>53 Conn. App. 1, 9, 752 A.2d 1087 (1999). \u201c[A] child support order cannot be modified unless there is (1) a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines absent the requisite findings. . . . The party seeking modification bears the burden of showing the existence of a substantial change in the circumstances. ... In these matters, as in other questions arising out of marital disputes, this court relies heavily on the exercise of sound discretion by the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>70 Conn. App. 212, 218-19, 797 A.2d 592 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cBoth the \u2018substantial change of circumstances\u2019 and the \u2018substantial deviation from child support guidelines\u2019 provision establish the authority of the trial court to modify existing child support orders to respond to changed economic conditions. The first allows the court to modify a support order when the financial circumstances of the individual parties have changed, regardless of their prior contemplation of such changes. The second allows the court to modify child support orders that were once deemed appropriate but no longer seem equitable in the light of changed social or economic circumstances in the society as a whole . . . .\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 718, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to provide the court with sufficient evidence either that a substantial change of circumstances had occurred since the February 14,1997 order of support or that the February 14, 1997 order was a substantial deviation from the child support guidelines. We first address the evidence of substantial change of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In his appellate brief, the defendant acknowledges that the record reflects \u201cchanges in the nature of the assets owned by the [defendant] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>however, that for the court properly to have found a substantial change of circumstances, it would have had to review those changes in light of the prior support order and that the court did not do so. The defendant\u2019s only support for his argument is, as he argues, that \u201cthe April 15, 2002 hearing is entirely devoid of reference to the financial affidavits or financial situation of the parties at the time of the prior order regarding payment of child support.\u201d We find that argument unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">First, the financial affidavits and any other relevant documents that the parties filed at the time of the dissolution, as well as financial affidavits subsequently filed by the parties, are in the court\u2019s case file. The court may take judicial notice of the contents of that file. See <em>Hryniewicz </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>51 Conn. App. 440, 444, 722 A.2d 288 (1999). Because we give every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s decision, we must assume, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, that the court properly considered the parties\u2019 financial circumstances as they were at the time of the prior child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Second, the defendant has failed to provide evidence that the court improperly exercised its discretion in ruling as it did. Although neither the court\u2019s order nor the transcript of the heating fully reveal the court\u2019s analysis or rationale for its decision, the defendant never sought further articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. It is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide an adequate record for review, including the seeking of an articulation of the court\u2019s decision. In light of our deferential standard of review and because the record as a whole reveals sufficient evidence from which the court reasonably could have found a signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>cant change in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude, absent evidence to the contrary, that the court relied on that ground in granting the plaintiffs motion and ordering a modification of child support. Having so concluded, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s additional arguments related to evidence of substantial deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant also claims that in modifying the child support upward to $650 per week, the court improperly deviated from the child support guidelines. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">It is undisputed that courts must <em>consider </em>the child support guidelines in all determinations of child support. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b (a). That includes postjudgment modifications of child support. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe child support and arrearage guidelines . . . shall be considered in all determinations of child support amounts and payment on arrearages and past due support within the state. . . . [T]here shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of such awards which resulted from the application of such guidelines is the amount of support ... to be ordered. A specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case, as determined under criteria established by the commission under section 46b-215a, shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in such case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Section 46b-215a-3 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies contains the deviation criteria established by the commission for child support guidelines. Further, \u00a7 46b-215a-3 provides that in addition to making a specific finding that following the guideline would be inequitable or inappropriate, the court must state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the amount that would have been required under the guidelines and the deviation criteria relied on by the court to justify deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In the present case, the court made an oral finding at the conclusion of the hearing that the defendant had \u201csubstantial assets, both income producing and not income producing,\u201d and \u201csubstantial financial resources that are not included in the definition of net income . . . .\u201d The regulation specifically provides that those are proper criteria for deviating from the guidelines\u2019 presumptive support amount. The court also found on the record that the guidelines provided for $288 per week and that \u201csuch an amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in this particular case</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The court made all the necessary findings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215a and the related regulations to rebut the presumption that the amount of support provided for under the child support guidelines was correct. The evidence presented at the hearing, specifically the testimony of the defendant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> supports the court\u2019s findings and, therefore, we conclude that the findings are not clearly erroneous. We further conclude, on the basis of those findings, that the court properly exercised its discretion in deviating from the guidelines and ordering the defendant to pay support of $650 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification . . . any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support . . . may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. . . . After the date of judgment, modification of any child support order issued before or after July 1, 1990, may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> \u201cThe guidelines are promulgated by the commission for child support guidelines . . . which was established by the legislature pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215a. [Section] 46b-215b (a) provides that the guidelines are to be considered in all determinations of child support in the state, and creates a rebuttable presumption that the amount of support calculated through application of the guidelines is the amount of support to be ordered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marrocco </em>v. <em>Giardino, </em>255 Conn. 617, 618 n.1, 767 A.2d 720 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> We note that the parties\u2019 separation agreement did not contain a nonmodification provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> The court\u2019s handwritten order simply stated: \u201cThe court finds $288 inappropriate in this case, given the discrepancy in [the] parties\u2019 respective incomes.

The defendant also testified that he had been voluntarily paying the plaintiff $670 per week in support, in excess of the court\u2019s order, although he claimed income of only $110,000 per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\"> See footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\"> See footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
