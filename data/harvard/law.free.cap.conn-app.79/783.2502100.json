On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) ordered him to pay child support in an amount that deviated from the child support guidelines, (2) ordered him to pay the plaintiff $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, (3) ordered him to maintain his present life insurance for the benefit of the parties\u2019 minor children, (4) ordered him to provide dental insurance for the minor children and (5) determined that it would retain jurisdiction over issues with respect to the property division. At oral argument, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether, pursuant to <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>181 Conn. 463, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980), the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order the defendant to make the minor children irrevocable beneficiaries of his life insurance. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant were married on March 26, 1976. The plaintiff commenced an action on December 19, 1998, seeking dissolution of the marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown. Neither party filed a child support guidelines worksheet<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as required by Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court rendered judgment of dissolution on February 7, 2001. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the time of the dissolution, the parties had three minor children, aged seventeen, fifteen and twelve. The court found that the defendant\u2019s infidelity, bizarre behavior and indifference to the needs of both the plaintiff and the children caused the breakdown of the marriage. The court ordered, inter alia, that the defendant provide health insurance, including dental coverage, for the children and maintain his life insurance for their benefit. The court further ordered the defendant to name the \u201cminor children\u201d as irrevocable beneficiaries of his life insurance and to provide the plaintiff, on an annual basis, with evidence that the insurance is effective. In addition, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $400 per week in child support as well as $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The court also ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff 50 percent of two individual retirement accounts (retirement accounts). Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly ordered him to pay child support in an amount that deviated from the child support guidelines. In support of his claim, the defendant argues that the court improperly (1) failed to make findings, including the amount of each party\u2019s gross income and the health insurance premiums paid by the defendant, that he asserts were necessary to the calculation of the presumptive amount of child support under the guidelines promulgated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b, (2) failed to determine the presumptive amount of child support and (3) failed to find that the presumptive amount of child support was inequitable pursuant to the factors set forth in the guidelines. In response, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s failure to file a child support guidelines worksheet with the court should preclude the defendant from complaining that the court failed to adhere to the guidelines. We agree with the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>and, accordingly, decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Our Supreme Court has emphasized that a court\u2019s adherence to the procedures set forth in the child support guidelines is necessary to facilitate appellate review. <em>See Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>231 Conn. 1, 29, 647 A.2d 731 (1994). Specifically, when a court deviates from the presumptive amount of support under the guidelines, it must first make a specific finding on the record as to the presumptive amount to \u201cenable an appellate court to compare the ultimate order with the guideline amount and make a more informed decision on a claim that the amount of the deviation, rather than the fact of a deviation, constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">When, as in the present case, the parties fail to file the required worksheets, the problem is compounded, as both the trial court and the reviewing court lack the guidance necessary to determine what the guidelines require in the particular case. The worksheets are specifically designed to provide an orderly mechanism for the presentation and calculation of the relevant information under the guidelines. Requiring the parties to use the worksheets ensures that all of the relevant information is provided in a format that facilitates and expedites the court\u2019s considerable task of applying the detailed requirements of the guidelines. Without that information in the form prescribed by the guidelines, the court is likely to be severely impaired in its task of determining the presumptive amount of support, as well as determining whether any factors might justify deviation from that amount and, if so, to what extent. Thus, the parties\u2019 failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (e) necessarily has a tendency to cause what the defendant claims has occurred in the present case, that is, a lack of the detailed findings that our Supreme Court has held are necessary for our appellate review. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>We conclude that a party who has failed to submit a child support guidelines worksheet as required by Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (e) cannot complain of the court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the guidelines. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim that the court did not follow the guidelines in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly ordered him to pay the plaintiff $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in ordering the attorney\u2019s fees because (1) it failed to make an explicit finding that denying the award would undermine the integrity of the court\u2019s other financial orders or that the plaintiff was unable to pay her fees, (2) he presented evidence that he already had paid $35,000 of the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees, and (3) the order was inconsistent with the court\u2019s findings that his health had deteriorated and that his income level was unlikely to be as high in the future as it had been in the past. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the plaintiff testified that she had paid one of her attorneys $3000 and had paid another attorney $7500, which she had borrowed from her parents. In addition, she testified that at the time of trial, she owed an additional $14,500 in legal fees for a total of $25,000. The plaintiff testified further that the defendant previously had paid her attorneys $35,000 to cover additional legal costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant also submitted documentation regarding the $35,000 payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the defendant, a licensed ophthalmologist, had earned an average net income of $70,000 to $80,000 per year, but that the defendant\u2019s health had \u201cdeteriorated to the point where his employment as an ophthalmologist is doubtful, at least on a full-time basis.\u201d The court concluded that the defendant was unlikely to \u201cearn in the future at the same level as he has in the past . . . .\u201d The court also stated, however, that \u201cto a large extent, [the defendant\u2019s] high spending levels have been underwritten by withdrawals from marital assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The court found that the plaintiffs employment prospects had been limited by her low level of education. The plaintiff had worked for the defendant throughout the parties\u2019 marriage, in both a full-time and part-time capacity, performing secretarial and bookkeeping services as well as other tasks such as cleaning the defendant\u2019s office. The plaintiff remained employed by the defendant until 1995, and the defendant had not always compensated her for her work which, the court noted, resulted in a lowering of her social security benefits. After 1995, the plaintiff had worked at other low paying jobs, but had never earned a weekly wage of more that $250. The court found that \u201c[b]ecause of [the plaintiffs] lack of education and work skills, it is unlikely that she will be able to earn more that $400 per week in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The court, in its financial orders, essentially divided the assets equally between the parties. In addition to its other financial orders, the court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $25,000 for her attorney\u2019s fees. The court stated that in fashioning its orders, it took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>into account the fact that the defendant previously had committed numerous violations of the court\u2019s automatic orders concerning the dissipation of assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a subsequent motion for articulation, the defendant asked the court to articulate the factual and legal basis for the court\u2019s award of $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The court provided the following articulation: \u201cThe evidence clearly indicated that the defendant had expended well over $70,000 for legal fees prior to the case being tried. Payment of the fees came from assets subject to distribution between the parties. The order of $25,000 payment to the plaintiff would still leave her with substantially less in legal fees that those incurred by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees in dissolution proceedings.\u201d <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 542, 752 A.2d 978 (1998). That section provides in part that \u201cthe court may order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in section 46b-82. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. \u201cThe criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82 are \u2018the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-81, and, in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability of such parent\u2019s securing employment.\u2019 In making an award of attorney\u2019s fees under [\u00a7 46b-62], \u2018[t]he court is not obligated to make express findings on each of these statutory criteria.\u2019 <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Weiman, </em>188 Conn. 232, 234, 449 A.2d 151 (1982).\u201d <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>supra, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u201cCourts ordinarily award counsel fees in divorce cases so that a party . . . may not be deprived of [his or] her rights because of lack of funds. . . . Where, because of other orders, both parties are financially able to pay their own counsel fees they should be permitted to do so. ... An exception to th[is] rule . . . is that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is justified even where both parties are financially able to pay their own fees if the failure to make an award would undermine [the court\u2019s] prior financial orders .... Whether to allow counsel fees [under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82], and if so in what amount, calls for the exercise of judicial discretion. . . . An abuse of discretion in granting counsel fees will be found only if [an appellate court] determines that the trial court could not reasonably have concluded as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>247 Conn. 356, 378, 752 A.2d 1000 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was improper because the court failed to make an explicit finding that denying the award would undermine the integrity of its other financial orders or that the plaintiff was unable to pay her fees. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, our Supreme Court has specifically held that such findings do not have to be explicit as long as the record would support a finding that the party to whom the award of attorney\u2019s fees is made lacks sufficient liquid assets with which to pay his or her attorney\u2019s fees or that the failure to award such fees would undermine the court\u2019s other financial orders. <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">In the present case, the defendant acknowledges in his brief that the judgment essentially divided the marital assets evenly between the parties. The court\u2019s articulation reveals its concern that the defendant previously had paid more than $70,000 of his legal fees out of assets that otherwise would have been subject to distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>between the parties. It therefore appears that the court viewed its award of $25,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff as a method of preventing the undermining of what it intended to be an even distribution of the marital assets between the parties. In other words, the court appears to have preserved the integrity of its other financial orders by ordering the defendant to pay $25,000 of the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees, thereby compensating for his previous use of marital assets to pay his attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The court reasonably could have concluded that the failure to award the plaintiff $25,000 in legal fees would have undermined the court\u2019s other financial orders, which essentially sought to achieve a fifty-fifty distribution of the marital property. Moreover, such a distribution was entirely reasonable in light of the court\u2019s findings regarding the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage, the parties\u2019 relative education, skills, employability and earning capacities, and the defendant\u2019s dissipation of the parties\u2019 assets. The fact that the defendant previously had paid $35,000 of the plaintiffs legal fees does not change that conclusion. As stated, the plaintiffs testimony indicated that the $35,000 represented legal fees that the plaintiff incurred in addition to the $25,000 represented by the court\u2019s award. See footnote 3. Furthermore, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, his declining health and decreased earning capacity were only two of the many factors that the court was bound to consider in making its determination. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82. The court was not required to view those isolated factors as dispositive. Consequently, the award of attorney\u2019s fees did not constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly ordered him to maintain his present Ufe insurance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the benefit of the minor children. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s order was improper in light of his testimony that he expected the cost of his insurance to increase. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to that issue. At trial, the defendant testified that he had two life insurance policies with the children as his beneficiaries. The defendant testified that to the best of his understanding, the premiums on both policies would increase in three years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u201cOur standar d of review in a domestic relations case is well settled. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court and will not disturb an order of the trial court absent an abuse of discretion or findings lacking a reasonable basis in the facts. . . . An order for life insurance is very often an appropriate and necessary component of a judgment of dissolution of marriage. . . . Such an order, however, must have a reasonable basis in the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quindazzi </em>v. <em>Quindazzi, </em>56 Conn. App. 336, 338, 742 A.2d 838 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The sole authority cited by the defendant in support of his claim is <em>Quindazzi </em>v. <em>Quindazzi, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 336. In that case, we concluded that the trial court improperly had ordered a party to a dissolution action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>maintain life insurance for his children because \u201c[t]here was no evidence that the defendant had a life insurance policy at the time of the dissolution, nor was there any evidence of his insurability or the cost of the insurance as of that time.\u201d Id., 338; see also <em>Papa </em>v. Papa, 55 Conn. App. 47, 50-51, 737 A.2d 953 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Quindazzi </em>and <em>Papa </em>because the defendant\u2019s testimony established that he had life insurance at the time of the dissolution. We have held that where a life insurance policy is in existence as the time of the judgment, the court has available to it all of the information necessary to craft an appropriate order regarding such insurance. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>61 Conn. App. 791, 805, 769 A.2d 725 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The defendant nevertheless asserts that the court\u2019s order was unreasonable because of his testimony that he expected his insurance premiums to increase in the years following the dissolution. The defendant\u2019s argument fails to recognize that \u201c[i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony and, therefore, is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiVito </em>v. <em>DiVito, </em>77 Conn. App. 124, 138, 822 A.2d 294, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 921, 828 A.2d 617 (2003). The court was not required to believe the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding future increases in the cost of his life insurance. In light of the undisputed fact that the defendant had life insurance at the time of the dissolution, the court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered him to maintain that insurance for the benefit of the children, notwithstanding his speculation that the cost might increase in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly ordered him to provide dental insurance for the minor children. Specifically, the defendant claims that the order was improper because there was no evidence regarding the availability and cost of such insurance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The following facts are relevant to that claim. At trial, the defendant testified that he had maintained dental insurance for the family for fifteen to twenty years until he canceled it in 1999. He had obtained the insurance through the Hartford County Medical Association, of which he was a member. He testified that if he had continued the dental coverage instead of canceling it, it would have cost him $1800 per year to cover the entire family, including the plaintiff and the children. In addition, the defendant testified that he was still a member of the Hartford County Medical Association because he had to keep that membership active to remain eligible for his medical insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The defendant relies on <em>Lake </em>v. Lake, 49 Conn. App. 89, 91, 712 A.2d 989, cert. denied, 246 Conn. 902, 719 A.2d 1166 (1998), for the proposition that it is improper for a court to order such insurance without evidence of the cost or availability of such insurance. <em>Lake </em>is distinguishable, however, because in the present case, there was evidence from which the court could have concluded that dental insurance was available and affordable. The court had before it evidence that the defendant previously had maintained dental insurance for the family through the medical association of which he was still a member at the time of trial. The defendant also testified as to the cost of such insurance if he had continued it. The defendant does not cite any evidence suggesting that the insurance subsequently had become unavailable or unaffordable, other than his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>that he canceled the insurance in 1999 after the commencement of the dissolution action. Consequently, the court had an evidentiary basis for its factual determination that dental insurance was available and affordable, and the court\u2019s order requiring the defendant to obtain and to maintain such insurance for the children did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly determined that it would retain jurisdiction over issues with respect to the property division. We find no merit in that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The court, in its memorandum of decision, ordered the defendant to transfer 50 percent of two retirement accounts to the plaintiff by way of a qualified domestic relations order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With regard to each of the ordered transfers, the court stated: \u201cThe court shall retain jurisdiction.\u201d In addition, after listing several items of personal property to be retained by the defendant and ordering him to remove those items from the parties\u2019 home, the court stated: \u201cThe court shall retain jurisdiction in the event that the parties are in disagreement as to the distribution of the items specified above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The defendant bases his claim that the court improperly retained jurisdiction on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999). In <em>Smith, </em>the court held that the Superior Court has statutory authority to retain continuing jurisdiction over orders for the periodic payment of permanent alimony, but not over lump sum alimony or property distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>buttons pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81. Id., 273. Accordingly, the trial court in that case improperly attempted to retain continuing jurisdiction in order to divide the plaintiffs interest in a certain trust if ever he were to be found to hold such an interest. Id., 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In the present case, by contrast, the court did not attempt to retain jurisdiction to make any future orders regarding property division. With regard to the retirement accounts, the court merely retained jurisdiction to ensure the proper execution of qualified domestic relations orders, the purpose of which was to effectuate the court\u2019s orders dividing the accounts evenly, which orders the court entered at the time of dissolution. Similarly, with regard to the items of personal property that the court ordered the defendant to remove from the marital home, the court clearly stated that it retained jurisdiction only \u201cin the event that the parties are in disagreement as to the distribution of the items . . . .\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction was simply for the limited purpose of effectuating the orders rendered at the time of dissolution. The court did not attempt to retain jurisdiction to make any additional orders regarding the division of property in the future. Consequently, the court\u2019s limited retention of jurisdiction did not run afoul of <em>Smith </em>and was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Finally, we address the issue on which we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs, namely, whether the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order the defendant to make the minor children irrevocable beneficiaries of his life insurance. Specifically, we sought clarification on whether the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to <em>Broaca </em>v. Broaca, supra, 181 Conn. 463, because the order constituted an impermissible order of postmajority sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>port. We conclude that the court did not order postmajority support.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We first note that we may address the issue although the defendant did not raise it in his principal brief. \u201c[A] subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived . . . [or] conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . [T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law [which may be] raised, either by a party or by the court itself . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim </em>Co., 263 Conn. 328, 337, 819 A.2d 803 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">As stated, the court ordered the defendant to name the \u201cminor children\u201d as irrevocable beneficiaries of his life insurance and to provide the plaintiff, on an annual basis, with evidence that the insurance is effective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court held in <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 463, that a trial court exceeds its subject matter jurisdiction when it makes an order of support requiring a parent to name the parties\u2019 children as irrevocable beneficiaries of a life insurance policy. That conclusion was based on the language of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84, pursuant to which the parental duty of support extends only to a \u201cminor child.\u201d See id., 465-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">We conclude that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Broaca </em>because the order in the present case, when viewed in its entirety, is not an order of postmajority support. On the contrary, we conclude that the court\u2019s order, when read in its entirety, requires the defendant to maintain each child as an irrevocable beneficiary of his life insurance only until such time as that child reaches the age of majority. In that respect, we note that \u201c[t]he construction of a judgment is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>of law for the court. ... As a general rule, judgments are to be construed in the same fashion as other written instruments. . . . The determinative factor is the intention of the court as gathered from all parts of the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>28 Conn. App. 794, 806, 613 A.2d 1351, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 915, 617 A.2d 171 (1992). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision specifically orders the defendant to \u201cmaintain his present life insurance for the benefit of the <em>minor </em>children . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) That language may reasonably be interpreted to mean that the defendant was required to maintain his life insurance for the benefit of each child only as long as that child is a minor. Such a reading is supported by the second sentence of the court\u2019s life insurance order, which provides that the defendant \u201cshall, on an annual basis, provide the plaintiff with evidence that the insurance is effective.\u201d We are not persuaded that the court intended to require the defendant to provide the plaintiff with proof of insurance every year, even after the children are adults and the parties\u2019 duty to provide support has terminated, because such an order would serve no purpose. The more sensible construction of the order is that the defendant has a duty to provide life insurance with respect to each individual child only while that child is a minor. That construction, by precluding the court\u2019s order from running afoul of <em>Broaca, </em>also effectuates the principle that we indulge every presumption in favor of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We conclude that the court\u2019s order requires the defendant to maintain his life insurance for the benefit of the children only until each child reaches the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>majority. The court\u2019s order therefore did not constitute an impermissible order of postmajority support.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\"> The child support guidelines worksheet is set forth in \u00a7 46b-215a-5a of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 25-30 (e) provides: \u201cWhere there is a minor child who requires support, the parties shall file a completed child support and arrearage guidelines worksheet at the time of any court hearing concerning child support; or at the time of a final hearing in an action for dissolution of marriage, legal separation, annulment, custody or visitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\"> The plaintiff testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And this past spring, did I get some additional money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: How much did I get and from whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: You got $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: From your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And this past summer did Judge Dranginis order [that] I receive an additional $25,000 retainer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-11\">\u201c[The Plaintiff]: Yes.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\"> See Practice Book \u00a7 25-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> The defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: In one of [the policies], I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s Midland or Transamerica, when I be \u2014 in three years it will go up to [$12,000]\u2014 $13,000 a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: In three years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-13\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Now, how about the other?
