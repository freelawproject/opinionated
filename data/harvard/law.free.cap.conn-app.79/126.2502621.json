Barksdale, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial to the jury, of three counts of sexual assault in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), three counts of risk of injury to a child by committing an act that was likely to impair the health and morals of a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 (1), and three counts of risk of injury to a child by having contact with the intimate parts of a child younger than sixteen years of age in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 (2). The defendant received a total effective sentence of twenty years in prison. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) he was denied the right to a fair trial because the court failed to instruct the jury on every element of the crime of risk of injury to a child pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 (2) and (2) twenty years incarceration for the commission of a class C felony is an illegal sentence. We conclude that the court\u2019s jury instruction did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial, but that he was illegally sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In January, 1998, the victim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was thirteen years old and an eighth grade student. At that time, the victim began to attend a therapeutic program at a hosptial during the afternoons. The defendant was the operator of a large van that enabled the victim and others to travel to the hosptial. He called for the victim at her school at noon. He also conveyed the victim from the hospital to her home after 5 p.m. The defendant, who was twenty-eight years old, and the victim got to know one another. He told her about his family, showed her his tattoos, and played basketball with her and the other students.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The defendant did not always take the victim directly to the hospital from school. On the first occasion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>defendant deviated from the established route by purchasing cigarettes, driving to a beach and inquiring of the victim whether she smoked marijuana. After the two of them smoked marijuana, they called for the other students. The defendant provided the victim with marijuana on at least two more occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">At some time during January, 1998, the victim asked the defendant whether he would have sexual relations with her. After hesitating initially, the defendant agreed. That evening after taking the other students home, the defendant took the victim to the parking lot of a hotel and had vaginal intercourse with her. Twice more, after first taking the other students home, the defendant took the victim to a secluded location and engaged in vaginal intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">After receiving telephone calls from the parents of two of the victim\u2019s friends, the victim\u2019s mother withdrew the victim from the program at the hospital. The victim had confided her relationship with the defendant to two of her friends, but at first denied the relationship to her parents, to officials at the hospital and to the police. Approximately one year later, the victim admitted that the defendant had given her marijuana and had had sexual intercourse with her on three occasions. The defendant denied having had sexual relations with the victim and having given her marijuana. Thus, the question for the jury to decide was one of credibility. Other facts will be discussed as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court, <em>McKeever, </em>J.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deprived him of the right to a fair trial by failing to instruct the jury on all of the elements of \u00a7 53-21 (2). Specifically, he claims that the court failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>to instruct the jury that to find the defendant guilty of risk of injury to a child under subdivision (2) of the statute, it had to find that he had had contact with the intimate parts of the victim in a sexual and indecent manner. He also claims that the court instructed the jury with respect to \u00a7 53-21 (1) rather than to \u00a7 53-21 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the defendant failed to preserve his claim at trial, he has asked us to review his claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the plain error doctrine set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>We conclude that although the court failed to instruct the jury on one of the elements of the statute, which is a clear constitutional violation; <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>244 Conn. 226, 235, 710 A.2d 732 (1998); the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court\u2019s standard of review regarding claims of improper jury instruction is well established. [A] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>76 Conn. App. 653, 677, 820 A.2d 1122 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u201c[A]n accused has a fundamental right, protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions, to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 308, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). \u201cIt is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. . . . [T]he failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 483-84, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201cAn alleged defect in a jury charge which raises a constitutional question is reversible error if it is reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ably possible that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallichio, </em>71 Conn. App. 179, 184, 800 A.2d 1261 (2002). \u201c[A] jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if \u2018a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by the overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error ....\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 738, 759 A.2d 995 (2000), quoting <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our review of the defendant\u2019s claim. In its amended information, the state charged the defendant in counts one, four and seven with sexual assault in the second degree, alleging in relevant part that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim, who was a person thirteen years of age, but younger than sixteen years of age, and that he was more than two years older than she was, in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). In parallel counts three, six and nine, the defendant was charged with risk of injury to a child by <em>having contact with the intimate parts of the victim, </em>a child younger than sixteen years of age, in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2). The jury had the amended information while it was deliberating.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The court instructed the jury as to the charges of sexual assault in the second degree, stating that \u00a7 53a-71a (1), \u201cas it is pertinent to this case, provides that a person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is thirteen years of age or older, but under sixteen years of age, and the actor is more than two years older than such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that sexual intercourse has taken place. Sexual intercourse in this case means vaginal intercourse. Its meaning is limited to persons not married to each other, and penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse and does not require the emission of semen.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">After the court instructed the jury on sexual assault in the second degree, it instructed the jury on the charges of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1), which pertained to the defendant\u2019s having given the victim marijuana. Immediately thereafter, the court instructed the jury as follows relevant to the charges under \u00a7 53-21 (2): \u201cThis statute here, in pertinent part, reads, any person who does any act likely to impair the morals of a child under the age of sixteen years shall be punished. To find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: That at the time of the incident, the alleged victim was under the age of sixteen years, that the defendant did an act that was likely to impair the health or morals of the child and that the defendant had the general intent to perform such act.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u201cThe conduct to be punished must involve a child under the age of sixteen. The statute also requires that the defendant did any act likely to impair the morals of the child. To establish that the defendant committed an act likely to impair the morals of a child, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>dant acted in a sexual and indecent manner. The act itself must be done in a sexual and indecent manner. <em>Innocent touching is not violative of the statute. </em>It is not the act itself that is likely to impair the morals of the child, but the manner in which it is done. Therefore, the inquiry under this second provision is whether the defendant did any act in a sexual and indecent manner that was likely to impair the morals of the child. Again, however, the defendant need not have had the specific intent to impair the morals of the child, only the general intent to perform the sexual and indecent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u201cAs used here, morals means good morals, living, acting and thinking in accordance with those principles and precepts which are commonly accepted among us as right and decent. The state must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the general intent to perform such act. General intent is the intent to do that which the law prohibits. It is not necessary for the state to prove that the defendant intended the precise harm or the precise result which eventuated. In other words, general intent is at least an intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires. Therefore, where the definition of a crime requires some forbidden act by the defendant, in this case, an act likely to impair the morals of the child, the defendant\u2019s bodily movement, to qualify the act, must be voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The charge failed to inform the jury that the state was required to prove that the defendant had contact with the intimate parts of the victim and failed to define intimate parts. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8) defines the term intimate parts as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">For resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim, we do not ignore the fact that the jury convicted the defendant of three counts of sexual assault in the second degree as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>a result of his having engaged in sexual intercourse with the thirteen year old victim. The jury, having found that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim, necessarily had to find, by exercise of its common sense, that he had had contact with her genital area. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 795, 772 A.2d 559 (2001) (by virtue of finding defendant guilty of robbery in first degree and burglary in first degree, jury necessarily found defendant had committed class B felonies).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On appeal, the defendant does not contest the jury\u2019s verdict on the primary issue in the case, which was whether he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim. In fact, in his brief, the defendant concedes that the jury found that he had contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts when it convicted him of sexual assault in the second degree. In making that concession, the defendant acknowledged that the issue of whether he had had contact with the intimate parts of the victim pursuant to the counts of the information alleging that he had violated \u00a7 53-21 (2) was uncontested and supported by the overwhelming evidence. The issue in the sexual assault count was whether the defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim, not the definition of intimate parts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 737-38.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In addition, the defendant has argued that because the court\u2019s instruction that to find him guilty, the jury had to find that he had done an act that impaired the health or morals of the victim, it was not possible to lmow which act the jury found to be in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2). The defendant notes that the state presented evidence that he had done a number of things of a sexual nature that did not involve contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the jury could have found him guilty on the basis of those acts rather than on the basis of having had contact with the intimate parts of the victim. That argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, the court made reference to a touching in distinguishing an innocent touching from a touching that is sexual and indecent. The jury also had the amended information with it during deliberations. The relevant counts allege that the defendant had contact with the intimate parts of a child younger than sixteen years of age. The jury, therefore, was not possibly misled as to the sexual act to which the court was referring.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Within his claim of instructional error, the defendant also argues that even if he had had contact with the victim\u2019s private parts, the state produced no evidence that the victim\u2019s health or morals were impaired.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The short answer to that argument is that the state did not have to prove that the victim\u2019s health or morals were impaired. Section 53-21 provides in relevant part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201c[a]ny person who ... (2) has contact with the intimate parts ... of a child ... in a sexual and indecent manner <em>likely </em>to impair the health or morals of such child, shall be guilty of a class C felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant has not challenged the court\u2019s thorough instruction on the <em>\u201clikely </em>to impair the health or morals\u201d element of the statute, only the evidence to support the charge. When charging the jury on that portion of the statute, the court stated in relevant part: \u201cTo establish that the defendant committed an act likely to impair the morals of a child, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted in a sexual and indecent manner. The act itself must be done in a sexual and indecent manner. <em>Innocent touching </em>is not violative of the statute. It is not the act itself that is likely to impair the morals of the child, but the manner in which it is done. Therefore, the inquiry under this second provision is whether the defendant did any act in a sexual and indecent manner that as likely to impair the morals of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court then defined morals for the jury. It was for the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s touching of the intimate parts of the victim was in accordance with the principles and precepts that are commonly accepted among us as right and decent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s improper jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the verdict was supported by overwhelming evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 738. It was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction on the charges alleged pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 (2). Furthermore, the improper instruction was not plain error. The instruction did not affect the fairness and integrity of or threaten to undermine the public\u2019s confidence in our judicial system. Cf. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>v. <em>Hair, </em>68 Conn. App. 695, 705, 792 A.2d 179, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 925, 797 A.2d 522 (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that he was sentenced illegally under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). The state concedes that the sentence was illegal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim is one of law, and our review is therefore plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>40 Conn. App. 643, 654, 673 A.2d 530, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 924, 677 A.2d 950 (1996). Subsequent to the verdict, the court, <em>Rodriguez, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentenced the defendant. As to the defendant\u2019s conviction of three counts of having violated \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the court sentenced him to twenty years in the custody of the commissioner of correction, execution suspended after four years, with twenty years of probation on each of the three counts of sexual assault in the second degree. The sentences were to be served concurrently.. On appeal, the defendant claims that he was sentenced illegally under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) because at the time he committed the assault, the violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) was a class C felony for which the maximum period of incarceration was ten years.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (6). The defendant is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The defendant has raised his claim for the first time on appeal. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides that \u2018[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Constantopolous, </em>68 Conn. App. 879, 882, 793 A.2d 278, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 927, 798 A.2d 971 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201cAn illegal sentence is essentially one which either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictoiy. . . . The remedies available for correcting an illegal sentence include reconstructing the sentence to conform to its original intent or to the plea agreement, eliminating a sentence previously imposed for a vacated conviction or resentencing a defendant if it is determined that the original sentence was illegal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because the defendant was sentenced illegally, we remand the case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the sentence on the conviction of three counts of having violated \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and the case is remanded for resentencing according to law.

In <em>Hair, </em>the defendant was charged with violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c, but the court instructed the jury on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hair, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 703. Here, the jury necessarily found that the defendant had touched the intimate parts of the victim when it convicted him of sexual assault in the second degree. In <em>Hair, </em>the jury did not make an implicit finding of fact on an element of the crime with which the defendant was charged. Id., 704. Consequently, <em>Hair </em>does not apply to facts here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> Judge Rodriguez was substituted as the trial court for postverdict proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\"> For informational purposes only, we note that in 2002, the legislature amended subsection (b) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 to change the classification of a violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) from a class C felony to a class B felony.
