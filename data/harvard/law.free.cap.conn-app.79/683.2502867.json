The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the court committed plain error when it presided over the revocation of probation hearing after having participated actively in pretrial plea negotiations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On October 24, 2000, the defendant, through his public defender, pleaded nolo contendere to two separate charges of operating under the influence on two separate occasions in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a and was sentenced by the court to a total effective term of thirty months of imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-four months, and one year of probation with special conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The special conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation were the same with respect to both violations and included, inter alia, substance abuse screening, evaluation and treatment as recommended by the probation officer, a total of 200 hours of community service and no operation of a motor vehicle while the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On or about October 4, 2001, the defendant was released from prison and began serving his probation. After the defendant refused to participate in an alcohol treatment program, his probation officer applied for arrest warrants for violation of probation on December 10, 2001. On December 11, 2001, the defendant was arraigned on two criminal matters, criminal trespass in the first degree and interfering with an officer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> respectively, and the court appointed a public defender as his counsel. On December 18, 2001, the defendant was arraigned on the violation of probation matters and denials were entered. At that time, the court appointed the public defender who was handling the defendant\u2019s criminal matters to represent him in the violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>probation matters. Thereafter, the court held several scheduled proceedings, often involving both the criminal and the violation of probation matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On January 15, 2002, the defendant appeared in court with his counsel and indicated that he wanted to represent himself. The court told the defendant that before allowing him to represent himself, it was going to order a competency examination. On February 27,2002, when the defendant appeared in court with his counsel, the court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>made an uncontested finding of competency based on the competency report in the file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again, the defendant raised the issue of self-representation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>allowed the defendant\u2019s counsel to withdraw from the violation of probation and criminal cases, and, on the same date, the defendant filed a pro se appearance in those cases. On March 20, 2002, the court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>the prosecutor and the defendant engaged in an on the record plea discussion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The defendant refused any offered plea bargain and insisted on exercising his \u201cright for a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On April 3,2002, the defendant again appeared before Judge Clifford for the violation of probation hearing. Although Judge Clifford recalled having some discussion with the defendant previously in the case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ceeded to canvass the defendant on the issue of self-representation and advised the defendant of, inter alia, the state\u2019s burden of proof in the case and the defendant\u2019s various constitutional rights. The defendant indicated that he was \u201cprepared to continue\u201d and to \u201cgo forward,\u201d and there was no mention by anyone of Judge Clifford\u2019s recusal. Thereafter, the hearing commenced and concluded, and Judge Clifford found that the defendant did violate a condition of his probation and that the beneficial aspects of probation were no longer being served. Judge Clifford sentenced the defendant to the remaining six months of imprisonment previously suspended on the sentence for the underlying motor vehicle offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The defendant claims that his violation of probation hearing was unlawfully conducted by the same judge who conducted plea bargaining on that charge in violation of canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The defendant argues that this deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. The defendant contends that the trial judge had a responsibility to recuse himself and, thus, although the defendant did not file a motion to recuse the judge, the error is reviewable under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the plain error doctrine pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The state argues that we should not review the question of the propriety of the judge\u2019s participation in the probation revocation hearing because it is not properly before us, as the defendant failed to file a motion for the judge\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1-23.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state maintains that neither plain error review nor review under <em>Golding </em>is appropriate. The state contends, moreover, that by failing to raise the issue of Judge Clifford\u2019s disqualification at the hearing, the defendant consented to the judge\u2019s participation under General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c). Although the state is correct in asserting that this court will not normally review claims that have not been preserved for appeal adequately, we conclude that plain error review is warranted in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u201cIt is well established that plain error review is exercised in only the most limited of circumstances. Such review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and <em>public confidence in the judicial </em>proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>68 Conn. App. 884, 887, 793 A.2d 274, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 924, 797 A.2d 521 (2002). We conclude that plain error review is warranted \u201cbecause the fairness and integrity of the hearing as well as public confidence in judicial proceedings is involved.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 179, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 887 (plain error review warranted because impropriety of court presiding over trial and sentencing after having actively participated in pretrial plea negotiations \u201cis so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of the public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\u201cOur Supreme Court has stated that a trial court\u2019s failure to follow the mandatory provisions of a statute prescribing trial procedures or to follow a procedural rule constitutes plain error. . . . Canon 3 [c] (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The reasonableness standard is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances. . . . <em>Even in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial </em>authority.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 887-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Although pretrial or plea negotiations play a critical role in the criminal justice system, and the disposition of charges after plea discussions is highly desirable, judicial participation in pretrial plea negotiations frequently has been criticized. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 505-506, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 888; <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 180-81. In fact, \u201cmany jurisdictions bar judges from active participation in plea negotiations.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 506 &amp; n.22, citing Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>R. Crim. P. 11 (e) (1), Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-7-302 (1) (2000), Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 9.94A.080 (West 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In Connecticut, however, \u201c[i]t is a common practice . . . for the presiding criminal judge to conduct plea negotiations with the parties. If plea discussions ultimately do not result in a plea agreement, the trial of the case is assigned to a second judge who was not involved in the plea discussions and who is unaware of the terms of any plea bargain offered to the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge responsible for trying the case also is responsible for sentencing the defendant in the event the defendant is convicted after trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 508 n.25. \u201c[A]s long as the defendant is free to reject the plea offer [made after negotiations conducted by one judge] and go to trial before a [second] judge who was not involved in or aware of those negotiations, [the defendant] is not subject to any undue pressure to agree to the plea agreement, and the impartiality of the judge who will sentence him in the event of conviction after trial is not compromised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 507-508, quoting <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 194 n.16, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We conclude that the court committed plain error when it presided over the defendant\u2019s violation of probation hearing after having participated actively in plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>negotiations with the defendant. The record discloses that during the plea negotiations, the court itself understood that it had participated actively in such a way as to make clear that a different judge would necessarily preside over the defendant\u2019s violation of probation hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although it seems unlikely, on the basis of the record, that at the time of the hearing, the court recalled the nature of its previous involvement,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we need not find, nor do we find, actual bias or prejudice on the part of the court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 460-61, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 182; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889. Because the court presided over the hearing after actively participating in plea negotiations, the appearance of a fair trial was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We disagree with the state\u2019s contention that by failing to raise the issue of Judge Clifford\u2019s disqualification at the violation of probation hearing, the defendant consented to the judge\u2019s participation in the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and thereby waived appellate review of the issue. The state\u2019s argument is predicated on cases such as <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 487 A.2d 191 (1985), which stated that the failure \u201cto raise the issue of the [judge\u2019s] disqualification either before or during the trial, can be construed as the functional equivalent of \u2018consent in open court\u2019 to [the judge\u2019s] presiding over the trial\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c). Id., 205. The cases relied on by the state in support of its argument, however, are inapposite.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> None of them renders plain error review of a claimed violation of canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct inappropriate on the basis of \u00a7 51-39 (c) where the claimed violation implicates a judge\u2019s responsibility to recuse himself from presiding over a defendant\u2019s trial after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>having participated actively in plea negotiations with the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As noted previously, that responsibility has recently been underscored by our Supreme Court and by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 506; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We conclude that the existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected when a court presides over the violation of probation hearing after having participated actively in plea negotiations. In this case, the appearance of a fair trial has been lost and a new revocation of probation hearing is warranted. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 182; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The judgments are reversed and the cases are remanded for a new revocation of probation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-12\"> The defendant raised an additional claim, which we do not reach in view of our resolution. The defendant claimed that the court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>improperly canvassed the defendant so that he was unable to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel, which rendered him without counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> On the same date, the defendant also pleaded nolo contendere to one count of disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 and was sentenced to sixty days imprisonment, running concurrently with the sentence for the motor vehicle offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> For the details of the defendant\u2019s appeal from his ensuing convictions of criminal trespass in the first degree and two counts of interfering with an officer, see <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>79 Conn. App. 696, 830 A.2d 1196 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> The defendant and his counsel informed the court that he waived any competency hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\"> The defendant indicated that he would accept standby counsel if the court wanted that. The court established that the defendant had never represented himself before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\"> During the plea negotiations, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: This matter ... I did check with probation. [The defendant\u2019s sentence] is not consecutive. It was a concurrent sentence. So, I just wanted to be sure. He owes six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">\u201cThe Court: You representing yourself, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s never a smart move. I\u2019m the one who sentenced you [on the motor vehicle offenses] originally, right? You\u2019ve got thirty months, suspended after twenty-four months, correct? You\u2019ve got two [violations of probation], which, basically, you owe six months on that. You\u2019ve got a trespass [in the first degree for which] you can get up to a year; interfering [with an officer], you can get up to a year. Your exposure is two and one-half years. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes. I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">\u201cThe Court: Is there any offer from the state on these?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Prior to the [violation of probation], one year execution suspended, six months probation on the criminal trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-18\">\u201cThe Court: One year what? Suspended sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-19\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: It was six months and \u2014 one year after six months. And then there was no offer on the interfering and the [violations of probation].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cThe Court: But if it was known he was on probation, would the offer still be like a year after six months, if he was interested in that?

Let me just say this sir. I know you are representing yourself. You know, violation of probation, with all due respect, you don\u2019t\u2014 they\u2019re not that hard to prove. You do something on probation, they violate the terms of it, that\u2019s six months right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I\u2019m entitled to a hearing; I\u2019m sure of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cThe Court: Listen. I\u2019m trying to help you. Okay. What I\u2019m trying to tell you, it\u2019s not hard to prove those. You go to a hearing on that \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not that difficult. You\u2019re not even in front of a jury. It\u2019s in front of a judge. If the judge finds you in violation, bingo, you\u2019ve got six months. The offer is a year after six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">\u201c[The Defendant,]: I got three months in now, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well, at the time of the arrest the police removed $500 from my front pocket, which would\u2019ve been my bond money for that particular\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re not hearing me.

You can have your right to a trial. I\u2019m just telling you to use some common sense. Okay. You\u2019ve already got a lot of time. If you want to have your trial, you can end up doing two and a half years. You owe six months on the probation. The offer is six months in jail. You\u2019ve got three months in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-16\">\u201c[The Defendant]: That was only on the [violation of probation] offer\u2014 files.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>261 Conn. 198, 216, 802 A.2d 74 (2002). In the present case, even if the defendant\u2019s sentence has been completed, there is a reasonable possibility that the same prejudicial collateral consequences identified in <em>McElveen </em>would result from the defendant\u2019s probation revocation. See id., 213-16. Accordingly, because we have determined that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will flow from the revocation of the defendant\u2019s probation, his appeal is not moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant may prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if <em>aU </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 1-23 provides: \u201cAmotion to disqualify ajudicial authority shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification and a certificate of the counsel of record that the motion is made in good faith. The motion shall be filed no less than ten days before the time the case is called for trial or hearing, unless good cause is shown for failure to file within such time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The state\u2019s additional claim that the plea negotiations did not encompass the violation of probation charges is without merit. See footnote 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> As noted, the defendant failed to preserve his claim and requested review pursuant to either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, or the plain error doctrine. Because we find that a nonconstitutional ground existed with regard to whether it was plain error for the court to preside over this case after having participated actively in plea negotiations, we need not decide the constitutional claim. We conduct a plain error review rather than a <em>Golding </em>review because \u201c[t]his court, has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>dispose of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 176-77 n.3, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 175-79, the defendant, who had been serving a five year term of probation after having pleaded guilty to a narcotics related charge, appealed from the judgment of the trial court revoking his probation and imposing a sentence of five years imprisonment with no probation following his arrest for a variety of alleged offenses. Although the defendant failed to file a motion for the judge\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 997, now \u00a7 1-23, and failed to seek plain error review of the propriety of the court\u2019s participation in plea negotiations and the probation revocation hearing, we determined that our sua sponte invocation of plain error review was warranted. Id., 175-81. We held that the court committed plain error in presiding over the probation revocation hearing after having actively participated in plea negotiations with the defendant, the appearance of a fair trial having been lost. Id., 181-82. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for a new revocation of probation hearing. Id., 183.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 884-87, the defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, claiming, for the first time on appeal, that the trial court improperly had presided over his trial and sentencing after having actively participated in plea negotiations two years earlier. We afforded plain error review and held that because the existence of impartial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ity might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected, the trial judge committed plain error in failing to recuse himself. Id., 887-89. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Id., 889.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> \u201cIndeed, on those occasions when [our Supreme Court] has addressed claims regarding the active participation in plea bargaining by the judge responsible for trying the case and for sentencing the defendant in the event of a conviction, [it has] underscored the inappropriateness of such conduct due to its inherent dangers.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 506, citing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>inter alia, <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 194 n.16, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992), <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 47, 475 A.2d 269 (1984). \u201cThose dangers are that (1) the trial judge\u2019s impartiality may truly be compromised by his [or her] own perception of a personal stake in the agreement, resulting in resentment of the defendant who rejects [the judge\u2019s] suggested disposition, (2) the defendant may make incriminating concessions during the course of plea negotiations, and (3) the trial judge may become or appear to become an advocate for his [or her] suggested resolution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 506 n.23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> Our Supreme Court has \u201capproved judicial involvement in plea discussions when it is clear to all concerned parties that, in the event a plea agreement is not reached, the judge involved in the plea negotiations <em>will play no role </em>in the ensuing trial, including the imposition of sentence upon conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 506-507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> pecifically, following the unsuccessful round of plea negotiations, which included a lengthy exchange between the court and the defendant, the court stated, inter alia: \u201cFine.
