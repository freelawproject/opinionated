By way of two substitute informations with separate docket numbers, the defendant was charged with, inter alia, (1) one count of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (1) in connection with an incident that allegedly occurred on December 9, 2001, and (2) two counts of interfering with an officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167a (a) in connection with incidents that allegedly occurred on December 10, 2001. Each of the charges relates to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unwanted presence in his mother\u2019s home and the defendant\u2019s conduct when he was arrested there. The cases ultimately were consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The defendant was arraigned in those cases on December 11, 2001, and the court appointed a public defender as his counsel. On December 18, 2001, the defendant was arraigned on violation of probation charges stemming from his prior convictions for motor vehicle offenses. At that time, the court appointed the public defender who was handling the defendant\u2019s criminal trespass and interfering with an officer cases to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>represent him in the violation of probation matters. Thereafter, the court held several scheduled proceedings, often involving the criminal trespass and interfering with an officer cases as well as the violation of probation matters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">On January 15, 2002, the defendant appeared in court with his counsel and indicated that he wanted to represent himself. The court told the defendant that before allowing him to represent himself, it was going to order a competency examination. On February 27,2002, when the defendant appeared in court with his counsel, the court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>made an uncontested finding of competency based on the competency report in the file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again, the defendant raised the issue of self-representation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>allowed the defendant\u2019s counsel to withdraw from the cases involving the charges of criminal trespass in the first degree and interfering with an officer, as well as the violation of probation matters, and, on the same date, the defendant filed a pro se appearance in those cases. On March 20, 2002, the court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>the prosecutor and the defendant engaged in an on the record plea discussion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The defendant refused any offered plea bargain and insisted on exercising his \u201cright for a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On April 3,2002, the defendant appeared before Judge Clifford for the violation of probation hearing. Although Judge Clifford recalled having had some discussion with the defendant previously in that case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>canvass the defendant on the issue of self-representation. The defendant indicated that he was \u201cprepared to continue\u201d and to \u201cgo forward\u201d with the hearing. Thereafter, the hearing commenced and concluded, and Judge Clifford found that the defendant did violate a condition of his probation and that the beneficial aspects of probation were no longer being served. Judge Clifford sentenced the defendant to the remaining six months of imprisonment previously suspended on the sentence for the underlying motor vehicle offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">At the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the violation of probation hearing, there was a brief on the record discussion of the defendant\u2019s pending criminal trespass and interfering cases. Judge Clifford again briefly canvassed the defendant on the issue of self-representation and appointed standby counsel to assist the defendant in the trial of the charges of criminal trespass in the first degree and interfering with an officer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>On June 10,2002, Judge Clifford granted the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>motion to consolidate those cases for trial. On the same date, during a discussion about whether Judge Clifford had signed an arrest warrant in the case, Judge Clifford asked the defendant, \u201cDo you have a problem with me sitting on [this case?]\u201d The defendant responded that he had \u201c[n]o objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Thereafter, following jury selection on June 12, 2002, the case proceeded to trial before Judge Clifford on June 12, 13, 14 and 18, 2002. During trial, there was no mention by anyone of Judge Clifford\u2019s recusal. On June 18, 2002, the jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (1) and two counts of interfering with an officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167a (a). Judge Clifford then sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of two years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty months, with three years of probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant claims that his trial was unlawfully conducted by the same judge who had conducted plea bargaining on the charges in violation of canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The defendant argues that this deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. The defendant contends that the trial judge had a responsibility to recuse himself and, thus, although the defendant did not file a motion to recuse the judge, the error is renewable under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the plain error doctrine pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The state argues that we should not review the question of the propriety of the judge\u2019s participation in the defendant\u2019s trial because it is not properly before us, as the defendant failed to file a motion for the judge\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1-23.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state maintains that neither plain error review nor review under <em>Golding </em>is appropriate. The state contends, moreover, that by failing to raise the issue of Judge Clifford\u2019s disqualification before or during the trial, the defendant consented to the judge\u2019s participation under General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the state is correct in asserting that this court will not normally review claims that have not been preserved for appeal adequately, we conclude that plain error review is warranted in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\u201cIt is well established that plain error review is exercised in only the most limited of circumstances. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and <em>public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>68 Conn. App. 884, 887, 793 A.2d 274, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 924, 797 A.2d 521 (2002). We conclude that plain error review is warranted \u201cbecause the impropriety of a court presiding over the trial and sentencing after having actively participated in pretrial plea negotiations is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d Id.;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 179, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995) (plain error review warranted \u201cbecause the fairness and integrity of the hearing as well as public confidence in judicial proceedings is involved\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cOur Supreme Court has stated that a trial court\u2019s failure to follow the mandatory provisions of a statute prescribing trial procedures or to follow a procedural rule constitutes plain error. . . . Canon 3 [c] (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The reasonableness standard is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances. . . . <em>Even in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial </em>authority.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 887-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Although pretrial or plea negotiations play a critical role in the criminal justice system, and the disposition of charges after plea discussions is highly desirable, judicial participation in pretrial plea negotiations frequently has been criticized. <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 505-506, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 888; <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 180-81. In fact, \u201cmany jurisdictions bar judges from active participation in plea negotiations.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 506 &amp; n.22, citing Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>R. Crim. P. 11 (e) (1), Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-7-302 (1) (2000), Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 9.94A.080 (West 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In Connecticut, however, \u201c[i]t is a common practice . . . for the presiding criminal judge to conduct plea negotiations with the parties. If plea discussions ultimately do not result in a plea agreement, the trial of the case is assigned to a second judge who was not involved in the plea discussions and who is unaware of the terms of any plea bargain offered to the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge responsible for trying the case also is responsible for sentencing the defendant in the event the defendant is convicted after trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 508 n.25. \u201c[A]s long as the defendant is free to reject the plea offer [made after negotiations conducted by one judge] and go to trial before a [second] judge who was not involved in or aware of those negotiations, [the defendant] is not subject to any undue pressure to agree to the plea agreement, and the impartiality of the judge who will sentence him in the event of conviction after trial is not compromised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 507-508, quoting <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 194 n.16, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We conclude that the court committed plain error when it presided over the defendant\u2019s trial and sentencing after having participated actively in plea negotiations with the defendant. The record discloses that during the plea negotiations, the court itself understood that it had participated actively in such a way as to make clear that a different judge would necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>preside over the defendant\u2019s trial and sentencing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although it seems unlikely, on the basis of the record, that at the time of the trial, the court recalled the nature of its previous involvement,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we need not find, nor do we find, actual bias or prejudice on the part of the court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 389, 460-61, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889; <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 182. Because the court presided over the trial and sentencing after having participated actively in plea negotiations, the appearance of a fair trial was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We disagree with the state\u2019s contention that by failing to raise the issue of Judge Clifford\u2019s disqualification prior to or during the trial, the defendant consented to the judge\u2019s participation pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and thereby waived appellate review of the issue. The state\u2019s argument is predicated on cases such as <em>Timm </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 487 A.2d 191 (1985), which stated that the failure \u201cto raise the issue of the [judge\u2019s] disqualification either before or during the trial, can be construed as the functional equivalent of \u2018consent in open court\u2019 to [the judge\u2019s] presiding over the trial\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 51-39 (c). Id., 205. The cases relied upon by the state in support of its argument, however, are inapposite.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> None of them renders plain error review of a claimed violation of canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct inappropriate on the basis of \u00a7 51-39 (c) where the claimed violation implicates a judge\u2019s responsibility to recuse himself from presiding over a criminal defendant\u2019s trial after having participated actively in plea negotiations with the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>noted previously, that responsibility recently has been underscored by our Supreme Court and by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Revelo, supra, 256 Conn. 506; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We conclude that the existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected when a court presides over the trial and sentencing after having participated actively in plea negotiations. In this case, the appearance of a fair trial has been lost and a new trial is warranted. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 182; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The judgments are reversed and the cases are remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\"> Although the defendant had been charged with two counts of criminal trespass in the first degree, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to one of those counts at trial after the state rested its case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\"> The defendant raised two additional claims, which we do not reach in view of our resolution. The defendant claimed (1) that the court improperly canvassed him so that he was unable to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel, which rendered him without counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings, and (2) that he was convicted twice, improperly, for the same offense in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\"> For the details of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the ensuing judgments of the trial court revoking his probation, see <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>79 Conn. App. 683, 830 A.2d 1187 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> The defendant and his counsel informed the court that he waived any competency hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> The defendant indicated that he would accept standby counsel if the court wanted that. The court established that the defendant had never represented himself before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\"> During the plea negotiations, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: This matter ... I did check with probation. [The defendant\u2019s sentence] is not consecutive. It was a concurrent sentence. So, I just wanted to be sure. He owes six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">\u201cThe Court: You representing yourself, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-14\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s never a smart move. I\u2019m the one who sentenced you [on the motor vehicle offenses] originally, right? You\u2019ve got thirty months, suspended after twenty-four months, correct? You\u2019ve got two [violations of probation], which, basically, you owe six months on that. You\u2019ve got a trespass [in the first degree for which] you can get up to a year; interfering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>[with an officer], you can get up to a year. Your exposure is two and one-half years. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes. I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201cThe Court: Is there any offer from the state on these?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">\u201c [The Prosecutor]: Prior to the [violation of probation], one year execution suspended, six months probation on the criminal trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u201cThe Court: One year what? Suspended sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: It was six months and \u2014 one year after six months. And then there was no offer on the interfering and the [violations of probation],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">\u201cThe Court: But if it was known he was on probation, would the offer still be like a year after six months, if he was interested in that? I don\u2019t know if you are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I had written a letter to the public defender in January that I wanted a speedy trial motion filed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-13\">\u201cThe Court: You are really not eligible. Are you serving a sentence now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, I\u2019m not serving a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-15\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re not eligible for a speedy trial until you\u2019ve been incarcerated for eight months. Let me just say this sir. I know you are representing yourself. You know, violation of probation, with all due respect, you don\u2019t\u2014 they\u2019re not that hard to prove. You do something on probation, they violate the terms of it, that\u2019s six months right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-16\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I\u2019m entitled to a hearing; I\u2019m sure of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-17\">\u201cThe Court: Listen. I\u2019m trying to help you. Okay. What I\u2019m trying to tell you, it\u2019s not hard to prove those. You go to a hearing on that \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not that difficult. You\u2019re not even in front of a jury. It\u2019s in front of a judge. If the judge finds you in violation, bingo, you\u2019ve got six months. The offer is a year after six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-18\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I got three months in now, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-19\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-20\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well, at the time of the arrest the police removed $500 from my front pocket, which would\u2019ve been my bond money for that particular\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-21\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re not hearing me. You are going to hurt yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-22\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I\u2019m not giving up my right for a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-23\">\u201cThe Court: Listen. You can have your right to a trial. I\u2019m just telling you to use some common sense. Okay. You\u2019ve already got a lot of time. If you want to have your trial, you can end up doing two and a half years. You owe six months on the probation. The offer is six months in jail. You\u2019ve got three months in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-24\">\u201c[The Defendant]: That was only on the [violation of probation] offer\u2014 files. Sir, that wasn\u2019t on the criminal trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-25\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s on something right now, a year after six months.

Because we find that a nonconstitutional ground existed with regard to whether it was plain error for the court to preside over this case after having participated actively in plea negotiations, we need not decide the constitutional claim. We conduct a plain error review rather than a <em>Golding </em>review because \u201c[t]his court has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn.

We afforded plain error review and held that because the existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected, the trial judge committed plain error in failing to recuse himself. Id., 887-89. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.

Although the defendant failed to file a motion for the judge\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 997, now \u00a7 1-23, and failed to seek plain error review of the propriety of the court\u2019s participation in plea negotiations and the probation revocation hearing, we determined that our sua sponte invocation of plain error review was warranted. Id., 175-81. We held that the court committed plain error in presiding over the probation revocation hearing after having actively participated in plea negotiations with the defendant, the appearance of a fair trial having been lost. Id., 181-82. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for a new revocation of probation hearing.
