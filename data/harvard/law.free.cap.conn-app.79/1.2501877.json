Pepper, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered following a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court denied him his constitutional right of confrontation by precluding him from questioning the victim about her motive to accuse him falsely of sexual assault, (2) pursuant to <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), the state violated his constitutional rights by using his postarrest and <em>post-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence for impeachment purposes and substantive evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>guilt, and (3) the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by asking him to comment on the credibility of the victim and the veracity of her testimony. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 23, 2001, at 11:30 p.m., the victim was in her residence with her husband and her one year old daughter, who were asleep, when the defendant knocked on her door uninvited. The defendant appeared upset and wanted to speak with the victim\u2019s husband. The victim woke her husband so that he could get ready for work, which began at midnight. Her husband left for work at 11:45 p.m., but the defendant remained. The defendant and the victim conversed about what was upsetting the defendant. During their conversation, both drank alcoholic beverages. The victim then began to drink soda.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">At 12:30 a.m., the victim\u2019s husband called her and asked if the defendant was still there. The victim answered in the affirmative. The victim and the defendant then began to \u201cplay fight\u201d with each other, which involved the victim spitting soda and water on the defendant, the defendant attempting to retaliate, and both running around the residence as they did so. The victim\u2019s husband called a second time and asked if the defendant was still there. The victim lied and stated that he had left. She then noticed that the floor near the bathroom was sticky from spilled soda and proceeded to mop up the spill. She then went into the bathroom and changed into her pajamas, which consisted of baggy cargo pants, a blue tank top, and no underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The defendant said that he and the victim should have sex and that he would not tell her husband. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>victim told the defendant no, that she was married and would not have sex with him. She then asked the defendant to leave her residence. The defendant told her that he would not leave until he \u201cgot some\u201d and came toward the victim. She ran toward her bedroom where she planned to lock herself in to prevent the defendant\u2019s advances, but on her way she slipped on the floor that she had just cleaned. The defendant grabbed her as she fell and pushed her into the bedroom. He then threw her onto the bed and jumped on top of her between her legs. The victim tried to push the defendant away with her feet and kicked the defendant. The defendant continued in his attempt to spread her legs apart as the victim struggled and screamed for the defendant not to continue. The defendant told her to shut up or he would punch her in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The defendant then pulled her pants down, removed his shirt and pushed his pants down to his ankles, leaving his sneakers on. He then placed the victim\u2019s legs over his shoulders and had sexual intercourse with her for five minutes, during which he told her to be quiet or he would punch her in the face. The victim said it was impossible to fight the defendant in the position she was in. After the intercourse, the defendant threatened that if she told anyone, he would inform her husband that the sex was consensual and that she had slept with an old roommate. The victim was distraught and upset after the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Once the defendant left, the victim contacted her father, the police and her husband informing them of the sexual assault. She was taken to a hospital where routine tests after a sexual assault were given and evidence taken. Her injuries included abdominal pain, back pain, bruising on her inner thighs and vaginal bleeding. Laboratory tests from specimens taken from the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and compared with a blood sample from the defendant indicated that his sperm was present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly denied him his sixth amendment right to confront the victim when it precluded him from questioning the victim about her motive to accuse him falsely of sexual assault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that he should have been permitted to cross-examine the victim concerning the reasons for a previous suicide attempt that occurred after she engaged in an earlier extramarital affair. Additionally, the defendant argues that this evidence was admissible under common-law evidentiary rules. We disagree that the court acted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On May 3, 2002, the defendant filed notice that he intended to offer evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim. On May 6, 2002, the defendant filed a written offer of proof concerning the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct, arguing, inter alia, that such evidence was relevant to his defense of consent. On May 9, 2002, the court held a hearing on those matters pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-861'. The defendant had subpoenaed medical records from Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London concerning the victim. Pursuant to the procedure set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990), the court conducted an in camera inspection of all the subpoenaed records and disclosed to the defendant certain medical records from the victim\u2019s hospitalization in October, 2000, after a suicide attempt that had been made soon after a previous extramarital affair.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Upon review of those records, the defendant amended his offer of proof concerning the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct. The defendant argued that the recently disclosed evidence was relevant to demonstrate that the victim had fabricated the sexual assault claim because she was afraid of her husband\u2019s reaction and potential negative effects stemming from her actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court deferred ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the defendant\u2019s motion until the victim testified. After the victim\u2019s direct examination, the defendant renewed his motion to admit the evidence, stating: \u201cI wish to ask her directly concerning whether or not she lied to her husband [during the second telephone call] because she had been previously caught in an affair, and she was worried about the further effect and erosion of her marriage in addition to or rather following on from the October-September hospital records.\u201d The state objected to that area of inquiry. The court then asked the defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cNow, this is lying to her husband with respect to saying that your client had left the apartment when, in fact, he was still there? Is that what we\u2019re talking about, that phone call.\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d The court overruled the state\u2019s objection and permitted that inquiry by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The defendant also sought to inquire about the suicide attempt, which had followed the victim\u2019s extramarital affair. The defendant argued that this evidence was relevant \u201c[i]f . . . she told the doctor [that] she was found in an illicit affair. She had problems with her husband. That was sufficient in her mind to produce a suicide attempt. We are now six months later. She\u2019s in a similar situation. Her husband calls, and now she chooses to he as opposed to commit suicide, again.\u201d The court ruled that such evidence was overly prejudicial and that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. The defendant then stated: \u201cSo, my question, then, is limited to motivation for lying to her husband. That\u2019s fine, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">On cross-examination, the defendant asked the victim if she had had an extramarital affair in October, 2000, and whether her husband became aware of it. The victim answered in the affirmative to both questions. The defendant also asked the victim if that affair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and her husband\u2019s knowledge of the infidelity was the reason she lied about the defendant\u2019s presence during the second telephone call on the night of the assault. The defendant did not attempt to introduce the evidence of the victim\u2019s suicide attempt, nor did he attempt to introduce or make an offer of proof that portions of the medical records, which related to some of the underlying causes leading to the victim\u2019s suicide attempt and which related to her previous infidelity, should be admitted into evidence separately from any reference to the suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim was not preserved at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant, therefore, seeks review of his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the record is adequate for review and the defendant\u2019s claim is one of constitutional magnitude, we will review the claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>34 Conn. App. 261, 274, 641 A.2d 406, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 903, 644 A.2d 916 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u201cThe primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. ... In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the juiy facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. ... In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Cruz, </em>71 Conn. App. 190, 197-98, 800 A.2d 1243, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 934, 806 A.2d 1067 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u201cThis right, however, is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. . . . The trial court, in its discretion, may impose limitations on the scope of cross-examination, as long as the defendant has been permitted sufficient cross-examination to satisfy constitutional requirements. . . . The confrontation clause does not . . . suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . Only relevant evidence may be elicited and the right to cross-examine is subject to the duty of the court to exclude irrelevant evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>72 Conn. App. 640, 665, 805 A.2d 823, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 917, 811 A.2d 1293 (2002). \u201c[T]he [confrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish. . . . Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>been an abuse of discretion. ... If the constitutional standard has been met, then we must nonetheless examine whether the court abused its discretion in restricting the defendant\u2019s cross examination of the victim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Gainey, 76 Conn. App. 155, 163, 818 A.2d 859 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Here, the defendant argues that the court improperly restricted the cross-examination of the victim by not allowing inquiry concerning the victim\u2019s suicide attempt and its underlying causes. According to the defendant, the disclosed medical records reveal that the victim attempted to take her life solely because she was distraught when her husband discovered her affair and was afraid that her husband might divorce her and engage in a custody battle for their child. This evidence, the defendant contends, demonstrates a motive by the victim to fabricate the sexual assault claim. Our review of the disclosed medical records, however, reveals that there were numerous reasons underlying the victim\u2019s suicide attempt apart from the affair and her fears of her husband\u2019s negative reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Although some portions of the disclosed medical records may have been relevant to a motive to fabricate the sexual assault claim, the defendant never made an offer of proof or attempted to introduce those potentially relevant portions separately from the evidence of the victim\u2019s suicide attempt. There is no indication that the court would have precluded that area of inquiry. The court simply precluded reference to the suicide attempt and made no ruling that would preclude the defendant from inquiring about the victim\u2019s fears stemming from her husband\u2019s discovering her previous infidelity. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right [of cross-examination] is not infringed if the defendant fails to pursue a line of inquiry open to him. . . . The test is whether the opportunity to cross-examine existed, not whether full use of such opportunity was made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>75 Conn. App. 447, 465, 817 A.2d 122, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 919, 822 A.2d 244 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The defendant was allowed to question the victim concerning her October, 2000 infidelity, her husband\u2019s awareness of the affair and her husband\u2019s jealousy. The defendant never attempted to ask the victim about her fear of divorce or a custody battle. In addition, the defendant extensively cross-examined the victim about the sexual assault, including the inconsistencies between their respective versions of the events and how the victim\u2019s version of events actually demonstrated that the sex was consensual. The defendant did not attempt to ask the victim if she fabricated the claim that the sex was forced because she was afraid of her husband\u2019s reaction. There is no indication that the court would have precluded this area of inquiry. The court did not impose any limitations on the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim concerning a possible motive to fabricate the sexual assault other than precluding any reference to the suicide attempt. Accordingly, we find that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Because we conclude that the constitutional standard has been met, we next must determine, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>supra, 76 Conn. App. 163, whether the court abused its discretion in restricting cross-examination of the victim concerning her suicide attempt. \u201cOur standard of review of a claim that the court improperly limited the cross-examination of a witness is one of abuse of discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis D., </em>75 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>App. 1, 20, 815 A.2d 191, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 909, 819 A.2d 842 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates <em>undue </em>prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . [Accordingly] [t]he test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the [party against whom the evidence is offered] but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jur[ors].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>263 Conn. 524, 544, 821 A.2d 247 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Here, the court excluded reference to the suicide attempt because its prejudicial impact outweighed any probative value. Clearly, evidence of a suicide attempt would unduly evoke the jury\u2019s emotions and sympathy. The victim\u2019s suicide attempt implicated her deepest personal and private thoughts and emotions, many of which were irrelevant to the issues at trial. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in precluding reference to the suicide attempt. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The defendant also claims that exclusion of any reference to the suicide attempt violated our rules of evidence. This determination is tied inextricably into our prior analysis in our resolution of the defendant\u2019s <em>Golding </em>claim. The defendant\u2019s claim fails because, as we concluded previously, the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence as being overly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that pursuant to <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610, the state violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>his constitutional rights by using his postarrest and <em>post-Miranda </em>silence for impeachment purposes and as substantive evidence of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Additional facts are necessary for the analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim. On April 24, 2001, David Anthony Gigliotti, a detective with the New London police department, interviewed the defendant about the victim\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. At that meeting, the defendant was not in custody or under arrest and, therefore, was not provided with <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The defendant informed Gigliotti that he was not at the victim\u2019s residence on April 23, 2001, and he denied having had any type of sexual relationship with her. The defendant also provided a written statement to Gigliotti stating the same. On June 8,2001, the defendant was arraigned following his arrest, at which time he was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. On September 24, 2001, a blood sample was taken from the defendant with Gigliotti present. No interrogation or statements were taken from the defendant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The defendant alleges that the state committed three <em>Doyle </em>violations. First, the defendant references the following question and answer during the state\u2019s examination of Gigliotti:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cQ. Detective, at any point after April 24, 2001, when you took the statement . . . from [the defendant] did he have any further conversations with you concerning his activities on the evening of April 23, morning of April 24, 2001?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">\u201cA. No, he did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The second alleged <em>Doyle </em>violation also arose in the state\u2019s direct examination of Gigliotti:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">\u201cQ. Did [the defendant] tell you about any physical ailments or conditions that he might have been suffering from [on April 24, 2001]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cA. No, he did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The final alleged <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cQ. When did you claim that this sexual intercourse with [the victim] was voluntary? You never told that to the police, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cA. I believed that ever since the beginning. Police never asked me. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">\u201cQ. And if they didn\u2019t ask you, you weren\u2019t going to tell them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">\u201cA. If they would ask, I would\u2019ve told them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">We note at the outset that the defendant did not properly preserve this claim. He therefore seeks <em>Golding </em>review. We review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>75 Conn. App. 304, 311-12, 815 A.2d 1234, cert. granted on other grounds, 264 Conn. 914, 826 A.2d 1158 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">Pursuant to <em>Doyle, </em>\u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s postarrest and <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is constitutionally impermissible under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. . . . The factual predicate of a claimed <em>Doyle </em>violation is the use by the state of a defendant\u2019s postarrest and <em>post-Miranda </em>silence either for impeachment or as affirmative proof of his guilt. . . . The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuranko, </em>71 Conn. App. 703, 709, 803 A.2d 383 (2002). \u201cSilence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is insolubly ambiguous because it may be nothing more than a defendant\u2019s exercise of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights. . . . Once the government assures a defendant through the issuance of <em>Miranda </em>warnings that his silence will not be used against him, it is fundamentally unfair for the state to break that promise by using his silence against him at trial. . . . Comments by the state on a defendant\u2019s silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not only constitutionally impermissible, but also inadmissible under the principles of evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>41 Conn. App. 701, 711, 679 A.2d 19, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 906, 682 A.2d 1011 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We conclude that the state did not violate <em>Doyle </em>in its questions to Gigliotti. The first question merely referenced the investigative efforts of the police, which does not constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>42 Conn. App. 41, 48, 680 A.2d 1340 (1996) (\u201cstate may present evidence to show the investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded\u201d). The second question posed to Gigliotti did not violate <em>Doyle </em>because it referenced the defendant\u2019s <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 319, 613 A.2d 242 (1992) (\u201cprosecution\u2019s use of silence prior to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Assuming without deciding that the state violated <em>Doyle </em>in its question posed to the defendant, we conclude that any impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Doyle </em>violations are . . . subject to harmless error analysis. . . . The harmless error doctrine is rooted in the fundamental purpose of the criminal justice system, namely, to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. . . . Therefore, whether an error is harmful depends on its impact on the trier of fact and the result of the case. . . . [Bjefore a . . . constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The state bears the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>demonstrating that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . That determination must be made in light of the entire record [including the strength of the state\u2019s case without the evidence admitted in error]. ... A <em>Doyle </em>violation may, in a particular case, be so insignificant that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible question or comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Under such circumstances, the state\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence does not constitute reversible error. . . . The [error] has similarly been [found to be harmless] where a prosecutor does not focus upon or highlight the defendant\u2019s silence in his cross-examination and closing remarks and where the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not strike at the jugular of the defendant\u2019s story. . . . The cases wherein the error has been found to be prejudicial disclose repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, reemphasis of the fact on closing argument, and extensive, strongly-worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuranko, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 711-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Here, there was substantial evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s guilt, including (1) the presence of his semen in the victim, (2) his lying to the police in his April 24, 2001 statement, (3) the victim\u2019s immediate reporting of the incident to the police, her father and her husband even though the defendant threatened to tell them all that the sex was consensual if she reported the assault, (4) the fact that the defendant could not fully undress during sex, (5) the defendant\u2019s threats of physical harm to the victim during the assault, (6) the victim\u2019s physical injuries including bruising and vaginal bleeding, (7) the victim\u2019s hysterical reaction immediately after the assault, (8) the fact that the victim testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>fied that if the sex were consensual, she would have used contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, which did not occur here, and (9) the victim\u2019s resistance to the defendant\u2019s sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Furthermore, any potential <em>Doyle </em>violation was isolated. There were no repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, constant reemphasis on the defendant\u2019s silence in closing argument or extensive, strongly worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt. Accordingly, we conclude that any potential <em>Doyle </em>violation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it improperly asked the defendant to comment on the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony. We agree that in a certain context these questions may be viewed as improper, but, in the context of which they were asked here and considering the trial as a whole, we conclude that the defendant was not denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The defendant cites the following excerpts from the state\u2019s cross-examination of him:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201cQ.

Okay. And was that accurate or not? Is that how, in fact you tore your shirt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t tear it wrestling. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">Because the defendant failed to object to the claimed prosecutorial misconduct at trial, he seeks review under <em>Golding. </em>Because the record is adequate for review and a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is of constitutional magnitude, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 699, 793 A.2d 226 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may occur in the course of cross-examination of witnesses . . . and may be so clearly inflammatoiy as to be incapable of correction by action of the court. ... In such instances there is a reasonable possibility that the improprieties in the cross-examination either contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty or, negatively, foreclosed the jury from ever considering the possibility of acquittal. . . . Moreover, prosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>77 Conn. App. 197, 209, 822 A.2d 990, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 827 A.2d 707 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . [M]oreover ... [a defendant is not entitled to prevail under Golding] whe[n] the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. ... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial [by virtue of prosecutorial misconduct] we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 161-62, 836 A.2d 224 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In making that determination, we focus on several factors, including \u201c(1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, (2) the severity of the misconduct, (3) the frequency of the misconduct, (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case, (5) the strength of the curative measures adopted and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 205-206. \u201cFurthermore, whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. When defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">It is well established that it is improper to ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 credibility or the veracity of his or her testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 706. \u201cThat is because such questions not only invade the province of the jury, in that determinations of credibility are for the jury to decide, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>those questions also have no probative value because they are not helpful to the jury in assessing witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubose, </em>75 Conn. App. 163, 179, 815 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 909, 819 A.2d 841 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As a general proposition, the challenged questions appear to be improper because the defendant was asked to comment on the veracity of another witness\u2019 testimony. Our determination, however, focuses on whether any impropriety denied the defendant a fair trial. We therefore must analyze whether this cross-examination rendered the trial so unfair as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process utilizing the previously mentioned factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Here, any misconduct was neither severe nor frequent. The challenged exchanges amounted to only five instances in an extensive cross-examination of the defendant. They related to minor inconsistencies between the defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s recollections of the events of the night in question. They did not attack the major theme of the consent defense, but merely highlighted the differences in the defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s stories. In addition, the state did not ask the defendant to characterize the victim as a liar or to use other strong terms in reference to her testimony. Our conclusion that any misconduct was not severe is highlighted by the fact that no objection or curative instructions were sought by the defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Furthermore, as discussed in part II, the state had substantial evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s guilt. Finally, we note that any prosecutorial misconduct was not blatantly egregious and did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. Accordingly, we conclude that any misconduct was harmless and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fore, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\"><em> Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.

We have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . .

The defendant, however, provides no case law or analysis of this claim in his brief. Nor does the defendant inform this court of what material is being sought from an in camera review. Additionally, there was no showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 58. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . .

Because the defendant\u2019s brief is inadequate, we deem his request for an in camera review waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\"> The specific argument made by defense counsel was the following: \u201c[W]ith respect to the information that I just got, there was an incident of infidelity, which led to a suicide attempt and a physician\u2019s emergency commitment. And from the defendant\u2019s point of view . . . what . . . we must do is to illustrate for the jury\u2019s perspective the fact that from his perspective this is a parallel situation. In other words, at a point in time not too terribly far removed from this incident here, there was an act of infidelity. It was revealed. It led to difficulties. The victim attempted to take her own life, went to the hospital, went to another hospital and then subsequently returned to her family. Our position ... is that that forms the basis for her reporting nonconsensual activity, and unless we are allowed to put that information to the jury, we cannot present that defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> The defendant argues that his claim was preserved because he informed the court that the exclusion of the prior sexual conduct of the victim violated his constitutional rights to cross-examination and confrontation. That argument, however, concerned the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct with three other individuals and was not in reference to the victim\u2019s suicide attempt or the October, 2000 infidelity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> An unpreserved claim is renewable under <em>Golding </em>\u201conly if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> The defendant also claims on appeal that the following additional questions were improper.
