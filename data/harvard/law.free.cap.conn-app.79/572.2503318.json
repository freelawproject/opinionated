We agree with the defendant\u2019s second claim and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court. Although that claim is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s appeal, we also address his first claim because it is likely to arise in the new trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>261 Conn. 553, 556, 804 A.2d 781 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On June 25, 1999, the victim and her then boyfriend Johnny Ramirez, who is the defendant\u2019s brother, attended a party at the home of the defendant\u2019s parents. After consuming several drinks, the victim became ill. The defendant offered to escort the victim to the bathroom. When they reached the bathroom, the defendant remained with the victim while she vomited. The defendant then told the victim that she looked \u201csexy\u201d and \u201cpretty\u201d and began to fondle her breasts. She begged him to stop and then vomited again. The defendant then proceeded to force the victim to engage in sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>intercourse, penetrating her vagina with his fingers, mouth and penis. The victim repeatedly implored the defendant to stop, but did not have the strength to physically restrain him.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The next morning, the victim awoke alone in a bed in the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 home. When she awoke, she found that her clothing was in disarray. She ate breakfast with the defendant\u2019s family. At that time, she was not entirely certain what had transpired the previous night and who had been involved, so she did not say anything to anybody about the incident in the bathroom. Later, the defendant drove the victim and Johnny Ramirez to Johnny Ramirez\u2019s apartment. At that time, the victim was still confused about the events of the previous night. Johnny Ramirez later took the victim to her parents\u2019 home where she lived. She did not tell her parents that evening what had transpired the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The next morning, the victim went to work. While she was at work, she realized she had been raped, but was not certain of the identity of her assailant. Later in the day, however, she became more confident that the defendant had raped her. She returned home, where she told her mother about the assault and called the police. They then went to the hospital, where she was examined and rape kit tests were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The defendant was later arrested in New York and taken to a correctional facility in that state. The authorities in New York subsequently delivered him into the custody of the Danbury police department. He was charged with sexual assault in the first degree and, after a six day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain evidence found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>during an unlawful search by police. Specifically, the defendant argues that a certain letter that was admitted into evidence at trial was obtained by way of an illegal search in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The following facts, found by the court in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, are relevant to that issue. The defendant was arrested and held at the Putnam County correctional facility in Carmel, New York, as a fugitive from justice in connection with this case. Joseph LeRose and James Pacific, who were officers with the Danbury police department, traveled to that facility to arrest the defendant pursuant to a warrant. At the time that the officers took custody of the defendant, the correctional facility authorities gave them a bag containing the defendant\u2019s personal property and an inventory sheet listing the property. LeRose checked the contents of the bag and determined that they matched the items listed on the inventory sheet. The officers placed the bag in the trunk of their police cruiser and drove the defendant directly to the Danbury police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Upon arriving at the Danbury police department, LeRose processed the defendant by taking his fingerprints and photograph, conducting a patdown search and providing him with an opportunity to make a telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>call. Pursuant to Danbury police department policy, LeRose also performed an inventory search of the defendant\u2019s personal belongings, including the items in the bag that the correctional facility authorities in New York had given to the officers. The purpose of the search was to determine whether the bag contained any contraband or dangerous instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">While performing the inventory search, LeRose noticed an unsealed envelope containing multiple pages of a letter or letters. He opened the envelope and removed the pages one by one to be sure that there was no contraband, such as illegal drugs, hidden in the envelope. Initially, LeRose did not read the writing on the pages. WTren he notice the word \u201cImportant\u201d written in the margin of one of the pages, however, he read the nearby text, in which the defendant asked someone named Ed to offer \u201cthat girl\u201d $2000 to drop the charges against the defendant. Upon further review of the document, LeRose discovered a statement that \u201cEd\u201d could solve the defendant\u2019s problem \u201cby talking to that girl .... I have $2000 you can offer it to her if she drops the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the letter on the ground that it was obtained through an unlawful search in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments. The state made three arguments in opposition to the motion to suppress. Specifically, the state argued that the use of the letter would not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because (1) there was no search within the meaning of the fourth amendment, as the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter, (2) the letter was obtained by way of a search incident to a lawful arrest and (3) the letter was in plain view during a lawful inventory search. The court agreed with the state\u2019s second and third arguments and, accordingly, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>address the state\u2019s argument that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter. At trial, the court admitted the letter into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the court improperly determined that the letter was obtained by way of a search incident to a lawful arrest and pursuant to a lawful inventory search. We conclude that the court properly denied the motion to suppress, but base our conclusion on the alternate ground that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter and that the review of the letter by police therefore did not constitute a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\u201cOur review of the defendant\u2019s claim is governed by well established principles. Under the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the fruit of prior police illegality. . . . On appeal, we apply a familiar standard of review to a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [Wjhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the validity of a . . . search [or seizure] implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, however, we engage in a careful examination of the record to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. . . . However, [w]e [will] give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 42-43, 836 A.2d 224 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\u201c[T]o claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable; i.e., one that has a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S. Ct. 469, 142 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1998). \u201cTo receive fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, a defendant must have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the [subject of the search], . . . Absent such an expectation, the subsequent police action has no constitutional ramifications.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>259 Conn. 436, 441 n.7, 790 A.2d 1132, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 879, 123 S. Ct. 79, 154 L. Ed. 2d 134 (2002). \u201cThe determination of whether such an expectation exists is to be made on a case by case basis . . . and requires a two-part inquiry: first, whether the individual has exhibited an actual subjective expectation of privacy, and second, whether that expectation is one society recognizes as reasonable. . . . Whether a defendant\u2019s actual expectation of privacy ... is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable involves a fact-specific inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 94, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The second element of the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test is dispositive of the issue in the present case because the facts found by the court establish as a matter oflaw that the defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy, if any, was not reasonable. Our conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>sion is based on <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984), in which the United States Supreme Court specifically held \u201cthat society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell. The recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot be reconciled with the concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institutions.\u201d Id., 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The <em>Hudson </em>court elaborated on its rationale as follows: \u201c[P]risons are not beyond the reach of the Constitution. No iron curtain separates one from the other. . . . Indeed, we have insisted that prisoners be accorded those rights not fundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment itself or incompatible with the objectives of incarceration. . . . However, while persons imprisoned for crime enjoy many protections of the Constitution, it is also clear that imprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights. . . . These constraints on inmates, and in some cases the complete withdrawal of certain rights, are justified by the considerations underlying our penal system. . . . The curtailment of certain rights is necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad of institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities . . . chief among which is internal security . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\u201c[P]rison administrators \u00e1re to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of not only the prison staffs and administrative personnel, but also visitors. They are under an obligation to take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates themselves. They must be ever alert to attempts to introduce drugs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>other contraband into the premises which, we can judicially notice, is one of the most perplexing problems of prisons today; they must prevent, so far as possible, the flow of illicit weapons into the prison; they must be vigilant to detect escape plots, in which drugs or weapons may be involved, before the schemes materialize. In addition to these monumental tasks, it is incumbent upon these officials at the same time to maintain as sanitary an environment for the inmates as feasible, given the difficulties of the circumstances. . . . [I]t would be literally impossible to accomplish the prison objectives identified above if inmates retained a right of privacy in their cells.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cDetermining whether an expectation of privacy is legitimate or reasonable necessarily entails a balancing of interests. The two interests here are the interest of society in the security of its penal institutions and the interest of the prisoner in privacy within his cell. The latter interest, of course, is already limited by the exigencies of the circumstances: A prison shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home, an automobile, an office, or a hotel room. . . . We strike the balance in favor of institutional security, which ... is central to all other corrections goals .... A right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms is fundamentally incompatible with the close and continual surveillance of inmates and their cells required to ensure institutional security and internal order. We are satisfied that society would insist that the prisoner\u2019s expectation of privacy always yield to what must be considered the paramount interest in institutional security. We believe that it is accepted by our society that [l]oss of freedom of choice and privacy are inherent incidents of confinement.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 527-28. Furthermore, the principle underlying the holding in <em>Hudson, </em>that is, that the fact of confinement and the legitimate goals and policies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the penal institution limit the constitutional rights of prisoners, \u201capplies equally to pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners. A detainee simply does not possess the full range of freedoms of an unincarcerated individual.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 546, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In the present case, the defendant does not dispute the fact that the letter in question was written while he was incarcerated at the correctional facility in New York and that the correction officers there removed it from his cell along with his other property. As the previously cited legal authorities indicate, any subjective expectation of privacy that the defendant had with regard to the items within his prison cell was not reasonable. Accordingly, the correction officers at the New York facility did not conduct a search or seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment when they took the letter from the defendant\u2019s cell. The defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter when the prison authorities removed it from his cell, and the actions of the prison authorities therefore had no constitutional ramifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">That conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. The question before the court in the present case was whether the Danbury police officers\u2019 subsequent act of reading the letter at the Danbury police station violated the fourth amendment. Because we have already established that the defendant did not have any reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter when it was in his jail cell, the Danbury police officers\u2019 act of reading the letter likewise does not have any constitutional ramifications unless something in the circumstances arising subsequent to the initial seizure of the letter was sufficient to create such an expectation. Nothing happened, however, between the moment that the New York authorities initially took the letter from the defendant\u2019s cell and the moment that the Danbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>police read the letter that would give the defendant a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter. There was no evidence that the letter was ever outside the control of the New York authorities before they handed it over to the Danbury police. From that point forward, the letter was within the exclusive control of the Danbury police. The defendant could not have had any reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to property in police custody that had been recovered from a location in which he had no such reasonable expectation in the first place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The facts found by the court establish that the defendant did not at any time have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the letter he wrote while incarcerated. Consequently, the defendant failed to cany his burden of demonstrating that the fourth amendment was implicated by the Danbury police officers\u2019 reading of the letter. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly precluded him from questioning witnesses regarding the victim\u2019s postassault conduct in violation of his constitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense. Specifically, the defendant argues that after the state elicited testimony from the victim that she took a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>shower the day after she was sexually assaulted, he should have been permitted to ask both the victim and Johnny Ramirez whether they had showered together. The state argues that the questions were precluded properly because they sought to elicit evidence of sexual conduct in violation of the rape shield statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the defendant admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim. The defendant\u2019s theory of defense at trial was that the victim had consented. Specifically, the defendant argued that the victim consented to sexual intercourse and subsequently regretted her decision. Thus, as both the state and the defendant stated during their respective closing arguments, the main issue for the jury to determine was whose version of events to believe \u2014 the defendant\u2019s or the victim\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">During direct examination by the state, the victim described the events of the day following the sexual assault. She stated that when she awoke the morning after the assault, she stood up and felt something dripping down her leg. She testified that the substance appeared to be semen and that \u201cit was coming from inside of [her].\u201d She further testified that after she and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Johnny Ramirez arrived at his apartment, she took a shower and got dressed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Prior to beginning cross-examination of the victim and outside the presence of the jury, the defendant sought the court\u2019s permission to ask the victim whether she and Johnny Ramirez had showered together at the apartment that day. The defendant argued that the question was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of whether the victim\u2019s behavior was consistent with the conduct of a victim of a recent sexual assault. The court ruled that the evidence sought by the proposed question was irrelevant and therefore disallowed the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The defendant subsequently called Johnny Ramirez as a witness and sought the court\u2019s permission to ask him questions regarding the shower. The court permitted the defendant to make an offer of proof by examining Johnny Ramirez outside of the jury\u2019s presence. In response to the defendant\u2019s questions, Johnny Ramirez indicated that he and the victim had showered together at his apartment on the day after the sexual assault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The defendant again argued that the evidence was relevant to the question of whether the victim\u2019s actions were consistent with the conduct of a victim of a sexual assault. The court disallowed the testimony on the grounds that it constituted extrinsic evidence on a collateral issue and that, pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f, it was inadmissible evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cUpon review of a trial court\u2019s decision, we will set aside an evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination and [e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. ... To establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\u201cAlthough the outright denial of a defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine a witness on an element of the charged offense implicates the constitutional protection of the confrontation clause, such a denial is [still] subject to harmless error analysis . . . [which will result in a new trial] only if the exclusion of the proffered evidence is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\u201cWhether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 173-74, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cThe [sixth amendment to the] federal constitution [also] require [s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. . . . The sixth amendment right to compulsory process includes the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies. . . . The defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right, however, does not require the trial court to forgo completely restraints on the admissibility of evidence. . . . Generally, an accused must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence in exercising his right to present a defense. ... A defendant, therefore, may introduce only relevant evidence, and, if the proffered evidence is not relevant, its exclusion is proper and the defendant\u2019s right is not violated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>72 Conn. App. 831, 838, 806 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 924, 814 A.2d 379 (2002). As with the exclusion of evidence in violation of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, the exclusion of evidence in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense is subject to a harmlessness analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>73 Conn. App. 173, 196, 807 A.2d 500, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 923, 812 A.2d 865 (2002). In both cases, the state must demonstrate harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 176, 801 A.2d 788 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The state characterizes the testimony offered in the present case as evidence of \u201csexual conduct\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 54-86f. We note that the defendant sought to introduce evidence indicating that the victim and Johnny Ramirez showered together, and did not seek to elicit testimony about any specific sexual activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ties that may have taken place in the shower or even whether sexual activity did in fact occur. The state\u2019s argument that \u00a7 54-86f applies to the proffered evidence raises the question of when, if ever, evidence merely <em>suggesting </em>sexual conduct might implicate that statute. Nevertheless, we need not address that issue today because we conclude that the exclusion of the proffered evidence violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights regardless of whether it constituted \u201cevidence of sexual conduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-861'.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201c[I]n cases involving sexual crimes, [t]he rape shield statute . . . was enacted specifically to bar or limit the use of . . . sexual conduct of an alleged victim of a sexual assault because it is such highly prejudicial material. . . . However, [although the state\u2019s interests in limiting the admissibility of this type of evidence are substantial, they cannot by themselves outweigh the defendant\u2019s competing constitutional interests. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">\u201cWe must remember that [t]he determination of whether the state\u2019s interests in excluding evidence must yield to those interests of the defendant is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case. ... In eveiy criminal case, the defendant has an important interest in being permitted to introduce evidence relevant to his defense. Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . Whenever the rape shield statute\u2019s preclusion of prior sexual conduct is invoked, a question of relevancy arises. If the evidence is probative, the statute\u2019s protection yields to constitutional rights that assure a full and fair defense. ... If the defendant\u2019s oiler of proof is sufficient to show relevancy, and that the evidence is more probative to the defense than prejudicial to the victim, it must be deemed admissible at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 176-77; see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (4) (evidence of victim\u2019s sexual conduct admissible if so relevant and material to critical issue in case that exclusion would violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the court\u2019s rulings precluding the defendant from questioning the victim and Johnny Ramirez regarding whether they had showered together the day after the assault violated his rights to confrontation and to present a defense. As stated, the victim testified that the morning after the assault, she found what appeared to be semen dripping down her leg and that she subsequently left the house where the assault had occurred, went to Johnny Ramirez\u2019s apartment and took a shower. No other evidence regarding the shower was presented. The jury was likely to conclude from the evidence presented that the victim showered alone as soon as reasonably possible after the attack because she wanted, in the defendant\u2019s words, \u201cto remove the taint of nonconsensual sexual activity.\u201d We are convinced that the defendant\u2019s version of the shower, that is, that the victim showered with the defendant\u2019s brother less than one day after allegedly being sexually assaulted by the defendant, might have painted a decidedly different picture in the minds of the jurors. The proffered testimony would have been probative of the defendant\u2019s theory of defense because the jury might have concluded, on the basis of that evidence, that the victim\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with the conduct of a sexual assault victim. Moreover, the admission of the evidence would not have been highly prejudicial with regard to the victim in view of the defendant\u2019s efforts to avoid eliciting any explicitly sexual details of the shower. Because the probative value of the proffered evidence outweighed the potential prejudice to the victim, the defendant had a constitutional right to have the evidence admitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>notwithstanding the purpose of the rape shield statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">We next must determine whether the exclusion of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. Ramos, supra, 261 Conn. 176. The victim\u2019s testimony that she took a shower was important to the prosecution\u2019s case because, as stated, it suggested behavior consistent with the conduct of a victim of a recent sexual assault while the proffered testimony would have suggested behavior that the jury might have considered inconsistent with such an assault. The prosecution\u2019s case was not an especially strong one, as it turned almost exclusively on whether the jury believed the victim\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s version of events; there were no other firsthand witnesses who could testify about the issue of force. Furthermore, the proffered testimony would not have been cumulative because there was no other evidence as to whether the victim showered alone or with Johnny Ramirez on the day after the assault. On the basis of all of those factors, we cannot say that the exclusion of the proffered evidence did not have a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury. The state has not demonstrated that the exclusion of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\"> The defendant also claims that the letter was obtained in violation of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. \u201cBecause the defendant has not briefed his claim separately under the Connecticut constitution, we limit our review to the United States constitution.
