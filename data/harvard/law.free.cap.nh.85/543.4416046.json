White <em>v. </em>Boulia-Gorrell Lumber Co.</parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-14\"><em>Peter J. King </em>and <em>Murchie, Murchie &amp; Blandin {Mr. Alexander Murchie </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-15\"><em>Robert W.

A release of all demands against the defendant was executed by the plaintiff\u2019s father, who signed the release as the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cnext friend.\u201d This instrument is not a bar to the action. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Hillsborough Mills, ante, </em>517.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">There is no claim that the accident did not arise \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s employment. P. L., c. 178, s. 2. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>that employment exposed the plaintiff at times \u201cto the dangers incident to proximity to machinery\u201d he was an employee under class II of the statute and is \u201centitled to the benefit of such classification,\u201d even though his injury was not caused by a dangerous machine. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 567, 568. See also <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Company, </em>79 N. H. 42, 43; <em>Boody </em>v. <em>Company, </em>77 N. H. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">It is suggested, however, that the statute is inapplicable because the accident did not occur on the defendant\u2019s premises. Assuming the legislative purpose to have been correctly interpreted in the cases cited, no intent can reasonably be inferred to restrict the application of the statute to accidents happening within the employer\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The initial inquiry relates to classification, and the words, \u201cwork in any shop, mill, factory,\u201d etc., are merely descriptive of class II. P. L., c. 178, s. 1, <em>cl. </em>II; <em>Regnier </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>79 N. H. 310, 311. It follows that if the circumstances of a workman\u2019s employment bring him within that class, he is entitled to compensation under the act whenever and wherever an \u201caccident arising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The trial court found on sufficient evidence that the plaintiff \u201cfell from the height of the truck platform to the ground, some four and one-half feet, receiving an injury to his back.\u201d The fact that x-ray photographs disclosed \u201ccongenital abnormalities\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s spine did not conclusively prove that the plaintiff failed to receive severe injury. The findings in respect thereto are amply sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The court further found that the plaintiff would be totally disabled for a period in excess of three hundred weeks (P. L., c. 178, s. 24) unless he could procure expensive medical treatment, in which event his disability would continue for about two years. Since the accident occurred in 1929 and the plaintiff has been unable to obtain this treatment, consideration of the questions raised by the finding is unnecessary. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for $2,563.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
