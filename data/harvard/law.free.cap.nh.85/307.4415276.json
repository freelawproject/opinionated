Kittredge, <em>Adm'r.</em></parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Frederick J. Grady </em>(by brief and orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-6\"><em>Walter E.

The plaintiff worked for Mrs. Leavitt until May, 1926; then left her, and obtained employment elsewhere. She explains her understanding of the contract and her excuse for ceasing work as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201cShe [Mrs. Leavitt] asked me what I would come to work for her for, and I told her my wages were twelve dollars a week. She said that she could not pay that, but \u2018 I will tell you what I will do. I will pay you two dollars a week and will this home to you. \u2019 I consented to that and she told me afterwards that she had made a will but she would not show it to me. I wanted her to make a deed or put it in trust for me \u2014 something to be signed. I wanted it in trust. I didn\u2019t want it then but I wanted to keep it in trust so that I would know it would be mine. ... I was willing to stay with her until the end came. That was the agreement I made with her . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">\u201cShe promised me faithfully that house if I would take care of her faithfully while she lived and I intended to do it. ... She wouldn\u2019t give me a deed or an assignment of the place. . . . When she didn\u2019t show me the will or give me anything signed, I thought she was not going to ... . If she made a will and showed\u2019it to me, it would be all right, and I would have my signing on it. . . I thought I could sign it so she could make it over to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201cA contract to devise or bequeath property can be performed by making a valid will at any time during the life of the promisor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>leaving it in force at his death. Such contract can not be broken by non-performance until the death of the promisor. If the promisor dies without leaving a valid will in accordance with his contract, the contract is broken.\u201d 1 Page, Wills (2d <em>ed.), s. </em>99. And in such event the promisee may enforce the contract against the estate of the deceased promisor. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>76 N. H. 203, 204.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">But the agreement in the present case is not an enforceable one, since a contract to devise real estate is within the statute of frauds. <em>Ham </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>37 N. H. 185. Unless the will which Mrs. Leavitt executed contained some reference to the agreement (and there is no evidence that it did), it was not in itself a sufficient memorandum. 27 C. J. 259 and cases cited; 24 Mich. Law Rev. 749, 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">If, then, the plaintiff had fully performed her part of the agreement (and the decedent had died without leaving a will in her favor), she would not have been entitled to a decree for specific performance \u201cin the absence of facts showing that she would be the victim of a fraud\u201d if equitable relief were denied. <em>Muir </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>78 N. H. 313, 315. See also <em>McCrillis </em>v. <em>Company, ante, </em>165; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>69 N. H. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Since the decedent\u2019s promise was not to pay in money but in real estate, the doctrine of <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>6 N. H. 481, does not apply. <em>Roundy </em>v. <em>Thatcher, </em>49 N. H. 526. The case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>18 N. H. 293, holding that the promisee under an oral agreement to labor for a term and take a lot of land in payment may stop work at his pleasure and recover the value of the services rendered, has been virtually overruled. <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>52 N. H. 31, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Ordinarily, the promisee in default under an unenforceable contract of this kind is not at liberty to treat the contract as void and sue on a <em>quantum meruit </em>if the promisor is willing to perform his part of the bargain. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Shackford, </em>5 N. H. 130, 133; <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Marston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The record discloses no evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention that it could be found, as in <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>that there was a further agreement to reduce the contract to writing which the decedent unreasonably refused to perform. Nor does it appear that the plaintiff requested the decedent to join her in signing a memorandum of the contract. The only reasonable interpretation that can be given the plaintiff\u2019s testimony is that she desired a deed or trust arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">It is therefore unnecessary to determine the soundness of the suggested rule that a plaintiff in default may recover \u201cif it appears that before default he requested the defendant to join him in signing such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>a written memorandum as would comply with the requirements of the statute, and that the defendant refused or failed within a reasonable time so to do.\u201d Woodward, Quasi Contracts, s. 98, <em>p. </em>156. See also Williston, Contracts, s. 538, <em>pp. </em>1044, 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The motion for a nonsuit should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
