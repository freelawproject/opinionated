Coulomhe </em>and <em>Ira W. Thayer {Mr. Thayer </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-12\"><em>Edmund Sullivan </em>(by brief and orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b553-13\">Marble, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKZa\">The defendant signed a statement procured by one Swift in which she declared: \u201cThe cause of the accident was the locking of the gears on my car.\u201d At the trial she testified: \u201cI started to turn around to go home ... I started out in first,. . . and commenced to turn, and put it in second. . . . But when I threw her in second she seemed to get away from me . .. [Mr. Swift] suggested himself that the gears had locked. ... I haven\u2019t said the cause of the accident was the gear locking. I didn\u2019t say that... I must have put my foot on the accelerator, because she went so quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">A witness testified that he heard the \u201cengine accelerating, racing so fast\u201d that he \u201cknew it was something unusual.\u201d This and other testimony as to the extreme speed of the car justified a finding that the defendant negligently stepped upon the accelerator. See <em>Summerfield </em>v. <em>Wetherell, </em>82 N. H. 513, 516. The fact that evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>introduced makes it unnecessary to consider the motion for a nonsuit made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s opening statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>84 N. H. 75, 77, and cases cited. The motion for a directed verdict was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It was the contention of defendant\u2019s counsel that the accident was caused by the locking of the steering gear. The car was taken to the defendant\u2019s garage after the accident and was never run or repaired again. A mechanic inspected the car at the time of the trial and testified that he \u201cchecked the steering gear and checked the accelerator and looked the car over as much as\u201d he could \u201cand didn\u2019t find or see a thing wrong.\u201d The defendant excepted to the admission of this testimony because \u201cthis accident happened two years ago.\u201d It was within the discretion of the trial court to admit the evidence, and that discretion does not appear to have been improperly exercised. <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Company, </em>79 N. H. 116, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">At the close of the evidence the presiding justice announced: \u201cIt is agreed by the parties that the defendant is insured.\u201d The assertion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel in argument that the defendant said she must have accelerated the engine and his reference to the man who took her written statement as an insurance agent were fully warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
