The jury fixed punishment at five years in the penitentiary. The trial court imposed the sentence, and we granted Mitchell a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">The sole question to be resolved is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that a robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Robbery, undefined in Code \u00a7 18.1-91, is defined in our common law as <em>\u201cthe taking, </em>with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 253, 254, 105 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1958) (emphasis added). All elements of the common law offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish that a robbery has occurred. <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 860, 864, 183 S.E. 452, 454 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>We have searched the record in this case and have found no evidence that there was a <em>taking </em>of any money. Therefore, since this element of robbery was riot proved, the Commonwealth failed to establish that a robbery was in fact committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Accordingly, the judgment will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
