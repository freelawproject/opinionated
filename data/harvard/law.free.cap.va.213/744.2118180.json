We must determine whether the trial court was correct in holding plaintiff\u2019s testimony established contributory negligence which proximately caused the automobile crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">The crash in which plaintiff was injured occurred in a heavily populated area approximately one-half mile west of Abingdon on U. S. Route 11, a divided four-lane highway. The speed limit on this heavily traveled highway was 45 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-18\">Plaintiff, who was proceeding westwardly, testified that he observed a car operated by Mrs. L. P. Johnson, an acquaintance, waiting to enter Route 11 from her driveway on the north side of the highway. As he approached the Johnson car, plaintiff noticed a ladies\u2019 handbag sitting on top of the car. He waved to Mrs. Johnson to call her atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tion to the handbag and then stopped his car in the right (outside) westbound traffic lane approximately 50 to 75 feet west of the private driveway. As he was stopping plaintiff looked in his rear view mirror and saw the top of defendant\u2019s westbound truck as that truck came over a rise about 1000 feet east of the site of the wreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Plaintiff then backed his car eastwardly in the right (outside) westbound lane. The rear of his car was struck by the front of the defendant\u2019s truck at a point just west of the Johnson driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony establishes that he was guilty of negligence when he violated Code \u00a7 46.1-216.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He backed his vehicle toward oncoming traffic without exercising reasonable care to see that such movement could be made in safety. That this negligence on his part was a proximate cause of the crash is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\"> Code \u00a7 46.1-216 provides: \u201cEvery driver who intends to start, back, stop, turn or partly turn from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety and whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement shall give such signals as are required in \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-217, 46.1-218 or 46.1-220, plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicle, of his intention to make such movement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
