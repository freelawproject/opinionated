He was tried by the court without a jury and sentenced to three years in the State Penitentiary on each indictment, with the sentences to run concurrently. We granted writs of error to the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">The evidence shows that on the afternoon of June 24, 1970, two girls, 8 and 10 years old, respectively, were playing on Arbutus Circle in the City of Chesapeake. A car driven by the defendant stopped and he asked them the way to Daniel\u2019s Pharmacy. When the girls approched the car they noticed that defendant\u2019s trousers were unbuckled and unzipped, and they saw what they referred to as his \u201cprivacy.\u201d The defendant made no suggestive remarks or gestures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>and there was no evidence that he was sexually aroused. After obtaining the information sought, defendant went on his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The evidence of the Commonwealth is insufficient to prove the lascivious intent required under the statute, and the convictions cannot be upheld. <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 24, 26-27, 175 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The judgments are reversed and set aside and the cases are remanded to the court below for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
