The return address on the package was David Reese, 1038 East Corona Drive, Yuma, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">In examining the package one of the detectives noticed a small slit at one comer. Through this slit he saw what appeared to him to be marijuana. The detectives then \u201cstaked out\u201d the baggage room.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-19\">At approximately 3:00 p.m., two hours later, the defendant\u2019s wife came to the baggage room and asked for the package. After the package was delivered to her, Mrs. Buono was photographed by the detectives and placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Several minutes later the defendant, who had been circling the block in his car, entered the bus station. One of the detectives related that he saw the defendant enter the bus station and that \u201cI moved toward him, he went to back off and I grabbed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">After his arrest the defendant denied that the drugs were his property. The evidence shows that he came to the bus station in response to a phone call advising him that a package addressed to him had arrived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Later investigation established that the name \u201cDavid Reese\u201d and the address \u201c1038 East Corona Drive, Yuma, Arizona\u201d were fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">To establish \u201cpossession\u201d in a legal sense it is not sufficient to simply show actual or constructive possession of the drug by the defendant. The Commonwealth must also establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed it with knowledge of its nature and character. <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 732, 741, 173 S. E. 2d 799, 805 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The evidence here fails to meet the standard established by Ritter. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
