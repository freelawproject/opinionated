The court, trying him as an adult, convicted him of the lesser included offense of larceny from the person of $5.00 or more, and sentenced him to 12 months in jail. This category of larceny is a felony under Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.1-100 (Cum. Supp. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney made a timely election to present the case to the grand jury, as authorized by Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.1-176 (Cum. Supp. 1971). Watts was indicted by the grand jury for robbery. A pre-trial motion to quash the indictment and plea of former jeopardy having been overruled, Watts was tried on August 5, 1971, by the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond, sitting without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>jury, and convicted as charged. After hearing a pre-sentence report, the court sentenced him to 12 years in the penitentiary, with four years suspended for a period of 20 years on condition of good behavior and a recommendation that the sentence be served at Southampton Farm. We granted Watts a writ of error to the judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The determinative issue presented to us is whether jeopardy attached when Watts was convicted of the felony of larceny from the person by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. If so, his subsequent conviction for the greater offense of robbery would have been barred. <em>See, e.g., Cates </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>111 Va. 837, 69 S.E. 520 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A juvenile and domestic relations court may retain jurisdiction over a juvenile offender and treat him as an adult in a misdemeanor case. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.1-177.1 (1960). But such a court does not have jurisdiction to proceed against a juvenile as if he were an adult in a felony case, except for the limited jurisdiction granted by Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.1-158(8) (Cum. Supp. 1971), which is inapplicable here. Moreover, as Watts was a prior offender, the court was under a duty to certify the case to the court of record for proper criminal proceedings, in the absence of a finding that it would be in the public interest to dispose of the matter in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. <em>See </em>Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.1-176.1 (1960)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. No such finding was made. So the action of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in undertaking to convict Watts of a felony was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Inasmuch as the judgment entered by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court was void, jeopardy did not attach. <em>Burford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 752, 20 S.E.2d 509 (1942); <em>Seay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574 (1931); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 960 (1873). Accordingly, Watts could properly be tried for robbery and convicted thereof in the Hustings Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 16.1-176.1.
