Code Aim. \u00a7 18.1-65 (I960)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The jury returned this verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cWe, the jury, find the accused gu\u00fcty of unlawful wounding and fix his punishment at 12 months in jaE\u2014$500 fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">After overruling a motion to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law and evidence the trial court entered judgment on the verdict. We granted Bacci a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The question for us to decide is the vahdity of the verdict. Bacci contends that it is fataEy defective and a nullity because it faEs to recite the requisite intent, either specificaEy or by reference to the indictment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The verdict is simEar to those which we held to be void in <em>Banner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 640, 133 S.E.2d 305 (1963), and <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 58, 55 S.E.2d 450 (1949), for faEure to recite that the wounding was done with the necessary intent or as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">It is true, as the Attorney General says, that the form of verdict was given by the court to the jury in an instruction, that other instructions defined mahcious wounding and unlawful wounding, and that another instruction set forth the punishment which could be fixed by the jury for mahcious wounding, unlawful wounding and assault and battery, respectively. But instructions also defined the crimes and set forth the permissible punishment for each in <em>Banner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The Attorney General argues that, as the verdict here, unlike those in <em>Banner </em>and <em>Lane, </em>fixed the punishment within the limits provided for a misdemeanor, Bacci\u2019s conviction can be upheld as a misdemeanor conviction. We do not agree. It is clear that the jury here intended to acquit Bacci on the charge of mahcious wounding and to convict him of the less serious felony of unlawful wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Under <em>Banner </em>and <em>Lane </em>the verdict is void, except insofar as it served to acquit Bacci of malicious wounding. Being void, it can be attacked for the first time before us. The judgment' order is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial upon the charge of unlawful wounding with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or k\u00fcl.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\"> <em>\u201c\u00a7 </em>18.1-65. Shooting, stabbing, etc., with intent to maim, kill, etc.\u2014If any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or k\u00fcl, he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be confined in the penitentiary not less than three nor more than twenty years. If such act be done unlawfully but not maliciously, with the intent aforesaid, the offender shall, at the discretion of the jury, be confined in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than five years or be confined in jail not exceeding twelve months, and fined not exceeding five hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b366-6\">Harrison, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A72\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">I would affirm the conviction. The jury was properly instructed as to what constitutes malicious wounding, unlawful wounding and assault and battery. The majority correctly holds <em>\u201cit is </em>clear\u201d that the jury intended to acquit Bacci of malicious wounding and to convict him of unlawful wounding. Under such circumstances we should not nullify the jury\u2019s verdict finding the defendant guilty of unlawful wounding because of its failure to add thereto \u201cwith intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill\u201d. Our decisions in <em>Banner </em>and <em>Lane </em>should be modified to avoid such a result where, as in the instant case, there is no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, the correctness of the instructions given by the court, the offense which the jury found was committed and the offense which the jury convicted the defendant of committing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
