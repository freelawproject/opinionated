He testified that he did so in self-defense while resisting a violent homosexual attack which the deceased made upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">The sole question here is whether the trial court erred in refusing to admit the 'evidence of \u201cBuddy\u201d Williams, a 17-year-old boy, that the deceased had made homosexual advances to him on several occasions shortly before the homicide occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">The defendant argues that the proffered testimony was admissible under <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 256, 264-65, 56 S.E.2d 226, 230 (1949), where we held that other specific violent acts by the deceased, even though unknown to the accused, may be shown when there is other evidence of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Williams testified that the deceased \u201cstarted rubbing my leg\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201ctried to go into my pants.\u201d He also testified that the deceased took Williams\u2019 hand, placed it on the deceased\u2019s penis and \u201cwanted me to play with him.\u201d When Williams resisted these advances, the deceased did not persist in his course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We agree with the trial court that this proffered testimony fails to disclose such violent and turbulent acts as to make the evidence admissible under th'e rule laid down in <em>Randolph.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
