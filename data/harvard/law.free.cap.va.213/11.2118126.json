Va. Code Ann. Title 15.1, Chapter 22 (Transition of Towns to Cities), \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-978 -1010 (1964). Before the transition three schools owned and operated by the County School Board of Greensville County were located within the Town of Emporia, and after the transition these schools were located within the new city of Emporia.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">On October 2, 1969, the City, its Council and its School Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>brought this suit against the County, its Board of Supervisors and its School Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City sought to compel the County School Board to convey to the City School Board two of the three County schools located within the City, Greensville County High School and Emporia Elementary School. The City also sought an equitable adjustment of the County\u2019s indebtedness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">By the final decree from which this appeal was prosecuted, the court held that the County School Board should convey to the City School Board, and the City should pay for, Greensville County High School and Emporia Elementary School. The County assigns cross-error to that holding. By the same decree, the court held that the County School Board should transfer to the City School Board, and the City should pay for, certain equipment and chattels located in those Schools. The City assigns error to that holding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The transition statute, Chapter 22 of Title 15.1 of the Code (Transition of Towns to Cities), contains no provision respecting the transfer of a county school to a newly-created city or its school board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the trial court held that \u201csince the City has a beneficial interest in school properties within its boundaries the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Court has the power to compel the County to convey all or a part of the said properties to the City\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">To sustain the trial court\u2019s conclusion, counsel for the City rely upon three cases, which we will refer to as: <em>\u201cColonial </em>Heights\u201d, <em>\u201cCovington I\u201d and \"Covington II\u201d: Colonial Heights </em>v. <em>Chesterfield County, </em>196 Va. 155, 82 S.E.2d 566 (1954); <em>County School Board of Alleghany County </em>v. <em>School Board of the City of Covington, </em>197 Va. 845, 91 S.E.2d 654 (1956); <em>School Board of the City of Covington </em>v. <em>County School Board of Alleghany County, </em>200 Va. 587, 106 S.E.2d 655 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The issue before the Court in <em>Colonial Heights </em>was the amount to be paid by the newly-created City of Colonial Heights (formerly the Town of Colonial Heights) to the County of Chesterfield to adjust the County debt as contemplated by Code \u00a7 15.1-1003 <em>(supra </em>n. 2) and to pay for a County school to be acquired by the City. So any words of the opinion that might imply a right to enforce the conveyance of county school property should be taken in the context of an issue drawn between a County and a City only as to the amount to be paid by the City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In <em>Covington I, </em>school properties of the County of Alleghany lying within the newly-created City of Covington (formerly the Town of Covington) had been fully paid for, and the County had no outstanding debt. The trial court held that under such circumstances, the City acquired title to the County school properties by operation of law and had no obligation to pay the County for the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">On appeal, the issue before this Court was whether the City of Covington had already acquired County school properties for which it owed nothing or whether the City could acquire County school properties only upon paying the County for the property. We reversed the trial court, holding that \u201cbefore the City of Covington may take title to the school properties in question it must make proper compensation therefor\u201d. 197 Va. at 852, 91 S.E.2d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The issue in <em>Covington II, </em>which involved the same school properties as <em>Covington I, </em>was again the amount to be paid for the County school properties. The date when the properties should be valued was the main issue, the Court holding that they should be valued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>at the date of the Town\u2019s transition into a city rather than the date of the City\u2019s acquisition of the properties from the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>Covington II, </em>the Court also affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of any credit for the City\u2019s beneficial interest in County school properties lying outside the City. (The City acquired all County school properties lying within the City\u2019s boundaries.) We pointed out that credit for such beneficial interest could be given only in arriving at an equitable adjustment of county debt pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-1003. Since Alleghany County had no debt to be adjusted, Covington was not entitled to credit for its beneficial interest in County school properties lying outside the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>Colonial Heights, Covington I </em>and <em>Covington 11 </em>support these propositions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">(1) Title to county school property lying within a town remains vested in the county school board after the town becomes a city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(2) The beneficial interest of a newly-created city in county school property, whether within or without the city, should be taken into account in arriving at the equitable adjustment of county debt contemplated under Code \u00a7 15.1-1003 <em>(supra </em>n.2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">(3) A city must pay for any school property acquired by the city, whether or not the county has any debt, the city receiving credit for its beneficial interest in that property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">These cases do not hold, however, that a city can enforce the conveyance of county school property, an issue that was not before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">We have recognized the beneficial interest of a newly-created city in county school property for the limited purpose mentioned in the preceding paragraph. But it does not follow that a court has the power, as the trial court concluded, to compel a county to convey any county school property to a newly-created city. We hold that a court lacks such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Because the decree appealed from erroneously orders the conveyance of County Schools and school equipment and chattels to the City School Board, we reverse the decree. In view of the credits available to the City, the County does not seek to have the City assume any of its debt. (Recitation in pretrial order entered September 11, 1970.) And in no case is \u201ca city . . . entitled to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the excess of its claim over the amount of the debt assumption\u201d. <em>Colonial Heights, supra </em>at 175, 82 S.E.2d at 577. Our order will therefore dismiss the City\u2019s bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> As used herein, \u201cCity\u201d means City of Emporia, and the term includes the Council of the City of Emporia and School Board of the City of Emporia unless the context otherwise indicates. \u201cCounty\u201d means County of Greensville, and the term includes the Board of Supervisors of Greensville County and the County School Board of Greensville County unless the context otherwise indicates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> <em>\u201c\u00a7 </em>15.1-1003.

Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-1003 (1964).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A6\"> The City complains chiefly of the court\u2019s holding respecting the value of the Schools ordered to be conveyed by the County.
