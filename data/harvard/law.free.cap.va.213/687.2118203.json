Tate (Tate), Harvey L. Watson (Watson) and Clifton T. Chalk (Chalk). The judgment has become final'against Tate, who did not appeal. We granted a writ of error to Watson and Chalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The only question here is whether summary judgment should have been awarded against Watson and Chalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">On September 30, 1969, Tate executed a 60-day note for $5,000 plus interest payable to Bank. Watson and Chalk were endorsers on this note. A handwritten amendment on the face of the note provided: \u201cR once Pay at 2nd M.\u201d The parties agree that this language means: \u201cRenew once; pay at second maturity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The printed body of the note provides: \u201cAll parties to this note . . . hereby agree that extension or extensions of the time of payment of this note, or any part thereof, may be made before, at, or after maturity by agreement with any one or more of the parties hereto without notice to or without releasing the liability of any other party to this note . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The record establishes that Bank was represented in all of its dealings with Tate, Watson and Chalk by Armistead W. Dey (Dey), one of its Vice Presidents. Dey testified that he handled the loan and prepared the note signed by Tate and endorsed by Watson and Chalk. He said there was a \u201cclear understanding\u201d between the parties that the note could be renewed once but that it would be paid at or before the second maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On cross examination Dey testified, without objection, that he \u201cwould have no right\u201d after the first maturity to renew the note without the consent of the endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The note was renewed at its first maturity on November 29. It was also renewed when it subsequently matured on January 28, 1970, March 29, 1970, and May 28, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Dey testified that Tate, Watson and Chalk were the principals in a new insurance agency, Christian Casualty Insurance Agency, Inc. The loan to Tate was made to provide him with funds to purchase stock in the agency. Bank also made loans to others to enable them to purchase stock in the agency. The insurance agency, at the time the Tate loan was made, had accounts with Bank of approximately $100,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Dey further testified that Tate, Watson and Chalk were working as a \u201cunit\u201d and that he had a number of conversations with them, individually and jointly, about their progress with the insurance agency. He said that they \u201cwould \u2018cry the blues\u2019 and we would renew the note again.\u201d While Dey was unable to recall who was present on each occasion when the note was renewed, he insisted that he \u201cwas certain\u201d that he had obtained the consent of the endorsers, either in person or by telephone, before each renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Watson and Chalk denied that they ever agreed to a renewal or extension of the note after the first renewal. Each specifically denied he had been consulted about or agreed to renewal of the note in January, 1970, or any of the subsequent renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Both Watson and Chalk testified that they first learned that the Tate note had not been paid on May 7, 1970, after Tate\u2019s position as president of the insurance agency had been terminated. They learned this when they visited Dey to \u201cchange the signature card\u201d on the agency bank account. Both testified that Dey was advised of Tate\u2019s planned departure from Virginia and they advised Dey that he \u201cshould get behind him (Tate).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Dey recalled having a meeting with Watson and Chalk prior to the last renewal of the note on May 28, 1970. He conceded that the note was again renewed after this meeting. When asked whether Watson and Chalk were aware of the May 28 renewal, Dey answered \u201cAs far as I know they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Here, as in the court below, Bank argues that the handwritten amendment did not change or alter the printed provision of the note authorizing extensions without notice to or the consent of the endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">We do not agree. Code \u00a7 8.3-118 provides the following rule of construction for commercial paper:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201c(b) Handwritten terms control typewritten and printed terms, and typewritten control printed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Dey, the Bank\u2019s duly authorized representative, represented Bank in all of its dealings with Tate, Watson and Chalk. He was called by Bank as its only witness. His testimony about the handwritten amendment to the note and its meaning, which is clear, definite and unequivocal, precludes the holding that Bank urges. <em>Massie </em>v. Firmstone, 134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Rule 3:18, Rules of Court, provides: \u201cSummary judgment shall not be entered if any material fact is genuinely in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Here there was a direct conflict between the testimony of Dey and the testimony of Watson and Chalk on whether the endorsers consented and agreed to the renewal of January 28 and the subsequent renewals. This was the real issue in the case and the facts in this connection were -genuinely in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The judgment rendered by the trial court against Watson and Chalk is, therefore, reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
