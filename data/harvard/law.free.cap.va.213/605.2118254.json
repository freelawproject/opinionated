He was found guilty of unauthorized use of a vehicle in violation of Code \u00a7 18.1-164<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to serve six months in jail. We granted Hewitt a writ of error to determine whether the evidence supports the finding of unauthorized use and whether Hewitt could be convicted of unauthorized use. when the indictment charged him only with larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">On the night of August 12, 1971, Hewitt was a passenger in a station wagon that failed to negotiate a curve on Route 639 in Nelson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>County and overturned. None of the five occupants was killed, but Hewitt and another were injured. Leaving their wrecked vehicle the men walked up the road until they found parked in front of a house a pickup truck belonging to Wallace A. Hammer. Some of the group took possession of the truck, and one of them started the vehicle by \u201chotwiring\u201d it. Because of his injuries, Hewitt did not actively participate in taking or moving the truck, but he rode on it with the others as it was driven about a half mile into Amherst County and up a fire trail. There was some evidence that Hewitt wished to be taken to a hospital, but the group slept in the truck that night and abandoned it on the fire trail the next day before dispersing to their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Counsel for Hewitt argues that the evidence, while sufficient to support a conviction of larceny, is insufficient to support a conviction for unauthorized use. The essential difference between the two offenses is one of intent. A taking of personalty without the owner\u2019s consent and with intent to deprive him of possession permanently constitutes common law larceny. <em>See Vaughan </em>v. <em>Lytton, </em>126 Va. 671, 679, 101 S.E. 865, 867 (1920); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1023 (4th ed. 1951). A taking of a vehicle with intent to deprive the owner of possession temporarily is unauthorized use under \u00a7 18.1-164. Intent may be inferred from the circumstances. Here, Hewitt\u2019s slight involvement, his injuries and his desire to be taken to a hospital in the truck were sufficient to justify the trial court in inferring that he did not intend to deprive the owner of possession permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Moreover, although the evidence may tend to prove only the offense charged in the indictment, the finder of fact may nevertheless convict of a lesser offense. <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 587, 591-92, 70 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1952); <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 860, 868-69, 183 S.E. 452, 456 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We have not heretofore determined whether unauthorized use is a lesser offense included under larceny. We hold that it is. In <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 264, 18 S.E.2d 909 (1942), and <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 134, 56 S.E.2d 367 (1949), both relied upon by Hewitt, unauthorized use was assumed to be a lesser included offense as the defendants, who were indicted for and convicted of larceny, sought to have the trial court give instructions to the jury on unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Code \u00a7 19.1-249 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201cIf a person indicted of a felony be by the jury acquitted of part of the offense charged, he shall be sentenced for such part as he is so convicted of, if the same be substantially charged in the indictment, whether it be felony or misdemeanor . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Manslaughter and assault and battery are lesser offenses included under murder. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>144 Va. 594, 607-08, 131 S.E. 212, 216-17 (1926); F. Wharton, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 33 (12th ed. J. Ruppenthal 1932). Unlawful wounding is a lesser offense included under malicious wounding. Code \u00a7 19.1-251; <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 840, 36 S.E. 371 (1900). The determining factor in each instance is intent, i.e. the presence or absence of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Indecent exposure, Code \u00a7 18.1-236, while not a lesser offense included under sodomy because the facts to be proven are not the same, is a lesser offense included under the statutory felony of exposure to certain infants with lascivious intent, Code \u00a7 18.1-214, because only the intent differs. <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 443, 158 S.E.2d 657 (1968). Similarly, intent alone distinguishes larceny of a vehicle from unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We conclude that the indictment charging that Hewitt did \u201cfeloniously and unlawfully . . . steal\u201d the truck \u201cagainst the will and without the consent\u201d of the owner sufficiently complied with the provisions of \u00a7 19.1-249 to charge unauthorized use. His conviction of the lesser offense is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-18\"> <em>\u201c\u00a7 </em>18.1-164.
