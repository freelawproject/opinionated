We granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The dispositive question here is whether the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection that it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">At about 11:30 p.m. on October 3, 1970, an automobile crash involving two cars occurred at Bacon\u2019s Castle in Surry County. One of the vehicles involved, a blue 1970 two-door Chevrolet, was occupied by four black men.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The other car was occupied by a white couple. The occupants of both cars were injured, and all of them were moved by ambulance from the scene of the crash to Obici Memorial Hospital in Suffolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">State Trooper Donald Wayne MacKenzie (MacKenzie), the investigating officer, did not learn the names of any of the victims at the crash scene and could not identify the defendant as having been present there. None of the other witnesses identified the defendant as having been present at the crash scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">MacKenzie, in making his investigation of the accident, later went to Obici Memorial Hospital where he saw two of the crash victims, Joseph Eugene West and Coyle V. Person, Jr. The trooper obtained the names and addresses \u201cof the people who came in\u201d from the hospital records. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, MacKenzie was permitted to testify that one of the names he obtained that night from the hospital records was \u201cJames Boone\u201d and that the hospital records were later \u201ccorrected\u201d to show the name \u201cWillie Stanley Boone.\u201d These hospital records were not tendered nor were they admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Certain records of Portsmouth General Hospital were authenticated and admitted in \u2018evidence. These records established that Willie Stanley Boone was admitted to Portsmouth General Hospital on October 4, at 2:10 a.m., as a transfer patient from Obici Memorial Hospital. The defendant, while not objecting generally to admission of these records, did object to a note in the record by the admitting nurse that \u201cAmbulance driver states he (Boone) was in an auto accident\u201d on the ground that this was hearsay and should not have been considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">We find that both of these objections by th'e defendant have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The record clearly shows the testimony of Trooper MacKenzie that the defendant was \u201cone of the people who came in\u201d to Obici Memorial Hospital was not based upon MacKenzie\u2019s personal knowledge but upon his examination of the hospital records. Since this evidence was hearsay evidence which did not fall within one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, the defendant\u2019s objection should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">We likewise find that portion of the Portsmouth General Hospital records which recorded a hearsay statement by the ambulance driver to the admitting nurse was inadmissible, and that this portion of the hospital records should not have been admitted and considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">While We have adopted the modern Shopbook Rule, allowing in given cases the admission of verified regular entries without requiring proof of the original observers or record keepers, as an exception to the hearsay rule, <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Johnson, Adm'x, </em>204 Va. 102, 129 S.E.2d 647 (1963), we have generally restricted this exception, as well as other exceptions to the rule created by statute, to facts or events within the personal knowledge and observation of the recording official to which he could testify if he were called as a witness. <em>See, e.g., Bailey, Adm'x </em>v. <em>Hunter, Inc., </em>207 Va. 123, 148 S.E.2d 826 (1966); <em>Bass </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 699, 187 S.E.2d 188 (1972); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 45, 189 S.E.2d 378 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-22\"> A related case involving the same defendant has already been reviewed by this court. <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 686, 187 S.E.2d 178 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
