Tenney of Ft. Meade, Maryland. Defendant, operator of a service station and repair shop in Dinwiddie County, dispatched its wrecker to the scene and picked up the disabled vehicle. The automobile was towed to defendant\u2019s shop, examined by mechanics and found to have \u201crear end trouble\u201d. Tenney was advised that the vehicle could not be repaired before Monday. He requested that it be taken to Master Chevrolet\u2019s garage in Petersburg, hoping that it could be fixed for him that afternoon. Bland &amp; Ponder agreed to the request and towed the car to the Petersburg garage. J. H. Reid, a Commission investigator, observed the wrecker towing the Tenney car. He followed and talked with Tenney and John Wright, driver of the wrecker, and thereby learned why the car was being transported to Master Chevrolet. Reid introduced in evidence a ticket dated April 16, 1971, for \u201ctowing\u2014$15\u201d, and testified \u201ca fifteen dollar charge was made for towing services\u201d. The ticket has Bland &amp; Ponder\u2019s name on it and is marked paid by John Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Reid also testified that on another occasion defendant had transported a wrecked state police automobile for a $20 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Defendant says that its wrecker is used only in connection with its repair business and to transport vehicles to its garage where repair work is to be done on them. It admits that while most automobiles brought to its station are repaired there, when automobiles, are under warranty, or parts are not readily available, the vehicles are sometimes moved elsewhere for the repairs. When this occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the move is accomplished by defendant\u2019s wrecker. It contends, nevertheless, that all charges for towing are made for bringing an automobile to its station for repairs and not for moving it elsewhere in those cases where such a move becomes necessary. Mr. Ponder testified: \u201cThe only time I charge anyone for towing is when I bring them into the station. That is all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In the instant case defendant claims that the $15 charge covered the transportation of the Tenney vehicle from the scene of the wreck to defendant\u2019s garage, and that no charge was made for towing the automobile from its garage to Master Chevrolet.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The narrow question before us is when is defendant\u2019s wrecker used \u201cin connection with\u201d its business of repairing motor vehicles. The Commission interprets Code \u00a7 46.1-163 to mean that the wrecker needs no permit if it is used only to tow disabled vehicles to the owner\u2019s repair shop, but if it tows a vehicle to somebody else\u2019s repair shop it must have a permit as a contract carrier under Code \u00a7 56-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Code \u00a7 46.1-163 envisions the existence of a connection or relationship between the transportation of a disabled vehicle by a wrecker or service vehicle and the repair of the disabled vehicle by the owner of the service vehicle. Obviously the transportation of Tenney\u2019s car to defendant\u2019s garage to be repaired in that garage was in furtherance of defendant\u2019s business of repairing vehicles. Under such circumstances the transportation, although for compensation, would not be the business of a contract carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The Commission does not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that its second towing was in connection with its repair business because it made no charge for this towing. Further it does not agree that in the instant case there was no charge. Although it may be defendant\u2019s policy to transport to another garage, without charge, those disabled vehicles which it cannot repair, Code \u00a7 56-288 would still be applicable, for the contract arrangement between the parties, which involves a fee for towing, would necessarily contemplate and cover not only the first towing but also an occasional second towing of vehicles to another service facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Commission is charged with the administration and enforcement of Code \u00a7 56-288 and its ruling as to what constitutes a contract carrier business, for which a permit is required, is entitled to great weight. It has determined from the facts in the instant case that defendant provided contract carrier service by transporting Tenney\u2019s automobile between its repair facility and Master Chevrolet\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>garage, and that defendant did not have the required permit authorizing him to conduct such an operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We cannot say that the Commission\u2019s construction of the two statutes involved, and its determinations, are plainly wrong or without evidential support.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
