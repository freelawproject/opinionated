The Commission found that Lawrence injured his right ring finger on October 2, 1970, during the course of his employment with Joe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Wills, lessee and operator of a \u201cSunoco\u201d service station in Lynchburg, and that under Code \u00a7 65.1-29<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sun Oil was Lawrence\u2019s statutory employer and hence liable for the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Sun Oil contends here, as it contended in the Industrial Commission, that it was not Lawrence\u2019s statutory employer under \u00a7 65.1-29 and that it was not liable for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 65.1-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The evidence reveals, among other things, that Joe Wills subleased a service station from Sun Oil and was an independent retail dealer in petroleum products, and not an employee or agent of Sun Oil. Pursuant to a dealer\u2019s agreement and a written lease, Wills operated the station under his own name as proprietor but displayed the \u201cSunoco\u201d trade name. He had full authority to hire and fire employees, set their pay and control their work. He was required to sell Sun Oil\u2019s petroleum products, but could sell competing brands and accessories. According to Sun Oil\u2019s district manager, title to its products passed to Wills upon delivery. Sun Oil was not entitled to any part of the revenue received from services, such as towing, washing and greasing cars, or changing spark plugs. Its profit was made at the time of sale to Wills and not when Wills later sold its products. Wills took advantage of Sun Oil\u2019s advertisements and credit cards, and he paid rent based on the amount of \u201cSunoco\u201d gasoline he sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Sun Oil had approximately 255 service stations operated by dealer-lessees, such as Wills, in Virginia on October 2, 1970, the date of Lawrence\u2019s injury. However, Sun Oil also had four similar stations it operated in Virginia through its own employees at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\"><em>Shell Oil Company </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>212 Va. 715, 187 S.E.2d 162 (1970), involved the question of whether claimants, who were employed by Shell Oil\u2019s dealer-lessee, were statutory employees of Shell Oil under \u00a7 65.1-29 at the time of the injury. Shell Oil had approximately 140 service stations leased to dealer operators in the Richmond District of Virginia. On one occasion Shell Oil had operated a station with its own employees on an interim basis. The In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>dustrial Commission awarded compensation, holding that the claimants were statutory employees of Shell Oil. In reversing the awards, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cOur conclusion is that while the sale of gasoline was indispensable to Shell\u2019s business, such sale to the consumer public was an activity which Shell did not <em>normally </em>carry on through its employees\u2014and that this determines its liability under Code \u00a7 65.1-29.\u201d (Italics supplied.) 212 Va. at 724, 187 S.E.2d at 168.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In the case at bar, the critical test to be applied is whether Sun Oil <em>normally </em>retailed petroleum products and offered automotive services through its own employees. The four Sun Oil operated service stations constituted less than 2% of all \u201cSunoco\u201d service stations in Virginia. Under these facts, we find that Sun Oil was not <em>normally </em>in the business of retailing petroleum products and performing automotive services and, therefore, that Lawrence was not the statutory employee of Sun O\u00fc.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">It follows that the Commission erred in directing Sun O\u00fc to pay Lawrence\u2019s attorney fees and the costs expended in prosecuting his claim. Code \u00a7 65.1-101 provides for the assessment of these expenses if it be determined by the Commission that Sun O\u00fc defended the proceedings \u201cwithout reasonable grounds.\u201d The mere fact that Sun O\u00fc was granted an appeal from the Commission\u2019s award evidences that its action was not without reasonable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The award of the Commission appealed from is reversed, and Lawrence\u2019s claim is dismissed..</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 65.1-29.
