He was sentenced to a term of twelve months in jail. We granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">The sole question here is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">The indictment charged that Caldwell did \u201cunlawfully and feloniously obtain by false pretenses the endorsement signatures of Jack Mitchell and C. &amp; J. Oil Company, Inc., to a check and did steal, take and carry away $330.00 the goods and chattels of Jack Mitchell and C. &amp; J. Oil Company, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">Jack Mitchell did not testify. No officer or employee of C. &amp; J. Oil Company, Inc., was called as a witness. The only evidence in the record concerning the endorsements is that of the defendant. This evidence not only fails to disclose false pretenses but negates that false pretenses were employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
