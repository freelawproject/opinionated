Article Fourth of Hanks\u2019s will devised a parcel of land known as \u201cBunker Hill\u201d to his wife for her life. In the event that Hanks should die without issue (which was the case), the first sentence of Article Sixth devised Bunker Hill after his wife\u2019s death to the youngest sons of Hanks\u2019s sisters. Upon the wife\u2019s death in 1969 the question arose, and is now before us, whether Bunker Hill was vested in the youngest sons living at the death of Hanks or in the youngest sons living at the death of Hanks\u2019s wife. Article Sixth provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">\u201cIf there are no children living at my death, or born ten months thereafter, after the decease of my wife Gertrude Hanks I give and devise in fee simple the tract or parcel of land above described and known as Bunker Hill to the youngest son of each of my three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sisters, namely Florence Ann Clark, Mary Willie Whaley, and Susan Gertrude Headley, to be equally divided among each of the three youngest sons. If there is no youngest sons of any of the above named Sisters living then to the Youngest daughter of any or all of my sisters.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">At the testator\u2019s death, William B. Clark was the youngest son of the testator\u2019s sister Florence Ann Clark. But William B. Clark died in 1968, before the death of the testator\u2019s wife. When the testator\u2019s wife died, George Richard Clark (William B. Clark\u2019s older brother) was Florence Ann Clark\u2019s youngest living son. So the present contest is between William B. Clark\u2019s heirs (appellees) and George Richard Clark (appellant) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The trial court held that the remainder interest in Bunker Hill vested in William B. Clark at the testator\u2019s death and was not divested upon William B. Clark\u2019s death before the death of the testator\u2019s wife. The appellant, George Richard Clark, contends that William B. Clark\u2019s interest was divested at his death, and that Bunker Hill vested in George Richard Clark upon the death of the testator\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Our purpose of course is to find the testamentary intent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If a will reflects a clear intent that the determination of beneficiaries be postponed until a life tenant\u2019s death, rather than the testator\u2019s death, we honor that intent. <em>See Griffin </em>v. <em>Central Nat'l Bank, </em>194 Va. 485, 74 S.E.2d 188 (1953). But if a will is ambiguous in this regard, we invoke the aid of the canon of construction known as the early vesting rule. Under that rule, \u201cdevises and bequests are to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>strued as vesting at the testator\u2019s death, unless the intention to postpone the vesting is clearly indicated in the will\u201d. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>90 Va. 409, 411, 18 S.E. 913 (1894).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A case in point is <em>Catlett </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>37 Va. (10 Leigh) 79 (1839), involving the will of Thomas, Lord Fairfax. Lord Fairfax bequeathed annuities under his will to each of his three nieces. Respecting the third annuity, the will provided, \u201cupon the death of my other [third] niece, Ann Suzanna Martin, the annuity of \u00bf100. sterling bequeathed to her be given and continued to the fourth child of the said Bryan Fairfax, during his or her natural life\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">At the death of Lord Fairfax, Elizabeth Fairfax was Bryan Fair-fax\u2019s fourth living child in the order of seniority; but at the death of the life tenant, Anne Fairfax (who was born after Lord Fairfax\u2019s death) was Bryan Fairfax\u2019s fourth living child in the order of seniority. (William Fairfax, Bryan Fairfax\u2019s second living child in the order of seniority at Lord Fairfax\u2019s death, died before the life tenant died.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The contest in <em>Catlett </em>was between the fourth child at the testator\u2019s death and the fourth child at the life tenant\u2019s death, each contending that she qualified as the fourth child under the terms of the testator\u2019s will. Applying the early vesting rule, the Court held that the fourth child living at the testator\u2019s death, Elizabeth Fairfax, was entitled to the annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Just as the Court in <em>Catlett </em>could find in Lord Fairfax\u2019s will no clear indication of intent to postpone the vesting of the gift until the death of the life tenant, Ann Suzanna Martin, we can find in John Oliver Hanks\u2019s will no clear indication of intent to postpone the vesting of the gift until the death of the life tenant, Gertrude Hanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Article Fifth of Hanks\u2019s will (note 1 supra) devised a remainder interest in Bunker Hill to beneficiaries described as his children living or in their mother\u2019s womb at his death. Alternatively, if Hanks left no children, Article Sixth of the will devised the remainder interest to persons described as the youngest son of each of the testator\u2019s sisters. In neither Article did the testator attach a condition that the remaindermen must survive the life tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In both Articles Fifth and Sixth, the testator devised the remainder interest \u201cafter the decease of my wife Gertrude Hanks\u201d. These words might be taken to. refer to the time when the beneficiaries should be determined, as contended by George Richard Clark\u2019s counsel. Conversely, these words, which are substantially the same as used in Lord Fairfax\u2019s will <em>-{supra), </em>might be taken to refer merely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the time when the beneficiaries should enjoy or possess the remainder interest. In view of the ambiguity, we should determine the testamentary intent by applying the early vesting rule. And under that rule, the beneficiaries must be determined at the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Counsel for George Richard Clark emphasizes the word \u201cliving\u201d, found in the last sentence of Article Sixth: \u201cIf there is no youngest sons of the above named Sisters <em>living </em>then to the Youngest daughter of any or all of my sisters\u201d. Counsel argues that since the word \u201cliving\u201d must mean living at the death of the testator\u2019s wife, the sentence reflects a clear intent to postpone the determination of the class until the death of the testator\u2019s wife. But \u201cliving\u201d may be taken to refer either to the time of the testator\u2019s death or to the time of his wife\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again we find ambiguity that calls for application of the early vesting rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">For the reasons stated, we hold that the trial court properly construed the will of John Oliver Hanks as vesting in William B. Clark at the testator\u2019s death an indefeasible remainder interest in Bunker Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> Article Fifth of the will provides: \u201cIf there should be a child or children born and living at my death, or during ten months thereafter, I give and devise to them in fee simple after the decease of my wife Gertrude Hanks the said tract or parcel of land known as Bunker Hill which is above described to be equally divided among them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\"> William B. Clark died intestate, leaving as his heirs his wife, Elizabeth J. Clark (now Shinnick), and his daughter, Nancy C. Hood. Elizabeth J. Shinnick and Nancy C. Hood are the appellees who have an interest in the outcome of this appeal. The other appellees are Kenneth G. Whaley and Thomas H. Headley, the youngest sons of the testator\u2019s sisters Mary Willie Whaley and Susan Gertrude Headley, and Jeannette Hanks C. Cotterell, the youngest daughter of Florence Ann Clark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-16\"> \u201cI think we may concede without citation of supporting cases, of which there must be many thousands, that the purpose of construing a will (where construction is necessary) is to find the intent of the testator. We are perfectly agreed that this must be found from the whole will\u2014from its \u2018four corners\u2019. The cliches and formulas by which this never-doubted principle is expressed are so numerous and so frequently cited that no lawyer now grasps a will by its four corners without facing north.\u201d <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>225 N.C. 611, 621-22, 36 S.E.2d 17, 23 (1945) (Seawell. J., dissenting opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"><em> </em>The word \u201cliving\u201d may also be taken to refer to the times of the deaths of the testator\u2019s sisters. But at oral argument counsel for George Richard Clark declined to advocate that interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
