That the use of such space for parking is both permitted and required by the Ordinance seems quite clear and appears to be conceded by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The appellants have failed to point out wherein the Ordinance requires the lease or rental of parking space only with office space. They would have us infer such a requirement because: (1) the purpose of the Ordinance is to encourage off-street parking; (2) the mandate of \u00a7 30-3.10.6 prohibits any encroachment upon or reduction \u201cin any manner\u201d in the required off-street parking; and (3) \u201ccommercial parking lots\u201d are only permitted by the Ordinance in an I-G (Industrial general) zone and are, therefore, prohibited in the more restricted CO-H zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The Board has confused the <em>use </em>of property with <em>compensation for use </em>of property. These are two entirely separate and distinct things. <em>Mooreland </em>v. <em>Young, </em>197 Va. 771, 91 S.E.2d 438 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Under Article 8 of Chapter 11 of Title 15.1 of the Code the General Assembly has authorized local governing bodies by ordinance to control the use and development of lands within their respective jurisdictions. There is no legislation, however, which enables these governing bodies to control the compensation for use of land or the improvements thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The purpose of the Ordinance to encourage off-street parking in a congested metropolitan area is a laudable one. The prohibition of \u00a7 30-3.10.6 of the Ordinance is directed to and only prohibits encroachment upon or diminution in the physical space required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>be set aside for parking and is not directed to diminution of use which might result because compensation is charged. The lease or rental of parking space to a limited clientele, not to the public generally, on a regular, not a casual or transitory basis, does not constitute the operation of a \u201ccommercial parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">We agree with the trial court that the use of the property for motor vehicle parking is a permitted one under the Ordinance and that the Ordinance does not require that parking space be leased only with and as a part of the lease or rental of office space. In such a situation the landlord, who is entitled to compensation for the use of his property, is not prohibited from making a separate rental agreement with respect to and receiving compensation for the use of his property for parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
