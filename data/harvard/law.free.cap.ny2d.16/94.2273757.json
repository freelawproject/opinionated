V.

The apportionment scheme established by Local Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>No. 1 would operate to and was intended to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of certain political elements of the voting population of the City of Binghamton and is violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States and New York State Constitutions. <em>(Fortson </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>379 U.

Local Law No. 1 fails to comply with all of the relevant provisions of the Municipal Home Buie Law and is, therefore, void and of no effect. <em>(Matter of McCabe </em>v. <em>Voorhis, </em>243 N. Y. 401; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>373 U. S. 284.) X.

S. Const., 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11). Following the commencement of the action, the Mayor of Binghamton was added as a party defendant and four of the councilmen, all members of the political party with minority representation on that body, originally named as defendants were permitted to intervene and serve their own papers in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 position. The remaining defendants moved to dismiss the action, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a), primarily on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action because, in their words, <em>\u201c </em>the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction \u201d of such eases. The plaintiffs countered by requesting that the motion be treated as one for summary judgment (CPLR 3211 [c]) and that such relief be granted in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Justice Sloan at Special Term concluded that no triable issue of fact existed and directed summary judgment for the plaintiffs. In so doing, he declared that 1 \u2018 the present scheme <em>* * * </em>deprives each of the plaintiffs of his right to equal representation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, and section 11 of article I of the the Constitution of the State of New York\u201d. (45 Misc 2d 940, 943-944.) The court also announced that it would retain jurisdiction of the action in order that it might thereafter entertain \u20181 an application by any of the parties for a review of any * * * plan adopted by local law \u201d. (45 Misc 2d, at p. 944.) No appeal was taken from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Following a public hearing in April, the Binghamton Common Council passed Local Law No. 1 of 1965, adopting a new districting plan. Approved by the defendant Mayor, it was thereafter filed with the Broome County Board of Elections for the purpose of being submitted, pursuant to section 23 of the Municipal Home Rule Law, to a referendum. However, before the date set for such submission, Justice Sloan, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>application of the plaintiffs and the intervening defendants, held that the proposed districting plan still failed to meet constitutional requirements. The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion and, as indicated, granted the defendants leave to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As presently constituted, the Binghamton Common Council is made up of 13 members. Each is elected by the inhabitants of one of the city\u2019s 13 \u201c wards \u2019 \u2019 and has the power to cast one vote, of equal weight with the others, on matters coming before the Council. According to the latest United States census, that of 1960, the population of the wards varies from 542 in the 9th ward to 11,426 in the 4th ward. In fact, on the basis of the existing scheme, it is possible for 7 councilmen \u2014 those from the 2d, 13th and 7th through 11th wards \u2014 representing less than 27% of the population of the city to enact laws opposed by and, by the same token, to defeat legislation favored by members representing over 73% of Binghamton\u2019s citizens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">By the terms of Local Law No. 1 of 1965, enacted after Special Term\u2019s decision invalidating the existing plan, it was proposed that the Council be reduced from 13 to 7 members, each to be elected from one of seven <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>districts \u2019 \u2019, the boundaries of which would follow those of the former \u201c wards \u201d with certain of the less populous wards simply being incorporated into the new and larger districts. The population of each of the new districts \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>again, as indicated by the 1960 census \u2014 varies from 7,863 in the 6th district to 15,808 in the 7th district.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The defendants attempt to justify the new plan by proffering and relying upon population figures based not on the 1960 census but on their own surveys and estimates which, it is to be noted, reduce somewhat the discrepancies between the various districts:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>District Population</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">1 9,615</p>\n<p id=\"Am3\">2 10,501</p>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">3 10,600</p>\n<p id=\"AT0\">4 11,588</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">5 9,640</p>\n<p id=\"AM9\">6 8,640</p>\n<p id=\"Av6\">7 12,003</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">These estimates, employed by the Council in drafting the new plan, were arrived at, first, by \u2018 \u2018 up-dating \u2019 \u2019 the 1960 census figures, by taking into account, in the defendants \u2019 words, <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 various factors which affect the population [of Binghamton] such as movement of people, downtown urban renewal, extensive highway construction, and future available areas for expansion, all based on proper statistical projection of known facts \u2019 \u2019, and, second, by excluding the 3,217 persons (included by the census) who are patients in the Binghamton State Hospital located within the new 7th district.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Reasoning that \u201c [Residents in or at the Binghamton State Hospital are. a part of the population and may not be eliminated from * * * proposed Councilmanic District No. 7 \u201d and that \u201c [t]he approximations of increase and decrease of population by reason of population movement and other factors are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>at best estimates and are not to be accepted in lieu of the Federal census \u201d (46 Misc 2d 289, 291), Justice Sloan at Special Term rejected the defendants\u2019 population figures and, looking to the data supplied by the 1960 census, concluded that the Local Law did not meet constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The present action was, of course, prompted by recent Supreme Court eases holding that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that representation in both houses of a state\u2019s legislature be substantially proportionate to the number of people represented under the principle of <em>11 </em>one person, one vote. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There can be little doubt, and it is not disputed by the defendants, that that principle is applicable to elective legislative bodies exercising general governmental powers at the municipal level (cf. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U. S. 533, 575; <em>Gomillion </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>364 U. S. 339), and such has been the conclusion reached by several courts called upon to consider the question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">/ It is axiomatic that local governmental units are creations of, and exercise only those powers delegated to them by, the State (N. Y. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; Municipal Home Rule Law, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11) and, certainly, if the latter may exercise its legislative powers only in a body constituted on a population basis, any general elective municipal organ to which it delegates certain of its powers must, by a parity of reasoning, be subjected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>same constitutional requirement! Viewed in another way, if, as seems evident, the thrust of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions is that it is inherent within the concept of \u201c equal protection \u201d that a person has a substantial right to be heard and to participate, through his elected representatives, in the business of government on an equal basis with all other individuals, no reason or justification exists for differentiating, so far as that right is concerned, between the general governmental business carried on in the highest legislative organs of the State and that conducted, by virtue of a delegation of authority, in municipal law-making bodies. (See, generally, Weinstein, The Effect of the Federal Reapportionment Decisions on Counties and Other Forms of Municipal Government, 65 Col. L. Rev. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Nor can there be any question that the courts of New York, obliged as they are to uphold the Federal Constitution as well as this State\u2019s Constitution\u2014whose equal protection clause, we have said, is as broad in its coverage as that of the Fourteenth Amendment (see <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant Town Corp., </em>299 N. Y. 512, 530, 544) \u2014 are vested with jurisdiction of actions brought to vindicate the right to equal representation. (See <em>Matter of Orans, </em>15 N Y 2d 339; <em>Maryland Committee </em>v. <em>Tawes, </em>377 U. S. 656, 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">This brings us to that aspect of the decision below invalidating Binghamton\u2019s Local Law No. 1 of 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The \u2018 \u2018 overriding objective \u2019 \u2019 of any legislative apportionment (or districting) plan, the Supreme Court has made clear, \u201c must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen\u201d. <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U. S. 533, 579, <em>supra.) </em>In light of this objective, \u201c the proper judicial approach \u201d in evaluating the constitutional validity of any particular plan, the court went on to say in a companion case to <em>Reynolds, </em>\u201cis to ascertain whether, under the particular circumstances existing \u2019 \u2019 in the individual locality whose legislative scheme is in issue, \u2018 \u2018 there has been a faithful adherence to a plan of population-based representation, with such minor deviations only as may occur in recognizing certain factors that are free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination\u201d. <em>(Roman </em>v. <em>Sincock, </em>377 U. S. 695, 710.) Judged in these terms, the Binghamton plan now before us may not withstand attack.</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Even accepting the defendants\u2019 own population figures (i.e., those used by the Council in adopting the Local Law and arrived at by \u201c up-dating \u201d the 1960 census and excluding from district No. 7 the patients at the State Hospital), significant population discrepancies exist between certain of the seven councilmanic districts. For instance, although each district is allotted but one representative and, thus, one vote on the Council, district No. 7 (population: 12,003) includes nearly 50% more people than district No. 6 (population: 8,640), and almost as serious discrepancies exist between district No. 1 (population: 9,615) or district No. 5 (population: 9,640) and district No. 4 (population: 11,588) or district No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Manifestly, then, Local Law No. 1, far from representing, to cull from the opinion in the <em>Roman </em>case (377 U. S. 695, 710, <em>supra), \u201c </em>a faithful adherence to a plan of population-based representation \u201d, perpetuates a denial of the right of many of Binghamton\u2019s citizens to equal protection of the law in their representation on the Common Council. Not only do the defendants \u2019 population figures demonstrate that the revised districting scheme entails more than a <em>\u201c </em>minor deviation\u201d from the <em>\u201c </em>one person, one vote \u201d principle but no special considerations or factors are called to our attention to rationally explain the patent discrepancies. On the contrary, Binghamton\u2019s relatively small population\u2014 75,941, according to the 1960 census \u2014 and rather compact geographic area suggest that the task of redistricting its Common Council, so as to assure to its citizens a closer approximation to equality of representation than that provided by Local Law No. 1, is a responsibility which may be met without great difficulty. To paraphrase what we said in <em>Matter of Sherrill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(188 N. Y. 185, 210), no possible legitimate purpose for the exercise of discretion to create districts unequal in population has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The disparities of population among the councilmanic districts created by the Local Law are, to some extent, more acute when the numerical size of those units is gauged by the 1960 census figures. To take but one example, district No. 7 (population: 15,808), under those calculations, contains over 100% more people than district No. 6 (population: 7,863). In our opinion, the courts below correctly held that (1) the latest official census is to be employed in determining population for districting pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>poses and (2) the patients at the State Hospital are properly to he included (as they are in the 1960 Federal census) as part of the population of the district wherein that hospital is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">A municipality may not devise its own method of calculating population as a basis for deriving a districting plan for its elective law-making body where the state has, by Constitution or statute, mandated that population be determined in a prescribed manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our view, Hew York has adopted such a prescription./For instance, this State\u2019s Constitution (art. III, \u00a7 4) makes the latest Federal census \u2018 \u2018 controlling as to the number of inhabitants in the state or any part thereof\u201d for purposes of State legislative apportionment, and numerous statutes likewise make that census the determinant whenever \u201c population \u201d is a factor to be taken into account.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Particularly significant is section 11 of the Optional City Government Law (L. 1914, ch. 444, repealed L. 1939, ch. 765 but \u201c frozen \u201d as to city governments, such as Binghamton, adopted under its authority) which, in effect, requires that \"the latest state census or United States census, whichever shall be later \u201d, be employed to determine \u201c the number of inhabitants of a city \u201d whenever such inquiry is pertinent to <em>laws passed by the city\u2019s legislative body.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Although, admittedly, no constitutional or legislative provision specifically deals with \u201c population \u201d as it relates to <em>local </em>apportionment or districting, the declared policy is readily apparent and reason dictates that the most recent official census be employed in this area as well. Reliance upon such a source will assure periodic, impartial population data on the basis of which an apportionment or districting plan may be initially developed and thereafter regularly revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>All that need be said about the patients at the State Hospital is that, in the light of current state policy, the action of the defendants in excluding them from their districting plan without any investigation of relevant factors \u2014 such as, for instance, where they had previously lived and where they had voted in the past\u2014 is arbitrary and discriminatory. The Federal census, as indicated, includes these patients as residents of Binghamton\u2019s present 12th ward, now within the new 7th district, and no sound reason has been suggested for denying them representation on the city\u2019s Common Council. On the contrary, it seems undisputed that many of the patients are from the Binghamton area and that many were voluntarily admitted to the hospital (Mental Hygiene Law, \u00a7 70, subd. 1, par. [a]) and, not having been judicially declared incompetent, are actually entitled to vote (Election Law, \u00a7 152, subd. 6). Therefore, to treat these patients, as the defendants have, as if they did not exist is to depart, improperly, from the concept of population-based legislative representation. (See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>377 U. S. 678, 691 [relating to exclusion of military personnel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Van Voobhis, Burke, Scileppi and Bergan concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. While the case has been referred to by the parties as one involving \u201capportionment\u201d, it deals, strictly speaking, with an issue of \u201cdistricting\u201d. \u201cApportionment and districting\u201d, it has been said by the Citizens\u2019 Committee on Reapportionment, \u201cmust be differentiated. Apportionment is the process by which legislative seats are distributed among units entitled to representation; districting is the establishment of the precise geographical boundaries of each such unit or constituency.\u201d (New York Citizens\u2019 Committee on Reapportionment, Report to Governor Nelson A.
