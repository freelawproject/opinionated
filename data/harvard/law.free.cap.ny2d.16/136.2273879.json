Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case against Triborough, and the complaint against it should have been dismissed. II. Triborough had no duty with respect to the maintenance of the blow-off pot at the time of the accident herein since it was neither an owner nor occupier of the pot nor did it exercise any control over its maintenance and use. <em>(Cullings </em>v. <em>Goetz, </em>256 N. Y. 287; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>New York, O. &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>261 N. Y. 489; <em>Kenny </em>v. <em>Doral Constr.

III. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Triborough is an occupier or possessor of the blow-off pot and has a duty to maintain it, plaintiff still has failed to make out a prima facie case since, on the facts herein, the pot was at all times fit for its intended use and a \u201c safe place to work\u201d as that phrase is used in section 200 of the Labor Law. <em>(Zucchelli </em>v. <em>City Constr. Co., </em>4 N Y 2d 52; <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Di Cesare &amp; Monaco Concrete Constr.

Triborough cannot be held liable for failure to provide a safe place to work since the record herein is devoid of any proof that Triborough had actual or constructive notice of the unknown cause of death. <em>(Wohlfron </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Edison Co., </em>238 App. Div. 463.) V. Neither Triborough nor Lockwood, Kessler and Bartlett, Inc., particularly Triborough who was not present, exercised any direction or control over the manner in which Mr. Persichilli, an employee of Nassau-Mascali, carried out the details of his work on June 13, 1956. In any event, the trial court did not charge on the issue of assumption of control. <em>(Broderick </em>v. <em>Cauldwell-Wingate Co., </em>301 N. Y. 182; <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Di Cesare &amp; Monaco Concrete Constr. Corp., 9 </em>A D 2d 379; <em>Iacono </em>v. <em>Frank &amp; Frank Contr. Co., </em>259 N.

Y. 222; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>214 N. Y. 316.) VI. The expert testimony of plaintiff failed to establish any custom to ventilate applicable to the work in question. <em>(Garthe </em>v. <em>Ruppert, </em>264 N. Y. 290; <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>New York Consolidated R. R. Co., </em>230 N. Y. 194.) VII. It was error to charge Triborough had a duty to provide a safe place to work to an employee of Nassau-Mascali. VIII. The court erred when it charged that the issue of whether the blow-off pot came within the provisions of section 200 of the Labor Law was a question of fact. <em>(Dell\u2019Olio </em>v. <em>Mastronardi, </em>267 App. Div. 829; <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Reisberg &amp; Reiner, </em>244 App. Div. 822; <em>Vooth </em>v. <em>Castroviejo, </em>206 Misc. 85.) IX. The court erred in charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the jury that the failure to comply with the recognized practice, custom and general usage may be deemed some evidence of negligence. X. There was no evidence as to the exact nature of the condition causing the Persichilli death, and no evidence as to the duration of its existence and, therefore, there was no factual basis for a charge of constructive notice. Since Triborough had no duty to maintain or ventilate the pot, there was no legal basis for the charge of constructive notice. XI. The trial court did not err in granting Triborough judgment over against Nassau-Mascali, the primary active wrongdoer, since the contract provisions and the common-law distinction between active and passive neglience warranted such indemnification. <em>(Turner Constr.

Plaintiff\u2019s intestate (contractor\u2019s employee) was upon the premises as an invitee, toward whom defendant Triborough (as the occupant and possessor and the one in control of the project premises) owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to provide him with a safe place to work. <em>(Hess </em>v. <em>Bernheimer &amp; Schwartz Pilsener Brewing Co., </em>219 N.

The duty owed by the owner, occupier or possessor of premises to provide a contractor\u2019s employee with a reasonably safe place to work is nondelegable. <em>(Wohlfron </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Edison Co., </em>238 App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Div. <em>463, 263 N. </em>Y. <em>547; Powell </em>v. <em>Senville 35th St. Realty Corp., </em>29 Misc 2d <em>77.) </em>III.

This being a death action, a lesser degree of proof was required of plaintiff to establish the negligence of Triborough. <em>(Noseworthy </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>298 N. Y. 76.) VI.

Triborough had no duty to supply a safe place to work to deceased, with reference to the blow-off pot at the time of the casualty, because the blow-off pot was not a place of work within the meaning of section 200 of the Labor Law and, therefore, plaintiff\u2019s complaint against Triborough should have been dismissed, and Triborough\u2019s third-party complaint against Nassau-Mascali should have been dismissed. <em>(Zucchelli </em>v. <em>City Constr.

Assuming theoretically that the proof permits an inference that Triborough either directed deceased or assured deceased\u2019s safety, such act would be active negligence barring indemnity and, therefore, Triborough\u2019s third-party complaint against NassauMascali should have been dismissed. <em>(Putvin </em>v. <em>Buffalo Elec.

III. The indemnity provision does not require indemnity to Triborough for its own active negligence. <em>(Thompson-Starrett Co. </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>271 N.

That Triborough was the possessor or occupier of the blow-off pot is immaterial in the absence of direction or assurance of safety and no liability inures to Triborough merely by being the possessor. <em>(Grant </em>v. <em>Rochester Gas &amp; Elec. Corp., </em>20 A D 2d 48.) V. Plaintiff failed to prove any custom that in road construction work blow-off pots should be ventilated before people entered them, and this constituted a failure of proof of negligence. <em>(Garthe </em>v. <em>Ruppert, </em>264 N.

(Nassau-Mascali), who died from asphyxiation during the course of his employment. The facts upon which plaintiff\u2019s claim is based are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In September, 1954 defendant Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (Triborough) entered into a contract with third-party defendant Nassau-Mascali to perform construction work, as general contractor, on Conduit Boulevard in the Borough of Queens, New York. This contract, known as CB-1, involved a work area covering several miles, and generally called for the performance of grading, paving and general construction work. During the same month, Triborough also contracted with defendant Lockwood, Kessler, Bartlett, Inc. (Lockwood), consulting engineers, to take charge of and supervise such construction work.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On May 25, 1955 the Department of Water Supply, Gras and Electricity of the City of New York wrote Lockwood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>requested that Nassau-Maseali he permitted to construct a \u201c blow-off pot \u201d for the city in the vicinity of the work being performed on Conduit Boulevard. This <em>11 </em>blow-off pot\u201d was to be connected by means of a 16-inch pipe to a 72-inch water main which ran under the roadbed. The 72-inch water main was divided into sections, and the function of the \u201c blow-off pot \u201d was to serve as a reservoir in the event that water had to be drained from a section of the 72-inch main. This would be accomplished by the use of valves located in a \u201cblow-off manhole \u201d which would isolate the section of the water main to be drained, and divert the water therefrom through the 16-inch pipe into the \u201c blow-off pot \u201d. The pot, which was installed in the grass mall dividing the lanes of traffic on Conduit Boulevard, was rectangular in shape, about 4 feet square, and approximately 16 feet deep. Its sides and bottom were of reinforced concrete, with iron rungs set into one side to form a ladder, and the top was covered by an iron manhole cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The \u201c blow-off pot\u201d was not part of the original contract entered into between Triborough and Nassau-Maseali and, accordingly, after the city\u2019s request was approved, an extra work order covering the construction of this item was prepared by Lockwood and signed by Triborough and Nassau-Maseali. As a result of this extra work order, the construction of the \u201c blow-off pot\u201d became a part of the contract and subject to its terms and conditions; however, plans and specifications for the construction were furnished by the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, and the cost of construction was chargeable to the Corporate Stock Funds of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Construction of the \u201cblow-off pot\u201d was completed on June 28, 1955 and, although the city had not accepted it at the time of the accident, it admitted ownership of the pot on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Around the latter part of May, 1956 cracks developed in the pavement recently laid by Nassau-Maseali on Conduit Avenue in the vicinity of the \u201cblow-off pot\u201d. The reason for the cracking was the settling of the subgrade, but no one knew what had caused the subgrade to settle. Accordingly, a conference was held on May 31, 1956 among representatives of Lockwood and Nassau-Maseali, at which time Lockwood directed Nassau-Maseali to remedy the defect, remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>cracked portions of the pavement and dig test holes to ascertain why the subgrade was settling.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On June 13, 1956, the cause of the settling of the subgrade still being unknown, another conference was called by Mr. Robert Willit, Lockwood\u2019s resident engineer on the job. This conference was attended by Mr. Willit; Mr. Dickson of the Department of Water Supply, Gras and Electricity, and his assistant; Mr. Darpino, Nassau-Mascali\u2019s superintendent on the job, and decedent, Archangelo Persiehilli. At this conference it was thought that leakage from one of the city\u2019s water pipes might be causing the settling of the subgrade and, to test this theory, Mr. Willit descended into the \u201c blow-off manhole \u201d and inspected its condition. Finding the manhole dry, Mr. Willit returned to the surface and related his findings to those present. Shortly thereafter the conference ended and the representatives of the Department of Water Supply, Gras and Electricity left.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Mr. Willit, Mr. Darpino and Mr. Persiehilli then proceeded to the \u201cblow-off pot\u201d and, at Mr. Darpino\u2019s suggestion, decedent descended into the pot with a shovel. He scraped the bottom of the pot with the shovel, and then started up the iron rungs set in the side of the \u201c blow-off pot \u201d. After climbing a couple of rungs, decedent fell back, apparently unconscious. A nearby crane operator who descended into the \u201c blow-off pot \u201d to render assistance and help decedent to the surface also was overcome and fell unconscious in the bottom of the pot. Both men finally were removed by a police officer wearing a gas mask but, although artificial respiration revived the crane operator, decedent failed to respond and died of asphyxiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s theory of negligence is the same against both Triborough and the city. It is that defendants failed to supply decedent with a safe place to work, and is succinctly stated in plaintiff\u2019s brief as follows: \u201c The negligence with which Triborough is charged is its failure and omission to take (with respect to the blow-off pot in question) the precautions dictated and required by usage and custom, to wit, the measures * * * testified to by Mr. Madeheim, before having, Persiehilli enter the same, when Triborough (through Lockwood) knew, or could and should have known, that the said structure was likely to contain noxious gases or an oxygen deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Mr. Madeheim, whose testimony is referred to above as the basis for plaintiff\u2019s claim, was a graduate engineer and an instructor in the field of industrial safety. Called as an expert witness by plaintiff, Mr. Madeheim testified to the custom and practice in New York City with respect to precautions taken before entering underground structures such as the \u201cblow-off pot \u201d here in issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">\u201c The practice is to use what is known as a gas sampling kit which is a little kit which usually measures some 12 inches by 12 inches by 4 inches thick. That is step one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">\u201c Step two is in connection with manholes that are 10 feet in depth or deeper. That is to provide mechanical ventilation for manholes regardless of the showing of the gas sample.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">\u201c The practice would be to take a portable blower with a canvas hose, hang this into the manhole to blow a supply of air from the surface into the manhole to make sure you would dissipate any air in the manhole which would be short of oxygen or contain gases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Plaintiff expressly disclaims any theory of negligence based upon defendants\u2019 failure properly to maintain the \u201c blow-off pot \u201d. Her only theory, as has been shown, is that defendants failed to adhere to the custom and usage in the construction trade of taking gas samples before entering the pot and, since this was a 16-foot hole, using a portable blower while decedent was in the \u201c blow-off pot\u201d. We do not believe that either Triborough\u2019s or the city\u2019s failure to supply this equipment constituted actionable negligence and, accordingly, hold that the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor must be reversed and her complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">It is by this time well settled that the duty to provide a safe place to work is not breached when the injury arises out of a defect in the subcontractor\u2019s own plant, tools and methods, or through negligent acts of the subcontractor occurring as a detail of the work <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Belt Assoc. </em>14 N Y 2d 129, 134; <em>Gasper </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>13 N Y 2d 104, 110-111; <em>Zucchelli </em>v. <em>City Constr. Co., </em>4 N Y 2d 52, 56; <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Bernheimer &amp; Schwartz Brewing Co., </em>219 N.Y. 415, 418-419). The <em>Hess </em>case particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>is apposite here. In that case an employee of an independent contractor, hired by defendant to varnish beer vats in its plant, died as the result of inhaling fumes of methyl alcohol while working in the vat. The contention was that defendant negligently failed to supply blowers to carry off the poisonous vapors, and thus violated its duty to provide decedent with a safe place to work (Labor Law, \u00a7 200). Noting that the contract between defendant and the decedent\u2019s employer (the contractor) required the latter to supply all the instrumentalities by which the work was to be done, the court stated (219 N. Y., pp. 418-419): \u201cIt cannot be said, however, that the duty of the employer is by this provision of the statute extended to supervision of the method of doing the work by the contractor, or that the employer thereby becomes responsible for <em>the negligence of the contractor in failing to furnish proper appliances therefor. </em>While the employer must exercise reasonable care to have his own plant safe for the employees of the contractor, he does not stand in the shoes of the contractor and become liable for the latter\u2019s negligence. If the employer furnishes a ladder or a scaffold for the contractor\u2019s employees to work on he must be careful to furnish a safe appliance <em>(Huston </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>138 App. Div. 810; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Mulcahy &amp; Gibson, </em>164 App. Div. 829), but if the contractor furnishes such appliances the employer does not thereby become responsible for their sufficiency. They are no part of the employer\u2019s plant; <em>failure to furnish them is not a defect in the employer\u2019s plant; he is under no absolute duty to furnish them and the statute has no application.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Here, just as in <em>Hess, </em>the contract between Triborough and Nassau-Mascali required the latter to furnish the necessary equipment to complete the job. Paragraph 1 of the general specifications of the contract provided that \u201c The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, plant, equipment and other incidentals necessary or required for the complete construction of the work as required by the Plans, in accordance with these Specifications and to the complete satisfaction of the Engineers.\u201d Even without this express provision, though, it would seem clear that it was decedent\u2019s employer\u2019s responsibility to furnish the proper supplies and materials to complete the job which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>it had contracted to do.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Certainly a property owner who engages an independent contractor to do a task which is not inherently dangerous should not be held to account for injuries to the contractor\u2019s employees because the contractor has omitted to bring along a tool vital to the job he was to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Since neither Triborough nor the city was required to supply gas measuring devices or air blowers to decedent, their failure so to do does not give rise to any liability to plaintiff. And it follows from this that Triborough\u2019s third-party complaint against Nassau-Mascali also must fall. The remaining appeals by the other parties to the action, of course, become academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The order appealed from should be modified by (1) reversing the judgment in favor of plaintiff against Triborough and dismissing the complaint, and (2) reversing the judgment against Nassau-Mascali on the third-party action by Triborough and dismissing Triborough\u2019s third-party complaint and, as so modified, the order appealed from should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Vookhis, Burke and Bergan concur with Judge Scileppi ; Chief Judge Desmond dissents and votes to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Order modified in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\"> We intimate no opinion as to whether Lockwood might have assumed such control over the project as to have taken that responsibility on itself. That question is not before us as the result of the Appellate Division\u2019s order for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
