Code, \u00a7 602) and committed to the California Youth Authority. He appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The record was filed on appeal but the reporter\u2019s transcript of the jurisdictional hearing failed to include the closing arguments of counsel. At page 107 of that transcript it merely recited, \u201c(Argument by counsel).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The minor applied to this court for augmentation to include the reporter\u2019s transcription of closing argument. We ordered the augmentation. Compliance with our augmentation order has proven impossible as the court reporter failed to take notes of the closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Based upon the inability to provide a complete reporter\u2019s transcript on appeal, the minor has moved this court for an order which would reverse and direct a new trial. At the outset we note that Welfare and Institutions Code section 677 required the court reporter to \u201ctake down in shorthand\u201d the closing arguments of counsel. It is unquestionable that the reporter was required to record closing argument and that the minor, upon a proper showing, is entitled to inclusion of that closing argument in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">To the extent the People resist the minor\u2019s new trial motion on the ground there is no showing (or reason to believe) the missing transcript is necessary to the minor\u2019s appeal, the People are wrong. Clearly one issue to be posed to this court is that of constitutionally defective trial counsel. Incompetent counsel is an issue often raised on appeal but rarely found supported. One reason for the dismal success record of the appellate issue is that the appellant may not simply speculate incompetency but must affirmatively prove it as a demonstrable reality on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">To successfully contend incompetency, what an appellant usually needs is trial counsel speaking his ignorance or mistake on the record. That is the exact situation found in the cornerstone decision of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]. If we were to conclude that the closing argument of the minor\u2019s counsel was here inconsequential to the appeal, we would be divesting the minor of that part of the record which <em>might </em>best support his contention (or which <em>might </em>best destroy the contention). This we cannot do and therefore find the argument of the People on the point to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The position of the minor on the effect of the unavailable transcript is that reversal and new trial are per se required. Supporting authority for the position is found in the cases of <em>In re David T., </em>55 Cal.App.3d 798 [127 Cal.Rptr. 729], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hulderman, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 375 [134 Cal.Rptr. 223], both decided by Division One of this court and with hearing denied in the more important <em>David T. </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On the other hand, there is considerable persuasion to the People\u2019s contention that no logical reason exists to treat this type of record defect any differently than a similar defect found in the case of an adult criminal defendant. If this proposition is accepted, then the criminal cases providing for a \u201cfair substitute\u201d for the transcript would be applicable. Representative cases of the \u201cfair substitute\u201d concept are <em>People </em>v. <em>Chessman, </em>35 Cal.2d 455 [218 P.2d 769, 19 A.L.R.2d 1084]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 80 [100 Cal.Rptr. 34], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuentes, </em>132 Cal.App.2d 484 [282 P.2d 524], Also see rule 39, California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The People\u2019s position goes on to urge that we should remand this matter to the trial court for the purpose of attempting to prepare a \u201cfair substitute,\u201d i.e., an agreed statement or a settled statement. At this point the persuasion swings to the minor as he contends such a record would be highly unfair to him since his trial counsel is dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We do not resolve the question of whether a \u201cfair substitute\u201d is permissible' in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 juvenile appeals for if we assume such procedure is appropriate, we must nevertheless grant minor\u2019s motion. The \u201cfair substitute\u201d urged by the People is an agreed statement or a settled statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">It is undisputed that counsel who represented the minor at the jurisdictional hearing is dead. This creates an unusual situation for not only has the error of the court reporter occurred but that error has been compounded by the death of minor\u2019s then counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The Appellate Department of the Los Angeles Superior Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>72 Cal.App.3d Supp. 59 [140 Cal.Rptr. 274] has recently held that the preparation of a settled statement on appeal is a critical point in a criminal proceeding. The court concluded \u201cthat the assistance of <em>informed </em>counsel during the preparation and settlement of the statement on appeal is essential to a. defendant seeking review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(Italics added.) The <em>Wilson </em>case is crystal, clear that it is the assistance of trial counsel to which the defendant is entitled. Presence and participation, not necessarily representation, is required of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>61 Cal.App,3d 102 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265], the attorney for Leslie Van Houten disappeared from trial after both sides had rested but before jury instructions had been finalized and before closing arguments. While a new attorney was appointed as co-counsel for her, it was concluded that Van Houten had been denied the effective assistance of counsel because her trial counsel was not available to present her argument to the jury. The court found the handicap on the new attorney too great to assume a meaningful adversary posture for he had been absent from all trial proceedings except argument. The court weighed the harm to Van Houten caused by the absence of her lawyer at a critical stage against the burden of retrial and concluded that \u201cthe fair administration of justice demands reversal.\u201d The court also quite accurately observed that \u201c[u]nder our. system of justice expediency is never exalted over the interest of fair trial and due process.\u201d (Pp: 197-203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We agree with <em>Wilson </em>that preparation of the appeal record when it is by means of agreed or settled statement is a critical stage for the appellant. We must also recognize that at the heart of the problem we consider is the failure of an official of the court, the court reporter, to fully discharge his duties mandated by law. It makes no difference why the court reporter did not report, the fact is that the minor has been deprived of a portion of the record because of the court reporter\u2019s omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Built upon this governmental error is the death of minor\u2019s counsel which, in our opinion, creates an intolerable circumstance in the terms of preparation of a \u201cfair substitute\u201d for the record to which the minor was entitled. And then, not only is the minor\u2019s counsel unavailable but the input the minor himself could provide is reasonably nonexistent not only because of lack of legal training but because of youth as well as the strain that must have existed in facing a proceeding to determine whether he had performed an act of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Minor\u2019s present counsel could, of course, represent the boy in preparation of a record but he accurately complains that such representation would be meaningless for he was not present at the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>hearing. While he could protect procedural rights, counsel\u2019s assistance would be worthless on the substantive content of the substitute record.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We have no hesitancy to conclude that given the death of counsel any so-called \u201cfair substitute\u201d would be a tarnish on the fairness of the judicial appellate process. Whether the concern of this court be termed as denial of Sixth Amendment rights or just a matter of common sense and a respect for fundamental due process, we are of the opinion that if we directed the court below to attempt a \u201cfair substitute\u201d we would be making a mockery of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We do not intend to suggest that the court below, the prosecutor, or anyone else involved in preparing a substitute record would act with any impropriety. <em>Wilson </em>observed \u201cthat few judges have the opportunity or ability to make a verbatim record of the proceedings before them.\u201d That case also recites that the necessity of informed counsel\u2019s participation in the substitute record preparation is even more important because \u201cof the inevitably adverse impact of the passage of time and the consideration of a multitude of other matters between the time of trial and the time of settlement on the memory of trial judges.\u201d Here the argument of counsel was made on May 26, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Whatever the state of memories and notes might be, the minor is certainly entitled to input by his then counsel. The minor is not necessarily entitled to <em>representation </em>by his trial counsel in the substitute record preparation for another attorney could adequately provide that function <em>so long as the trial attorney was available for input.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">There may be cases in which a \u201cfair substitute\u201d could be prepared without the presence of trial counsel\u2014this we do not decide. It is upon the facts and circumstances of this case before us that we conclude that a \u201cfair substitute\u201d record cannot be prepared. It is not enough for our review to merely prepare a \u201csubstitute\u201d record.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We repeat the unquestionable language of <em>Manson, </em>\u201c[ujnder our system of justice expediency is never exalted over the interest of fair trial and due process.\u201d To that we add that such expediency will not be exalted over a fair appeal. Our Supreme Court offered sage direction, occasionally overlooked in the enmeshed framework of procedural questions, when it said that \u201c[\u00a1Judicial logic should not be carried ruthlessly beyond the point of common sense. It should be the tool and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>not the master of judicial craftsmanship.\u201d <em>(Cothran </em>v. <em>San Jose Water Works, </em>58 Cal.2d 608, 612 [25 Cal.Rptr. 569, 375 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The minor is correct that under the circumstances a proper and trustworthy record cannot be prepared for review of this court. It thus is unnecessary to determine if the \u201cfair substitute\u201d procedure is available in juvenile appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The minor\u2019s motion is granted. The jurisdictional findings and dispositional order are reversed and the case remanded to the juvenile court for new trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 914; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1181, subd. 9.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
