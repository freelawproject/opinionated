J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4H\">Defendant appeals from the judgment entered following a juiy trial that resulted in his conviction for burglary. He contends: \u201cI. Prejudicial error occurred when the trial court instructed the juiy in the disjunctive, that appellant could be found guilty of burglary if he entered Pacoima T.V. with the specific intent to commit larceny <em>or </em>with the specific intent to receive stolen property. (CT 32.) II. The prejudicial effect of the foregoing error was compounded by the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as per appellant\u2019s request. III. The trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the use of his robbery conviction for impeachment purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The procedural facts determinative of the one fundamental issue tendered by this appeal are not in dispute. On the afternoon of August 4, 1976, appellant and one Lee Richardson broke the lock on the front door of the Pacoima T.V. shop, a shop wherein its owner kept television sets he had purchased at swap meets for repair and sale. When the police arrived on the scene after a few items had been removed and placed in appellant\u2019s car, appellant informed them, \u201cWe are helping the owner take this stuff out for safe-keeping\u201d because the store \u201cwas supposed to be ripped off that night.\u201d At trial the owner of the store, Roland Teal, known as Lucky, denied that.he had instructed appellant to enter his store for any purpose, or that he had given him permission so to do. However, he admitted that he had known appellant for some time, knew he was an ex-felon, and, in fact, had spoken with him at one of his bars only 35 minutes before learning that the police had apprehended appellant at the television shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In defense appellant testified that Teal had promised to \u201cgive us $200. and give me a position as a security officer\u201d if appellant would remove certain designated items from Teal\u2019s store. Originally it had been planned that the manager of the store would open it for appellant but, since this party unexpectedly had been arrested on the morning of the 4th, Teal assertedly had told appellant, \u201cBreak in. You got permission. If anything happens, I mean go wrong, I would take care of it.\u201d Appellant was also told that the merchandise to be taken would be found segregated in a certain location within the store and a van would arrive to aid appellant in transporting the more bulky items.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">When asked why, in his opinion, Teal might have wished his own property t\u00f3 be moved about in such an unusual fashion, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>indicated that he suspected Teal was a fence who was dealing in stolen property. He did not specifically inquire as to Teal\u2019s motives, however, since, he asserted, \u201cyou don\u2019t ask, not that man, questions. You just do it.\u201d When asked if he had considered \u201cjust stealing the stuff and reselling it, yourself,\u201d appellant replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t steal from that man, Mr. Lucky, and expect to live. He will have you killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">It is clear, of course, that if appellant\u2019s version of the facts were to be credited he would not have been guilty of burglary although he might have aided and abetted Teal in concealing stolen property if, in fact, the property was stolen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   This is true, the Supreme Court has recently said, because \u201c[t]he cases have preserved the common law principle that in order for burglary to occur, <em>\"The entry must be without consent. If the possessor actually invites the defendant, or actively assists in the entrance, e.g., by opening a door, there is no burglary.\u2019 </em>[Citation.] [\u00b6] Thus, section 459, while substantially changing common law burglary, has retained two important aspects of that crime. A burglary remains an entry which invades a possessory right in a building. And it still must be committed by a person who has no right to be in the building.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gauze, </em>15 Cal.3d 709, 713-714 [125 Cal.Rptr. 773, 542 P.2d 1365]; italics added.)  Clearly an entry into the possessor\u2019s premises for the purpose of carrying out the possessor\u2019s instructions is not burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Despite the foregoing legal proposition, however, after both sides had rested the prosecution moved to amend the information to conform to \u201cthe evidence that has been presented now by defendant\u2019s testimony, that he entered the T.V. store not to commit theft, but to conceal stolen property which is a felony and People submit that is\u2014this amendment would go to the proof that has been shown here in Court.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection this informal amendment was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We need not consider the many arguments made below and on this appeal concerning the proper manner in which the jury should have been instructed on the proposition that a consensual entry into premises to carry out the possessor\u2019s business may render the invitee, and presumably also the possessor-invitor, guilty of burglarizing the latter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>own premises if the latter, as the invitee suspects, has been engaged, or is presently engaged, or is about to engage, in felonious conduct vis-a-vis unknown third persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No rational instructions on such theoiy were possible since, its premises remained unproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The defendant\u2019s own story suggests he was engaged in some criminal activity\u2014conspiracy, receiving stolen property, insurance fraud\u2014but it rebuts the charge of burglary. Defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed on his theory of the case, i.e. that he entered the possessor\u2019s premises with the possessor\u2019s consent in order to carry out the possessor\u2019s instructions. If he had such consent his entry did not become burglary merely because the possessor himself had engaged, was engaging, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the court abused its discretion in allowing appellant\u2019s impeachment by means of a six-year-old conviction for robbery. Such impeachment falls within the area of trial-court discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Compton, J., and Beach, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">There was no evidence that any of the property involved was stolen despite appellant\u2019s expressed suspicions. Teal stoutly denied that he ever knowingly purchased or possessed stolen property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Although under the court\u2019s instructions appellant was guilty regardless of whose testimony was credited, the jury deadlocked until the court gave them a special instruction indicating, in essence, that appellant\u2019s acknowledged suspicions that Teal\u2019s property was stolen were sufficient to convict, regardless of the property\u2019s actual character.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
