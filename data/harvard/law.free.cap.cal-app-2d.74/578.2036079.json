In California, he turned the car in to defendant Anderson-Behel Porsche/Audi, Inc. for a credit of $1,700 on the purchase of a Porsche. Anderson-Behel sold the Chevrolet to Autocar-Europe, Inc., which in turn sold it to plaintiff Varwig. At some unspecified date the Las Vegas dealer caused the car to be repossessed. No issue as to the propriety of that retaking is raised here. Varwig sued Autocar and Doe defendants, including Anderson-Behel. The latter defendant moved for summary judgment. The motion was granted and summary judgment was entered in favor of Anderson-Behel against plaintiff, who appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The declaration filed by respondent in support of its motion for summary judgment avers only that respondent \u201chas never had any contact with nor made any representations to the plaintiff concerning the automobile in question,\u201d and that respondent \u201cwas not a party to the written agreement between defendant Autocar . . . and plaintiff.\u201d Appellant filed no declaration in opposition. Respondent asserts that \u201can opponent of a motion for summary judgment cannot rely on pleadings, but must make an independent showing.\u201d But a defendant seeking summary judgment must \u201crule out <em>all possible </em>merit\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s action <em>(Residents of Beverly Glen, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 117, 127 [109 Cal.Rptr. 724]). Moreover, although neither party can depend upon allegations in his own pleadings to cure deficient affidavits, \u201ca party can rely on his adversary\u2019s pleadings to establish facts\u201d <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>3 Cal.3d 176, 181 [89 Cal.Rptr. 737, 474 P.2d 689, 44 A.L.R.3d 615]).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The complaint alleges that defendant represented itself to be the owner of the Chevrolet, but \u201cknew that the representations were not true,\u201d and made such representation \u201cwith no sufficient or reasonable ground for believing it to be true.\u201d Respondent\u2019s uncontradicted declaration effectively removed any issue of direct representation to appellant.  But an actionable representation \u201cmay be made <em>indirectly </em>as well as directly.\u201d (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law. Torts. \u00a7 467. p. 2729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">If a representation is made with \u201cintent to defraud <em>... a particular class of </em>personsthe one making such a representation is deemed to have intended \u201cto defraud every individual in that class who is actually misled by the deceit.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 469, p. 2730, and authorities there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>As the Restatement puts it: \u201cThe maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability ... to another who acts in justifiable reliance upon it if the misrepresentation, although not made directly to the other, is made to a third person and the maker intends or has reason to expect that its terms will be repeated or its substance communicated to the other, and that it will influence his conduct. . . .\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 533.) It is not necessary that the maker of the representation \u201chave any particular person in mind. It is enough that he intends or has reason to expect to have it repeated to a particular class of persons and that the person relying upon it is one of that class.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>com. g.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Respondent\u2019s sole argument was and is that its representation of title was made only to Autocar and hence was not actionable by plaintiff. But respondent, in its cross-complaint against Autocar and its answer to Autocar\u2019s cross-complaint, set forth its contract for sale of the Chevrolet to Autocar. As a part of that contract, Autocar executed and delivered to respondent a certificate exempting the transaction from California sales tax, certifying that the Chevrolet \u201cwill be resold by me.\u201d At oral argument below, respondent\u2019s counsel readily conceded that his client \u201cwholesaled\u201d the Chevrolet to Autocar.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The resale sales tax certificate put respondent on notice that Autocar intended resale. Moreover, the transfer to Autocar at \u201cwholesale\u201d was possible only if Autocar was assured that it was receiving a transferable title. Thus respondent had \u201can advantage to gain ... by furnishing the misrepresentation for repetition\u201d to the class of persons interested in purchasing a secondhand 1973 Chevrolet. Such advantage \u201cis of great significance in determining\u201d whether respondent had \u201creason to expect that\u201d Autocar would repeat the misrepresentation. (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 533, com. e.) We conclude that on these facts, respondent\u2019s representation to Autocar was in law an indirect misrepresentation to plaintiff, who purchased the car in reliance upon Autocar\u2019s repetition of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Respondent argues that it could be liable only if its representation of title were a \u201cstatement in advertisements or communicated by means of other mass media\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Citizens Nat. Trust etc. Bank, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 480, 486 [300 P.2d 14]). But the <em>Cohen </em>language is but dictum. That case concerned an apartment house first sold in 1944. After an intermediate sale, Cohen bought it in 1946. In 1952, the health department barred use of basement apartments which had been added before 1944 in violation of the building code. Cohen sued the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(1944) seller, whose buyer had in no way indicated any intent to resell. We need not quarrel with the holding that Cohen had no right of action against the original seller under these facts (but see Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 532). The purported limitation of liability for indirect representation is, however, wholly unnecessaiy to the decision and, in light of current trends, is unacceptably broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The doctrine limiting liability for deceit stems from an 1889 decision of the House of Lords <em>(Derry </em>v. <em>Peek, </em>14 A.C. 337). A leading text writer has pointed out that American courts have greatly modified the limitation (Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed.) pp. 699-710). This area of the law \u201chas been undergoing change in the direction of liberalizing the rules as to the expected reliance,\u201d and the Restatement emphasizes that it \u201cis not intended to foreclose or discourage further developments.\u201d (Rest.2d, Torts, \u00a7 531, com. h.) Of course, we do not speculate as to the proof appellant can produce at trial. We hold only that, in the posture in which this case was submitted to the trial court, summary judgment was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Scott, J., and Devine, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> Retired Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
