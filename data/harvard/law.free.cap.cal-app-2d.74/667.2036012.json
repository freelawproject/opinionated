(Gov. Code, \u00a7 945.4.)  The trial court\u2019s resolution of the issues presented by the petition is subject to appellate review only for an abuse of discretion not supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 116, 120-121 [90 Cal.Rptr. 479]; <em>Black </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 670, 674 [91 Cal.Rptr. 104]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 844, 847 [114 Cal.Rptr. 518]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 946.6, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In his proposed complaint appellant alleges that he suffered personal injuries at the hands of Los Angeles police officers while being arrested on January 7, 1975. Appellant did not submit a written claim or application for leave to present a late claim until April 23, <em>1976. </em>Appellant obviously failed to satisfy either the 100-day time limit for filing a written claim for personal injuries (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2) or the 1-year time limit for filing with the city an application for leave to present a late claim (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Appellant contends that letters he wrote to the board of police commissioners and the mayor should have been construed as a claim and that the city\u2019s responses to these letters should estop the city from relying upon the claims statutes. These contentions are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The record on appeal does not contain the complaint which appellant apparently made to the board of police commissioners, nor does the record indicate the date of such complaint. The record shows only that the board of police commissioners sent a letter to appellant, apparently in reply, on April 24, 1975, the 107th day after the cause of action accrued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus the record does not show that appellant submitted even a letter within the first 100 days. Additionally, there is no evidence that agents of the city did anything during the first 100 days which prevented appellant from filing a timely claim as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">After receiving the board\u2019s letter, appellant delayed until September 11, 1975, and then wrote a letter to the mayor. Apparently receiving no reply, he wrote to Mayor Bradley again on December 1, 1975. That letter stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u201cPhilranzo Tyus a citizen of the United States of America, finds no individual gripe with arrest if it is deemed necessary. However, in this individual case with all the evidence I have brought forth, Mr. Bradley, it clearly shows to me the intent to do harm without provocation\u2014the harm being done to my singing advancement. I just can\u2019t sing any more! The intent is based on the grounds that the arresting officers knew what they were doing from a professional point of view and that is how to choke to subdue and the consequences are obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cWhy choke a person already in handcuffs? Why make a remark, \u2018You got a big mouth?[\u2019] I request a hearing in person because I don\u2019t accept the police commission\u2019s report or investigative report nor their medical report. I am seeking justification because there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me physically or medically at the time of the arrest, and I still have to see the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cIf nothing else can be arranged I would still wish a better letter written than the one I received from the Board of Police Commissioners, based on the Affidavit because the one on record now is a threat to my police record and my personal well being.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u201cWould very much appreciate a reply to this letter as soon as possible as this would be a great relief to a citizen.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Appellant alleges that not until the middle of March 1976 did he \u201cfinally discover[ ] that I had filed my claim (complaint) with the wrong agency and that the police commissioner and Mayor\u2019s Office did not have the authority to deny or accept a claim for personal injuries and damages.\u201d Appellant filed his application for leave to present a late claim on April 23, 1976. The city attorney responded on May 18, 1976, that \u201c[a]fter reviewing your claim, we bring to your attention the fact that your claim was not filed within one hundred (100) days as required by Government Code Section 911.2. Accordingly, we must deny your claim. [11] You may wish to consult an attorney about this matter if you have not already done so.\u201d Appellant filed his petition in superior court for relief pursuant to Government Code section 946.6 on August 2, 1976, and the petition was denied August 18, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The record provides no support for appellant\u2019s contention that he timely filed an \u201cinformal claim\u201d which should be deemed substantial compliance with the 100-day requirement. As pointed out above, the record does not show when appellant complained to the police department or what he said. At most, it could only be speculated that the complaint to the police department contained the same matter as appellant\u2019s letters to the mayor, and that the complaint might have been received within 100 days since it was investigated and answered on the 107th day. Even if we were to engage in such speculation, appellant\u2019s letter to the mayor cannot reasonably be construed as constituting a claim or substantially a claim. The letter requested only (1) \u201ca hearing\u201d (\u201cbecause I don\u2019t accept the police commission\u2019s report\u201d); (2) \u201cjustification\u201d (\u201cbecause there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me physically or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>medically at the time of the arrest, and I still have to see the doctor\u201d); and (3) \u201ca better letter written than the one I received from the Board of Police Commissioners\u201d (\u201cbecause the one on record now is a threat to my police record and my personal well being\u201d). Nowhere in the letter does appellant indicate that he is making a <em>claim for monetary damages. </em>Thus, even more basic than the failure of the letter to include the various items required by Government Code section 910 to be included in a claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the fact that the letter does not even purport to request monetary relief. (Compare the letter in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>McFadden, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 943 [106 Cal.Rptr. 685], which was from an attorney who had been retained by the claimant, and which unequivocally demanded that the matter be referred to the insurance carrier and indicated that a lawsuit would be initiated if the matter was not satisfactorily resolved.)  The purposes of the claims statutes include not only giving the public entity timely opportunity to investigate the claim and determine the facts, but also to settle meritorious claims without litigation. <em>(Lacy </em>v. <em>City of Monrovia, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 152, 155 [118 Cal.Rptr. 277]; <em>Sheeley </em>v. <em>City of Santa Clara, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 83, 86 [30 Cal.Rptr. 121].)  Appellant\u2019s letter failed to put the city on notice that there was in fact any claim to settle. (See <em>Stromberg, Inc. </em>v. <em>L.A. County Flood etc. Dist., </em>270 Cal.App.2d 759, 765-766 [76 Cal.Rptr. 183].) Appellant did not substantially comply with the claims statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Appellant contends \u201cthat the city made statements regarding his injuries in such a way as to lead him to believe that he had contacted the proper agencies in regards thereto, and also that these agencies purported to make determinations as to his injuries without disclosing the fact that there were other agencies which might better deal with his claim, or without advising him that he should seek counsel.\u201d The trial court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>properly find that the board of police commissioners and the mayor reasonably treated appellant\u2019s complaint as a citizen\u2019s complaint of police misconduct rather than a claim for monetary damages. They were under no duty to advise appellant of the claims statutes or to consult an attorney. <em>(McGranahan </em>v. <em>Rio Vista etc. Sch. Dist., </em>224 Cal.App.2d 624, 630 [36 Cal.Rptr. 798] (distinguishing <em>Dettamanti </em>v. <em>Lompoc Union School Dist., </em>143 Cal.App.2d 715, 721-722 [300 P.2d 78], cited by appellant).) In purporting to respond to appellant\u2019s complaint, they were not rejecting a claim for monetary damages, and the advice required by Government Code section 911.8 upon rejection of a claim was not applicable. (See <em>Stromberg, Inc. </em>v. <em>L.A. County Flood etc. Dist., supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 759, 764.) Their statements would not reasonably lead appellant to believe that they were acting upon a claim for monetary relief. (Cf. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 35, 40 [105 Cal.Rptr. 384].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Appellant is the one who chose to complain first to the board of police commissioners and, after apparently being dissatisfied with the board\u2019s response, to delay for five months and then write to the mayor. The board of police commissioners did not tell appellant to do so. Neither the board nor the mayor made misleading statements of the type found in <em>Mendibles </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 502, 506 [224 P.2d 42], and <em>Cruise </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 558, 564-565 [225 P.2d 988], cited by appellant. The trial court could reasonably conclude that appellant failed to act with reasonable diligence in determining the proper procedure if he wished to file a claim for monetaiy damages. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 116, 121. See <em>La Rue </em>v. <em>Swoap, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 543, 551 [124 Cal.Rptr. 329].)  Appellant\u2019s ignorance of the law will not alone create an excuse or an estoppel. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra; Roberts </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 844, 847.) Appellant failed to show that the city should be estopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Kaus, P.
