Appellants make several contentions: (1) that the trial court improperly impressed the lien upon the judgment without relitigating respondent\u2019s entitlement thereto following a reversal on an earlier appeal of an order of the trial court denying the lien; (2) that the court improperly found that appellants were not due rent for the period prior to and during the receivership of the leased premises; and (3) that the trial court erroneously gave priority to the lien upon the judgment and denied appellants\u2019 claim of equitable offset. This latter contention presents a question of first impression in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Preliminarily, we deny the motion to dismiss this appeal as frivolous. We have concluded that appellants\u2019 first and second contentions are without merit. As to the third contention, we have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>trial court erred in giving priority to the lien upon the judgment and denying appellants\u2019 claim of equitable offset. The conclusions we have reached require some discussion of the unpublished opinion of Division. Two of this court upon the earlier appeal. <em>(Salaman </em>v. <em>Bolt, </em>1 Civ. 37577.) We set forth the facts only to the extent necessary to resolve the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In May 1969 J. Franklin Salaman and Joseph Waldo Salaman (hereinafter appellants) entered into a 30-year lease with Albert D. Bolt (hereinafter Bolt) and Thomas Seeger for land and improvements commonly known as Redwood Marina. Seeger subsequently assigned his interest in the lease to Bolt, leaving him as the sole lessee. Appellant J. Franklin Salaman subleased a portion of the leased premises. Subsequently, appellants commenced proceedings in unlawful detainer against Bolt alleging a two-month default in the payment of rent. Appellants caused a receiver to be appointed to take possession of the leased property pursuant to a provision in the lease giving them that right upon any default by the lessee. Bolt was represented in the unlawful detainer action by Field, DeGoff, Huppert &amp; MacGowan, a law corporation (hereinafter Field). Bolt obtained a judgment on November 6, 1973. The judgment was predicated upon equitable grounds. The court found that Salaman, as sublessee, had intentionally withheld payment of rent in retaliation against Bolt\u2019s refusal to agree to a modification of the primary lease, and that his conduct constituted \u201coppressive, retaliatory and inequitable conduct.\u201d The court further found that Bolt was entitled to an award of $8,000 attorneys\u2019 fees and to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On May 20, 1975, Bolt confessed to judgment in favor of Field in the amount of $31,036.52 covering attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered, inter alia, in defending the unlawful detainer action. On May 29, 1975, Field noticed a motion to impress a lien pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 688.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon Bolt\u2019s cause of action for attorneys\u2019 fees and upon any judgment rendered thereon. This motion was denied on June 13, 1975. Field appealed the denial order and Division Two of this court reversed on April 23, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>On June 23, 1975, Bolt\u2019s judgment in the unlawful detainer action was modified to include the award of $8,000 attorneys\u2019 fees. In an unrelated action (Superior Court, San Mateo, No. 176932) appellants recovered a judgment by default against Bolt for $6,214.44 and on April 14, 1976, filed a motion, to offset their judgment against Bolt\u2019s judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees. This motion was amended on April 23, 1976 to include their claim for rent allegedly due for the period prior to and during which the receiver was in possession of the leased premises. Before this motion was heard, the decision reversing the denial of Field\u2019s motion was rendered. Field opposed appellants\u2019 motion urging that his right to a lien upon the judgment and the priority of that lien over appellants\u2019 claim of offset had been determined by the decision on appeal. He further urged that the general verdict in Bolt\u2019s favor in the unlawful detainer action constituted a finding against appellants on the rent they claimed to be due. On the hearing on appellants\u2019 motion, the court found that appellants were not entitled to the rent claimed, and that Field had a valid lien with priority over appellants\u2019 claim of offset. The court endorsed Field\u2019s lien upon the judgment and denied appellants\u2019 offset. It is from the ensuing judgment that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">1. The order impressing the lien upon the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Citing the rule that a general or unqualified reversal vacates the judgment and returns the case for further proceedings as if no judgment had ever been rendered (see generally, <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Lagiss </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 23, 44 [35 Cal.Rptr. 554]; see also <em>Erlin </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 547, 549 [61 P.2d 756]; <em>Estate of Pusey </em>(1918) <em>177 </em>Cal. 367, 371 [170 P. 846]; <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Krasna </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 1049, 1053 [91 Cal.Rptr. 250] [cert. den., 403 U.S. 931 (29 L.Ed.2d 710, 91 S.Ct. 2253)]; <em>Bate </em>v. <em>Marsteller </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 605, 618 [43 Cal.Rptr. 149]; <em>Weightman </em>v. <em>Hadley </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 831, 836 [292 P.2d 909]; <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Caire </em>(1919) 39 Cal.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>776, 778 [180 P. 58]), appellants contend that the superior court erroneously endorsed Field\u2019s lien upon the judgment without relitigating the issue of Field\u2019s entitlement thereto. (2) This general rule has a well recognized exception which was stated as follows in <em>Stromer </em>v. <em>Browning </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 513, 518-519 [74 Cal.Rptr. 155]: \u201cThe fact that the rule we discuss is a \u2018general\u2019 rule implies that it has limitations. One limitation is that a case is to be set at large for retrial only when that is the intent of the appellate court. \u2018Judgment reversed\u2019 at the end of an opinion is, of course, strong indication of such intent. But when the opinion as a whole establishes a contrary intention, the rule is inoperative. To hold otherwise would be to make a fetish of form.\u201d (See also <em>Barth </em>v. <em>B. F. Goodrich Tire Co. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 137 [92 Cal.Rptr. 809].)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Appellants recognize the <em>Stromer </em>exception, but contend that it is not here applicable because there were factual issues to be litigated on a rehearing. Field argues that a reading of the opinion indicates that the court intended to end litigation on the question of the lien, and that the reversal order was properly treated as a reversal with directions to impress the lien upon the judgment. With this we agree. The order of the trial court was reversed with the following language: \u201cIt follows.that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the judgment hen. The order is reversed.\u201d Despite the absence of express language reversing with directions, it is clear that the intended effect of the court\u2019s decision was to require that the lien be impressed without further litigation on the issue of Field\u2019s right thereto. The judgment awarding Bolt attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing party in the unlawful detainer action had become final, as was Field\u2019s judgment against Bolt. There was no allegation or showing of any fraud or collusion between Field and Bolt. The reviewing court reasoned that Code of Civil Procedure section 688.1 \u201cis remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to give effect to the remedy that it authorizes [citations].\u201d Under these circumstances, the <em>Stromer </em>exception to the general rule requiring retrial after a general reversal applies. The trial court\u2019s order that Field\u2019s lien be impressed upon Bolt\u2019s .judgment against appellants was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">2. The claim for rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Appellants claim that they are entitled to offset, in addition to their judgment against Bolt, their claim for rent allegedly due prior to and during the period of the receivership. The unlawful detainer action against Bolt was commenced by appellants on the allegation-of Bolt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>default in rent payments. The judgment in Bolt\u2019s favor in that action is now final and is dispositive of this issue. That judgment was grounded on equitable principles and upon the finding that appellant J. Franklin Salaman intentionally withheld, rent due Bolt in retaliation for Bolt\u2019s refusal to agree to a modification of his lease, and that this conduct was oppressive and inequitable. No rent was awarded appellants in that action. The issue has been adjudicated and determined in Bolt\u2019s favor. Appellants are now estopped to assert a claim for rent for the period covered by that action, and the trial court correctly so found. <em>(Todhunter </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1934) 219 Cal. 690 [28 P.2d.916]; <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439]; <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 810 [122 P.2d 892]; <em>Beverly Hills Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Glynn </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 274, 283 [93 Cal.Rptr. 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">3. The question of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We now reach the principal issue presented on this appeal: whether the trial court properly gave priority to Field\u2019s lien and denied appellants\u2019 claim to offset their judgment against Bolt\u2019s judgment. The question thus presented is one of first impression in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We are compelled to point out that language in the opinion of Division Two of this court on the first appeal clearly indicates that priority should be given to Field\u2019s lien over appellants\u2019 claim of offset. In its opinion, the court discussed Civil Code section 2897<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the rule of <em>Takehara </em>v. <em>H. C. Muddox </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 168, 170 [104 Cal.Rptr. 345, 501 P.2d 913], that the priority of the judgment creditors depends on the date of the orders creating their liens. The court reasoned that since appellants here had not shown that they had any lien which predated Field\u2019s lien, the trial co\u00fart\u2019s order denying Field\u2019s motion should be reversed. The opinion of the court was incorporated by reference in an affidavit filed by Field in opposition to appellants\u2019 motion. The trial court relied upon that language in making its order herein appealed from. The court referred to the decision reversing denial of the lien and concluded \u201cthat by reason thereof, the claim of Field, DeGoff, Huppert &amp; MacGowan, a law corporation, has priority over plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the claims of equitable set-off of the plaintiffs should be denied.\u201d Appellants contend that the court erroneously concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>priority should be given to Field\u2019s lien over their claim of offset. On the other hand, Field contends that the priority of its lien is established as the law of the case. Should that contention have merit, appellants\u2019 claim would necessarily be defeated since the amount of Field\u2019s lien exceeds the amount of Bolt\u2019s judgment against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Under the rule of the law of the case,- the statement by an appellate court of a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case on appeal conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial on appeal in the same case. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 463 et seq., p. 4419, and cases there cited.) However, the stated rule of law relied upon as the law of the case must have been necessary to the decision of the case on appeal. Obiter dicta is not included in the law of the case. (See <em>Gyerman </em>v. <em>United States Lines Co. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 488, 498 [102 Cal.Rptr. 795, 498 P.2d 1043]; <em>Stockton Theatres </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 469, 474 [304 P.2d 7]; <em>Tomaier </em>v. <em>Tomaier </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 754, 757 [146 P.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The only issue before the court on Field\u2019s appeal was his entitlement to a lien, and not the priority \"of his lien over other possible claims. As the opinion itself so aptly put it: \u201cThe only question presented by this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to impress a judgment lien against a prior judgment for $8,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to the attorneys of the tenant (Bolt),[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] after the successful defense of an action for unlawful detainer and back rent filed by the landlords (Salaman).\u2019\u2019 However, the conclusion of the court was not only that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the motion, but also that Field\u2019s lien was entitled to priority over any claims of appellants since appellants had not shown that they had any claims predating Field\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We conclude that the issue of priority was not properly before the court and that the statements regarding priority are dicta, and therefore, not included within the law of the case.  The court below, in deciding whether to allow appellants\u2019 claim of equitable offset, was called upon for the first time to determine the priority to be given to appellants\u2019 claim as against Field\u2019s lien. As already indicated, giving priority to Field\u2019s lien would defeat appellants\u2019 offset since Field\u2019s lien exceeded the amount of Bolt\u2019s judgment against appellants. Had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>court given priority to appellants\u2019 claim of equitable offset, Field\u2019s lien would reach only the excess, if any, remaining after appellants\u2019judgment had been offset. We are therefore called upon to determine whether it was proper for the trial court to give priority to Field\u2019s lien. We have concluded that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">No case has been cited to us, and we have found none, that is directly dispositive of the issue before us.  Among nonparty lien claimants, the basic rule is well established that they have priority according to the time of the orders creating their liens, \u201cother things being equal.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2897; <em>Takehara </em>v. <em>H. C. Muddox, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 168.) Flowever, the general intendment of the cases, as we read them, is that as between a statutory lien and a right of equitable offset, things are not equal and the offset is given an equitable preference. A lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by-which it is made security for the performance of an act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2872; see 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Personal Property, \u00a7 144, pp. 1732-1733.)  On the other hand, equitable offset is a means by which a debtor may satisfy in whole or in part a judgment or claim held against him out of a judgment or claim which he has subsequently acquired against his judgment creditor. The right exists independently of statute and rests upon the inherent power of the court to do justice to the parties before it. (See generally, <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 551 [47 Cal.Rptr. 473, 407 P.2d 649]; <em>Highsmith </em>v. <em>Lair </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 298 [281 P.2d 865]; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 646 [128 P.2d 9]; <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1898) 123 Cal. 157 [55 P. 786].)  As was stated by our Supreme Court in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Adams, supra: </em>\u201c[I]t is well settled that a court of equity will compel a set-off when mutual demands are held under such circumstances that one of them should be applied against the other and only the balance recovered. The insolvency of the party against whom the relief is sought affords sufficient ground for invoking this equitable principle. [Citations.]  And a judgment debtor who has, by assignment or otherwise, become the owner of a judgment or claim against his judgment creditor, may go into the court in which the judgment against him was rendered and have his judgment offset against the first judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 648-649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In <em>Highsmith </em>v. <em>Lair, supra, </em>relying upon <em>Harrison, </em>the court gave priority to a claim of equitable offset against a prior federal government tax lien and noted that \u201c[t]he rights acquired by the government as coowner of the debt never were greater than those which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>been acquired by an assignee of Lair.\u201d (44 Cal.2d at p. 303.) Thus, the rights acquired by a lien claimant are never greater than those of his judgment debtor.  As a general rule, the assignee of a chose in action stands in the shoes of his assignor, taking his rights and remedies subject to any right to offset or other defenses existing against the assignor prior to actual notice of the assignment. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1459; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The language of Code of Civil Procedure section 688.1 is consistent with this general approach. This section was enacted in 1941 at the same time that the Legislature amended section 688 of that code to prohibit a judgment creditor from levying execution upon his debtor\u2019s cause of action or judgment. Experience showed that substantially less than fair value was frequently realized upon such sales. (See <em>Lantin </em>v. <em>Biscailuz </em>(1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 422 [95 P.2d 962].) The Legislature obviously intended to end this harsh practice and to substitute a procedure whereby a judgment creditor could obtain a lien to the extent of his judgment \u201cupon all moneys recovered by his judgment debtor\u201d in the action or proceeding. The intent of the Legislature was to create in the judgment creditor, to the extent of his lien, rights coextensive with but not greater than those of his debtor. The \u201cmoneys recovered\u201d by a judgment debtor in an action are the sums due him after a full determination of the respective claims and offsets of the parties to that action. To hold otherwise would create in the judgment creditor a right greater than that of his debtor. Such a result would not comport with the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In <em>Margott </em>v. <em>Gem Properties, Inc. </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 849, 856 [111 Cal.Rptr. 1], the court refused to allow the right of offset to be defeated by an earlier contractual lien in favor of the respondent\u2019s attorney to secure his fee of 40 percent of all amounts received by respondent in the event of trial. The court said: \u201cSince the offset to which appellants were entitled on the record which is now before us results in respondent receiving essentially nothing, no contingent fee was due. Any lien of respondent\u2019s counsel to secure his fee thus secures nothing that is owed [citation], and is ineffective to defeat appellant\u2019s right of offset. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">We conclude that the offset of judgment against judgment is a matter of right absent the existence of some facts establishing an equitable principle precluding it. <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 646 at pp. 648-649; <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Berney </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 424, 434 [45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 467]; <em>Margott </em>v. <em>Gem Properties, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at p. 854.)  In the court below, Field raised the equitable defenses of laches and unclean hands. The findings in the underlying unlawful detainer action establish that in that proceeding appellants acted in a retaliatory and inequitable manner. As a consequence thereof, Bolt prevailed in that action and was awarded $8,000 attorneys\u2019 fees. However, the judgment which appellants seek to offset is a judgment in an unrelated matter which was obtained by default and which has become final. Neither inequitable conduct nor laches defeating the right of offset appears on the record before us. We hold, therefore, that it was error for the trial court to give priority to Field\u2019s lien and to deny appellants\u2019 right of offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied, and the judgment is reversed with directions to allow appellants to offset their judgment against Bolt\u2019s judgment with Field\u2019s lien reaching only the excess, if any, remaining thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Racanelli, P.
