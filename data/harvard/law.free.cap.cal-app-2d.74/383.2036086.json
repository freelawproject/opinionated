In one scene of the film, the young girl enters the community bathroom of the facility to take a shower. She is then shown taking off her clothes and stepping into the shower, where she bathes for a few moments. Suddenly, the water stops and a look of fear comes across her face. Four adolescent girls are standing across from her in the shower room. One of the girls is carrying a \u201cplumber\u2019s helper,\u201d waving it suggestively by her side. The four girls violently attack the younger girl, wrestling her to the floor. The young girl is shown naked from the waist up, struggling as the older girls force her legs apart. Then, the television film shows the girl with the plumber\u2019s helper making intense thrusting motions with the handle of the plunger until one of the four says, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d The young girl is left sobbing and naked on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">It is alleged that appellant, aged nine, was attacked by minors at a beach in San Francisco. It is alleged that the minors attacked appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and another minor girl, and forcibly and against her will, \u201cartificially raped\u201d appellant with a bottle. The complaint alleges that the assailants had seen the \u201cartificial rape\u201d scene in \u201cBorn Innocent\u201d and that the scene \u201ccaused them to decide to do a similar act to a minor girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">When the case came on for jury trial, respondents moved, before impanelment of a jury, that the court first determine for itself the \u201cconstitutional fact\u201d of \u201cincitement\u201d\u2014i.e., whether the film, \u201cBorn Innocent,\u201d was a vehicle for \u201cinciting\u201d violent and depraved conduct such as the crimes of the juveniles in the present case, of which appellant was the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The trial judge viewed the entire film, made a finding that it did not advocate or encourage violent and depraved acts and thus did not constitute an \u201cincitement,\u201d and rendered judgment for respondents without impaneling a jury. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Analysis of this appeal commences with recognition of the overriding constitutional principle that material communicated by the public media, including fictional material such as the television drama here at issue, is generally to be accorded protection under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. <em>(Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 495, 501 [96 L.Ed. 1098, 1105, 72 S.Ct. 777]; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 507, 510 [92 L.Ed. 840, 847, 68 S.Ct. 665].) In <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>at page 501 [96 L.Ed. at pp. 1105-1106], the court stated: \u201cIt cannot be doubted that motion pictures are a significant medium for the communication of ideas. They may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression. The importance of motion pictures as an organ of public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as to inform. As was said in <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948): \u2018The line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right [a free press]. Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man\u2019s amusement, teaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted; see also <em>Kingsley Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Regents </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 684, 690 [3 L.Ed.2d 1512, 1517, 79 S.Ct. 1362].) \u201cThere is no doubt that entertainment,- as well as news, enjoys First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>(Zacchini </em>v. <em>Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 562 [53 L.Ed.2d 965,97 S.Ct. 2849])  As the court stated in <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 29, 41 [29 L.Ed.2d 296, 310,</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>91 S.Ct. 1811]: \u201cThe guarantees for speech and press are not the preserve of political expression or comment upon public alfairs.\u2019 <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 388 (1967). \u2018Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.\u2019 <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 102(1940).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Specifically, television broadcasting is a medium which is entitled to First Amendment protection. (See <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>FCC </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 367, 386 [23 L.Ed.2d 371, 386-387, 89 S.Ct. 1794]; <em>Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. </em>v. <em>F.C.C. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1976) 423 F.Supp. 1064, 1147.) Thus, expression by means of television dramatization is included within the free speech and free press guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Where a television broadcast does not involve unprotected speech, the constitutional protection for free speech limits the state\u2019s power to award damages in a negligence action based upon the broadcast. (See <em>New York Tim\u00e9s Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 265, 277-278 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 697, 704-705, 84 S.Ct. 710, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not, of course, absolute. Certain narrowly limited classes of speech may be prevented or punished by the state consistent with the principles of the First Amendment. Speech which is obscene is not protected by the First Amendment. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(19.73) 413 U.S. 15, 23, 34-35 [37 L.Ed.2d 419, 430, 436-437, 93 S.Ct. 2607], rehg. den., 414 U.S. 881 [38 L.Ed.2d 128, 94 S.Ct. 26].) \u201cBom Innocent\u201d is not constitutionally obscene. \u201c[L]ibel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like\u201d are also outside the scope of constitutional protection. <em>(Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 36, 49, fn. 10 [6 L.Ed.2d 105, 116, 81 S.Ct. 997].) Generally, libel and slander are considered outside the scope of First Amendment protection because \u201cthere is no constitutional value in <em>false </em>statements of <em>fact.\u201d (Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 340 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 805, 94 S.Ct. 2997]; italics added.) However, the free speech guarantee even requires that some protection be given to falsehood, in certain circumstances, \u201cin order to protect speech that matters.\u201d <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 341 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 806].) The constitutional freedom for speech and press also does not immunize \u201cspeech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.\u201d <em>(Giboney </em>v. <em>Empire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Storage Co. </em>(1949) 336 U.S. 490, 498 [93 L.Ed. 834, 841, 69 S.Ct 684].) Additionally, speech which is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and which is likely to incite or produce such action, is also outside the scope of First Amendment protection. (See <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 444, 447-448 [23 L.Ed.2d 430, 433-434, 89 S.Ct. 1827].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The question whether the television film, \u201cBom Innocent,\u201d falls within any category of unprotected speech may, where the facts are not disputed, constitute a question of law. <em>(L.A. Teachers Union </em>v. <em>L.A. City Bd. of Ed. </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 551, 556 [78 Cal.Rptr. 723, 455 P.2d 827]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 26, 32 [106 Cal.Rptr. 862].)  In the present case, the film itself was available and the court might perhaps have determined from viewing it in connection with a motion for summary judgment, that the film did not advocate or encourage violent and depraved acts and thus, did not constitute an \u201cincitement.\u201d (See <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 49, 56 [37 L.Ed.2d 446, 456, 93 S.Ct. 2628], rehg. den., 414 U.S. 881 [38 L.Ed.2d 128, 94 S.Ct. 27]; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 153, 159-160, 161 [41 L.Ed.2d 642, 649-651, 94 S.Ct. 2750]; <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 568, 574 [86 L.Ed. 1031, 1036, 62 S.Ct. 766].) But a motion for summary judgment had earlier been denied by another judge. No such motion was pending when the trial judge rendered the decision now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Trial by jury had been demanded by appellant. That demand put into operation her right, under California Constitution, article I, section 7, to have all fact issues in the case determined by a juiy. The trial court\u2019s action in viewing the film, and thereupon making fact findings and rendering judgment for respondents, was a violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury. It was both reversible error and an act in excess of jurisdiction. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 73, p. 2908.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Here, it is appropriate to acknowledge that, if the cause had proceeded properly to trial before a jury and a verdict awarding damages to appellant had been the result, it would have been the responsibility of the trial court, or perhaps of this court on appeal, to determine upon a reevaluation of the evidence whether the jury\u2019s fact determination could be sustained against a First Amendment challenge to the jury\u2019s determination of a \u201c \u2018constitutional fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>403 U.S. 29, 54 [29 L.Ed.2d 296, 318].) But the case is not presently ripe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>for such a determination, appellant having been deprived of her constitutional right to present before a jury evidence which she contends will show that, despite First Amendment protections, the showing of the film, \u201cBorn Innocent,\u201d resulted in actionable injuries. (Cf. <em>Weirum </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 40 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to impanel a jury and proceed to trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Rattigan, Acting P. J., and Emerson, J.,* concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 23, 1977, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 19, 1978. Tobriner, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
