Wallace payable by the estate of her late husband: It raises the novel issue of the competency as evidence of affidavits or declarations in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>contested proceeding on a petition for family, allowance. The appeal also includes issues of the relevancy of length of marriage to the award of family allowance to a surviving widow and the propriety of an exercise of trial court discretion in making the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We conclude: (1) affidavits or declarations are not competent evidence in a contested proceeding concerning the award of a probate family allowance; (2) length of marriage is irrelevant to the right of a surviving widow to the allowance; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion. We reject as untimely a further contention first asserted by the appellant executor in his reply brief. Accordingly, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Prior to October 1969, Donald P. Wallace was employed by a corporation, Wallace Machinery Co., at a salary of $48,000 per year plus 10 percent of net profit. The contract provides for the payment of $1,000 per month to the surviving spouse of Wallace if he dies during the term of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Wallace died testate on October 9, 1969, leaving respondent, Barbara S. Wallace, as his surviving widow. On October 27, the Wallace will designating Michael H. Wallace executor was admitted to probate. An inventory and supplemental inventory of the estate disclose assets of approximately $320,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Barbara Wallace was paid the $1,000 per month from Wallace Machinery as required by the employment contract. On October 15, 1970, Michael Wallace, as executor, petitioned the probate court for an order authorizing payment of family allowance to Barbara. The petition recites that the estate is indebted to a bank in the amount of $20,000, is subject to the expense of administration, and will be liable for death taxes in an unascertained sum. It seeks authority to pay a family allowance retroactive to the date of death at the rate of $500 per month, a total sum of $5,000. The petition was granted and the sum paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">No further sum was paid from the estate to Barbara until January 1, 1972. Commencing on that date, the executor paid her $500 per month until September 1974, and then $700 per month through April 1976. No order of court authorized the payments. They ceased in May of 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>On September 21, 1976, Barbara filed a petition for family allowance commencing the matter at bench. The petition seeks the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">(1) $7,850 constituting the allowance at the $500 per month rate for the period from the end of September 1970, when the allowance was last paid per the previous court order, to January 1, 1972, when the executor resumed payments from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">(2) An award of family allowance at the rate of $800 per month from May 1, 1976.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The court received evidence that Barbara\u2019s income produced by her net worth of about $157,000, including $118,000 of proceeds of insurance on the life of the deceased, was approximately $9,900 per year and that her expenses were in excess of $24,000. Barbara, who had been employed after her husband\u2019s death but had been earning less than her financial needs in the years preceding the hearing, had terminated her employment because of a \u201cback problem.\u201d She plans part-time work.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The court sustained Barbara\u2019s objection to evidence offered by the executor to show that Barbara\u2019s marriage to the decedent had been of short duration. It refused to receive in evidence an affidavit of the executor which stated the executor\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe net residuary estate\u201d was approximately $ 110,000. The court also refused to consider in connection with Barbara\u2019s petition a first and final account and petition for its settlement and proration of federal estate tax filed by the executor on the day of hearing on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The probate court granted Barbara\u2019s petition except for the period May 1 to October 1, 1976. In this appeal by the executor from the order incorporating that ruling, the executor contends in his opening brief: (1) the probate court erred in refusing to accept the executor\u2019s affidavit in evidence and in barring testimony of the length of Barbara\u2019s marriage to the decedent; and (2) the court abused its discretion by awarding family allowance. In his closing brief, the executor for the first time raises the issue of the propriety of the probate court\u2019s failure to consider the first and final account in conjunction with the petition for family allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\n<em>Competency of Affidavit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The trial court properly barred the use of the executor\u2019s affidavit as evidence in the hearing on Barbara\u2019s petition for family allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Probate Code.section 1230 states: \u201cAll issues of fact joined in probate proceedings must be tried in conformity with the requirements of the rules of practice in civil actions.\u201d The requirements of practice in civil actions preclude testimony by affidavit except as provided by statute. (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The executor relies solely upon Code of Civil Procedure section 2009 which recognizes the competency of affidavits or declarations in lieu of oral testimony in a hearing on a motion. He reasons that because Code of Civil Procedure section 1003 defines an application for an order as a motion and an order as a direction of the court entered in writing but not included in a judgment, a petition for family allowance is a motion as defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Probate Code section 1233 precludes the executor\u2019s argument. That section incorporates into probate proceedings only \u201cthe provisions of Part 2 (commencing with Section 307) and of Article 3 (commencing with Section 2016) of Chapter 3 of Title 3 of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d Thus only the procedural provisions encompassed in Code of Civil Procedure sections 307 through 1062a and 2016 through 2036 are specifically applicable to proceedings in probate. While section 1003 defining motions is one of the incorporated provisions, section 2009 permitting evidence by affidavit or declaration to be received in hearings on a motion is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In sum, the Code of Civil Procedure\u2019s statutory authorization for use of affidavits or declarations cannot be applied to authorize the procedure in probate. In probate proceedings, the authorization is contained in Probate Code section 1233 itself. There affidavits or declarations are permitted only in uncontested proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The executor points to Probate Code section 1230 as standing for a contrary result. While that section does state the generality \u201cAll issues of fact joined in probate proceedings must be tried in conformity with the requirements of the rules of practice in civil actions,\u201d the generality must yield in the context of the issue in the case at bench to the specific provisions of Probate Code section 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\n<em>Relevancy of Length of Marriage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Claiming that a probate family allowance awarded a surviving widow is the functional equivalent of spousal support granted in a marital dissolution, the executor asserts trial court error in barring as irrelevant evidence offered by the executor to establish that Barbara\u2019s marriage to the decedent was of short duration. The executor notes that Civil Code section 4801, which specifies the criteria for determining spousal support in a marital dissolution, includes duration of the marriage as one of the elements to be considered. He adds citations to <em>Estate of Woodward </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 113, 116 [40 Cal.Rptr. 791, 12 A.L.R.3d 1134], and <em>Estate of Schumacher </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 146, 152 [95 Cal.Rptr. 572], each of which states that a family allowance is an extension of the decedent\u2019s obligation of support, and extrapolates to the proposition that, therefore, the duration of marriage is relevant to an award of family allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The executor\u2019s extrapolation fails. It ignores the fact that <em>Woodward </em>and <em>Schumacher </em>deal with family allowance in the context of those who may be legally entitled to it. Neither case deals with the purpose of family allowance. When that purpose is contrasted with that of spousal support, the analogy between the two forms of award fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The purpose of the family allowance is to continue, during settlement of the estate, the support of the surviving spouse (or eligible child) that he or she was receiving or was entitled to receive during the decedent\u2019s life. <em>(Estate of Brooks </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 748, 755 [171 P.2d 724]; <em>Estate of Secord </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 783, 786 [192 P.2d 81].) To that end, Probate Code section 680 speaks in terms of a family allowance of a \u201creasonable [amount] ... as shall be necessary for . . . maintenance according to [the] circumstances [of the recipient].\u201d The allowance must be denied by reason of reasonable maintenance derived from other sources only when other persons (such as surviving children) may also be entitled to their own allowance. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 682.) While the probate court pray consider a surviving spouse\u2019s income from his or her property in determining whether a family allowance is necessary, the allowance is deemed necessary despite the proposition that the survivor is able to invade capital to supply his or her need for support. <em>(Estate of Secord, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 783, 786; see also <em>Estate of Van Der Oef </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 155, 156 [27 Cal.Rptr. 855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>In contrast, the court in a marital dissolution seeks generally to split one primary income so that it will support two households. It is unrealistic in those circumstances to ignore the fact that generally the standard of living which supports each household will be diminished. For that reason, Civil Code section 4801 establishes the standards for the award of spousal support in a marital dissolution in terms of amounts which \u201cthe court may deem just and reasonable.\u201d The capital of the spouse seeking support may be considered (Civ. Code, \u00a7 4801, subd. (a)(2)) as well as capacity to engage in employment (Civ. Code, \u00a7 4801, subd. (a)(4)), factors irrelevant to the award of a family allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Thus Civil Code section 480l\u2019s requirement that duration of the marriage be considered in determining a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d award of spousal support is not transposable to Probate Code section 680\u2019s mandate that family allowance be awarded in such \u201creasonable [amount] . . . as shall be necessary for [the] maintenance [of the recipient] according to [his or her] circumstances____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Accordingly, the probate court properly barred as irrelevant the executor\u2019s offer to prove that the decedent\u2019s marriage to Barbara was a short one.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\n<em>Probate Court Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The executor\u2019s final contention in his appellant\u2019s opening brief asserts that the probate court\u2019s award of family allowance at all, or alternatively in the amount awarded, is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We consider that contention in the context that the probate court is vested with a broad area of discretion in determining the factual, need for and the amount of a family allowance, and that so long as it acts within that range its result must be supported on appeal. <em>(Estate of Loundagin </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 555, 558 [19 Cal.Rptr. 19].)  Here the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is supported by the $48,000-plus annual income payable to the decedent prior to death by his employment contract, evidence that Barbara needs approximately $24,000 per year for her support, and that her annual income is less than $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Executor argues for a contrary result. He asserts that the value of the estate is slightly over $100,000 rather than the $300,000 shown in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>inventory, a fact not supported by the record. He points to Barbara\u2019s separate estate of a net value of about $157,000, including $118,000 representing the proceeds of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life, a fact which is irrelevant because it is Barbara\u2019s income and not her capital that is significant. <em>(Estate of Barkdull </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 729, 731 [80 Cal.Rptr. 317].) He asserts a marriage of only one year and ten days, a fact both irrelevant and not supported by the record. He points to the further irrelevant proposition taken from an incorrect resolution of conflicts in the evidence that Barbara is able to work in a fashion by which she can support herself. Finally, the executor relies upon the seven year period the probate has been pending and the amounts received by Barbara as family allowance, \u201cvoluntary payments,\u201d and pursuant to the employment contract in prior years. The executor and not Barbara is in control of the estate and could long ago have petitioned for a final distribution terminating the probate. The amounts received by Barbara in the past were uniformly materially less than the $24,000 per year she requires for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>First and Final Account</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">For the first time in his closing brief, the executor asserts that the trial court erred in not considering the executor\u2019s first and final account filed on the day of the hearing on Barbara\u2019s petition for family allowance. The contention having been omitted from the opening brief is not entitled to consideration on appeal. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Public Works </em>v. <em>Garden Grove Farms </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 666, 670 [42 Cal.Rptr. 118].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The judgment (order) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Wood, P. J., and Hanson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 16, 1977, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 15, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The petition also seeks confirmation as family allowance of the payments rnade by the executor to Barbara in the period from January 1, 1972, through April 1976. That issue was withdrawn by stipulation and reserved for resolution in connection with the executor\u2019s accounting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
