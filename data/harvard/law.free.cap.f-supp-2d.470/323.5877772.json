INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">Michael Lonecke, Raymond Duffy, Anne Nelson, Robert S. Fash and Craig A. Harris, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals, filed consolidated actions alleging that the Citibuilder Cash Balance Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>In summary, plaintiffs lodge three challenges against the Plan. <em>First, </em>they challenge the legality of the Plan\u2019s accrual formula. <em>Second, </em>they assert that because Plan participants never received adequate notice of Plan amendments in 2000 and 2002, those amendments never took effect as a matter of law. <em>Third, </em>plaintiffs argue that the Plan unlawfully discriminates on the basis of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">Specifically, plaintiffs allege in Counts I and II, respectively, that the Plan is im-permissibly backloaded due to insufficient interest credits and that even if this back-loading is cured, the Plan will produce an illegal accrual phenomenon known as a \u201cwhipsaw.\u201d In Count III, plaintiffs allege that the Plan\u2019s \u201cfractional test\u201d method of computing accrued benefits is precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>under ERISA and, in the alternative, the test is being wrongfully applied. In Counts IV and V, plaintiffs allege that the Plan discriminates based on age. Count VI has been withdrawn. In Count VII, Plaintiffs allege that Citigroup Inc., and its Plans Administration Committee (\u201cdefendants\u201d) failed to provide Plan participants proper notice that the 2000 and 2002 cash balance amendments (\u201cCBAs\u201d) would reduce the rate of future benefit accrual.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On August 25, 2006, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, summary judgment for plaintiffs is granted in part and denied in part. Summary judgment for defendants is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">A. Cash Balance Plans</p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">Under a cash balance pension plan, an employer guarantees each participant a retirement benefit premised on a hypothetical account that has been established in each participant\u2019s name. These accounts grow over time according to a predetermined formula, driven by two components: (1) the employer\u2019s hypothetical \u201ccontributions,\u201d expressed either in dollars or a specified percentage of the participant\u2019s current yearly salary (making it a \u201ccareer average\u201d formula); and (2) hypothetical earnings expressed as interest credits, which can either increase at a fixed rate or be tied to an extrinsic index, such as 30-year Treasury bonds. Employer contributions and interest credits are usually allocated to the accounts annually. Each year participants receive a balance statement so they can review the value of their pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Since 1985, when cash balance plans were first introduced, they have become an increasingly popular way to structure retirement pensions. As of 2004, \u201cnearly one-third of Fortune 100 companies had adopted some form of cash balance plan, and a 2002 survey of firms with pension plans containing more than 1000 participants revealed that 10 percent of plans were cash balance plans.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proponents of cash balance plans maintain that from an employee\u2019s perspective, they are superior to traditional defined benefit plans because they are easier to understand and they allow benefits to accrue more evenly over the course of a career. They are also more portable than other defined benefit plans, thus allowing workers to change jobs without experiencing significant reductions in benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is also commonly accepted that cash balance plans are advantageous for employers in that: (1) they are cheaper and less administratively burdensome to maintain; (2) employers retain funding flexibility as long as plans remain solvent; (3) their simplicity fosters employees\u2019 appreciation for the value of their pensions; (4) they can significantly reduce future payouts overall, thereby boosting their earnings; and (5) employers reap the benefit of any investment experience on plan assets that exceeds the interest rate assumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">B. Citigroup\u2019s Cash Balance Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Both parties have agreed to all material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The named plaintiffs are present or former employees of either Smith Barney or Citibank, N.A., both of which are divisions of Citigroup Inc. (\u201cCitigroup\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They all accrued benefits under the Plan during all or part of the period since January 1, 2000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two named plaintiffs were vested participants at the time their employment terminated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">1. January 1, 2000 CBA</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In October 1998, Citicorp merged with Travelers Corporation (\u201cTravelers\u201d), and their respective pension plans also merged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Importantly, the provisions on plan amendments set forth in the Travelers Plan were incorporated into the Citibank Plan as of December 31, 1998. Pursuant to these provisions, authority to amend the Citibank Plan was vested with the plan sponsor, Citigroup, \u201cby action of its Board of Directors\u201d (\u201cBoard\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In a meeting on October 19, 1999, the Board exercised this authority by adopting a series of resolutions going to the heart of plaintiffs\u2019 case. Pertinent excerpts of the meeting minutes state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">an amendment to the Citigroup Inc. Pension Plan incorporating the cash balance design for certain subsidiaries of the Company, on substantially the terms as previously presented to the Board is hereby approved .... <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">Although the provisions of the amendment were not set forth in an executed Citibuilder Retirement Plan document until May 2001,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> plan participants did receive notification of the amendment in December 1999 \u2014 after the Board\u2019s vote and prior to the CBA\u2019s effective date, January 1, 2000. Notice was mailed to all effected employees by a letter dated December 9, 1999, from Tim Peach, Director of Retirement Benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Attached to the letter was a document entitled \u2014 -in large boldfaced letters \u2014 \u201cThe Citigroup Pension Plan Notice of Significant Reduction in Benefit Accruals for Certain Employees of Citigroup Inc. and its Subsidiaries\u201d (\u201cDecember 1999 \u00a7 204(h) notice\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This notice contained a general summary of how the cash balance formula would work, as well as a table listing the percentages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>salaries that would be credited to accounts annually, such percentages being based on an employee\u2019s age and years of service.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The notice did not include specifics or mention the Plan\u2019s application of the fractional test for compliance with statutory accrual principles. Readers with questions were directed to \u201c[pllease see the brochure titled <em>Your New Citigroup Benefits, </em>which [they] received earlier this year, for more details.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As noted above, the provisions of the newly adopted cash balance plan were not set forth in a written document until May 27, 2001.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plan Article 4.1 lays out the funding scheme giving rise to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">4.1 <em>Accounts</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(a) <em>General. </em>The Account of a Participant shall be the sum of the Interest Credits and Benefit Credits credited to the Account established for such Participant following his entry into this Plan in accordance with Article II.

The Benefit Credit shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the Participant\u2019s Compensation paid by an Employer during the Plan Year, as determined by the Participant\u2019s age and Years of Credited Service as of the end of such Plan Year in accordance with Table 4.1(b) below; provided,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">(1) [omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">(2) with regard to the Plan Year in which the Participant\u2019s employment with an Employer is terminated, (A) the Benefit Credit shall be determined by the Participant\u2019s age and Years of Credited Service as of the date of termination, (B) Compensation shall be recognized for this purpose only through such date of termination, and (C) such Benefit Credit shall be made as of the date of termination instead of the last day of such Plan Year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">(c) <em>Minimum Benefit Credit. </em>[T]he <em>minimum </em>Benefit Credit each Plan Year ... for any Participant who is a Full-Time Employee shall be $500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">(d) <em>Interest Credits. </em>The Account of a Participant shall be credited with an Interest Credit as of the last day of each of the Plan Years in the period beginning with the Plan Year next following the date on which a Benefit Credit is first made to a Participant\u2019s Account and ending with the Plan Year in which the Participant\u2019s Benefit Commencement Date occurs .... <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Article 4.1(e) establishes the fractional rule as the Plan\u2019s mechanism for complying with ERISA\u2019s minimum accrual standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">(e) <em>Minimum Account. </em>Notwithstanding the benefit described in \u00a7 4.1(a) above, if the Account at the date a Participant ceases to be eligible to earn Benefit Credits (\u201cDetermination Date\u201d) has accrued so that the accrual does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 411(b)(1) of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder, there shall be added to the Account the amount described in paragraph (4) below calculated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(1)The projected value (\u201cProjected Value\u201d) of a Participant\u2019s Account is calculated by projecting the Account at the Determination Date to the Participant\u2019s Normal Retirement date (using the <em>average </em>Compensation for the Participant, as determined in accordance with \u00a7 411(b)(1)(A) of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and the same rate used to calculate Interest Credit (\u201cInterest Rate\u201d) as in the year of the Determination Date) assuming for these purposes that the Participant continued to earn Benefits Credits through the Normal Retirement Date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">(2) Determine the minimum account (\u201cMinimum Account\u201d) by multiplying the Projected value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant\u2019s Years of Vesting Service and the denominator of which is the Years of Vesting Service plus the number of years and months from the Participant\u2019s Determination Date to the Participant\u2019s Normal Retirement Date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">(3) Calculate the excess, if any, of the Minimum Account, over the Account at Determination Date future valued to the Normal Retirement Age of the Participant using the Interest Rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">(4) Calculate the quotient of the amount determined in paragraph (3) above divided by a present value factor (equal to 1 plus the Interest Rate, the sum of which is raised to a power equal to the number of months divided by 12 from Determination Date to Normal Retirement Date).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">2. January 1, 2002 CBA</p>\n<p id=\"AzD\">The 2002 CBA incorporated the same cash balance regime adopted in 2000, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>recalibrated the range of benefit credits that would be allotted annually to employees\u2019 hypothetical accounts. It lowered the floor from 2% to 1.5% of compensation for participants under age twenty-nine in their first five years of credited service. It also lowered the ceiling from 7% to 6% of compensation for participants fifty-five years or older with fifteen or more years of credited service (\u201c2002-Present Benefit Credits\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The application of the fractional rule under Article 4.1(e) remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The first and only communication to Plan participants in 2001 of an amendment pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 204(h) was an information package dated December 2001.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although different versions of the packages were prepared, they all contained: (i) a cover letter dated December 5, 2001, from Tyrrell Erbes, Citigroup\u2019s Director of Retirement Benefits; (ii) a document entitled \u201cNotices to Interested Parties;\u201d and (iii) a document entitled \u201cCitigroup Pension Plan 204(h) Notice.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As with the December 1999 \u00a7 204(h) notice, there is no mention of the Plan\u2019s application of the fractional rule.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The named plaintiffs do not recall receiving these packages, nor do they recall being aware in December 2001 that the 2002 CBA \u201cmight substantially reduce benefit accruals for themselves or others.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">III. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">Summary judgment is appropriate if the record \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> An issue of fact is genuine if \u201cthe evidence is such that a jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A fact is material when it \u201c \u2018might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The movant has the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact that does \u201c \u2018not rely- on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> To do so, it must do more than show that there is \u201c \u2018metaphysical doubt as to the material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>facts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In determining whether a genuine issue <em>of </em>material fact exists, the court must construe -the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">B. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Although ERISA does not prescribe a statute of limitations for civil actions, where parties seek to recover higher benefits from a pension plan, the appropriate statute of limitations is six years\u2014the limitations period specified in the most analogous state statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has held that the six-year statute of limitations does not begin to run until \u201cthere has been a repudiation by the fiduciary which is <em>clear </em>and made known to the beneficiaries.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Typically, the statute of limitations period begins when a participant\u2019s formal application for benefits is denied.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In some circumstances, however, the time period may . begin earlier.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">C. ERISA\u2019s Minimum Accrual Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">Although cash balance plans mimic some of the same features of defined contribution plans, in this Circuit they are treated as defined benefit plans.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201cThe regulatory consequences of this [defined benefit plan] classification are wide-reaching.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> One critical consequence is that the term \u201caccrued benefit\u201d under a cash balance plan means \u201ca participant\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan ... <em>expressed in the form, of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement </em>age.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">Although ERISA does not require pension plans to pay out a specific dollar amount, it does regulate the rate at which benefits accrue.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> A paramount reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>this is to prevent \u201cbackloading,\u201d a term of art describing a plan\u2019s use of a benefit accrual formula that postpones the bulk of an employee\u2019s accrual to her later years of service. Given the time value of money, it is not surprising that plan sponsors are often tempted to backload pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">To combat backloading, ERISA requires plans to accrue benefits relatively evenly over the course of an employee\u2019s career.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> ERISA sets forth three alternative tests for monitoring accrual rates; in order to be lawful a plan must satisfy at least one of these formulas.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> These formulas are construed as \u201cminimum accrual standards\u201d to the extent that they tether plans to a controlled, steady baseline of benefit accrual.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The first alternative is the \u201c3 percent rule.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The second alternative, set forth in ERISA section 204(b)(1)(B), is known as the \u201c133 % percent rule\u201d and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 133% percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded [;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Thus the 133% percent rule prevents back-loading by constricting the fluctuation of accrual rates from year to year.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The third alternative, set forth in ERISA section 204(b)(1)(C), is called the \u201cfractional rule\u201d because it prorates the projected normal retirement benefit over the years of plan participation.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> A plan satisfies the fractional rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI5v\">if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date on which any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgL\">In simpler terms, under the fractional rule, in any given year, benefit accrual is \u201cbased upon the assumption that the participant will continue, until normal retirement age, to earn the same rate of compensation that would have been taken into account under the plan had the employee retired in that year.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">D.

The Plan\u2019s Accrual Formula (Counts I, II, III)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">1. Application of the Fractional Rule and Impermissible Backloading</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Plan\u2019s cash balance formula misapplies the fractional rule in a way that not only fails to guard against backload-ing \u2014 it <em>enables </em>backloading. The Plan\u2019s use of the fractional rule violates section 204(b)(1) because as a career average plan, the only applicable accrual test is the 133]\u00e9 rule.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> By its very terms, the fractional rule may only be applied to participants with ten or fewer years of service.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the Citigroup cash balance formula does not violate this limitation because \u201cfor purpose of applying the fractional test, average compensation is calculated based only on the last ten\u201d years of an employee\u2019s service.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Under Plan Article 4.1(e), if this calculation reveals that an individual\u2019s hypothetical account balance is less than the minimum amount required by section 204(b)(1)(C) of ERISA, Citigroup credits the participant the difference.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Defendants assert that this supplementary contribution brings accrued pensions into compliance with the minimum benefit required by the fractional rule.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> However, this lump-sum contribution, made on the eve of the benefit payout, is inadequate precisely because it permits the backloading that the fractional rule was designed to prevent.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">The Plan\u2019s unorthodox application of the fractional test only upon a participant\u2019s separation from service, rather than on a year-by-year basis, ignores the statutory scheme requiring pension plans to <em>be able </em>to test compliance with accrual rules \u201cin any given year,\u201d or even any given moment.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The Citigroup formula also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>travenes the well-acknowledged purpose of the mandatory accrual tests, which is to prevent the backloading of benefits.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> In applying the fractional rule only once, at the end of an employee\u2019s Plan participation, Article 4.1(e) strips the rule of its functionality because it can no longer \u201cregulate the rate at which benefits may accrue.\u201d <footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Without its consistent application, the fractional test is powerless to \u201cprevent [the Plan] from designing accrual schedules that circumvent the vesting rules by providing that the great preponderance of benefits accrues only in the last years of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> If such applications of the fractional rule were permissible, plans would be free to adopt formulas providing a mere pittance of benefit accrual over, say, the first twenty years of employment, and thereafter have benefits accrue rapidly by tacking on an additional amount, much like the Citigroup Plan does.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">To the Court\u2019s dismay, plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of Article 4.1(e) as a novel end-run around ERISA\u2019s minimum accrual standards is accurate.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Defendants downplay their gutting of the fractional rule as a harmless modification that is permissible because it is not expressly prohibited by statutory text.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> More accurately, it is a bold and exploitative contortion of the rule. While defendants \u201cdo[] not (and cannot) dispute\u201d that they are bound to comply with ERISA\u2019s accrual rules, they have nonetheless \u201cresist[ed] \u2014 and ha[ve] tried to draft around' \u2014 [their] consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The Court takes Congress\u2019 efforts to prevent the backloading of pension benefits quite seriously. The Plan\u2019s accrual formula is unlawfully structured to allow for impermissible backloading. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted in plaintiffs\u2019 favor on Counts I and III.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">2. Reformation of the Plan to Comply with the 133% Percent Rule and Avert Whipsaw</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Having found Article 4.1(e)\u2019s use of the fractional rule impermissible, I turn to the Plan\u2019s mandatory compliance with the 133% percent rule. Defendants have stipulated that since January 1, 2002, the accrual formula has not satisfied the 133 j\u00e9 percent rule.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In arguing for a reformation of the Plan, plaintiffs request the imposition of an interest credit floor that will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>compensate for the backloaded pay credits while averting whipsaw.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The Court declines to direct defendants to adopt plaintiffs\u2019 reformation proposals, but hereby orders defendants to reform the Plan consistent with the requirements of ERISA, retroactive to January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">C. Adequate \u00a7 204(h) Notice (Count VII)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Both the December 1999 \u00a7 204(h) and December 2000 \u00a7 204(h) notices omitted any mention of the benefit formula\u2019s unorthodox approach to calculating benefits and monitoring accrual rates. Because it was ultimately revealed that the formula included an unlawful application of the fractional rule, which had the effect of keeping accrual rates below the minimum rate prescribed by statute, defendants\u2019 failure to either include or summarize Article 4.1(e) in the notices violated \u00a7 204(h).<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Adequate notice is critical to ensure the \u201cmeeting of expectations in the context of ERISA.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Plaintiffs had every reason to expect that under the new cash balance plan, their pensions would continue to accrue at a rate approved by Congress. It therefore is immaterial that the December 1999 \u00a7 204(h) notice stated in bolded font that the 2000 CBA could result in a reduction of their benefits. Given the material omissions, it remained \u201cinsufficiently \u2018accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise [Plan] participants and beneficiaries of their rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Nor can it be said that the notices \u201callow[ed] applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment\u201d because plaintiffs were without fair warning that the formula endangered their right to a minimum rate of benefit accrual.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Defendants submit that the notice claims should be dismissed for plaintiffs\u2019 failure to show that they suffered any prejudice as a result of the allegedly deficient \u00a7 204(h) notices, as required by <em>From-mert.</em><footnotemark><em>92</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Defendants argue that the \u201conly consequence\u201d here was plaintiffs\u2019 failure to commence this litigation sooner, which \u201chardly constitutes prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing for two reasons. <em>First, </em>in <em>Frommert, </em>the prejudice issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>arose in the context of tardy notice, not substantively inadequate notice.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Here, because both the December 1999 and December 2000 \u00a7 204(h) notices failed to mention the formula\u2019s fractional rule application, which kept accrual rates below the statutory minimum, the amendments never took legal effect. <em>Second, </em>in <em>Frommert, </em>the Second Circuit explicitly <em>rejected </em>the notion that beneficiaries must demonstrate the type of prejudice urged by defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1-\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 arguments and the district court\u2019s conclusion, the fact that the plaintiffs remained at Xerox\u2019s employ does not demonstrate that they suffered no prejudice through the purported adoption [of the challenged amendment]. ...

Morgan.</em><footnotemark><em>100</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">I. ERISA Age-Based Accrual Provisions Are Applicable Before Normal Retirement Age</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Although neither party raised it here, courts are divided on the threshold issue of whether ERISA\u2019s age-based accrual provisions apply to all workers, including those younger than sixty-five.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ERISA section 204(b)(1)(H)(i) prohibits the reduction of an employee\u2019s benefit accrual \u201cbecause of the attainment of <em>any </em>age.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Despite this broad terminology, some courts have held that the provision does not apply to individuals before they reach normal retirement age.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> However, because the statutory language \u201cany age\u201d is unambiguous, I respectfully disagree with those courts.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has directed, \u201c[t]he preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> By its own terms, the ERISA age provision protects individuals of all ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. Definition of \u201cRate of Benefit Accrual\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The crux of the age discrimination issue is the definition of the \u201crate of an employee\u2019s benefit accrual\u201d as it is used in section 204(b)(l)(H)(i) of ERISA. If the phrase refers to an employee\u2019s retirement benefit (output), as plaintiffs contend, then cash balance plans are discriminatory because they afford younger employees higher rates of benefit accrual than their similarly situated older counterparts.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> However, if the phrase refers to the employer\u2019s annual contributions to the hypothetical accounts (inputs), then there is no discrimination.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that the relevant \u201cbenefit\u201d is the overall benefit an employee receives upon retirement <em>(i.e., </em>the annuity at normal retirement age). Under this interpretation, in order to avoid age discrimination, the rate at which a participant accumulates her retirement benefit cannot decrease as she ages. Defendants, however, contend that \u201cthe presence or absence of age discrimination should be measured based on the change in participant\u2019s cash balance account from year to year, rather than the total value of the annual contributions to the account at retirement age.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Under this view, using annual allocations of interest and pay credits as the relevant paradigm, as long as the employer makes ever-increasing contributions to accounts, there is no ERISA violation.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Under defendants\u2019 reading, the methodology used to detect age discrimination in a cash balance plan \u2014 which is a defined benefit plan \u2014 \u25a0 becomes, for all intents and purposes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>same as that which is prescribed for defined contribution plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">I decline defendants\u2019 invitation to \u201cseiz[e] on the obvious similarities\u201d between the parallel anti-discrimination provisions governing defined contribution and defined benefit plans.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Although other courts, including the Seventh Circuit,<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> have treated cash balance plans as defined contribution plans for this purpose, doing so would ignore the plain language of the statute as well as the critical distinctions between the types of plans outlined by the Second Circuit in Esden,<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Defendants ally themselves with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s position, which is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">[i]nterest is not treated as age discrimination for a defined-contribution plan, and the fact that [the respective] subsections are so close in both function and expression implies that it should not be treated as discriminatory for a defined-benefit plan either. The phrase \u201cbenefit accrual\u201d reads most naturally as a reference to what the employer puts in (either in absolute terms or as a rate of change), while the defined phrase \u201caccrued benefit\u201d refers to outputs after compounding.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Underlying this interpretation is a presumption that Congress wrote \u201crate of benefit accrual\u201d in one provision and \u201callocations to employee\u2019s account\u201d in the other, but intended those phrases to say the same thing. Rules of construction preclude me from adopting this view. The simple</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">fact is that \u2018accrual,\u2019 using its dictionary meaning and in line with the structure of defined benefit plans, refers to what the employee accumulates [ ], whereas \u2018allocation,\u2019 using its dictionary definition and in line with the structure of defined contribution plans, refers to what an employer puts into the account.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">As the Second Circuit has instructed, \u201c[w]hen Congress uses particular language in one section of a statute and different language in another, we presume its word choice was intentional.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> If Congress had intended for \u201cthe rate of an employee\u2019s benefit accrual\u201d to mean \u201cthe rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee\u2019s account,\u201d it would have copied those terms from the analogous provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">The other persuasive argument favoring plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statute is ERISA\u2019s binary regulatory framework for defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. This duality exists because defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans make categorically different promises to employees.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> As a result, the respective anti-discrimination provisions prescribe distinct metrics for detecting discrimination. Specifically, because employees with defined contribution plans are guaranteed employer contributions to retirement accounts but are not guaranteed a retirement benefit, discrimination is better discerned by looking at \u201cthe rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee\u2019s account.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> By contrast, because employees with defined benefit plans are guaranteed a retirement benefit (\u201cout<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>put\u201d), the sheer <em>\u201cimport </em>of the statutory language\u201d connotes that \u201c \u2018rate of benefit accrual\u2019 refers to the outputs from the Plan.\u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A binary regulatory approach was also required because by their very nature, \u201c \u2018[projections\u2019 and \u2018guesswork\u2019 are at the heart of defined benefit plans.\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> Effective regulation of such plans necessarily involves monitoring the future value of the overall pension benefit that will be payable at normal retirement age. This focus on the value of accrued benefits is apparent throughout the statutory scheme. For example, for purposes of testing compliance with ERISA\u2019s three accrual rules, the rate at which participants earn their accrued benefit is examined. Similarly, \u201cthe rules governing distributions from defined benefit plans are framed in terms of the normal retirement benefit,\u201d which explains why distributions in optional forms, such as lump-sum payments, are required to be equal or greater than the actuarial equivalent of such benefit.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Nevertheless, defendants insist that the proper test for age discrimination concerns the <em>present value </em>of the hypothetical accounts, rather than their value at the normal retirement age. If Congress wanted to divorce ERISA\u2019s age-based accrual standards from its otherwise consistent approach toward regulating defined benefit plans it could have done so by either using explicit language to that effect or using a single provision to apply to both types of plans. Congress did just this elsewhere in the statutory regime, \u201cunsurprisingly\u201d using one provision where they intended one standard to apply to both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Defendants also urge this Court to find that a \u201cmere correlation\u201d exists between reduced rates of accrual and older age, because any reduction in rates of benefit accrual is really a function of the time value of money. While this is a fair statement, it is inaccurate to the extent it assumes that the time value of money and age are mutually exclusive.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Under a cash balance plan, employees never receive the amount in their hypothetical accounts as their retirement benefit. Instead, the cash balance in the account must be converted to the age 65 annuity.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>this actuarial conversion requires knowing an individual\u2019s age, cash balance plans are not age neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The short of it is that because of this conversion to an age 65 annuity, younger workers are credited with more years to accumulate interest on their hypothetical accounts.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Therefore, as a matter of plain arithmetic, a greater value is added to a younger employee\u2019s account than to an older employee\u2019s account. In other words, \u201cfor similarly situated workers (same salary and work history), the older worker, by definition, will receive a smaller retirement benefit simply because he is older, and thus closer to age 65.\u201d <footnotemark>125</footnotemark> This problem is exacerbated further by the phenomenon of compound interest: as the same interest rate is applied to participants\u2019 ever-increasing principal balances, the rate at which older workers accrue benefits is slower than that of younger workers. In this light, the rate of contributions to an individual\u2019s account is dependent on age.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defendants proffer several policy arguments that weigh against measuring the rate of benefit accrual as an annuity beginning at normal retirement age.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> For instance, they argue that such a finding will \u201cdiscourage employers from guaranteeing a level growth in the value of a pension over time,\u201d resulting in the widespread adoption of defined contribution plans, and also preclude plans like this one from using a variable interest credit rate.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> While these practical considerations may have merit, the language of section 204(b)(1)(H), this Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Es-den, </em>and the construction of ERISA itself compel the conclusion that such plans are age-discriminatory.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">This \u201cdispute is not over what a \u2018better\u2019 regulatory regime, more accommodating to the design objectives of cash balance plans might look like.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> <em>Esden </em>fully acknowledged that \u201cthe governing statutes [including ERISA] and regulations were developed with traditional final-pay defined benefit plans in mind\u201d and that \u201cthey do not always fit in a clear fashion with cash balance plans and they sometimes require outcomes that are in tension with the objectives of those plans.\u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I must adhere to <em>Esden\u2019s </em>classification of cash balance plans as defined benefit plans.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">For the reasons discussed above, summary judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor is granted on Count I for impermissible backload-ing, Count III for violations of ERISA\u2019s minimum accrual tests, Count V for age discrimination, and Count VII for failing to meet statutory notice requirements. Summary judgment for plaintiffs on Count II, alleging whipsaw, is denied without prejudice. Summary judgment for defendants is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendants are ordered to reform the Plan to comply with ERISA. Other appropriate remedies have yet to be determined, in relation to the several claims for relief alleged in the Amended Complaint filed September 21, 2005. The parties, by their respective counsel, shall make written submissions by January 16, 2007, addressing the issue of a remedy not inconsistent with the rulings contained in this Opinion, and shall appear for a conference on January 2, 2007, at 4:30 p.m. The Clerk of Court is directed to close these motions [Nos. 31, 36 and 43 on the Docket Sheet].</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">.

Langbein explains this with a simple hypothetical: \u201cConsider what might happen if the statute prescribed vesting but did not regulate accrual rates. A plan could be designed that would vest employees in 100 percent of accrued benefits after five years, thereby complying fully with ERISA\u2019s five-year cliff vesting schedule; yet the formula for accruing benefits under the plan could provide that employees accrue no benefits (or very skimpy benefits) over, say, the first twenty years of employment. Thereafter benefits would accrue very rapidly. Under such a plan, an employee would be 100 percent vested after the fifth year in a pension plan with a benefit of nothing ...
