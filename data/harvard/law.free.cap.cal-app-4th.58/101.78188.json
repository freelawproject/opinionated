Casenas appeals from a summary judgwa). She contends there were triable issues of fact whether, after she complained about sexual harassment, her employer unlawfully retaliated against her, making her working conditions so intolerable as to constitute wrongful constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">We affirm, finding the trial court properly put an end to the case. We publish our opinion because Fujisawa\u2019s conduct is a textbook example of how to respond appropriately to an employee\u2019s harassment complaint. We do not know what more the employer could have done to accommodate Casenas, short of ceding its managerial prerogative to her. As we will explain, Casenas was not entitled to present her case to a fact finder: As a matter of law, no reasonable employee in her position would have found the working conditions so egregious as to compel resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">The following facts are based largely on the court\u2019s statement of materially uncontradicted evidence leading it to grant Fujisawa a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Fujisawa is engaged in the pharmaceutical products industry. Casenas began her employment as a professional sales representative (PSR) on February 3, 1986, in Philadelphia. At her request, she was transferred to Southern California at the end of 1987. Her district manager was Jeff Brown until early 1989, when he was transferred to another district and replaced by Casey Bemson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown and Bemson reported to Dennis Ison, regional sales director.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Under Fujisawa\u2019s evaluation system, PSR\u2019s are initially appraised by their district manager. A draft appraisal goes to the regional sales director who reviews it in comparison to the sales performances of all PSR\u2019s in the region. The appraisal is then sent to the national sales manager for review, revision and approval, to ensure application of uniform standards nationwide. The personnel department does the final review. PSR\u2019s are given an overall rating of \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201chighly commendable,\u201d \u201ccommendable\u201d or \u201cimprovement needed\u201d based on specific performance criteria in numerous areas. Merit salary increases tied to the performance evaluation range from 0 to 10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Casenas did very well at Fujisawa, earning many bonuses and much praise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the February 1988 appraisal of her previous year\u2019s performance in Philadelphia, she received a \u201chighly commendable\u201d rating and an 8 percent merit increase. In the March 1989 appraisal of work she performed during 1988, Casenas was again rated \u201chighly commendable\u201d and given a 7 percent increase.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The latter appraisal was determined prior to March 7, 1989, by Brown, Ison and Rick Lamb, then Fujisawa\u2019s national sales manager, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>reviewed by Barbara Sheiman, the company\u2019s personnel manager at the time. The sales statistics revealed Casenas achieved 105 percent of her sales goal for 1988, ranking her at about the 55th to 60th percentile among PSR\u2019s\u2014her territory was number 60 out of 131. Her district finished 13th out of 14 districts nationally. Casenas received a promotion to senior sales representative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Casenas was, however, unhappy with her 1989 appraisal. On March 18, she sent a memo to Sheiman, listing some specific accomplishments which had not been mentioned, objecting to the employer\u2019s choice of words in minor criticisms, noting the overall excellence of her services, and complaining about her salary increase which, at 1 percent less than the prior raise, she believed falsely implied her 1988 performance was inferior to that of 1987. On a positive note, she expressed her appreciation for Bemson; she believed him far more capable than Brown of managing the district. She \u201clook[ed] forward to working under [Bemson\u2019s] strong leadership and guidance.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Ison responded to the memo. After reviewing the appraisal, he wrote to Casenas on April 7, agreeing some of the suggested changes should be made. He told Casenas he was instructing Brown to \u201cupgrade\u201d the rating in one performance area and prepare an appraisal addendum stating the approved modifications. However, Ison noted, \u201cI have recalculated the performance rating and this change does not alter the overall rating of highly commendable or the merit increase of 7 percent. This already acknowledges a fine performance by you this past year.\u201d Ison further stated he had found \u201cseveral inaccuracies\u201d in Casenas\u2019s memo and asked her to schedule a meeting with him to discuss the issues face-to-face.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Casenas replied with an April 21 letter, demanding Ison \u201cspecify ... in writing\u201d what he meant by inaccuracies in her previous memo. Four days later, she sent Sheiman another memo (with a copy to Ison), again objecting to the appraisal, criticizing Brown on a broad range of management issues and, for the first time, accusing him of sexual harassment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She concluded, \u201cJeff Brown\u2019s continued critical and condescending comments during work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>contacts, his derogatory remarks, his total lack of support and encouragement along with his attempt to discredit my character and reputation are reprehensible, demotivating, and demoralizing. [\u2018JQ I feel that my rejection of his sexual advances and my obvious disgust to his sexual harassment was the reason for the unfair performance review evaluation he gave me and his unfair treatment and criticisms of my performance. [&lt;J0 . . . [D I am . . . asking [Fujisawa] to take formal action so . . . this activity is not permitted to continue. I have also notified the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the sexual harassment to ensure that matters are appropriately investigated. [^ After reviewing this document, please contact me so . . . we can mutually discuss what corrective measures are going to be taken to ensure that this activity ceases and I am permitted to work in an environment free of harassment and intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On April 28, Sheiman, unable to reach Casenas by telephone, left a message on her answering machine. Casenas returned the call on April 30, advising Sheiman her earliest available date to discuss the sexual harassment allegations would be May 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Sheiman and Casenas met as planned. The very next day, investigating the matter, Sheiman and Ison questioned Brown in detail about each incident mentioned in Casenas\u2019s April 25 memo. Over the next week, they also interviewed each of the PSR\u2019s who reported to Brown, as well as a former PSR, recently resigned, and a management level person from a related corporate enterprise. In the meantime, Casenas\u2019s appraisal was again reviewed by Ison, Lamb and Sheiman; Quincy Williams, Fujisawa\u2019s president, also looked at it. Based on company statistical data, the executives concluded the appraisal was accurate and adequate; Casenas\u2019s performance confirmed her place at about the middle of Fujisawa\u2019s sales force, justifying a general rating of \u201chighly commendable,\u201d but not \u201coutstanding.\u201d They further found Casenas\u2019s 7 percent increase, at the very top of the merit increases recommended by Brown, did not indicate retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On June 9, Bemson and Ison flew from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles for a face-to-face meeting with Casenas. When she declined to discuss her concerns, they did not press her. They gave her a June 7 letter written to her by Sheiman, summarizing the investigation findings and advising Casenas of the actions taken regarding Brown. Inter alia, the letter states, \u201cMr. Brown will receive a written reprimand and warning specifying his errors and warning that any repetition may be grounds for severe discipline, including termination. This written warning will be placed in Mr. Brown\u2019s personnel file. In addition, Mr. Brown will be instructed that he is to initiate no communications or contact with you, other than that which may be occasioned incidentally as a result of joint events involving your district and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>district. He also will be instructed that in the future he is to initiate no contact with your supervisors concerning you, your job performance, or any evaluation of your job performance.\u201d Sheiman added, \u201cI want to assure you again that our company takes its policy on sexual harassment of employees very seriously. We very much appreciate your coming forward with your concerns in that regard and encourage you to do so in the future.\u201d She urged Casenas to contact her if she had any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On June 12, Ison wrote a formal reprimand to Brown, which he and Lamb personally delivered. The document detailed the findings as to Casenas\u2019s allegations, stating, inter alia, \u201cWhile we did not find evidence that you made overt sexual advances to Ms. Casenas, it is apparent that you exhibited extremely poor judgment in some of your actions and in statements made to Ms. Casenas and to others in your district. Intentional harassment is not necessary for sexual harassment to have occurred; the emphasis lies in how your actions or statements are viewed by those with whom you work. Ms. Casenas and other employees found some of your statements and conduct inappropriate and offensive as did Barbara Sheiman and I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Ison\u2019s letter further advised Brown of several conclusions reached: His persistent statements about penile implants were offensive to female representatives and not necessary to the sales promotion he was advocating; his discussions with Casenas and others about X-rated movies and sexual arousal, his comments about sexual anatomy and function to female employees, and his sexually oriented humor were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and reflected \u201cextremely poor judgment\u201d on his part. Brown was cautioned, \u201cAny recurrence of [such] conduct. . . will be grounds for severe discipline, including termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Further, Brown was warned that regardless of his intentions in suggesting Casenas should wear shorts in Palm Springs (hot weather) or in taking her by the hand (to keep her from losing her balance), he \u201cshould understand that as a matter of company policy, no manager should urge any other employee to wear more provocative dress. Nor should any manager physically touch or handle another employee in a manner which could be considered sexually provocative.\u201d Ison once again reminded Brown, \u201cViolation of these policies will result in severe discipline, including termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Finally, the reprimand directed Brown not to talk about Casenas, her job status or the situation with anyone except designated management personnel, and to refrain from \u201cinitiating any contact whatsoever\u201d with Casenas. Ison concluded with a warning which left no room for misinterpretation: \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>short, avoid [Casenas]. Violation of these directives will be grounds for immediate termination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Casenas remained unhappy. On June 14, she wrote to Ison, advising him she was \u201cupset and disappointed by [his] decision to support Jeff Brown\u2019s evaluation of [her] performance . . . as a seven . . . percent.\u201d She reminded Ison she had surpassed her goal and was first in her region in percent of sales goal achievement. She again stated her belief Brown had used the appraisal to \u201cpunish [her] in retaliation for [her] rejection of his sexual advances and sexual harassment.\u201d She asked Ison to \u201cre-assess [the] appraisal of seven percent and further amend [the] performance evaluation to reflect an outstanding ten percent merit increase.\u201d She again demanded a written response from Ison.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Ison wrote back on June 26, repeating his willingness to meet with Casenas and reminding her of his \u201cmanagement practice and that of [Fujisawa] to discuss [such] matters . . . on a face-to-face basis, so as to allow full discussion of the issues and . . . avoid misunderstandings of emphasis or meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Casenas responded to Ison on July 13, this time with four items on her agenda. She first argued that from a business perspective, face-to-face meetings are ill-advised. She said, \u201cSound management practices appreciate the importance of clarifying issues through clear and concise memos. Once there is the appropriate clarification in writing, a meeting to further discuss these issues would be important.\u201d She next expressed her \u201canger and frustration over not being considered as a candidate for the district manager position in Los Angeles.\u201d She charged Brown with having failed to give her the chance to interview for the position on one occasion in the past, \u201creflective of [his] attempt to punish [her] for [her] rejection of his sexual overtures.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She then stated her \u201cconcern and frustration\u201d about Ison\u2019s failure to upgrade her performance appraisal as requested in her prior correspondence. Finally, she told Ison of her \u201creluctance to attend\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>upcoming training meeting in Los Angeles because Brown would be participating and might use the opportunity to \u201cintimidate and/or further harass\u201d her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In a written response on July 20, Ison advised Casenas, \u201cOut of sensitivity to your feelings and because this upcoming training meeting follows so closely upon the completion of the company\u2019s investigation of your complaints of discrimination against Mr. Brown, I will authorize on a one time basis your attending the training portion ... at another location and at Company expense.\u201d He said Bemson would contact Casenas to make arrangements for her to attend a training session in Chicago. As for Casenas\u2019s continuing refusal to discuss other issues in person despite his repeated requests, Ison finally insisted, saying, \u201cNow is the time to have this meeting. [Bemson] will call you to arrange a meeting among the three of us immediately after the adjournment of his pre-training [session] on July 26 at 4:30 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Casenas spoke with Bemson on July 25 and agreed to meet with him and Ison at the appointed time. She prepared a list of six items she wished to discuss: (1) the \u201cseveral inaccuracies\u201d to which Ison had previously alluded; (2) her appraisal; (3) her having been passed over for a district manager position; (4) the \u201cone-time\u201d limitation on arrangements for her attendance at meetings in a location separate from Brown; (5) Ison\u2019s July 20 letter in general; and (6) her current performance status.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">At the July 26 meeting, Ison, Bemson and Casenas spent more than five hours going over every item on Casenas\u2019s agenda. The only subjects discussed were concerns which Casenas had raised earlier or brought up at the time. Casenas took voluminous notes, indicating, inter alia, Ison\u2019s and Bemson\u2019s expressions of support for her goal of becoming a sales manager. At the conclusion of the meeting, Casenas left the room, apparently without any interference by Ison or Bemson.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">There were no further communications until August 10, when Casenas sent Ison a letter, stating she was \u201cinvoluntarily] resigning\u201d from Fujisawa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>as of August 15. She acknowledged Ison and Bemson had no complaints about her highly commendable performance, yet it had become apparent to her she \u201cno longer [had] a career with advancement opportunity.\u201d She added, \u201cIt is obvious that I will never be made a manager and that my career is essentially over no matter how hard I work. As this comes so close to my complaint about Jeff Brown\u2019s sexual harassment, I believe this is a retaliatory action against me for going to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Ison responded on August 15, saying he and Bemson were both \u201cextremely sorry to hear\u201d of Casenas\u2019s decision. The letter stated, inter alia, \u201cWe want to assure you that in no way do we wish for you to leave the company and [we] are disappointed that you have decided to take this step.\u201d Ison emphasized his belief the company had done everything that could be done to \u201cinsulate\u201d Casenas from \u201cevery conceivable impact [her] previous manager . . . could possibly have upon [her] and [her] career at [Fujisawa].\u201d He noted the lengths to which the company had gone, such as Bemson excusing himself from a general district luncheon to personally escort Casenas \u201cto a separate dining area,\u201d where he lunched with her \u201cso that [she] would not encounter [Brown].\u201d He reminded Casenas he had agreed to consider all future situations on a case-by-case basis, for as long as necessary, out of sensitivity to Casenas\u2019s discomfort at being in Brown\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In regard to Casenas not having been considered for a district manager position, he referred to Casenas\u2019s oft-stated written and oral career goal along a different path\u2014of becoming \u201ca Senior and then an Executive Sales Representative, short term, and to have a Speciality Sales Assignment, long term.\u201d Because of that goal, he explained, Casenas \u201cwould not have been reviewed in the committee\u2019s review of potential candidates for management.\u201d Ison reminded Casenas that at the five-hour meeting, when Bemson learned of Casenas\u2019s desire to be a district sales manager, \u201che committed himself to do everything in his power to support [her] towards [that] goal.\u201d Additionally, Bemson had told Casenas \u201che would rely upon [her] to provide leadership in his district and to concentrate upon achieving a high level of performance .... actions necessary for developing and demonstrating management potential.\u201d Bemson also assured Casenas he would give her \u201copportunity for growth and promotion.\u201d Ison recalled that at the end of the meeting, Casenas\u2019s parting statement was she would give Bemson her best effort. Finally, reminding Casenas she had a manager committed to her development, Ison told her she was mistaken in believing she had no opportunity for advancement at Fujisawa.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The correspondence ended. After filing her administrative agency claim against Fujisawa, Casenas initiated the underlying suit for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The following allegations are the basis for Casenas\u2019s constructive discharge claim: \u201cCommencing after the filing of a sexual harassment charge against. . . Brown with defendant and later [June 1989] with [the] governmental agency and continuing through August 15, 1989, . . . Fujisawa by its managerial agents . . . Ison and . . . Bemson, engaged in a course of conduct that was intended to cause intolerable working conditions such that a reasonable person in plaintiff\u2019s position would be compelled to resign. Specifically said agents engaged in the following acts: [^ (a) Refusing to change an unfair performance appraisal made by . . . Brown in retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s rejection of his sexual advances. [!] (b) Retaliating against plaintiff for filing a sexual harassment charge against. . . Brown by refusing to consider plaintiff for managerial advancement positions and failing to notify [her] of [an] upcoming managerial qualifying examination. [U (c) Requiring plaintiff to meet at a hotel alone with two male supervisors for over five hours for a night time purported \u2018meeting\u2019 to discuss plaintiff\u2019s charges of retaliation which \u2018meeting\u2019 only ended when plaintiff walked out. [&lt;Jj] (d) Making derogatory remarks regarding plaintiff to plaintiff\u2019s co-employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> [U (e) Supervisors refused to discuss with plaintiff what she needed to do to qualify for managerial positions or to review plaintiff\u2019s file and tell plaintiff what she needed to do to qualify for a managerial position. HD (f) [Ison] instructing plaintiff not to put [her] employment concerns in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">After answering the complaint, Fujisawa moved for summary judgment, contending the evidence upon which Casenas alleged constructive discharge failed, as a matter of law, to meet the threshold requirement to establish the cause of action, i.e., no reasonable person could conclude Casenas was forced to resign due to actions or conditions so intolerable or aggravated at the time of her resignation that a reasonable person in her position would have resigned. Fujisawa further contended there was no evidence by which Casenas could show her employer\u2019s actions were motivated by a desire to retaliate against her for filing a sexual harassment complaint. And even if she could make the requisite showing, Fujisawa\u2019s undisputed evidence established its legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its actions and Casenas had no evidence to show the proffered explanation was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Fujisawa\u2019s separate statement of undisputed material facts presented most of the facts recited above. In her opposing separate statement, Casenas admitted nearly all of the material facts, disputed some with facts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>were not material,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and objected to some as hearsay, but failed to obtain an evidentiary ruling barring them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court, finding no triable issues of fact, granted summary judgment to Fujisawa.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Casenas\u2019s appeal is not about whether Brown sexually harassed her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issues pertain to the employer\u2019s activities and motivations after Casenas reported her former district manager\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">A defendant moving for summary judgment \u201chas met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) The burden then \u201cshifts to the plaintiff ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We conduct a de novo review. <em>(Frank and Freedus </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 461, 469 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 678].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Constructive Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The elements of constructive discharge are set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022], a case we find absolutely dispositive of Casenas\u2019s appeal and thus discuss in some detail.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Turner worked for a brewery for six years, voluntarily resigned in 1981, and then returned in early 1984, to work at the wholesale operations division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>as a \u201c \u2018branch off-premises coordinator\u2019 in the sales department.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1243.) In May 1985, he was \u201creassigned to the position of \u2018assistant supervisor route sales.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>His salary and responsibility level were unchanged. For four years, with only one exception, he \u201creceived \u2018good\u2019 ratings on written performance evaluations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But in December 1988, his rating was \u201c \u2018needs improvement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1243-1244.) He met with supervisors who advised him his \u201cjob performance had deteriorated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1244.) Turner disagreed with both the appraisal and his supervisors\u2019 handling of the matter. He resigned and sued, alleging, in pertinent part, constructive wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The <em>Turner </em>court, reversing the Court of Appeal, found the trial court had properly granted the employer summary judgment. Initially, it noted, \u201cActual discharge carries significant legal consequences for employers, including possible liability for wrongful discharge. In an attempt to avoid liability, an employer may refrain from actually firing an employee, preferring instead to engage in conduct causing him or her to quit. The doctrine of constructive discharge addresses such employer-attempted \u2018end runs\u2019 around wrongful discharge and other claims requiring employer-initiated terminations of employment.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1244.)  The court explained, \u201cConstructive discharge occurs when the employer\u2019s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, T quit,\u2019 the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer\u2019s acts, against the employee\u2019s will. As a result, a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1244-1245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The <em>Turner </em>court then delineated \u201c[t]hree areas of inquiry\u201d to test whether a constructive discharge claim can be proved. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1245.) First, there must be intolerable conditions: \u201cThe conditions giving rise to the resignation must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer. The proper focus is on whether the resignation was coerced, not whether it was simply one rational option for the employee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1246.) In this respect, an employer is not obligated to provide a stress-free environment: \u201c \u2018 \u201cAn employee is protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>from . . . unreasonably harsh conditions, in excess of those faced by his [or her] co-workers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1247.) \u201c[A]dverse working conditions must be unusually \u2018aggravated\u2019 or amount to a \u2018continuous pattern\u2019 before the situation will be deemed intolerable.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247, fn. omitted.) \u201c \u2018[T]he mere failure to promote the plaintiff, even if unlawfully discriminatory, will not support a finding of constructive discharge. . . . Nor is it sufficient to show only that the employee received a poor performance rating.\u2019 . . . \u2018Further, demotion of job level, even when accompanied by reduction in pay, does not constitute constructive discharge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1247, fn. 4, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The second inquiry under the <em>Turner </em>test applies an objective standard, asking \u201c \u2018whether a reasonable person faced with the allegedly intolerable employer actions or conditions of employment would have no reasonable alternative except to quit.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The final inquiry focuses on the employer: \u201c[T]he employee\u2019s resignation must be employer-coerced, not caused by the voluntary action of the employee or by conditions or matters beyond the employer\u2019s reasonable control.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1248, original italics.) Employer coercion of a resignation against the employee\u2019s will cannot be proved by evidence of the employer\u2019s constructive knowledge of an intolerable situation. Rather, \u201c. . . the employer must either deliberately create the intolerable working conditions that trigger the resignation or, at a minimum, must know about them and fail to remedy the situation in order to force the employee to resign.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1249-1250.) This standard, requiring employees to notify someone in authority about the intolerable working conditions, \u201cpermit[s] employers unaware of any wrongdoing to correct a potentially destructive situation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1250), and \u201cdiscourages employer inaction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The <em>Turner </em>court summarized its holding: \u201cIn order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove . . . that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee\u2019s resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>person in the employee\u2019s position would be compelled to resign.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Casenas\u2019s facts do not survive the <em>Turner </em>test. The trial court correctly determined no jury would be permitted to find Fujisawa or any of its agents coerced her resignation by intentionally creating or knowingly permitting the existence of working conditions so intolerable at the time of the resignation that a reasonable person in the same position would have no rational option except to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Intolerable Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Little discussion is needed regarding Casenas\u2019s allegations she received an unfair performance evaluation and was not considered for promotion to a management position. As a matter of law, such events do not create intolerable working conditions transforming a voluntary resignation into constructive discharge. \u201c \u2018 \u201cAn employee may not be unreasonably sensitive to his [or her] working environment.... Every job has its frustrations, challenges, and disappointments; these inhere in the nature of work.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247.) For instance, \u201c. . . a poor performance rating or a demotion, even when accompanied by reduction in pay, does not by itself trigger a constructive discharge.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Moreover, with regard to factual evidence, while Casenas held the opinion her appraisal was unfair, she did not contradict Fujisawa\u2019s <em>proof </em>her rating and merit increase (the highest awarded in her district) were fair and reasonable based upon comparative data utilized nationwide by the company. The fact she was never told she ranked in the 55th to 60th percentile of all PSR\u2019s is immaterial. And she admitted she had no evidence or reason to believe Fujisawa\u2019s averred sales statistics were false. Moreover, Casenas\u2019s achieving 105 percent of her individual sales goal did not automatically entitle her to an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating. Indeed, Ison averred the rating is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>reserved for the top 10 percent of PSR\u2019s nationwide; Casenas was not among that select group.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Nor was there any <em>material </em>dispute about Fujisawa\u2019s reason for not considering Casenas for the position of district sales manager. Although Casenas had initially identified her goal of achieving that title, she admitted that in February 1989 (before she aired any complaint about sexual harassment), she advised Fujisawa she had chosen an entirely different career path\u2014senior sales representative or executive representative, with the long-term goal of a specialty sales assignment. On the motion for summary judgment, she quibbled about <em>why </em>she had changed her plans, saying it was at Bemson\u2019s urging, but she offered no evidence anyone in management knew she still wanted to be a district sales manager. Nor did she controvert Fujisawa\u2019s evidence that the <em>only </em>reason she was not originally included among the candidates for the job was her own stated change of direction. Moreover, Ison declared\u2014without contradiction\u2014that at the infamous five-hour meeting, he and Bemson discussed with Casenas her goal of being a sales manager and the process by which such positions were filled, and promised her they would do everything in their power to help her advance to the position she coveted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Turning to the meeting itself, which Casenas paints in such florid prose in her complaint, we note \u201c[t]he purpose of summary judgment is to penetrate . . . adept pleading and to ascertain, by means of affidavits, the presence or absence of triable issues of fact. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 836, 840-841 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 262].) Casenas presented no evidence of threats, reprimands or intimidating remarks. Indeed, Fujisawa submitted <em>uncontradicted </em>evidence the whole purpose of the meeting was to give Casenas a forum for airing all the items on her agenda, and she agrees the issues were discussed in detail. Indeed, she took eight pages of notes reflecting her active participation in a wide-ranging exchange in which all of her concerns were addressed. She complains she did not receive satisfactory answers to all of her questions, but <em>that </em>deficiency creates no triable issue as to \u201c1 \u201cunreasonably harsh conditions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1247.) Rather, it reflects an ordinary, commonplace frustration inherent in the nature of employment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>And insofar as Casenas claims the <em>length </em>of the meeting presents a triable issue of fact of intimidation, to all appearances she was completely in control of the situation. The meeting ended when she \u201cgot up and walked out.\u201d There is no evidence she was prevented from doing just that at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>But even assuming the meeting was intimidating, as a rule, under <em>Turner, </em>\u201c \u2018[s] ingle, trivial, or isolated acts ... are insufficient\u2019 to support a constructive discharge claim. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Casenas also lists as an intolerable condition Ison\u2019s refusal to converse with her through correspondence. We fail to discern the legal significance of this assertion. Casenas opined meetings were a waste of time until issues were \u201cclarif[ied] through clear and concise memos.\u201d Well, Ison disagreed, preferring face-to-face interaction. <em>He </em>was the boss\u2014the legitimate arbiter of business practices. A jury would not be allowed to second-guess his management style or to infer the existence of a pernicious underlying motivation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In short, whether examined in isolation or accumulation, the facts upon which Casenas relied do not demonstrate intolerable conditions under the <em>Turner </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Objective Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We need not dwell on the issue of \u201c \u2018whether a reasonable person faced with the allegedly intolerable employer actions or conditions of employment would have no reasonable alternative except to quit.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1248.) Although Casenas contends the objective standard is <em>necessarily </em>a jury question, her cited cases do not support that proposition, and, in the factual context presented here, it is patently absurd. In March 1989, Casenas was given a rating of \u201chighly commendable,\u201d together with the highest merit increase in her district and a promotion to senior sales representative. She was praised time and time again in subsequent months, earning awards and bonuses. Fujisawa\u2019s management responded immediately to her stated dissatisfaction with her appraisal, reviewing it, making changes to accommodate her suggestions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>directing the preparation of an addendum. The <em>only </em>thing it did not do was change the rating or the salary increase, both of which it deemed fair. There was endless consideration of her complaints and an investigation of the sexual harassment charges which resulted in a devastating written reprimand to Brown, to follow him forever in his personnel file. Casenas was congratulated and thanked for having called the matter to management\u2019s attention. There was no evidence anyone at Fujisawa ever gave Casenas any indication her job or advancement or career objectives were in jeopardy.. The only reasonable inference arising from the evidence is that she had the utmost employment security, an environment tailored to meet her specific needs, and support at every level of Fujisawa\u2019s management. As a matter of law, no reasonable person in Casenas\u2019s position would have believed she or he was being forced out of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Employer\u2019s Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">As for the third element of the <em>Turner </em>test, Casenas submitted no evidence to contradict Fujisawa\u2019s showing of the diligence it exercised in timely response to and investigation of the sexual harassment allegations, its severe written and oral reprimands of Brown and warnings to him regarding any further unprofessional conduct, and its extraordinary care to ensure Casenas never had to lay eyes on him again. Fujisawa established as a matter of law it had neither deliberately created intolerable working conditions nor knowingly permitted them to exist.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We close with the sorry observation that despite its exemplary conduct, the employer here was unable to placate its dissatisfied employee and avoid a lawsuit. However, and fortunately, Fujisawa utilized the summary judgment procedure which fulfilled its laudatory purpose of expediting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>litigation and eliminating the further waste of time and money which would have resulted from an utterly needless trial. (See, e.g., <em>PMC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saban Entertainment, Inc. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 579, 590 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 877].) As other courts have aptly observed, \u201c \u2018[j]ustice requires that a defendant be as much entitled to be rid of an unmeritorious lawsuit as a plaintiff is entitled to maintain a good one.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Frank and Freedus </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 469, citing <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Johannes </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 491, 507 [86 Cal.Rptr. 744].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Fujisawa shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Sills, P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> Brown\u2019s transfer was unrelated to and occurred before Casenas\u2019s complaint of sexual harassment. Thus, at the time she made the problem known, he was no longer in any position of authority over her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> The record contains a number of congratulatory letters, memos and announcements of monetary awards for Casenas\u2019s achievements. In particular, on March 9, 1989, Rick Lamb awarded Casenas $2,000 \u201cas partial reward\u201d for her \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d in a sales campaign; on March 29, Ison congratulated her for placing in the \u201ctop third\u201d of her district in another program, qualifying her for \u201caward credits\u201d to be used as she chose; and on April 12, Ison again praised Casenas for her \u201csignificant accomplishment. . . resulting from] hard work, proper planning, and focused selling efforts.\u201d He noted, \u201cAchievement of sales goals is the engine that drives successful salespeople and you can count yourself among this group. We thank you for your efforts and contributions and we thank you for \u2018creating success by doing it right.\u2019 \u201d Bemson added his personal handwritten comment to the letter: \u201cThis is getting to be a habit. Congratulations!\u201d Finally, on June 8, Ison sent a bonus check in recognition of Casenas\u2019s efforts during the first quarter of 1989, thanking her for her work and stating, \u201cI trust you will continue your dedication to the sales and profit task during the second quarter of 1989.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> Five PSR\u2019s reported to Brown.

Inter alia, he warned Brown to make no comments of a sexual/gender nature, humorous or otherwise, to any Fujisawa employee and to refrain from discussing Casenas with anyone or contacting or approaching her in any way. He also told Brown violation of any of the company\u2019s directives, including actions judged to be retaliatory, would be grounds for immediate termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> Casenas admitted in her deposition that the position in question was filled by a more qualified person\u2014Bemson.
