S.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In this lawsuit plaintiff Denise S. Seraf\u00edn (Seraf\u00edn) alleges that defendant First Interstate Bank of California (Bank) violated the duties imposed upon it by statute when a homeowner pays off an obligation evidenced by a deed of trust. In particular, she claims that Bank, in its capacity as beneficiary of the deed of trust, violated its duty to deliver the reconveyance documents to the trustee when the loan was paid off and that Bank, in its capacity as trustee of the deed of trust, violated its duty to record the reconveyance. The trial court granted summary judgment to Bank. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">In April 1993, Seraf\u00edn obtained a $5,700 line of credit from Bank secured by a deed of trust on her home in Fullerton, California. Pursuant to the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>deed, Seraf\u00edn was the trustor and, as is often the practice with institutional lenders, Bank, through different departments, fulfilled two capacities: beneficiary and trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On September 3, 1993, Bank received a request for a demand in regard to paying off Seraf\u00edn\u2019s obligation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This request, however, was destroyed <em>prior </em>to the commencement of this lawsuit pursuant to Bank\u2019s standard retention procedures. (See fn. 6, <em>post.) </em>Nonetheless, the existence of this request is proven by a document Bank generated on September 3, 1993, and entitled: \u201cDemand (Beneficiary\u2019s Statement).\u201d The document is addressed to Gateway Title Company in Orange, California, directed to the attention of \u201cSunday,\u201d gives a specific escrow number, lists Seraf\u00edn as the borrower, and recites as the property address Seraf\u00edn\u2019s Fullerton home. The document states: <em>\u201cIn accordance with your request, </em>we submit our demand and will forward to you a delayed full reconveyance <em>to be recorded </em>upon receipt of funds and fees listed below.\u201d (Italics added.) Furthermore evidence of the fact that on September 3, 1993, Seraf\u00edn submitted a request for a demand is found in a copy of a report generated by Bank\u2019s computerized loan accounting system.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On September 27, 1993, Serafim paid the loan off.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On October 14,1993, Bank\u2019s direct loan center, functioning as beneficiary of the trust deed, generated a document entitled \u201cInstructions for Issuing Reconveyances.\u201d On October 15, 1993, this document was sent to Bank\u2019s trust deed reconveyance department which functioned as trustee of the trust deed. Enclosed with the document were: (1) the April 1993 note executed by Seraf\u00edn, which Bank had now stamped \u201cPaid\u201d on September 27, 1993; (2) the April 1993 trust deed; (3) a request for full reconveyance signed by an employee of Bank, Debby Wirstlin (Wirstlin); and (4) a $65 check for the reconveyance fee. The document included the following directions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cYou are requested to issue full reconveyance of above trust deed and forward to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">Attention: Sunday</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">Gateway Title Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">2100 West Orangewood Ave. 100</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">Orange CA. 92668</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u201cPlease complete the reconveyance for mailing after recording to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">Denise Seraf\u00edn</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">218 S. Ventura Pl[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Fullerton, CA 92633.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Bank\u2019s trust deed reconveyance department received the above on October 18,1993. On October 22,1993, that department mailed the reconveyance to Sunday at the Gateway Title Company. For reasons not explained in the present record, the reconveyance was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">On June 3, 1994, Seraf\u00edn and other named individuals commenced suit as representatives of a class allegedly injured by the practice of various defendants, including Bank, of collecting reconveyance fees but not recording the reconveyances in a timely manner. On June 16, 1994, Bank, through its employee Wirstlin, executed another full reconveyance in favor of Seraf\u00edn. On June 27, 1994, pursuant to the request of Gateway Title Company, that document was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In regard to the class action, the parties agreed to sever the complaint into separate cases. Seraf\u00edn then filed her own complaint. The operative pleading for purposes of this appeal is her fourth amended complaint. The complaint recites that it is a consumer class action and that Seraf\u00edn is suing on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated and as a private attorney general on behalf of the general public. The first cause of action alleged statutory liability against Bank under Civil Code section 2941, subdivision (b)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Bank\u2019s capacity as beneficiary of the trust deed. The second cause of action alleged statutory liability against Bank under section 2941, subdivision (b)(1)(A) in its capacity as trustee of the trust deed. The third cause of action alleged liability for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 based upon Bank\u2019s purported violations of section 2941. In regard to money damages, Seraf\u00edn did not plead that she had been damaged by Bank\u2019s alleged failures. Instead, she sought on behalf of herself and each member of the class the damages provided by statute: $300 for each violation of section 2941.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In regard to her unfair business practices claim, she sought an injunction to prohibit Bank from continuing to engage in the purported violations and disgorgement of all moneys \u201cwrongfully obtained\u201d by Bank. Lastly, she sought an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The trial court ultimately granted summary judgment to Bank. This appeal by Seraf\u00edn follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">1. <em>Liability for Failure to Deliver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Seraf\u00edn sought to impose liability upon Bank in its capacity as beneficiary of the trust deed based upon the assertion that Bank violated its statutory duty to deliver to the trustee the reconveyance request and the documents necessary to effectuate the reconveyance. She relied upon section 2941, subdivision (b)(1) which provides: \u201cWhen the obligation secured by any deed of trust has been satisfied, the beneficiary, or the assignee of the beneficiary shall execute and deliver to the trustee the original note, deed of trust, request for a full reconveyance, and other documents as may be necessary to reconvey, or cause to be reconveyed, the deed of trust.\u201d Seraf\u00edn\u2019s fourth amended complaint alleged: \u201c[Bank] breached Civil Code section 2941(b)(1) by failing to deliver to the trustee <em>within sixty days </em>after satisfaction of the debt the necessary documents to reconvey or cause to be reconveyed the deeds of trust securing such debt.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In this regard, the operative facts are undisputed. On September 27, 1993, Seraf\u00edn paid off her loan. On October 15, 1993, Bank, acting in its capacity as beneficiary and through its direct loan center, sent all of the necessary documents to effectuate a reconveyance to the trustee, Bank\u2019s trust deed reconveyance department. On October 18, 1993, the trustee received the documents. Thus, 18 days after Seraf\u00edn satisfied the obligation secured by the trust deed, the beneficiary sent the necessary documentation to the trustee, all of which was received 3 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is clear that based upon the allegations in the fourth amended complaint that Bank had a duty to deliver the necessary documentation in 60 days, the trial court properly granted Bank summary adjudication on this issue because the uncontradicted evidence established that Bank delivered the documentation in 18 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">In order to avoid the force of this conclusion and draw this court into a lengthy debate about the meaning of the subdivision, Seraf\u00edn now urges that she should not be bound by the allegations in her fourth amended complaint. She argues that she only amended her complaint to include those allegations because the trial court ordered her to do so. She therefore desires to now posit the issue as being whether the \u201cwhen\u201d in section 2941, subdivision (b)(1) means that Bank was required to deliver the reconveyance documents \u201cas soon as\u201d or \u201cat the time\u201d Seraf\u00edn paid her loan off. There is no need for us to discuss or decide this issue because a careful reading of the record shows that Seraf\u00edn <em>is </em>bound by the allegations in her fourth amended complaint and consequently cannot now shift theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Serafm\u2019s first amended complaint, filed in June 1995, alleged that Bank \u201c[f]ail[ed] to prepare the necessary documents to reconvey or cause to be reconveyed the deeds of trust within the time frames specified in section 2941(b)(1) . . . .\u201d Bank demurred, inter alia, on the basis that section 2941 imposed no time limit on the beneficiary vis-it-vis its duty to send reconveyance documents to the trustee. Seraf\u00edn\u2019s opposition, drawing upon other time requirements in the statute, urged that the only reasonable interpretation of the statute was \u201cthat a beneficiary must, no later than 39 days from payoff of the loan, submit the documents to the trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">After hearing argument, the trial court sustained Bank\u2019s demurrer with leave to amend as follows: \u201cAny claim against [Bank] as beneficiary under Civil Code \u00a7 2941(b)(1) must allege that [Bank] failed to deliver the documents required to be delivered under that section within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, of satisfaction of the obligation secured by the deed of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Thereafter, Seraf\u00edn filed a second amended complaint using the language which she carried over into the pleading in effect at the time of the summary adjudication motion, her fourth amended complaint. As stated above, that language alleged a violation of section 2941, subdivision (b)(1) based upon a failure \u201cto deliver within sixty days\u201d after the loan was paid off. Significantly, although expressly given the option by the trial court to allege \u201ca reasonable time period, not to exceed sixty days,\u201d Seraf\u00edn chose to amend her pleading by utilizing the outside limit of 60 days. In a subsequent hearing, counsel for Seraf\u00edn explicitly recognized this decision when he stated: \u201c[T]he allegations in the complaint, Your Honor, are all based upon 60 days. We haven\u2019t even relied upon reasonable time, we\u2019ve just said 60 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">At the hearing on the summary judgment motion held <em>after </em>the trial court had granted Bank\u2019s motion for summary adjudication, Seraf\u00edn raised <em>for the first time </em>the claim that Bank had an <em>immediate </em>duty to deliver the reconveyance documents. The trial court rejected Seraf\u00edn\u2019s attempt to disavow the allegations of her fourth amended complaint. It stated: \u201cHere\u2019s what seems to be happening. We wrestled with the question of when the beneficiary had to act and because it appeared the Legislature had omitted any specific time period, we said it would be a reasonable time, and then based on other provisions of the statute we said it would not exceed 60 days. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the way your amended complaint pleads it, though. Your amended complaint simply uses the hard and fast 60-day period, and I suspect that the plaintiffs did that so that you would have some option of certifying a class without going through a plaintiff-by-plaintiff analysis of what was a reasonable period of time .... So having chosen to develop a bright line for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>presumably parameters of class certification, you then face a predicament here where there was only 18 days. You just can\u2019t have it both ways. . . . [Y]ou can\u2019t on the one hand strategically decide to exclude everything less than 60 days so you don\u2019t have to argue about it and then when they come in it\u2019s only 18 days, say . . . we want to revisit that issue. You have pled 60 days and you\u2019re going to have to live with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In light of this record, we find no merit to Serafin\u2019s present claim that she should not be bound by the allegations in the fourth amended complaint as to the time period in which Bank was obligated to deliver the reconveyance documents because she was compelled by judicial order to plead in that manner. For one thing, it is clear that following the hearing on the demurrer to the first amended complaint, she elected to plead a period of 60 days although the trial court had ruled that she could plead a reasonable time period, not to exceed 60 days. For another thing, at the time of the hearing, Seraf\u00edn was <em>not </em>urging the position she now takes\u2014that Bank had the duty to transfer the reconveyance documents the moment she satisfied the obligation\u2014but instead was advocating the position that Bank had 39 days to transfer the documents. Seraf\u00edn did not clearly and explicitly raise the argument of an immediate duty to deliver until after the trial court had granted Bank summary adjudication. Thus, contrary to what Seraf\u00edn now suggests, it is apparent that she was not forced by the court to forsake alleging that the Bank had an immediate duty to transfer the documents and to instead allege a duty to act within 60 days. Having made the decision in the trial court to allege a 60-day period\u2014an allegation which defined the issues to be considered in Bank\u2019s summary adjudication motion\u2014Seraf\u00edn may not now change her position on appeal. We therefore do not address her new arguments that section 2941, subdivision (b)(1) imposes an immediate duty upon Bank, as beneficiary of the deed of trust, to deliver the reconveyance documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">2. <em>Liability for Failure to Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Seraf\u00edn sought to impose liability upon Bank in its capacity as trustee based upon the assertion that Bank violated its statutory duty to record the reconveyance. She relied upon section 2941, subdivision (b)(1)(A) which provides: \u201cThe trustee shall execute the full reconveyance and shall record or cause it to be recorded, <em>except as provided in subdivision (c), </em>in the office of the county recorder in which the deed of trust is recorded within 21 calendar days after receipt by the trustee of the original note, deed of trust, request for a full reconveyance, the fee that may be charged pursuant to subdivision (e), recorder\u2019s fees, and other documents as may be necessary to reconvey, or cause to be reconveyed, the deed of trust.\u201d Essentially, Seraf\u00edn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>claimed that Bank, in its capacity as trustee, had all the necessary documents in its possession by October 18, 1993, but that it failed to have the reconveyance recorded within the required 21 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In granting Bank summary adjudication on this issue, the trial court found that subdivision (c) of section 2941 excepted Bank from its statutory duty to record the reconveyance. Subdivision (c) recites: \u201cThe mortgagee or trustee shall not record or cause the . . . full reconveyance to be recorded when any of the following circumstances exist. . . .\u201d The trial court relied upon two exceptions. The first is when \u201c[t]he mortgagee or trustee has received written instructions to the contrary from the mortgagor or trustor, or the owner of the land, as the case may be, or from the owner of the obligation secured by the deed of trust or his or her agent, or escrow.\u201d We need not and do not decide the applicability of this exception because we find, as will be explained, that the italicized portion of the second exception, which we now quote, controls this particular situation. That exception occurs when <em>\u201c[i\\he </em>certificate of discharge <em>or full reconveyance is to be delivered to the </em>mortgagor or <em>trustor, </em>or the owner of the land, as the case may be, <em>through an escrow to which the </em>mortgagor, <em>trustor, </em>or owner <em>is a party\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The evidence presented by Bank in support of its summary adjudication motion established the following. Prior to September 3, 1993, Seraf\u00edn sent a request for a payoff to Bank. Bank, in its capacity as beneficiary of the trust deed, responded by sending, on September 3, 1993, a demand to Gateway Title Company explaining the amount Seraf\u00edn would have to pay. The demand letter gave an escrow number and identified Seraf\u00edn as the borrower. The demand further explained that Bank would send a reconveyance to Gateway Title Company \u201cto <em>be recorded </em>upon receipt of funds and fees listed . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) On October 14, 1993, after Seraf\u00edn had made the required payment, Bank\u2019s direct loan center, in its capacity as beneficiary of the trust deed, sent all of the pertinent documents to Bank\u2019s trust deed reconveyance department (the trustee of the trust deed) and instructed it first to issue a full reconveyance and then to forward that reconveyance to Gateway Title Company. The trustee received all of these documents within four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Taken together, the above facts established that Gateway Title Company requested Bank to forward a reconveyance of Seraf\u00edn\u2019s trust deed to it for recording through escrow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bank, as beneficiary, complied with that direction on October 14, 1993, when it sent the pertinent documents to the trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>and instructed it first to issue the full reconveyance and then to forward it to Gateway Title Company. Bank, as trustee, complied with that direction when it mailed the reconveyance to Gateway Title Company on October 22, 1993. Consequently, the trustee (Bank\u2019s trust deed reconveyance unit) was not required to record the reconveyance because \u201c[t]he certificate of . . . full reconveyance [was] to be delivered to the . . . trustor . . . through an escrow to which the . . . trustor . . . [was] a party.\u201d (\u00a7 2941, subd. (c)(2).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Seraf\u00edn advances several factual and legal arguments to defeat this conclusion, none of which has merit. We first address the factual arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Seraf\u00edn urges that there is no evidence that any escrow instructed the Bank to forward the reconveyance to it. She relies upon the fact that Bank was unable to produce the initial demand request it received because it had destroyed that document prior to commencement of litigation. Seraf\u00edn argues: \u201cThe Bank\u2019s failure to produce this key document leads to one irrefutable conclusion: The Bank never received such a written request from escrow. At the very least, the existence and content of such a document are disputed issues of fact central to the trial court\u2019s ruling.\" The argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Bank established through competent evidence (Wirstlin\u2019s declaration) the reason for the absence of the document,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a showing which Seraf\u00edn offered no evidence to contradict. In any event, the argument is, at best, disingenuous. Is Seraf\u00edn seriously urging that a request for a demand letter was never sent to Bank? Hardly, given that the fulcrum of her claim is that Bank failed to follow the statutory procedures after she received the demand letter and paid off her loan. None of these events would have occurred had she not set them in motion by requesting a demand letter. In any event, the evidence established that a request for a demand letter had been sent. For one thing, the September 3 communication from Bank to Gateway Title Company begins: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u201c7n <em>accordance with your request, </em>we submit our demand\u201d and Bank\u2019s computer records indicate that on September 3, 1993, it received a request for a demand letter from Gateway Title Company. (Italics added.) For another thing, several weeks later, Seraf\u00edn paid the sum due. Thus, it is patently unreasonable to argue that Bank never received a written request from escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In a similar vein, Seraf\u00edn urges that there is no evidence that Bank was to deliver the reconveyance to Seraf\u00edn through an escrow. We disagree. The October 14 communication from the beneficiary to the trustee directed the trustee \u201cto issue full reconveyance . . . and forward to . . . Gateway Title Company . . . .\u201d This shows that the trustee\u2019s obligation was limited to issuing the reconveyance and then forwarding that document to Gateway Title Company. Seraf\u00edn attempts to argue a contrary inference by pointing to the following language in the communication: \u201cPlease complete the reconveyance for mailing after recording to: Denise Serafin[,] 218 S. Ventura Pl[.,] Fullerton, CA 92633.\u201d Seraf\u00edn urges that this language indicates that the trustee was to record the reconveyance. Not so. The language is nothing more than an instruction to the trustee to insert Seraf\u00edn\u2019s name and home address in the upper left hand comer of the document entitled \u201cFull Reconveyance\u201d after the phrase \u201cAnd when recorded mail to.\u201d That is, the phrase simply directs the tmstee to insert the name and address of the trustor so that <em>after the reconveyance has been recorded, </em>it can be mailed to the trustor at the designated address. The phrase does <em>not </em>direct the tmstee to record the reconveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Lastly, Seraf\u00edn attempts to make much out of the fact that after she filed this lawsuit, a reconveyance was recorded in June 1994. She raises the following rhetorical question: \u201cIf the Bank had no duty to issue and record that reconveyance . . . then why did it so promptly reconvey four days after it was served with the complaint in this action?\u201d This question ignores the explanation given by Wirstlin, the individual who signed the June 1994 reconveyance, in her declaration. Wirstlin averred: \u201cSeraf\u00edn\u2019s Complaint notified [Bank] that the reconveyance [Bank] had previously prepared in Fall, 1993, <em>for recording by Gateway Title </em>had not been recorded. I prepared the new reconveyance in light of the allegations in Seraf\u00edn\u2019s Complaint that a reconveyance of her deed of trust had not yet been recorded. This new reconveyance has nothing to do with the documents prepared by [Bank] in Fall, 1993, at the time of pay-off of Serafin\u2019s loan, by which Bank issued a reconveyance and <em>sent the reconveyance to Gateway Title for </em>recording.\u201d (Italics added.) Furthermore, the upper left-hand comer of the reconveyance recites: \u201cRecording Requested by Gateway Title Company.\u201d This shows that Bank, as tmstee, had no obligation to record because it had always been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>intended that the reconveyance would be delivered to Seraf\u00edn through an escrow which would, in turn, record it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Lastly, we turn to Serafin\u2019s legal argument that the trial court erred in finding that the exception found in section 2941, subdivision (c)(2) applied to this case. She urges that this exception requires <em>personal </em>delivery to her of an <em>unrecorded </em>reconveyance so that she could then decide whether or not to record the document. The argument is borderline frivolous. For one thing, nothing in the language of subdivision (c)(2) even hints at <em>personal </em>delivery of the reconveyance. Seraf\u00edn is attempting to engraft upon that subdivision language found in subdivision (c)(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The attempt must fail, for whatever the merits of imposing such a requirement, the point is that the Legislature did not include it in subdivision (c)(2). Furthermore, nothing in the language of subdivision (c)(2) indicates that its purpose is to give the trustor the personal option of deciding whether or not to record the reconveyance. Serafin\u2019s effort to find support for such a purpose in the statute\u2019s legislative history fails. All she can point to is language taken out of context from a letter written by the California Real Estate Association expressing its opinion about including possible exceptions to the duty to record in a bill which was then pending in the state Legislature. This hardly constitutes a persuasive argument. Enough said.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">3. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Seraf\u00edn contends that the trial court adopted a one-year statute of limitations for claims alleging violations of section 2941 and that the correct limitations period is three years. She therefore urges us to address this claim. The problem with her position is that the ruling was made prior to the summary adjudication litigation when the action was framed in the context of a class action. Because Bank never urged that Serafin\u2019s claim was time-barred,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> none of the contested rulings in the summary adjudication involves the statute of limitations. Nonetheless, Seraf\u00edn urges: \u201c[T]his case began as a class action; if the judgment below is reversed, the case will proceed to class certification, and the issue of who belongs in that class will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>obviously have to be decided. The trial court early on in these proceedings ruled that a one-year statute applies to section 2941 violations, thereby eliminating some named plaintiffs in the related actions and severely restricting the size of the potential classes in all of these cases. . . . HQ . . . [B]oth the parties and the trial court will greatly benefit by this Court\u2019s guidance as to which statute of limitations should be applied in this case and in the ongoing related cases. Thus, for these reasons, this court is respectfully requested to decide whether the trial court applied the correct statute of limitations.\u201d We decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">4. <em>Business and Professions Code Section 17200</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">After the trial court granted Bank summary adjudication on the issues of violation of section 2941, Bank moved for summary adjudication on the remaining claim of violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. Bank noted that Seraf\u00edn had failed to offer any evidence to support that claim other than that already considered and rejected by the court in regard to her personal transaction. Bank urged that because Seraf\u00edn had no claim of her own under section 2941, she could not assert a claim on behalf of a class. Seraf\u00edn filed a response conceding that Bank\u2019s position was correct, assuming that the trial court\u2019s earlier rulings were correct. The court granted the motion and ultimately entered summary judgment on the complaint in Bank\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On this appeal, Seraf\u00edn does not seek review of the ruling granting Bank summary adjudication on the claim of violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. There is, therefore, nothing to discuss in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Hastings, J., and Baron, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 17, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-12\"> The parties\u2019 briefs do not explain the context in which the payoff occurred (e.g., sale by Seraf\u00edn of the home encumbered by the trust deed or simply a decision by Seraf\u00edn to pay off the liability) although one portion of the record suggests that the loan was paid off in the context of a refinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> A11 subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code unless stated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-12\"> Statutory liability is created by subdivision (d) of section 2941 which provides: \u201cThe violation of this section shall make the violator liable to the person affected by the violation for all damages which that person may sustain by reason of the violation, and shall require that the violator forfeit to that person the sum of three hundred dollars ($300).\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> Serafin has never really maintained that there was no escrow and in fact could not do so given the allegation in her complaint that Bank required that an escrow be used as part of the payoff transaction. Apparently, the escrow functions were performed by SC Funding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> If, as it appears, that Seraf\u00edn paid off the loan in the context of refinancing (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>our conclusion is consistent with the general rule that in a refinance situation, the trustee\u2019s obligation is to execute the reconveyance and have it deposited in an escrow for recordation upon close of escrow. <em>(Trustors Security Service </em>v. <em>Title Recon Tracking Service </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 592, 596 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 793].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> Wirstlin\u2019s declaration averred: \u201cThe actual Request for Demand relating to the Seraf\u00edn Advanceline is no longer in existence, as this class of document was disposed of prior to the commencement of this litigation pursuant to [Bank\u2019s] standard document retention procedures. A search of [Bank\u2019s] records was conducted to locate the Seraf\u00edn Request for Demand, but because of [Bank\u2019s] document retention procedures, it could not be located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">Additionally, Bank offered a declaration from its counsel who averred that through discovery she had attempted to obtain the request for demand letter from Gateway Title Company but was ultimately informed that the document could not be located. Counsel also sought discovery from SC Funding which had performed the escrow services in the transaction but it, too, was unable to locate the escrow file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> Subdivision (c)(3) of section 2941 provides: \u201cThe mortgagee or trustee shall not record or cause the certificate of discharge or full reconveyance to be recorded when any of the following circumstances exists: [U ... [ID (3) <em>When the personal delivery </em>is not for the purpose of causing recordation and when the certificate of discharge or <em>full reconveyance is to be personally delivered </em>with receipt acknowledged by the mortgagor or trustor or owner of the land, as the case may be, or their agent if authorized by mortgagor or trustor or owner of the land.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\"> In light of the facts that Serafin\u2019s loan was paid off in September 1993 and that Seraf\u00edn filed suit nine months later in June 1994, Bank essentially concedes that it could not argue that her claim was time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
