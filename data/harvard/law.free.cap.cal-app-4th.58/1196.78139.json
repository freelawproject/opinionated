Code, \u00a7 206).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges the constitutionality of section 206 on the grounds of vagueness and contends the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury that the crime of torture under section 206 requires the willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to inflict prolonged pain. We join the Third and Fifth Appellate Districts in rejecting both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">Appellant also argues the trial court\u2019s instruction defining \u201creasonable doubt\u201d lessened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, thereby violating his right to due process. We hold that the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction at issue comports with constitutional due process requirements, and publish our opinion to dispel any uncertainty regarding the court\u2019s position on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">As appellant does not attack the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, we need not discuss the underlying facts in detail. On May 14, 1996, the Marin County District Attorney filed an amended information charging appellant with a number of offenses, including one count of torture under section 206.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The alleged victim was appellant\u2019s two-month-old daughter, Claudia Ruelas. Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">A jury trial was held and, on June 11,1996, the jury found appellant guilty as charged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 9, 1996, the trial court sentenced appellant to a term in state prison. Appellant timely appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">I. <em>Section 206 Is Not Unconstitutionally Vague</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cThe fundamental policy behind the constitutional prohibition of vaguely worded criminal statutes was stated in <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1939) 306 U.S. 451, at page 453 [83 L.Ed. 888, at page 890, 59 S.Ct. 618]: \u2018No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Engert) (1982) 31 Cal.3d 797, 801 [183 Cal.Rptr. 800, 647 P.2d 76].) Under the California state and the federal Constitutions, \u201c. . . due process of law in this context requires two elements: a criminal statute must \u2018 \u201cbe definite enough to provide (1) a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and (2) a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 853 P.2d 507].) \u201cThe starting point of our analysis is \u2018the strong presumption that legislative enactments \u201cmust be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears. [Citations.] A statute should be sufficiently certain so that a person may know what is prohibited thereby and what may be done without violating its provisions, but it cannot be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">Section 206 defines the crime of torture as follows: \u201cEvery person who, with the intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose, inflicts great bodily injury as defined in Section 12022.7 upon the person of another, is guilty of torture. [\u201cJO The crime of torture does not require any proof that the victim suffered <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant specifically attacks as vague the terms \u201ccruel or extreme pain and suffering,\u201d \u201cany sadistic purpose,\u201d and \u201ctorture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">A. <em>\u201cCruel or Extreme Pain and Suffering\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Appellant contends the phrase \u201ccruel or extreme pain and suffering\u201d in section 206 is vague because \u201cno one knows what \u2018cruel pain\u2019 is.\u201d Appellant cites the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Engert), supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 797 as support for this contention. In <em>Enger\u00ed, </em>two defendants charged with first degree murder successfully challenged special circumstance allegations that the murders were \u201c \u2018especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity as described in . . . section 190.2(a)(14).\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Engert), supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 800.) The issue before the California Supreme Court (the Supreme Court) was whether the trial court properly struck the allegations from the information on the ground section 190.2, subdivision (a)(14) was unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Engert), supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 800-801.) The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order, stating; \u201cIt is difficult to assign any specific content to the pejoratives contained in subdivision (a)(14). Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed.) defines heinous as \u2018[hateful]; hatefully bad; flagrant; odious; atrocious; giving great offense.\u2019 Atrocious is defined as \u2018[savagely] brutal; outrageously cruel or wicked. . . .\u2019 Cruel is defined as \u2018[disposed to give pain to others; willing or pleased to hurt or afflict; savage, inhuman, merciless.\u2019 Depravity is defined as \u2018corruption; wickedness.\u2019 The terms address the emotions and subjective, idiosyncratic values. While they stimulate feelings of repugnance, they have no directive content. The adverb \u2018especially\u2019 adds nothing except greater uncertainty. The term \u2018especial\u2019 is defined by Webster as \u2018[n]ot general; distinguished among others of the same class as exceptional in degree.\u2019 [*]\u25a1 None of these terms meets the standards of precision and certainty required of statutes which render persons eligible for punishment, either as elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>of a charged crime or as a charged special circumstance. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Engert), supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 801-802.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We believe <em>Engert </em>is inapposite in this case. In <em>Engert, </em>the terms found to be unconstitutionally vague, including the word \u201ccruel,\u201d were used in and of themselves to define a standard of conduct. Used in that manner, those terms, as the Supreme Court stated, had \u201cno directive content.\u201d That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">In section 206, the word \u201ccruel\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d In at least two other cases, courts have held that \u201ccruel pain\u201d is the equivalent to \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d pain. <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 272, 297 [241 Cal.Rptr. 691]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Talamantez </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 443, 457 [215 Cal.Rptr. 542].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This definition comports with the common dictionary definition of \u201ccruel\u201d (see Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1965) p. 546 [as an adjective, \u201ccruel\u201d means \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d]), and, in our view, is a reasonable and practical interpretation of that phrase <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 568). We therefore conclude that the phrase \u201ccruel or extreme pain and suffering,\u201d as used in section 206, is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">B. <em>\u201cAny Sadistic Purpose\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Appellant also contends the phrase \u201cany sadistic purpose\u201d in section 206 is vague because although it has a settled meaning, that meaning is not commonly known. Appellant\u2019s position on this issue is based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Raley </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 870 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712] <em>(Raley). </em>He contends that in <em>Raley </em>the Supreme Court defined the phrase \u201csadistic purpose\u201d to include an element of sexual gratification. Appellant contends the trial court gave the jury the standard torture instruction which does not define the term \u201csadistic purpose,\u201d and that when the jury requested a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>definition of the term, the court failed to include the element of sexual gratification, thereby misleading the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In <em>Raley, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 870, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the phrase \u201csadistic purpose,\u201d as used in jury instructions defining the crime of murder by torture and the torture-murder special circumstance, was so vague as to violate the state and federal constitutional guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 899.) In holding that the phrase was not unconstitutionally vague, the Supreme Court indeed recognized that the word \u201csadism\" has a strong sexual connotation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 899-900.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Later in its opinion, however, the Supreme Court stated that \u201csadistic purpose\u201d \u201cis a term in common usage, having a relatively precise meaning, that is, the infliction of pain on another person for the purpose of experiencing pleasure.\u201d <em>(Raley, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 901.) We find it significant that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement does not include a specific reference to sexual pleasure. We also find significant the Supreme Court\u2019s notation of a recent definition of \u201csadism\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) page 1336, column 1: \u201cA form of satisfaction, commonly sexual, derived from inflicting harm on another.\u201d <em>(Raley, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 901, fn. 4.) In our view, the Supreme Court in <em>Raley </em>clearly recognized that a \u201csadistic purpose\u201d need not be sexual in nature, and therefore did not so limit the meaning of \u201csadistic purpose.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Healy </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1141-1142 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 274].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">We also conclude that the common meaning of \u201csadistic purpose,\u201d \u201cthe infliction of pain on another person for the purpose of experiencing pleasure\u201d (R<em>aley, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 901), is sufficiently definite to provide \u201c \u2018 \u201ca standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and . . . a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 567, citations omitted.) As the Supreme Court in <em>Raley </em>recognized, the courts of this state have consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>used the term \u201csadistic purpose\" without requiring further definition. (See <em>Raley, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 900-901, and cases cited therein; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrera, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1564.) The term \u201csadistic purpose\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">C. \u201cTorture\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Appellant contends the term \u201ctorture\u201d in section 206 is vague because the statute does not include as an element the intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain. He contends the intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain is part of the commonsense definition of torture and has been read into the definition of murder by torture (\u00a7 189) by the courts, and, therefore, that it should also be an element of torture under section 206. Since section 206 expressly requires an intent to inflict extreme pain or suffering, we understand appellant to be arguing that there must also be an intent to inflict <em>prolonged </em>pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">We disagree with appellant that the \u201ccommonsense\u201d definition of torture requires an intent to inflict prolonged pain. The dictionary definition of \u201ctorture\u201d does not indicate that the pain inflicted must be prolonged. (See Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 2414; Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dict. (1979) p. 1224.) In addition, although the courts have included the intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain as an element of murder by torture as a matter of judicial construction (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 539, 546 [128 Cal.Rptr. 161, 546 P.2d 665, 83 A.L.R.3d 1206]), this development was necessary because section 189 does not itself define the crime of murder by torture. Here, virtually the entire text of section 206 defines the crime of torture, and the statutory language does not require the intent to inflict prolonged pain. (See pt. II, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 92 [221 Cal.Rptr. 826, 710 P.2d 893] is misplaced. <em>Leach </em>involved application of the torture-murder special circumstance the electorate passed by initiative in 1978. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 109; \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(18).) As originally enacted, section 190.2, subdivision (a)(18) provided that \u201c. . . torture requires proof of the infliction of extreme physical pain no matter how long its duration.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 109.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 190.2, subdivision (a)(18) thus purported to eliminate the former requirement of \u201c \u2018proof of an intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 109, citing former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (c)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 92, the Supreme Court\u2019s concern was that section 190.2, subdivision (a)(18) eliminated completely the requirement of <em>intent </em>to torture. The Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>electorate which enacted subdivision (a)(18) intended to incorporate as much of the established judicial meaning of torture as is not inconsistent with the specific language of the initiative. Thus, the torture-murder special circumstance \u2018requires proof of first degree murder, [citation], proof the defendant intended to kill and to torture the victim [citation], and the infliction of an extremely painful act upon a living victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Significantly, the Supreme Court did not mention any requirement that the pain inflicted be prolonged. The case cited by the Supreme Court as supporting authority, <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861], likewise focused generally on the element of intent to torture and not on the duration of the pain inflicted. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 270-271.) And in neither of the other cases cited by appellant, <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 539, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 162 [133 Cal.Rptr. 135, 554 P.2d 881], is the duration of the pain inflicted an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Thus, in our view, intent to inflict <em>prolonged </em>pain is not an element of the crime of torture under section 206. Moreover, since section 206 expressly defines the crime of torture as requiring the intent to inflict extreme pain, it is consistent with pertinent case law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 109-110; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 270-271.) We therefore conclude that the term \u201ctorture,\u201d as used in section 206, is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">II. <em>\u201cWillful, Deliberate, and Premeditated Intent to Inflict Prolonged Pain\u201d Is Not an Element of the Crime of Torture as Defined in Section 206</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury that the crime of torture requires the willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to inflict prolonged pain. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">We have already concluded that section 206 does not require that the pain inflicted be prolonged. (See pt. I.C., <em>ante.) </em>This conclusion accords with the holdings of the two other cases that have dealt with that question. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vital </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 441, 444 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 676] [\u201cWhatever the requirements for torture murder under section 189 might be, section 206 plainly sets forth its requirements for torture. The intent to cause prolonged pain is not one of them.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrera, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1563-1564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Thus, the issue here is whether the intent to inflict pain, which is part of the statutory definition of the crime of torture (see \u00a7 206), must be \u201cwillful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>deliberate, and premeditated.\u201d Appellant contends such intent should be required under section 206 based on past judicial interpretations of the murder-by-torture statute (\u00a7 189) and the torture-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(18)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 539, the Supreme Court held that \u201cmurder by means of torture under section 189 is murder committed with a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to inflict extreme and prolonged pain.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 546.) The Supreme Court\u2019s holding was based in significant part on the fact that the Legislature defined murder by torture as a kind of first degree murder. Relying on prior judicial opinions on murder by torture, the Supreme Court stated; \u201cIn labeling torture as a \u2018kind\u2019 of premeditated killing, the Legislature requires the same proof of deliberation and premeditation for first degree torture murder that it does for other types of first degree murder. [&lt;\u00a1[] The element of calculated deliberation is required for a torture murder conviction for the same reasons that it is required for most other kinds of first degree murder. It is not the amount of pain inflicted which distinguishes a torturer from another murderer, as most killings involve significant pain. [Citation.] Rather, it is the state of mind of the torturer\u2014the cold-blooded intent to inflict pain for personal gain or satisfaction\u2014which society condemns.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) Keeping in mind that <em>Steger </em>involved the crime of first degree murder by torture and that section 189 does not define that crime, we do not dispute the logic underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Unfortunately for appellant, <em>Steger </em>does not support his position in this case. As appellant acknowledges in his opening brief, the plain language of section 206 does not require willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent. (See \u00a7 206.) This is a critical point of distinction between section 206 and section 189, which <em>expressly </em>requires such intent for murder by torture because it is a kind of first degree murder. (See \u00a7 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 546.) Thus, we are not bound to construe the intent requirement under section 206 identically to section 189. In the words of another court that has already rejected the argument made by appellant here, \u201c[w]e must presume that had premeditation been intended to be an element of the crime of torture under section 206, the section would have said so.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vital, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The trial court read the jury CALJIC No. 9.90 to define the elements of the crime of torture. (See p. 1203, fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>We conclude that CALJIC No. 9.90 correctly sets forth the elements of the crime of torture, and, therefore, that the trial court was not required further to instruct the jury that the crime requires willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>III. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Instruction Defining \u201cReasonable Doubt\u201d Did Not Violate Appellant\u2019s Right to Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Finally, appellant contends the trial court\u2019s jury instruction defining \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in the form of the 1994 revised version of CALJIC No. 2.90 lessened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, thereby violating appellant\u2019s right to due process. We note first that appellant requested the instruction given. Nevertheless, we review this contention de novo, and reject it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The 1994 revised version of CALJIC No. 2.90 provides; \u201cReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Before its revision in 1994, CALJIC No. 2.90 provided: \u201cReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs, <em>and depending upon moral evidence, </em>is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, <em>to a moral certainty, </em>of the truth of the charge.\u201d (Italics added.) In 1994, the United States Supreme Court (the Court) rejected a constitutional challenge to CALJIC No. 2.90 that objected to the phrases \u201cmoral evidence\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1, 10-17 [114 S.Ct. 1239, 1245-1249, 127 L.Ed.2d 583].) The Court, however, did not condone the use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d Although the phrase still met the constitutional standard for defining \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d its common meaning had changed since it was first used in a reasonable doubt instruction and could continue to change to the point of being unconstitutional. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 16-17 [114 S.Ct. at pp. 1248-1249].) The Court stated: \u201cAn instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 14-15 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1247], citing <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah </em>(1887) 120 U.S. 430, 439 [7 S.Ct. 614, 618, 30 L.Ed. 708].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, 31 A.L.R.5th 888], the Supreme Court responded to this criticism of the phrases \u201cmoral evidence\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty\u201d by stating: \u201cAlthough modifying the standard instruction is perilous, and generally should not be done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>today it might be more perilous for trial courts <em>not </em>to modify it in a narrow and specific manner in light of the high court\u2019s statement that the instruction\u2019s \u2018common meaning . . . may continue to [change] to the point that it\u2019 becomes unconstitutional. [Citation.] A slight modification in view of that decision might be deemed safe, indeed safer than not making it. The high court made clear that the terms \u2018moral evidence\u2019 and \u2018moral certainty\u2019 add nothing to the jury\u2019s understanding of reasonable doubt. It thus seems that trial courts might, in the future, safely delete the following phrases in the standard instruction: \u2018and depending on moral evidence,\u2019 and \u2018to a moral certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 504, original italics.) CALJIC No. 2.90 was thereafter revised as suggested by the Supreme Court in <em>Freeman. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 504; <em>People </em>v. <em>Light </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 879, 888 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 218].) Furthermore, the Legislature amended section 1096, effective July 3, 1995, to define \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in language identical to the language of revised CALJIC No. 2.90. (See \u00a7 1096.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Appellant contends the revised version of CALJIC No. 2.90 defines reasonable doubt only in terms of an \u201cabiding conviction\u201d and leaves the jury without guidance as to the level of persuasion the prosecution must attain to satisfy its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He contends the instruction thus permitted the jury to convict him upon a lesser standard than due process requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Constitutional challenges to the revised version of CALJIC No. 2.90, challenges identical to the one raised by appellant in this case, have been repeatedly rejected by the Courts of Appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barillas </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1022 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 166] [Second District]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 892, 895-896 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 868] [Fourth District]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 805, 815-816 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 853] [Sixth District]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tran </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 253, 262-263 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 650] [Sixth District]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Light, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 884-889 [Fifth District]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1077-1078 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 77] [Second District].) Although no First Appellate District case is among the cited cases, this court has rejected its share of challenges to revised CALJIC No. 2.90 in unpublished decisions.. We likewise reject appellant\u2019s challenge in this case, and publish our decision to make clear this court\u2019s position on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">We hold that the trial court did not violate appellant\u2019s right to due process by giving the jury CALJIC No. 2.90 as revised. In so holding, we find pertinent the comments of the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th 805: \u201cIn* <em>Freeman, </em>our Supreme Court took great care in suggesting changes to CALJIC No. 2.90 that would shore up its constitutionality, and concluded that these changes, while not required, were \u2018permissible.\u2019 [Citation.] We presume the [C]ourt\u2019s suggestions were not inadvertent or ill considered. (See <em>In re Brittany M. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1396, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>1403 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 57].) If there is to be any retreat from <em>Freeman, </em>it should come from the California Supreme Court, not us. We conclude, based on the pronouncements in <em>Freeman, </em>that the instruction given here satisfies federal due process concerns.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">We specifically reject appellant\u2019s characterizing as dicta the United States Supreme Court\u2019s comment in <em>Victor </em>that \u201c[a]n instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d (See <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at pp. 14-15 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1247].) The California Supreme Court in <em>Freeman </em>obviously thought otherwise. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 504 [\u201cThe high court made clear that the terms \u2018moral evidence\u2019 and \u2018moral certainty\u2019 add nothing to the jury\u2019s understanding of reasonable doubt.\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Light, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 888-889.) Moreover, even if the California Supreme Court\u2019s comments are themselves dicta, they are nonetheless highly persuasive. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 321, 328 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 406].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Peterson, P.

The court in <em>Talamantez </em>disagreed that the word \u201ccruel\u201d was vague, reading the <em>Engert </em>opinion as focusing on the word \u201cespecially\u201d as it modified \u201cheinous,\u201d \u201catrocious,\u201d and \u201ccruel.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Talamantez, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 457.)
