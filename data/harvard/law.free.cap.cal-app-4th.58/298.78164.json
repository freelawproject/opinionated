We further conclude that the trial court properly denied motions of each defendant to sever. We also determine that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the charge of aggravated kidnapping and did not err in refusing to instruct on time-barred lesser offenses. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, with the exception of defendant Lowe\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in imposing concurrent sentences, we conclude that the numerous other issues raised by the defendants lack merit. We therefore modify Lowe\u2019s judgment by staying the sentence imposed for second degree murder until completion of the term imposed for aggravated kidnapping, at which time the stay is to become permanent, and affirm the judgment as modified. We affirm the judgments as to Greenberger, Mentzer and Marti.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendants Karen DeLayne Greenberger (Greenberger), William Molony Mentzer (Mentzer), Alex Lomota Marti (Marti) and Robert Ulmer Lowe (Lowe) were tried jointly in a jury trial which commenced on September 4, 1990. The defendants were charged with the following crimes in the amended information: Count 1 alleged the crime of murder in violation of Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 187, subdivision (a), and count 2 alleged the crime of aggravated kidnapping in violation of section 209, subdivision (a). Count 1 also alleged the special circumstances that the murder was committed for financial gain and during the commission of kidnapping within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(17) and (b). Count 2 alleged that the victim had suffered bodily harm and death. Counts 1 and 2 also alleged that Marti and Mentzer personally used a firearm within the meaning of sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1). Both counts alleged pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a) that a principal in the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of the offense was armed with a firearm. The victim in both counts was Roy Radin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On July 19, 1991 the jury found Mentzer and Marti guilty of first degree murder and found the special circumstance allegations that the murder had been committed for financial gain and in the commission of a kidnapping to be true. The jury found Greenberger and Lowe guilty of second degree murder in count 1. The jury found all defendants guilty of aggravated kidnapping resulting in death in violation of section 209, subdivision (a) in count 2. The allegations of personal use of a firearm were found true as to Mentzer and Lowe in both counts, and the allegation of a principal armed with a firearm was found true as to all defendants in both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On October 18, 1991, the penalty phase of the trial resulted in jury verdicts of life in prison without the possibility of parole (LWOP) for Mentzer and Lowe. The trial court sentenced all four defendants to LWOP for count 2. For count 1, Greenberger and Lowe were sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, and Mentzer and Marti were sentenced to LWOP. Enhancements of two years pursuant to section 12022.5 were imposed on Mentzer and Marti. Enhancements of one year pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a) were imposed on Greenberger and Lowe. The trial court stayed the sentences and enhancements imposed on Greenberger for count 1 and the sentences and enhancements imposed on Mentzer and Marti for count 2 pursuant to section 654 and ordered the sentences in both counts imposed on Lowe to run concurrently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Enhancements of one year pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (a) in count 1 were stayed for Lowe and Marti.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>II. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">A. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The prosecution presented evidence to support its theory that defendant Greenberger hired defendants Mentzer, Marti and Lowe to kidnap and murder Roy Radin because Radin had cut her out of a Hollywood movie deal and had been involved in the theft of cocaine and money from her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Radin-Greenberger Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Roy Radin (Radin), the victim in both counts, was involved in the entertainment business in New York. He was interested in producing a movie to be called The Cotton Club. The name of the proposed movie derived from a nightclub of the same name. Radin met Greenberger in January 1983 in Los Angeles. Greenberger, who was involved in the illegal distribution of cocaine in Los Angeles, expressed an interest in assisting Radin in his efforts to make The Cotton Club. She also supplied cocaine to him. Greenberger introduced Radin to Tally Rogers, who worked for Greenberger in distributing cocaine. Rogers and Radin became friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Greenberger also introduced Radin to Hollywood film producer Robert Evans in April 1983. Evans was also interested in making a movie based on the Cotton Club. If Evans and Radin consummated a deal, Greenberger expected to be paid $50,000 as a finder\u2019s fee. Greenberger also hoped to have either financial participation or employment in the production company that would ultimately make the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Radin arranged for financing and conducted negotiations with Evans. Although Evans, who had befriended Greenberger, wanted to allow Greenberger some limited participation in the final contract, Radin refused. This resulted in an emotional confrontation between Greenberger and Radin in April 1983. Evans was interested in buying out Radin and proceeding without him. However, Radin intended to go through with the production with Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\n<em>Theft From Greenberger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">On April 18, 1983, someone stole 10 kilograms of cocaine and $275,000 in cash from Greenberger\u2019s home in Sherman Oaks. Greenberger suspected that Tally Rogers, who had disappeared, had committed this theft. She had received the cocaine from Milan Bellachasses and was afraid that she would be held responsible by Bellachases for the loss of the cocaine and money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Bellachasses was a major cocaine distributor in Miami and Greenberger\u2019s supplier. Upon discovery of the theft Greenberger hired Mentzer as a bodyguard. Marc Fogel had introduced her to Mentzer. Greenberger had supplied cocaine to Fogel in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Greenberger called Radin in New York in late April and told him she was looking for Rogers because he had stolen the money and cocaine from her house. She accused Radin of knowing where Rogers was and of being involved in Rogers\u2019s disappearance. Radin became angry and hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>Greenberger-Radin Dinner Date</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Radin returned to Los Angeles in early May 1983. Greenberger attempted to reach him by phone, but he refused to accept her calls. She was finally able to speak to Radin\u2019s personal assistant, Jonathan Lawson, on May 12. She arranged to meet with Radin the next night so that she and Radin could resolve their dispute over the Cotton Club deal at dinner. The same day Greenberger listed her Sherman Oaks home for sale, telling the real estate broker that she was moving to New York to work for Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">After Radin agreed to have dinner with Greenberger on May 13, he became concerned for his safety. Radin arranged to have a friend, Demond Wilson, follow him to the restaurant and provide security during the drive to dinner and at dinner. Wilson was to be armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\n<em>The Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">On May 13 Mentzer obtained the use of a limousine and another car with the assistance of Marc Fogel. On that same day a meeting occurred at Mentzer\u2019s apartment in Los Angeles. Mentzer, Lowe, Marti, Carl John Plzak and Raja Korban were present. Korban and Plzak first met Mentzer, Marti and Lowe when they all worked at an agency that performed vehicle repossessions and private detective services. Plzak worked for Mentzer in April 1983 providing security and surveillance for Greenberger. At that time Greenberger and Mentzer told him that she had been \u201cripped off for cocaine and money\u201d by Tally Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">While driving to this meeting Marti told Korban that the \u201cfat scumbag\u201d who owed money to a woman was going to be killed. At the meeting Mentzer, in the presence of Lowe and Marti, described the plan to kidnap Radin. Both Plzak and Korban testified at trial under a grant of immunity. They testified that the plan called for Plzak and Korban to wait for Jonathan Lawson, Radin\u2019s personal assistant, to leave the hotel as Greenberger met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>with Radin that night. Lawson was expected to go to Greenberger\u2019s car which was parked near an apartment Greenberger rented in Beverly Hills. Plzak and Korban were to kidnap Lawson who was to be used as leverage to get information from Radin about the location of the money and cocaine. They were to communicate with the others by walkie-talkie about their progress with Lawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The plan further called for Lowe to chauffeur Greenberger and Radin in the limousine Mentzer had obtained the previous day. They were to drive from Radin\u2019s hotel to a restaurant in Beverly Hills. The plan called for Greenberger to get out of the limousine at some point en route to Beverly Hills and for Mentzer and Marti to get in and force Radin to the floor at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Korban testified that Mentzer told the group that Lowe, Mentzer and Marti would drive Radin to the desert, and they would try to get information from Radin regarding the money owed Greenberger. Once in the desert the plan was to shoot Radin and blow up his face so his corpse could not be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Marti had a gym bag containing a handgun during this meeting. Mentzer had a bag with handcuffs, gloves and small explosives. Mentzer, who said he was being paid a \u201clot of money\u201d by Greenberger for the job, gave Korban an envelope containing $500 and a similar envelope and a walkie-talkie to Plzak.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>Night of Radin\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">On May 13 between 7 and 7:30 p.m. Greenberger arranged to have her child and nanny driven to the airport to fly to Miami. Greenberger then arrived at Radin\u2019s hotel. Radin and Lawson were in Radin\u2019s suite. Greenberger indicated that she hoped that the problems she and Radin had relating to the Cotton Club project would be resolved during dinner. Greenberger stated that she had arrived in a limousine that she and Radin would use to go to dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Greenberger asked Lawson to go to her car, which she said was parked nearby at her apartment, and obtain some cocaine from the glove box. Lawson refused. Korban and Plzak waited at Greenberger\u2019s apartment for approximately an hour. When Lawson did not appear they left.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">At approximately 9:30 p.m. Radin and Greenberger left the hotel and entered Greenberger\u2019s chauffeur-driven limousine. Demond Wilson, waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>outside the hotel, tried to follow the limousine but eventually lost it in traffic. Wilson then went to the restaurant expecting to find Greenberger and Radin there. They never appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Later Greenberger arrived at her apartment by herself and met Korban and Plzak. She drove off with Plzak. She asked Plzak whether he had heard from Mentzer and said that she needed to contact him. Plzak replied that he had not heard from Mentzer. Greenberger then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mentzer by walkie-talkie and telephone. When Plzak told her that Lawson had never appeared at her apartment, Greenberger stated that Lawson had refused to go to her car. Greenberger told Plzak that \u201cthey\u201d grabbed Radin and were on the way to the desert. She referred to Radin as \u201cthe fat pig\u201d or \u201cthe producer.\u201d When they parted, Greenberger told Plzak that she was going to set up an alibi and that he should not say he had seen her that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Greenberger then met with a friend with whom she stayed for several hours. During this time she made numerous phone calls to Mentzer and Evans, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Lawson spoke to Greenberger by phone several times the night of May 13 and the next day. Greenberger stated she was trying to locate Radin and told Lawson conflicting versions of how she and Radin had separated during the limousine ride en route to the restaurant for dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\n<em>The Next Day</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Marti called during the morning of May 14 and told Korban that Mentzer wanted Korban to return the $500 because Korban had not earned it. Korban returned the money to Marti that afternoon. Marti told Korban that nothing had happened the preceding night. He stated: \u201cWe just roughed him up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Plzak went to Mentzer\u2019s apartment in the early morning of May 14 at Mentzer\u2019s request and met with Mentzer and Lowe. Mentzer described to Plzak the events of the previous night. He described how he and Marti had entered the limousine. Mentzer said they thought the police were following them, and they were about to be stopped. He stated that he jammed the gun into \u201cthe producer\u2019s\u201d mouth and forced him to the floor. Mentzer stated Lowe then drove them to the desert where Mentzer and Marti shot Radin 27 times. They had taken Radin\u2019s Rolex watch and gun. Lowe stated to Plzak that he had to walk away from the shooting because he could not watch. Lowe also said that he cleaned the interior of the limousine after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Lowe and Plzak then left to return the limousine to the rental office from which it had been obtained. Lowe told Plzak that Radin said that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>know where the money was. Both Lowe and Mentzer described Radin as \u201cthe fat pig\u201d or \u201cfat pig producer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>Flight to Florida</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">During the night of May 14 Greenberger, Mentzer, Lowe, Marti and Plzak flew to Florida in a private plane. Mentzer told Plzak that they had word that Rogers was in Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">While in Florida Marti and Plzak drove to a small pond where Marti threw in some towel-covered objects. Marti told Plzak that these were the two .22-caliber guns and silencers used to kill \u201cthe fat pig.\u201d When Marti told Mentzer that he had discarded the weapons, Mentzer expressed displeasure, saying that the guns could not be traced and that silencers were hard to obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Plzak was paid by Greenberger for security work he did during their stay in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Discovery of Radin\u2019s Body</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Radin was reported missing by his friends in mid-May. A badly decomposed body was discovered June 10,1983, in Caswell Canyon, a remote area in northern Los Angeles County. The circumstances of the discovery of the body were unconnected to Radin\u2019s disappearance. The body was identified as Roy Radin by dental records and fingerprints. There was no jewelry or identification on the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Forensic pathological examination of the body disclosed that Radin had been shot numerous times in the head with .22-caliber bullets. The face had been damaged in a manner consistent with an explosive device having been placed in his mouth. The condition of the body was consistent with death having occurred on May 13, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">\n<em>Police Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The police investigation included searches of the residences of Mentzer and Marti and a search of storage lockers used by Mentzer. The police located and interviewed Plzak and Korban and used undercover operative William Rider to obtain tape-recorded incriminatory statements from Mentzer and Lowe in 1988. Rider was an acquaintance of Mentzer, Marti and Lowe. Rider had spoken to Marti and Mentzer in 1983, and each had admitted involvement in the Radin murder. Rider testified for the prosecution about the 1983 admissions, and tape recordings of the 1988 conversations with Mentzer and Lowe were played to the jury. The content of these conversations will be set forth in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Marti also made certain admissions to Estanislau Kreutzer whom Marti employed in 1986-1987 to help him in the distribution of cocaine. Kreutzer was a friend of Marti from Argentina.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kreutzer testified that Marti warned him on numerous occasions in 1986 and 1987 not to steal from him. Marti made veiled references to the murder of Radin by saying that he had been involved in the shooting of a \u201cpoor guy\u201d who had stolen $300,000 and 10 kilograms of cocaine, but that he had not been in charge of the murder. Kreutzer observed a photograph on a desk in Marti\u2019s house. The photograph depicted Marti holding a gun and standing next to Mentzer. Marti told Kreutzer that the location where the photograph was taken was near Magic Mountain (in the vicinity where Radin\u2019s body was discovered) and that he needed to find a new place to dump bodies because that place was full.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Mentzer, Marti, and Greenberger were arrested on October 2, 1988. Lowe was arrested on October 3, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">B. The Defense</p>\n<p id=\"A7CJ\">\n<em>Mentzer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">At the conclusion of the People\u2019s case Mentzer rested without presenting any evidence. He requested that his case be severed and submitted to the jury before the other defendants presented their defense. His request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\n<em>Marti</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Marti offered evidence to impeach the credibility of William Rider, Estanislau Kreutzer and Carl Plzak. He presented evidence that Rider used cocaine heavily in 1983, that Plzak made inconsistent statements to a defense investigator about his recollection of the events of 1983 and that Kreutzer attempted to hire Joseph Barbalinardo in 1987-1988 to kill Marti because of the debt owed by Marti. Marti testified in surrebuttal that he was in Florida working for Milan Bellachasses from May 9 to May 20, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\n<em>Lowe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Lowe also presented an alibi. Family members and friends testified that he was in Maryland on May 13 and 14, 1983, and that he left by motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>for Florida on May 14. His former wife and others also testified that Lowe had a penchant for exaggeration, especially when drinking too much. This was offered to explain his statements to Rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Lowe offered evidence to impeach the credibility of Rider. He also presented the testimony of a federal probation officer who testified that he was the probation officer for Gary Keys, Greenberger\u2019s regular driver, and had spoken to Keys in 1983 about a homicide. Keys told the probation officer that he had driven a group of men to a hilly area overlooking the ocean. The men dragged an individual screaming from the limousine, returned later without the individual who had been screaming and one stated, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>Greenberger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Greenberger presented the testimony of Tim Whitehead, who worked for her in the cocaine distribution business. Whitehead described efforts to locate Tally Rogers, who he and Greenberger believed had stolen the cocaine and money from Greenberger\u2019s house. He testified that he and Greenberger were afraid that they would be killed by their cocaine source if they did not find the stolen money and drugs. Greenberger introduced him to Mentzer, Marti and Lowe on April 20. He described phone conversations between Mentzer and Milan Bellachasses, the cocaine supplier in Florida who had threatened to hold Greenberger and Whitehead responsible if they did not find Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Whitehead described going to Memphis on April 23 with Mentzer, Lowe and Marti to look for Rogers. They discussed firebombing Rogers\u2019s house. Mentzer, Marti and Lowe put gasoline into glass jars to carry out the plan, which was eventually abandoned. Whitehead also testified that he went to Mississippi with Lowe to kidnap Rogers\u2019s mother but they abandoned this as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Whitehead testified he was in Miami in early May with Mentzer and Marti and talked with Bellachasses about how to find Rogers. At one point Mentzer stated that they had located Rogers through Radin\u2019s records. Bellachasses told Mentzer and Marti to go to California and talk to Radin.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Greenberger testified in her own behalf. She admitted distributing cocaine for her one-time boyfriend Bellachasses. She described the theft of cocaine and money from her house and her fear that she would be killed by the Colombians who supplied the cocaine to Bellachasses. She testified about efforts to find Tally Rogers and recover the stolen drugs and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Greenberger testified about hiring Mentzer to find Rogers and to furnish security for her. Mentzer brought in Lowe, Marti and Plzak to assist. She described their efforts at Bellachasses\u2019s direction to find Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Greenberger also described how she met Radin and had introduced Rogers to Radin. She testified about meeting Robert Evans and putting Evans and Radin together for the Cotton Club project. She described the negotiations involved in the project and how she anticipated being a partner with Radin. She also described her relationship with Evans who wanted her to work with him in film production.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Greenberger testified that she believed that Radin had been involved in the theft of the money and cocaine. This belief was based upon information she had received from Bellachasses and Mentzer who told her that phone calls to Rogers had been traced to Radin\u2019s hotel room in Beverly Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">She contacted Jonathan Lawson to set up a dinner date with Radin to discuss the movie deal. Bellachasses told her he wanted Mentzer to talk to Radin about what he knew about Rogers. Greenberger testified that she made arrangements to sell her house because she planned to move to New York and work for Evans. She testified that her son\u2019s flight to Florida had been planned as part of a birthday celebration, and she had planned to join him after her meeting with Radin.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">On May 13 Lowe drove her in the limousine to the hotel where Radin was staying. At the hotel she, Lawson and Radin used cocaine. Radin wrote her a check for her role in introducing him to Evans. She testified that she did ask Lawson to pick up something from her car, and Lawson refused. She testified that Mentzer had directed her to do this as a ruse to get Lawson out of the hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Greenberger testified Radin became boisterous and belligerent after they left the hotel. She and Radin were being driven in the limousine by Lowe. She did not know they were being followed. The car suddenly turned off Sunset Boulevard onto a side street, and the two back doors opened simultaneously. Mentzer was there, and he told her to go to her Beverly Hills apartment. She testified that she complied because she was confused and did not know what to think. She saw Mentzer the next day, and he told her that Radin had a gun and had intended to kill her, but that they had killed him first. She then left town, went to Florida and thereafter moved around quite a bit. It was her belief that Bellachasses had hired Mentzer to kidnap Radin.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>III. Declarations Against Interest</p>\n<p id=\"AMS\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\n<em>Statements Made to William Rider</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">William Rider was an acquaintance of Mentzer, Marti and Lowe. Rider was a former police officer and had been in charge of security for his former brother-in-law Larry Flynt in Los Angeles. He had hired Mentzer, Marti and Lowe to work for him between 1979 and 1982. He had also met Greenberger in 1983 in Mentzer\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Statements Made in 1983</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Rider testified about statements Marti and Mentzer made to him in 1983 in which they implicated themselves in the murder of Radin. This testimony was received over objection of each defendant as declarations against interest. Although the subject of objection in the trial court, the admission of these statements is not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Rider testified that he was alone with Mentzer in the first half of 1983 at Flynt\u2019s estate in Bel-Air, and Mentzer said he had \u201cjust done a hit and had dumped the body\u201d in a location Rider and Mentzer had used for target practice, a location consistent with the location in which Radin\u2019s body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Rider testified that he then had a conversation with Marti at Flynt\u2019s estate. He and Marti were alone. He testified that Marti told him that he had shot first and Mentzer second and that \u201cMentzer had to drink a pint of wine because he was afraid or reluctant before they did the hit.\u201d In a subsequent conversation Rider testified, Marti told him that \u201che hated Jews and that he enjoyed shooting the big fat Jew.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Rider also testified that Marti and Mentzer showed him a newspaper article about the discovery of Radin\u2019s body. In a later conversation with Marti and Mentzer, Marti offered to sell Radin\u2019s Rolex watch to Rider. During this conversation Marti referred to Radin as \u201cbig fat Rodan.\u201d Rider also testified that Mentzer, in a conversation outside the presence of Marti, stated that he had used a .22-caliber semiautomatic weapon and that Robert Evans had paid for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>Statements Made in 1988</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Rider was recruited by the police in 1988 to assist in their investigation. He was paid by the police and was also provided security. Rider met with Lowe in Maryland on May 10, 1988, and surreptitiously tape-recorded a conversation with him. Rider met with Mentzer on July 7, 1988, at a hotel in Los Angeles. This conversation was also surreptitiously tape-recorded. Redacted versions of the tape recordings were played, and transcripts were provided to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Some of Lowe\u2019s statements implicated Mentzer, and some of Mentzer\u2019s statements implicated Marti and Lowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The trial court dealt with the admissibility of these statements in various pretrial motions. The issue was one ground for motions to sever on behalf of Mentzer, Marti and Lowe. The People had initially taken the position that redaction of these statements to remove reference to nondeclarant defendants could be accomplished so that the right of confrontation of the nondeclarants would not be compromised and severance would not be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Hearings were conducted and rulings were made on just how the redactions would be implemented. Later, the People changed their position and argued that these statements were admissible against both the declarant and the nondeclarants as declarations against interest. Thereafter, the trial court conducted additional hearings and admitted some of these statements over the objections of the nondeclarant defendants. The trial court concluded that the statements were admissible pursuant to Evidence Code section 1230<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as declarations against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Mentzer, Marti and Lowe each contend that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting these statements because their admission denied the nondeclarant the right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution. They further argue that admission of these statements was contrary to the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bruton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476] and the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265]. They also argue that failure to sever their trial from that of the declarant defendant constituted reversible error. Respondent argues that these statements were properly received as declarations against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The question thus presented is whether the statements of a defendant may be received in a joint trial although they implicate the codefendant if the statements meet the requirements of the hearsay exception for declarations against interest. This requires the answering of subsidiary questions: (a) Does admission of a declaration against interest deny a nondeclarant defendant the right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution? (b) If it does not, is the answer the same if the declarant is a codefendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_E\">1. <em>Confrontation Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause, which is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U. S. 400, 403-405 [85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067-1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923], provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The confrontation clause \u201creflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial . . .\u201d which is accomplished through cross-examination of witnesses. <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 62-63 [100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 65 L.Ed.2d 597].) \u201cIn short, the Clause envisions [^Q \u2018a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness, in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 63-64 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2537-2538], quoting <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1895) 156 U. S. 237, 242-243 [15 S.Ct. 337, 339, 39 L.Ed. 409].)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">However, the Supreme Court has recognized that there are competing interests that justify dispensing with confrontation at trial in certain circumstances and permitting the introduction of hearsay evidence. \u201cSignificantly, every jurisdiction has a strong interest in effective law enforcement, and in the development and precise formulation of the rules of evidence applicable in criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 64 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2538].) The court has accommodated these competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>interests in a process that has \u201cbeen gradual, building on past decisions, drawing on new experience, and responding to changing conditions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The <em>Roberts </em>court recognized the two means by which the confrontation clause restricts the range of admissible hearsay. First, the proponent of the evidence must establish the necessity for the introduction of this evidence. This usually, but not always, means that the declarant is unavailable. Second, the hearsay must have adequate indicia of reliability to justify dispensing with the requirement of confrontation. \u201cThe Court has applied this \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 requirement principally by concluding that certain hearsay exceptions rest upon such solid foundations that admission of virtually any evidence within them comports with the \u2018substance of the constitutional protection.\u2019 . . . [*]\u25a1 . . . Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 66 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2539], citation and fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u201cAdmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d <em>(Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 805, 817 [110 S.Ct. 3139, 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d 638].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In assessing whether hearsay evidence which does not fall within a firmly rooted exception possesses \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement which render the declarant particularly worthy of belief must be examined. \u201cIn other words, if the declarant\u2019s truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility, then the hearsay rule does not bar admission of the statement at trial.\u201d <em>(Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 820 [110 S.Ct. at p. 3149].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">2. <em>Declarations Against Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The hearsay exception for declarations against interest was recognized in California in <em>People </em>v. <em>Spriggs </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 868, 874 [36 Cal.Rptr. 841, 389 P.2d 377]. Although the <em>Spriggs </em>court acknowledged that the majority of jurisdictions did not then permit this exception to the hearsay rule, it reasoned that \u201c. . . a person\u2019s interest against being criminally implicated gives reasonable assurance of the veracity of his statement made against that interest . . .\u201d thereby giving the statement a high degree of trustworthiness justifying its admission in evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 874.) The rule was codified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>section 1230 of the Evidence Code in 1967 with the additional requirement that the declarant be unavailable as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The extent of this hearsay exception was defined in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 441 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296]. The court concluded that, \u201c[i]n the absence of any legislative declaration to the contrary,\u201d not all statements which implicate the declarant are admissible against the nondeclarant. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 441.) Only those statements or portions of statements that are specifically disserving of the penal interest of the declarant were deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible. Statements not specifically disserving were characterized as \u201ccollateral\u201d statements and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The California Supreme Court has recently dealt with the scope of Evidence Code section 1230. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251] defendant Gordon was prosecuted for robbery and murder. Gordon, who had been shot during the commission of the crime, fled with his crime partners across the country. They ultimately arrived in Georgia where they met Dennis Rauch. Rauch assisted Gordon in caring for his wounds. Rauch was subsequently arrested and made a statement which provided very damaging information about Gordon. Rauch was unavailable at the trial, and his statement to the police was presented to the jury as a declaration against his penal interest over Gordon\u2019s hearsay objection. Gordon argued that Rauch\u2019s statement should be characterized as \u201cneutral or exculpatory\u201d and unreliable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1252.) Since Gordon had not asserted in the trial court that admission of Rauch\u2019s statement denied him the right of confrontation, the Supreme Court confined its ruling to the issue of whether the statement constituted a declaration against Rauch\u2019s penal interest. Although the statement not only implicated Rauch as an accessory after the fact but also incriminated Gordon in the robbery and murder, the California Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting the statements. The high court concluded that the circumstances surrounding the statement and its content provided sufficient indicia of reliability for the trial court to admit the statement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1251-1253; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 271, 276 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 594 [114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476] interpreted rule 804(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C.) in much the same fashion as the California Supreme Court interpreted Evidence Code section 1230 in <em>Leach.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court echoed the reasoning of <em>Spriggs, Leach, </em>and <em>Gordon, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>observing that this exception to the hearsay rule is \u201cfounded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true.\u201d <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 599.) However, this reasoning only applies to declarations within a confession that are individually self-incriminatory and not to statements that are collateral to them. \u201cThe fact that a person is making a broadly self-inculpatory confession does not make more credible the confession\u2019s non-selfinculpatory parts. One of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 599-600 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2435].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cThere are many circumstances in which [the] Rule . . . does allow the admission of statements that inculpate a criminal defendant. Even the confessions of arrested accomplices may be admissible if they are truly self-inculpatory, rather than merely attempts to shift blame or curry favor.\u201d <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 603 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2436].)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The court expressly stated that it did not address whether the declaration against interest exception to the hearsay rule was \u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 \u201d for confrontation clause purposes, noting that there is a split in federal circuit courts on this issue. <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 605 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2437].) However, the court did note that \u201cthe very fact that a statement is genuinely self-inculpatory\u2014which our reading of Rule 804(b)(3) requires\u2014is itself one of the \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 that makes a statement admissible under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The parties herein disagree whether the California hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest is firmly rooted. However, this is not a dispute that requires resolution here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   In order for a statement to qualify as a declaration against penal interest the statement must be genuinely and specifically inculpatory of the declarant; this provides the \u201cparticularized guarantee of trustworthiness\" or \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d that permits its admission in evidence without the constitutional requirement of cross-examination. Therefore, the determination that the statement falls within this hearsay exception also satisfies the requirements of the confrontation clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 278 and <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>York </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 933 F.2d 1343, 1361-1363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Mentzer, Marti and Lowe point out that California cases have applied an additional restriction on the admissibility of declarations against penal interest. These cases state that even if the declaration meets the requirements of Evidence Code section 1230, it must be excluded if it \u201cgoes to the heart of the case, if it is \u2018crucial\u2019 or \u2018devastating\u2019 to the defendant[.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coble </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 187, 195 [135 Cal.Rptr. 199]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bullard </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 764, 771 [142 Cal.Rptr. 473]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Claxton </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 638, 666 [181 Cal.Rptr. 281]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frutos </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 979, 986 [205 Cal.Rptr. 204]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 852, 867 [210 Cal.Rptr. 271].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The origin of this limitation is found in <em>Coble\u2019s </em>reference to language in the plurality opinion of <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 74, 86-88 [91 S.Ct. 210, 218-219, 27 L.Ed.2d 213], in which the Supreme Court upheld Georgia\u2019s unusually broad hearsay exception for coconspirator statements. However, the court in <em>Coble </em>misread <em>Dutton </em>in concluding that otherwise admissible hearsay statements are inadmissible if found to be crucial or devastating to the nondeclarant\u2019s case. This was not the holding of <em>Dutton. </em>Further, appellants have cited no federal case holding that this confrontation clause limitation has been imposed in the federal courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, as we discuss <em>post, </em>the federal cases admit such evidence without limitation. Since the <em>Coble </em>restriction on admissibility of evidence is based upon an erroneous assessment of the requirements of the confrontation clause rather than an interpretation of California law relating to hearsay, it runs afoul of Proposition 8 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d)), which mandates, with certain exceptions, the admission of all relevant evidence not otherwise excluded by the United States Constitution. We disapprove the limitation set forth in <em>Coble.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We conclude that admission of a statement possessing sufficient indicia of reliability to fall within the hearsay exception of a declaration against penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>interest does not deny a defendant the right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">3. <em>Joint Trials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The United States Supreme Court concluded in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. at page 125 [88 S.Ct. at page 1622] that admission of extrajudicial statements of a codefendant in a joint trial violated the nondeclarant\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment even though the statement was received only against the declarant. The court reasoned that limiting instructions, while useful in many situations, cannot adequately ensure that the jury will not use this evidence in deciding the case of the nondeclarant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court concluded: \u201cThe unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 136 [88 S.Ct. at p. 1628].) <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 293 [88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100] extended the holding of <em>Bruton </em>to prosecutions under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Appellants argue that <em>Bruton </em>is an absolute bar to introduction of statements of one defendant that implicate another when the defendants are tried jointly. They argue that labeling the declarant\u2019s statement a declaration against interest does not diminish the prejudicial impact on the codefendant which the holding of <em>Bruton </em>was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The trial court took the opposite position when it concluded that the statements complained of were admissible as declarations against interest. Respondent, relying upon the trial court\u2019s ruling that the statements were properly admissible, argues that there was no violation of the nondeclarant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">A careful reading of <em>Bruton </em>and its progeny reflects a body of law which has dealt with the use of limiting instructions to prevent inadmissible and highly prejudicial evidence from infecting the case of the jointly tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>codefendant. <em>Bruton </em>does not stand for the proposition that all statements of one defendant that implicate another may not be introduced against all defendants in a joint trial. The <em>Bruton </em>opinion itself stated that the offending hearsay statement in that case was clearly inadmissible against the nondeclarant under traditional rules of evidence, and that there was no recognized exception to the hearsay rule for its admission. The court went on to state that \u201cwe intimate no view whatever that such exceptions necessarily raise questions under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 128, fn. 3 [88 S.Ct. at p. 1628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 530 [106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514] the court dealt with confessions made by each defendant implicating the other and used as substantive evidence against both tried jointly. The court observed that \u201c. . . this is not strictly speaking a <em>Bruton </em>case because we are not here concerned with the effectiveness of limiting instructions in preventing spill-over prejudice^]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 542 [106 S.Ct. at page 2063].) The court concluded that, although such confessions were presumed to be unreliable, the presumption could be rebutted if the confession is shown to have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 543 [106 S.Ct. at page 2063].) The dissenting opinion of Justice Blackmun pointed out that \u201c[t]he <em>Bruton </em>rule thus necessarily applies only to situations in which the out-of-court statements are constitutionally inadmissible against the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552, fn. 5 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2064]; see also, <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>York, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 1362, fn. 3 [\u201cBruton only prohibits the use of an inculpatory hearsay statement against an accused when the jurisdiction\u2019s rules of evidence do not permit that statement to be introduced into evidence against the accused.

This is not to say that all statements which incriminate the declarant and implicate the codefendant are admissible. Any such statement must satisfy the statutory definition of a declaration against interest and likewise satisfy the constitutional requirement of trustworthiness. This necessarily requires a \u201cfact-intensive inquiry, which would require careful examination of all the circumstances surrounding the criminal activity involved; . . .\u201d <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 604 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2437].) There is nothing in <em>Bruton </em>which prohibits introduction of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The court in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(7th Cir. 1994) 19 F.3d 350, came to the same conclusion. The court determined that admission of one defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements implicating himself and the codefendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>violate the codefendant\u2019s right of confrontation so long as the declaration met the requirements of F.R.E. rule 804(b)(3). The <em>Hamilton </em>case was a federal prosecution for bank robbery. Hamilton and Miller were tried jointly. Miller contended that the trial court had admitted evidence that violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The evidence complained of consisted of statements Hamilton had made to a cellmate while awaiting trial in which he provided a detailed account of how he and Miller had committed the charged robbery. The <em>Hamilton </em>court concluded that <em>Bruton </em>was not a barrier to admission of this hearsay evidence so long as the evidence was admissible under F.R.E. rule 804(b)(3). The statements were then analyzed and determined to be admissible. (19 F.3d at pp. 354-357; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Curry </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 977 F.2d 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(2d Cir. 1994) 20 F.3d 538 the court came to a similar conclusion. Matthews and Prater were tried jointly for bank robbery. Prater\u2019s extrajudicial statements to his girlfriend were admitted over Matthews\u2019s Sixth Amendment objections that such evidence denied him his right of confrontation. As in <em>Hamilton </em>the statement consisted of a detailed account of how Prater and Matthews had committed the robbery. The court concluded: \u201cGiven the totality of the circumstances as to the content and context of Prater\u2019s statements, we conclude that those statements had sufficient \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 that their admission against Matthews did not violate Mathews\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 546.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Sasso </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 59 F.3d 341, a federal firearms prosecution, Sasso and Armienti were tried jointly. Armienti made prearrest statements to his girlfriend which implicated Sasso and himself. The court explained that examination of the circumstances of the statement must be undertaken to determine whether the portions implicating the nondeclarant were reliable. Upon such an examination the statements, as in <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Hamilton, </em>were found to be reliable, admissible and nonviolative of the nondeclarant\u2019s right of confrontation. The court recognized it had decided <em>Matthews </em>before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williamson, </em>but concluded that the views expressed in both are consistent. The court observed that <em>Matthews </em>stressed the need to examine the statement in question to determine whether there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness surrounding the statement, such as no effort to shift responsibility, and not mere reliance upon the fact that portions of the statement that incriminated the nondeclarant were in close proximity to statements inculpatory of the declarant. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Sasso, supra, </em>59 F.3d at pp. 348-350; see also <em>Earnest </em>v. <em>Dorsey </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 87 F.3d 1123, 1130-1134, cert. den. _ U.S. _ [117 S.Ct 527, 136 L.Ed.2d 414].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The cases cited by appellants are not persuasive. Indeed, the case of <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(5th Cir. 1993) 985 F.2d 770 supports respondent\u2019s position. In <em>Flores, </em>the government had offered against both defendants the postarrest grand jury testimony of one defendant. The court concluded that such evidence, because of the strong possibility that the declarant would shift blame or curry favor, was inherently unreliable and inadmissible. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 777-780.) However, the court went on to say that \u201ceven generally objectionable statements in which the declarant adversely implicates not only his own penal interest but also that of another may be made under circumstances that both suggest reliability and do not seriously invade the intended protections of the Confrontation Clause, such as statements made to a personal acquaintance in a noninvestigatory context where the setting suggests no motive to speak falsely. . . . Such statements might well fall [within] the <em>Lee </em>category of those shown to have \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 780, quoting <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Marti also cites <em>United States </em>v. <em>Battiste </em>(N.D.

However, cases decided in that circuit after <em>Battiste, </em>such as <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>continue to support admission of such evidence. We find the reasoning of <em>Matthews, Hamilton, Sasso, Gordon </em>and <em>Wilson </em>persuasive. The balance of the authority cited by appellants addresses the issue of trustworthiness which is an individualized inquiry intimately related to the facts of each case. As appropriate, these cases will be discussed, <em>post, </em>in relation to the analysis of the circumstances of the statements herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We therefore conclude that a declaration against interest may be admitted in a joint trial so long as the statement satisfies the statutory definition and otherwise satisfies the constitutional requirement of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">4. <em>Were the Statements Declarations Against Interest and Trustworthy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">There is no litmus test for the determination of whether a statement is trustworthy and falls within the declaration against interest exception. The trial court must look to the totality of the circumstances in which the statement was made, whether the declarant spoke from personal knowledge, the possible motivation of the declarant, what was actually said by the declarant and anything else relevant to the inquiry. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 730, 745 [280 Cal.Rptr. 440, 808 P.2d 1197]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 607 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635]; <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, supra, </em>400 U.S. at pp. 88-89 [91 S.Ct. at p. 219]; <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 819 [110 S.Ct. at pp. 3148-3149]; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. 594, 601 [114 S.Ct. 2431, 2435. ].)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Clearly the least reliable circumstance is one in which the declarant has been arrested and attempts to improve his situation with the police by deflecting criminal responsibility onto others. \u201cOnce partners in crime recognize that the \u2018jig is up,\u2019 they tend to lose any identity of interest and immediately become antagonists, rather than accomplices.\u201d <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 544 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2064].) However, the most reliable circumstance is one in which the conversation occurs between friends in a noncoercive setting that fosters uninhibited disclosures. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>985 F.2d at p. 780; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Matthews, supra, </em>20 F.3d at p. 546; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Sasso, supra, </em>59 F.3d at p. 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">When examining what was actually said by the declarant special attention must be paid to any statements that tend to inculpate the nondeclarant. This is so because a statement\u2019s content is most reliable in that portion which inculpates the declarant. It is least reliable in that portion which shifts responsibility. Controversy necessarily arises when the declarant makes statements which are self-inculpatory as well as inculpatory of another. This is why Evidence Code section 1230 only permits an exception to the hearsay rule for statements that are specifically disserving of the declarant\u2019s penal interest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 441.) This is not to say that a statement that incriminates the declarant and also inculpates the nondeclarant cannot be specifically disserving of the declarant\u2019s penal interest. Such a determination necessarily depends upon a careful analysis of what was said and the totality of the circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 276 [\u201cThe fact that the statement is also disserving to [nondeclarant] does not render the statement unreliable and inadmissible. . . .\u201d]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Sasso, supra, </em>59 F.3d at 349; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 1252-1253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Determination of whether a statement is trustworthy is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings we apply the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 1250-1253.) \u201cThe decision whether trustworthiness is present requires the court to apply to the peculiar facts of the individual case a broad and deep acquaintance with the ways human beings actually conduct themselves in the circumstances material under the exception. Such an endeavor allows, in fact demands, the exercise of discretion. Of course, we review the specific determinations underlying the court\u2019s ruling under the standards appropriate thereto.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1251.) \u201cIt follows that a determination whether the declaration is indeed against interest should itself be reviewed for abuse of discretion: that issue goes to the core of the question of basic trustworthiness, and hence must be deemed entrusted to the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1252.) (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Monaco </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 735 F.2d 1173, 1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In determining the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, consideration of corroborating evidence is inappropriate since that would constitute \u201cbootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial.\u201d <em>(Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 823 [110 S.Ct. at p. 3150].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The trial court conducted extensive hearings to determine whether the statements herein would be admissible. The court stated its understanding of the need to examine the circumstances and context in which the statements were made as well as their content. In addition to the tapes and their transcripts the court considered the preliminary hearing transcripts. Portions of the statements were excluded on various grounds, including lack of reliability, absence of personal knowledge of the declarant, and the fact that they were not specifically disserving of the declarant\u2019s interest. Some were excluded as cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It is not disputed that Mentzer and Lowe were unavailable as witnesses to both the prosecution and to the nondeclarant defendants. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">a. <em>Lowe-Rider Statements About </em>Mentzer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The conversation in 1988 between Lowe and Rider contained references to Mentzer (Bill). Mentzer contends that the circumstances of that conversation make any references to him unreliable. The conversation occurred in a bar. Both Lowe and Rider had been drinking. Mentzer argues that Lowe was intoxicated. Mentzer also argues that Lowe was motivated by a desire to impress Rider. These were all factors the trial court considered and rejected. Mentzer also contends that evidence presented during Lowe\u2019s defense established that Lowe had a habit of exaggeration. However, respondent correctly points out that this evidence was not presented to the trial court prior to the time the court ruled on the admissibility of the statement and the statement was received in evidence. Since Mentzer failed to raise this issue in the trial court, he is foreclosed from doing so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The specific statements Mentzer objects to are: \u201cAnd - you know what? Have you been with Bill on a - on a - homicide? . . . Have you been with Bill on a homicide? You have not. The mother fucker gets drunk. . . . Oh, I\u2019m not saying who it was, I\u2019m just saying the fucker gears himself up to get the balls to do it. And that ain\u2019t. . . . Friday the 13th they shot him 13 times.\u201d These statements were made shortly before Lowe acknowledged that he drove the car during the Radin kidnapping and described how he had been compensated for his participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Mentzer argues that Lowe\u2019s statements were not specifically disserving of Lowe\u2019s penal interest since Lowe initially denied his involvement to Rider and then indicated he only drove the car and had been paid. Mentzer argues that references which inculpated him were collateral to anything incriminating of Lowe and should have been excluded by the trial court. Respondent argues that the statement must be viewed in context, and that what Lowe said disclosed that he had been paid for driving the car involved in the murder and that he was present at the murder scene with Mentzer, all highly self-incriminating declarations. Respondent contends that Lowe\u2019s reference to Mentzer was merely part of this self-incriminating statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The trial court considered the circumstances of the conversation between Lowe and Rider and each of the statements uttered by Lowe. The trial court stated: \u201cI think that based on the totality of the evidence now before me. ... I think this is the type of situation where considering the relationship between the parties, the circumstances of the discussion, and the context of the statements I do think it\u2019s reliable and I don\u2019t find anything about the drinking that made it unreliable. If anything, [szc] probably talked more loosely than he otherwise would have. And there are indications at times these [sz'c] actually happened. For example, there is at least one occasion where he initially denies involvement and then proceeds to admit. So, I think based on the totality of what I have before me I do find that it is trustworthy and reliable.\u201d It is also clear from the record that the trial court was fully aware of the requirement that such statements must be specifically disserving of the declarant to qualify under Evidence Code section 1230 as declarations against penal interest when it ruled the statements admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that at the time Lowe made the statements about having \u201cbeen with Bill on a homicide\u201d and \u201cthey shot him 13 times\u201d and describing how he had been paid for driving the car, the statements were specifically disserving of Lowe\u2019s penal interest because they subjected Lowe to the risk of criminal liability to such an extent that a reasonable person in his position would not have made them unless he believed them to be true. We also find the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the circumstances of the conversation provided sufficient indicia of reliability to ensure that the statements were trustworthy. We find no abuse of discretion in admitting the portion of Lowe\u2019s statement which implicated Mentzer. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 1252-1253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">b. <em>The Mentzer-Rider Conversations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The conversations between Mentzer and Rider in 1988 contained references to both Marti (Alex) and Lowe (Bob). Marti and Lowe argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the circumstances of the conversations do not support the trial court\u2019s finding that the statements in question were trustworthy. They contend that Mentzer was motivated to agree with whatever Rider said because he wanted to work for Rider. Marti and Lowe argue that the only way they could have explored this issue would have been to cross-examine Mentzer, who was unavailable as a witness. Lowe also argues in his written brief that the conversation was \u201credolent with classic male-to-male \u2018stag\u2019 talk, i.e., \u2018B.S.\u2019 which was [and is] notoriously unreliable and untrustworthy.\u201d Lowe\u2019s counsel conceded to the trial court that Mentzer did not know that Rider was actually working as a police undercover operative when these conversations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">During the hearing relating to admissibility of these statements the trial court stressed that it considered the entire circumstances of the conversation. The court observed that Mentzer regarded Rider as a friend and that the conversation occurred in a noncoercive atmosphere. The trial court contrasted this situation with that in which an arrestee attempts to shift responsibility to another and curry favor with the police. The trial court found sufficient indicia of reliability in the totality of the circumstances to conclude that the statements were trustworthy. In addition to evaluating the circumstances of the conversations, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether statements that implicated Lowe and Marti were admissible as declarations against Mentzer\u2019s penal interest. Each statement was discussed in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">c. <em>Mentzer-Rider Statements About </em>Marti<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Marti contends that the trial court erred in admitting anything said by Rider or Mentzer. He further argues that the trial court\u2019s rulings deprived him of his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Marti argues that there was no evidentiary basis for admission of Rider\u2019s statements. He contends that Rider\u2019s statements were received as adoptive admissions of Mentzer, and since Mentzer had no interest in disavowing incriminating references Rider made about Marti those references constituted inadmissible hearsay as to Marti. He argues that the rationale for the hearsay exception for adoptive admissions only extends to matters a person would reasonably be expected to deny if untrue, but such expectation does not exist in regard to assertions of another\u2019s wrongdoing. Respondent argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that Rider\u2019s statements were received simply to show those things that were said to Mentzer which elicited Mentzer\u2019s responses. Respondent argues it is Mentzer\u2019s responses which were properly received in evidence as declarations against Mentzer\u2019s interest and that the jury clearly understood Rider\u2019s role as an undercover operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">When this objection was raised in the trial court, the court ruled that Rider\u2019s statements actually became Mentzer\u2019s to the extent that Mentzer\u2019s answers adopted what Rider said. The trial court went on to conclude that the express statements made by Mentzer and those in which he endorsed what Rider stated constituted declarations against Mentzer\u2019s penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">When viewed in context the statements made by Rider did elicit responses by Mentzer. In our review of the transcript of these conversations it is clear that Mentzer agreed with some things said by Rider and disagreed with others.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, the statements made by Rider to which Marti assigns error were principally a repetition of matters about which Rider had already testified. For example, Rider testified that Marti told him in 1983 that he had shot first and Mentzer second and that Mentzer had to drink a pint of wine before the \u201chit\u201d because Mentzer was afraid. During the 1988 tape-recorded conversation, Rider repeated this statement and elicited Mentzer\u2019s response, \u201cYou know what? Alex was scared shitless of me and he fuckin\u2019 better be. . . . Well we drank a little wine before that. Alex even drank a bunch of wine. We drank\u2014we drank a whole bottle. . . . No, you know what? You know Alex is full of shit. I\u2019m the one who set the whole thing up.\u201d The trial court concluded that Mentzer\u2019s responses were declarations against Mentzer\u2019s penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We agree with respondent that the potential for jury confusion regarding the use to be made of Rider\u2019s statements in the 1988 tape was nonexistent. It was clear that Rider\u2019s statements could be considered only as efforts to elicit responses from Mentzer. Rider had already been extensively cross-examined about what Marti had told him and he was available for further examination had Marti chosen to recall him. What Rider said on the tape is the functional equivalent of Rider testifying, had he been asked, about what he had said to Mentzer. We find no error in the admission of Rider\u2019s statements for the purpose for which they were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Marti next complains that Mentzer\u2019s statement, \u201cAlex was scared shitless of me and he fuckin\u2019 better be,\u201d is not disserving of Mentzer\u2019s penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>interest. Marti further argues that all portions of Mentzer\u2019s statements that referred to him were not specifically disserving of Mentzer\u2019s interest and were hearsay and violations of his right of confrontation. He specifically complains that those portions in which Mentzer described what occurred in the car with Radin were not specifically disserving of Mentzer\u2019s penal interest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The trial court ruled otherwise. The court considered Mentzer\u2019s entire statement which included the remark: \u201cAlex is full of shit. I\u2019m the one who set the whole goddamn thing up.\u201d This was followed by Mentzer\u2019s description of the events in the car with Radin, Marti and Lowe. In ruling on Marti\u2019s objections the trial court stated that \u201cunlike a lot of the comments in declarations against penal interest cases where someone incriminates a codefendant, here these two particular statements show clearly that Mentzer is a co-conspirator, aider and abettor. At least the first statement clearly shows that he is taking responsibility for this as the one who set it up. And then the other one clearly shows him acting with Mr. Marti and aiding and abetting while Marti is holding the gun on Radin in this thing. . . . What I am saying is that where Mentzer . . . specifically . . . realizejd] that . . . he set the whole thing up . . . that shows the prerequisite component of a declaration against penal interest; that the person realizes it is disserving. That is where the reliability comes from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Mentzer\u2019s references to Marti were an integral part of the statement in which he implicated himself in planning and participating in the kidnapping and murder of Radin. The trial court correctly concluded that Mentzer\u2019s statement subjected him to criminal liability to such an extent that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statements unless he believed them to be true. As discussed <em>ante, </em>the trial court also concluded that the totality of the circumstances of the Mentzer-Rider conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>provided sufficient indicia of reliability to guarantee the trustworthiness of Mentzer\u2019s statement. Applying the abuse of discretion standard of review as we are required to do, we are satisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in arriving at these conclusions and in admitting the portion of the statement which referred to defendant Marti.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">d. <em>Mentzer-Rider Statements About Lowe</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Lowe argues that Mentzer\u2019s statements about him were not declarations against Mentzer\u2019s penal interest and violated his right of confrontation. Respondent argues that the statements were disserving of Mentzer\u2019s penal interest in that they implicated Mentzer as the person who planned the killing of Radin and who participated in the kidnapping and murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The trial court stated its ruling as follows: \u201cI think in the totality of it if you\u2019re talking about the driver and kidnapping, Mr. Mentzer talked about setting the whole thing up, and I think what the driver did is disserving to Mr. Mentzer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This was part of the same conversation, <em>ante, </em>in which Mentzer stated he was the person who set up the \u201cwhole goddamn thing\u201d and then described what happened in the car. There does not appear to be any role shifting or effort to minimize his involvement. There was ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s rulings that the portion of Mentzer\u2019s statement which referred to Lowe was specifically disserving of Mentzer\u2019s penal interest and also that the totality of the circumstances guaranteed its trustworthiness. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in arriving at these conclusions and in admitting the portion of the statement which referred to Lowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">5. <em>No Violation of Right of Confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We are satisfied that the trial court conducted the \u201cfact-intensive inquiry\u201d suggested in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>512 U.S. at page 604 [114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>S.Ct. at page 2437] as to defendants Mentzer, Marti and Lowe. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the statements in question were specifically disserving of the declarants\u2019 penal interest and were made in circumstances which provided particularized guarantees of trustworthiness as required by the Sixth Amendment. Admission of these statements, therefore, did not deprive the nondeclarants of their right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">6. <em>Denial of Motion to Sever on Aranda-Bruton Grounds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Lowe and Marti argue that their case should have been severed from Mentzer\u2019s, and Mentzer argues his case should have been severed from Lowe\u2019s. These defendants cite <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518. They argue that the denial of their right of confrontation caused by introduction of statements of their codefendants would not have occurred had the trial court granted their pretrial motions to sever. However, we have determined that they were not denied their right of confrontation. Therefore, no error occurred in denial of their motions to sever. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>19 F.3d at pp. 357-358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">IV. Other Severance-related Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Defendants Greenberger, Mentzer and Lowe contend that the trial court committed reversible error by not severing Greenberger\u2019s case from the other defendants. Greenberger argues that her defense was antagonistic to the defense of her codefendants and failure to sever resulted in prejudice to her which would not have occurred had there been a severance. The argument of Mentzer and Lowe mirrors Greenberger\u2019s in contending that failure to sever their case from Greenberger\u2019s resulted in the introduction of evidence during her defense which inculpated them, and this could not have occurred had there been a severance. Defendant Marti contends that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to sever his case from Mentzer\u2019s. Greenberger, Marti and Lowe further argue that their defense was unfairly and prejudicially hampered by trial court rulings limiting their introduction of evidence. They argue that this evidence would have been received had their case been severed from Mentzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Respondent argues that the trial court did not err in denying severance motions of Greenberger and Lowe, and that Mentzer and Marti did not raise the issue in the trial court and are therefore foreclosed from raising it here. Respondent further argues that if there was error it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"Axf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Section 1098 provides: \u201cWhen two or more defendants are jointly charged with any public offense, whether felony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court order separate trials. . . .\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyde </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 212, 231-232 [250 Cal.Rptr. 83, 758 P.2d 25] the Supreme Court recognized that this section was the Legislature\u2019s expression of preference for joint trials.  \u201cThe statute nevertheless permits the trial court to order separate trials, and the decision to do so is one \u2018largely within the discretion of the trial court.\u2019 [Citations.] Whether denial of a motion to sever constitutes an abuse of discretion must be decided on the facts as they appear at the time of the hearing on the motion to sever.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">\u201cAfter trial, of course, the reviewing court may nevertheless reverse a conviction where, because of the consolidation, a gross unfairness has occurred such as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial or due process of law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302, 313 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669].) The appellate court looks \u201cto the evidence actually introduced at trial\u201d in making this latter determination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 940 [251 Cal.Rptr. 467, 760 P.2d 996].) In such an analysis the Supreme Court has stated: \u201cWe do not believe that we should reverse a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate trial. Although we recognize the importance of the preservation of the procedural safeguard of a separate trial, the Legislature has decreed joint trials to be the rule and separate trials the exception. . . . We must weigh the prejudicial impact of all of the significant effects that may reasonably be assumed to have stemmed from the erroneous denial of a separate trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899, 922-923 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Thus there are two levels of review when a defendant alleges prejudicial error in the denial of a motion to sever. The first level of review determines whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion. If it is concluded that there was no abuse of discretion, the next level of review determines whether the failure to sever resulted in gross unfairness which denied the defendant a fair trial or due process. The first level of review focuses on what was presented to the trial court at the time it made its decision. The second level of review focuses on what actually happened in the joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie, supra, 66 </em>Cal.2d at pages 922-923 the Supreme Court established guidelines for the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. The court concluded that the trial court \u201cshould separate the trials of codefendants in the face of an incriminating confession, prejudicial association with codefendants, likely confusion resulting from evidence on multiple counts, conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>defenses, or the possibility that at a separate trial a codefendant would give exonerating testimony.\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 916-917, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The Supreme Court has characterized a trial in which the defendants are charged with common crimes against common victims as the classic situation for joint trials. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 312; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 168 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781].) In <em>Turner </em>the defendant argued that his defense would conflict with that of the codefendant, allowing the People to sit back and watch the defendants become adversaries. The court observed that \u201c. . . if that point has merit, separate trials would appear to be mandatory in almost every case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 313.) The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyde, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 212, 232 observed: \u201cAlthough several California decisions have stated that the existence of conflicting defenses may compel severance of codefendants\u2019 trials, none has found an abuse of discretion or reversed a conviction on this basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Supreme Court, recognizing that few California cases have discussed what constitutes an \u201cantagonistic defense,\u201d referred to federal authority and concluded that the concept is construed very narrowly. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 168.) \u201c \u2018[M]utual antagonism\u2019 only exists where the acceptance of one party\u2019s defense will preclude the acquittal of the other.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ziperstein </em>(7th Cir. 1979) 601 F.2d 281, 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The trial court conducted a pretrial hearing on August 24, 1990, and denied all motions to sever. In so doing the court stated: \u201cI have to rule right now based on what I have before me, not what may take place in the future. ... I find this is not a case that severance is required because of inconsistent defenses. . . . this isn\u2019t a case where there are substantial gaps in the People\u2019s evidence. . . . I\u2019ve read the entire preliminary hearing transcript and I\u2019ve read the declarations filed <em>in camera, </em>and this is not a situation where substantial gaps are going to be supplied by the defense . . . the declarations that I have by the three defendants\u2019 counsel indicate a situation where the prosecution isn\u2019t going to sit back and just let these defendant\u2019s [sic] testify. ... It is not a matter of the People proving elements of the case through the defense. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As discussed separately as to each defendant, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions to sever, and that there is no reasonable probability that any of the defendants would have obtained a more favorable result had severance been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8J\">1. <em>Greenberger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In support of her motion to sever Greenberger argued that her defense was irreconcilable at its core with the defense of Mentzer, Marti and Lowe.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> She argued that her defense consisted of proving that her codefendants kidnapped and murdered Radin and their defense consisted of proving that they had nothing to do with it. As quoted ante, the trial court, basing its ruling on the information then available to it, denied her motion as well as the motions of the codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Greenberger renewed her motion to sever at various times during the trial. Each time the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Greenberger does not contend that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion to sever. She contends that \u201cit would be a waste of judicial economy to argue the issue from the pretrial stance.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She addresses the second level of review, discussed <em>ante, </em>that failure to sever resulted in gross unfairness which denied her a fair trial or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">We then turn to Greenberger\u2019s arguments that evidence offered by the codefendants was improperly admitted, undermining her defense, and evidence she offered was improperly excluded to protect the codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Greenberger\u2019s defense consisted of evidence offered to prove that she did not have knowledge of the plan to kidnap or kill Radin. She testified that all she knew was that Mentzer, at the direction of Bellachasses, was going to talk to Radin about the thefts. She now argues that the attack on her defense by the codefendants would not have occurred had there been a severance. Specifically she points to Marti\u2019s cross-examination of witnesses which was designed to attack her character, such as references to her drug use and drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>trafficking, spending habits, sex life and parenting skills. A review of the record satisfies us that she suffered no prejudice in this regard. Some of the evidence about which she complains was received without objection. Some evidence was properly received during the People\u2019s case-in-chief. Some was properly received in rebuttal to evidence introduced on her behalf. Some was excluded by the trial court upon timely objection of her counsel. Although some questions might not have been asked had there been a severance, we conclude that the questioning did not result in gross unfairness, denial of a fair trial or denial of due process. Much of the evidence she complains of concerned trivial matters with no potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Greenberger also argues that certain evidence was improperly excluded. The only example she provides is the trial court exclusion of her offer of evidence that Mentzer and Bellachasses had a drug-dealing relationship which did not involve her. She contends this evidence would have supported her theory that Mentzer and Bellachasses planned to kill Radin without her participation. However, the record reflects that Greenberger\u2019s offer of proof to the trial court was much different. Her counsel argued that Mentzer\u2019s admission of dealing cocaine for Bellachasses after Radin\u2019s death would show that Lowe had acquired the Cadillac (referred to in Lowe\u2019s conversation with Rider) because of Lowe\u2019s involvement in cocaine trafficking with Mentzer and Bellachasses rather than as payment to Lowe for his involvement in the Radin murder. Counsel\u2019s trial court argument on this issue does not support the argument Greenberger makes here. Based on this record the trial court properly exercised its discretion pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 in concluding that the prejudicial impact greatly outweighed the probative value of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We conclude that these evidentiary rulings did not result in any prejudice to Greenberger and did not deprive her of a fair trial or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">2. <em>Greenberger\u2019s Proposed Comment on Mentzer\u2019s Decision Not to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">During discussion of jury instructions counsel for Mentzer and Lowe requested that the trial court order counsel for Marti and Greenberger not to comment on the fact that Mentzer and Lowe did not testify. Counsel for Mentzer argued any such comment would violate his client\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The trial court ordered all counsel not to make any reference to the fact that Mentzer and Lowe did not testify. Greenberger and Marti then moved for a severance which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Greenberger, joined by Marti,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by refusing to permit comment on Mentzer\u2019s decision not to testify. She argues that Mentzer\u2019s failure to testify in the face of overwhelming evidence demonstrated his consciousness of guilt. Relying on <em>De Luna </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1962) 308 F.2d 140, as she did in the trial court, Greenberger contends that refusal to permit her to refer in closing argument to Mentzer\u2019s decision not to testify benefited Mentzer at her expense and denied her due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Respondent argues that the trial court properly ordered counsel not to comment in any way on Mentzer\u2019s decision not to testify. Respondent cites established authority which states that comment by an attorney representing one defendant on the silence of a codefendant violates the codefendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 157; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 237, 243-244 [88 Cal.Rptr. 871]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 887 F.2d 988, 997; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Mena </em>(11th Cir. 1989) 863 F.2d 1522, 1533-1534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Greenberger contends, however, that this argument fails to address the impact of the trial court\u2019s restriction on her. She argues that the trial court should have either allowed comment or granted a severance. She finds support for this position in dictum in the majority opinion in <em>De Luna </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>308 F.2d at page 141: \u201cIf an attorney\u2019s duty to his client should require him to draw the jury\u2019s attention to the possible inference of guilt from a codefendant\u2019s silence, the trial judge\u2019s duty is to order that the defendants be tried separately.\u201d (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Echeles </em>(7th Cir. 1965) 352 F.2d 892, 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We are not persuaded by Greenberger\u2019s argument. We find that neither Greenberger nor Marti would have benefited from counsel\u2019s comment on the codefendants\u2019 failure to testify. Further, the prospect of severance whenever a defendant elects to offer such comment would provide an easy but unacceptable mechanism for defeating the statutory preference for joint trials.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McClure </em>(10th Cir. 1984) 734 F.2d 484, 491 [\u201cGreat amounts of legal and judicial resources have been spent distinguishing numerous cases from the <em>DeLuna </em>dictum. Again, no decision of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>we are aware, including <em>DeLuna, </em>has ever ordered a severance on the basis of the <em>DeLuna </em>rationale. [*]]] We reject the dictum of the <em>DeLuna </em>majority and today hold that under no circumstances can it be said that a defendant\u2019s attorney is obligated to comment upon a codefendant\u2019s failure to testify- \u2022\u2022\u2022 HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Should a defendant seek to lay blame upon a nontestifying codefendant, he can always take the stand and testify against him. Such testimony would be entitled to great probative value; a jury\u2019s decision resting upon this evidence would, in our view, rise to a fairer level than one influenced by self-serving implications drawn by an attorney regarding a codefendant\u2019s silence.\u201d (Fn. omitted); see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Causey </em>(6th Cir. 1987) 834 F.2d 1277, 1287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">We are satisfied that the trial court correctly ruled that no comment would be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">3. <em>Marti</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Defendant Marti contends that failure to sever his case from Mentzer\u2019s denied him a fair trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On appeal Marti primarily addresses the issue of severance from the perspective of <em>Aranda-Bruton </em>error and denial of his right of confrontation, which we have rejected <em>ante. </em>He also contends that the People would have been required to call Mentzer as a witness in a separate trial instead of presenting Mentzer\u2019s declarations against interest. He would then have had the opportunity to cross-examine Mentzer. This argument is based upon the assumption that Mentzer would have been available as a witness in a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Respondent contends that Marti never sought severance in the trial court on this specific ground. Respondent correctly argues that <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitcham </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1027, 1049 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 230, 824 P.2d 1277] forecloses appellate review of a challenge to a trial court\u2019s rulings if a defendant did not present the trial court with the argument advanced on appeal. The record supports Marti\u2019s position, however, that he did present the trial court with the argument that failure to sever would deny him his right to cross-examine Mentzer. We find this was sufficient to preserve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">However, there is no basis for concluding that Mentzer would have been available as a witness had there been a severance. Had his trial proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>first, and had he been convicted, Mentzer would still have had his Fifth Amendment rights during the trial of the other charges which had been severed as well as throughout the entire appellate process. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 504, 515 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 312]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1021 [168 Cal.Rptr. 378].) Further, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine which trial would proceed first. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 102.) There is no reason to believe that Mentzer\u2019s trial would have preceded Marti\u2019s. Marti has also failed to show that the People would not have been able to introduce Mentzer\u2019s declarations against interest in Marti\u2019s separate trial had the trial court granted his motion to sever. Thus Marti has failed to show that he suffered prejudice from the trial court\u2019s failure to sever on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">4. <em>Evidence Offered by Marti to Impeach Rider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The balance of Marti\u2019s argument relates to his contention that failure to sever his case from Mentzer\u2019s resulted in evidentiary rulings which protected Mentzer\u2019s rights at Marti\u2019s expense by foreclosing Marti\u2019s impeachment of Mentzer and Rider. The court conducted a hearing on February 20, 1991, concerning the prosecution\u2019s motion to limit cross-examination of witness William Rider. Marti, joined by Mentzer,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> contends that the trial court committed reversible error at this hearing by rulings it made pursuant to Evidence Code section 352<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which precluded significant cross-examination of Rider. Marti contends that Rider was the key prosecution witness, and the trial court\u2019s rulings prevented him from accurately portraying Rider as Mentzer\u2019s accomplice and a person of bad character. Marti further contends the People were permitted to portray Rider falsely to the jury as a former police officer who voluntarily assisted in the Radin murder investigation as a good citizen. Marti contends that these rulings violated his right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The confrontation clause guarantees the defendant in a criminal prosecution the right of cross-examination, which includes exploration of bias. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 308 [94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347].) \u201cIt does not follow, of course, that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Amendment prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness. On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>(Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673, 679 [106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1091 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619].) Exclusion of impeaching evidence oil collateral matters which has only slight probative value on the issue of veracity does not infringe on the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 372 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The determination whether a defendant has been denied the right of confrontation is focused on the individual witness. The standard for determining if a confrontation clause violation has occurred is whether a reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019s credibility had the defendant been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination. <em>(Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 680 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 1435-1436].) If it is determined that trial court rulings limiting cross-examination of a witness have denied the defendant his right of confrontation, the error is subject to harmless-error analysis. \u201cThe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 684 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1438]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 750-751 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1989) 45 Cal.3d 744, 780-781 [248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Certain rulings about which Marti complains related to the murder of June Mincher, a crime with which only Mentzer and Lowe were charged. Those charges had been severed from the charges relating to the death of Radin and were not before the jury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Specifically Marti complains that although evidence was admitted to show that Rider was aware that Mentzer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>had been involved in Radin\u2019s murder and Rider thereafter loaned a .22-caliber pistol with silencer to Mentzer, Marti was not permitted to show that the gun was then used to murder June Mincher. Further, although the jury was informed that Rider did not turn the weapon over to authorities until one year after he was contacted by the police regarding Radin\u2019s murder, Marti was not allowed to prove that Rider failed to disclose to the police that he believed his gun had been used to kill Mincher.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Marti argues that the excluded evidence would have been helpful in establishing his theory that Rider was an accomplice in both the Radin and Mincher murders. He contends this theory was supported by evidence that Rider\u2019s gun could not be eliminated by firearms examiners as the weapon that killed Radin. He argues that, had Rider been viewed by the jury as an accomplice, Rider\u2019s testimony would have required corroboration, and the only corroboration connecting him to the murder of Radin was the questionable testimony of Estanislau Kreutzer. The trial court concluded that the proffered evidence was cumulative, and its admission would not have created a significantly different impression of Rider\u2019s credibility, although it did have the potential of prejudice to Mentzer.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Marti contends that this was an improper use of Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The application of Evidence Code section 352 is not limited to a conflict between opposing sides but may also apply to parties on the same side of litigation when they have adverse positions relative to the introduction of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1989) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1007, at fn. 10 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017].) The rule is the same whether the party objecting to introduction of evidence is the prosecution or a codefendant. However, in a joint criminal trial, if admission of evidence of significant probative value to one defendant would be substantially prejudicial to a codefendant the remedy is not exclusion of the evidence but rather a limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>instruction or severance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeder </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 543 , 553 [147 Cal.Rptr. 275].) In such a situation \u201cEvidence Code section 352 must bow to the due process right of a defendant to a fair trial and to his right to present all relevant evidence of significant probative value to his defense. ... ['TO We do not mean to imply, however, that a defendant has a constitutional right to present all relevant evidence in his favor, no matter how limited in probative value such evidence will be so as to preclude the trial court from using Evidence Code section 352.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Cross-examination is subject to restriction under Evidence Code section 352 if it is cumulative or if it constitutes impeachment on collateral issues. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 440 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 514, fn. 6 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1221 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 620, 641-642 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 343]; see also <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 679 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1435].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Review of a trial court decision pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 is subject to abuse of discretion analysis. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 654-655 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 59, 65 [215 Cal.Rptr. 716].) \u201cThe weighing process under section 352 depends upon the trial court\u2019s consideration of the unique facts and issues of each case, rather than upon mechanically automatic rules. . . . Moreover, the trial court\u2019s ruling under section 352 will be upset only if there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 65, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The trial court herein correctly concluded that reference to the Mincher murder was not significant to Marti\u2019s defense but was highly prejudicial to Mentzer and also cumulative. The relevant facts here were that Rider loaned a pistol with a silencer to Mentzer after he came to believe that Mentzer had killed Radin, and that Rider did not make any disclosures to the police of what he knew about Radin\u2019s death until a year after he had been contacted by the police. What Mentzer did with the pistol had no relevance to Marti\u2019s defense and was therefore properly excluded. Exclusion of reference to the Mincher murder did not inhibit Marti\u2019s defense in any way. We are satisfied the trial court did not abuse its discretion in thus limiting cross-examination of Rider pursuant to Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Marti also argues that he was prevented from questioning Rider about his involvement in two murder conspiracies, a plot to blow up a cap\u00edtol building and the death of a person named General Worbel, which he contends would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>have constituted substantial impeachment of Rider\u2019s character. Marti argued to the trial court that these matters tended to impeach Rider\u2019s credibility and would show, even if the allegations were not true, that Rider bragged about criminal deeds to such an extent that Marti was motivated to respond in kind by bragging about crimes he did not commit, including the murder of Radin. The People objected that this evidence was not relevant, and if it had any relevance the probative value was substantially outweighed by potential prejudice pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. The trial court sustained the objections. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Information presented to the trial court relating to these allegations was sketchy at best. There was no evidentiary support for these allegations other than a representation that counsel wanted to ask Rider about them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The trial court found that there was insufficient evidence at the time of the hearing to justify cross-examination on these matters. There was nothing in the record to suggest that Marti had been motivated by either fear of Rider or a desire to impress Rider with false accounts of criminal deeds. The trial court correctly concluded that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by its potential prejudice.  \u201cAlthough we recognize that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to present all relevant evidence of a <em>significant </em>probative value in his favor [citations] \u2018[t]his does not mean that an unlimited inquiry may be made into collateral matters; the proffered evidence must have more than \u201cslight-relevancy\u201d to the issues presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 372, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Northrop </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1027, 1042 [182 Cal.Rptr. 197]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1195, 1220-1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Rider was subjected to extensive cross-examination which was often contentious, and which resulted in an abundance of impeaching evidence. This evidence established that Rider was in dire financial straits at the time he agreed to cooperate with the police investigation and thereafter was paid $3,000 per month, and he had been paid over $80,000 by the prosecution by the time of his testimony. It was brought out that he received a concealed weapons permit from the sheriff\u2019s department after his cooperation, and that he had a paranoid fear of his former employer Larry Flynt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>which manifested itself in sleeplessness, weight loss, sexual dysfunction and crying spells. It was disclosed that Rider had been undergoing hypnotherapy. Rider was impeached with prior inconsistent statements on numerous occasions, including admissions of having previously lied under oath. His bias was clearly exhibited during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Further, it was disclosed during his examination that Rider remained friendly with Mentzer and Marti even after he concluded that they had been involved in Radin\u2019s murder, and that he rehired Marti to work for Flynt. Rider testified he owned a .22-caliber pistol with silencer which he believed to be illegal and that he loaned the gun to Mentzer after he believed that Mentzer had been involved in Radin\u2019s murder. It was also made clear that Rider did not turn the gun over to the police until 1988. Also Rider testified he did not disclose to the police any information he had about Radin\u2019s murder until 1988 although he had such information in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Even if the trial court had abused its discretion in limiting cross-examination of Rider, we are satisfied that a reasonable jury would not have received a significantly different impression of Rider\u2019s credibility had Marti been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination. We find no denial of Marti\u2019s right of confrontation. \u201cAs we have stressed on more than one occasion, the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not to a perfect one.\u201d <em>(Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Ardall, supra, </em>475 U.S. at pp. 680-681 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1436]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 730, 750, at fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">5. <em>Marti\u2019s Mistrial Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Marti contends that the trial court committed reversible error in not granting his motion for mistrial made during the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of witness William Rider. The basis of this motion was an answer given by Rider to a question asked by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Marti contends that the defense was \u201csandbagged\u201d by the prosecutor who engaged in a deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>strategy to derail the defense effort to impeach Rider. He contends that the prosecutor had a duty to disclose new information which he learned during an interview with Rider and to seek a ruling from the court as to whether the information was admissible before asking the question. Marti argues that the answer given by Rider introduced evidence which violated his right of confrontation and was a by-product of the trial court\u2019s decision to try the defendants jointly. Marti argues that the resulting prejudice was so great that the only remedy was mistrial. Mentzer joins in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Marti\u2019s counsel cross-examined Rider about the .22-caliber pistol with silencer which Rider loaned to Mentzer after Rider became aware that Mentzer had been involved in the murder of Radin. It was brought out that this weapon had originally been Mentzer\u2019s and had been sold to Rider. Marti\u2019s counsel even marked the weapon as an exhibit. Marti argues that his purpose in conducting this examination was to infer that this weapon may have been the weapon that killed Radin and to show that Rider may have been an accomplice in the Radin murder. Marti also contends that this examination would have impeached the prosecution theory that two .22-caliber pistols had been used to kill Radin and would have impeached Plzak\u2019s testimony that he was with Marti when Marti disposed of two .22-caliber pistols used in the Radin murder. Marti contends that he would never have engaged in this strategy of cross-examination had he known what the prosecutor was going to bring out during redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Marti\u2019s counsel then argued for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor deliberately introduced highly prejudicial evidence without prior notification to the court and the defense. The prosecutor stated that he learned the preceding day about Mentzer giving one gun to Marti, and he did not know whether this had been mentioned in reports which had been previously furnished to the defense in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The court then conducted a hearing without the jury present. Rider was questioned concerning the source of his information about what Mentzer did with the other .22-caliber pistols. He testified that Mentzer told him that Marti had also bought one pistol but it hadn\u2019t been delivered yet. Rider further testified he told the prosecutor about this the preceding day but told the investigators about it two years earlier. Sergeant Stoner then testified that he had a conversation with Rider, which he believed occurred when Rider gave him the .22-caliber in 1988, and Rider told him that Mentzer had two other guns similar to the one he sold to Rider. Mentzer also told Stoner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Marti got one of the guns. But Rider stated that he was not present when Marti obtained the gun. Stoner acknowledged that his report stated only: \u201cMr. Rider stated Mentzer purchased three .22 pistols with silencers possibly from the Ace gun dealership.\u201d The prosecutor stated to the court: \u201cIf I had recognized that that was never before mentioned, that this was therefore a new statement and I had seen it in that light, I would have reduced it to writing. I did not see it in that light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">After further argument the trial court excused the jury and recessed the trial to give all counsel an opportunity to prepare written argument on the admissibility of Rider\u2019s testimony and, if it was not admissible, whether a mistrial should be declared. Each defendant agreed to this delay. The trial court stated that it was concerned about the issue of prejudice to the defendants rather than whether a discovery violation had occurred. The court reconvened one week later and heard argument. The trial court agreed with Marti that the statement was inadmissible hearsay. The trial court then denied Marti\u2019s mistrial motion, concluding that any harm suffered by Marti would be remedied by the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, before you were excused last Thursday there was testimony by Mr. Rider concerning the other two .22\u2019s, and Mr. Mentzer gave one to Mr. Marti and he kept one. I have sustained an objection to this testimony and struck the testimony and told you to disregard it. It\u2019s clear that this testimony was not based on personal knowledge of Mr. Rider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cFurthermore, it\u2019s clear that the testimony was based on pure assumption and rank speculation. I, therefore, repeat and emphasize my earlier instruction to you that you\u2019re to disregard the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cFurthermore, last Thursday you heard other testimony by Mr. Rider concerning the other two ,22\u2019s. I am now striking all such testimony. That testimony in its entirety is irrelevant to these proceedings and potentially very confusing for you. This testimony about the other two .22\u2019s would have had the tendency of causing a great deal of unfounded speculation by this jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cAfter further proceedings it is abundantly clear that these weapons have nothing to do with Mr. Radin\u2019s death. The prosecution admits and concedes that these weapons are not the murder weapons. That they have nothing to do with the killing in this case. Therefore, the testimony is irrelevant, and is stricken and you are to completely disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Marti argues that the instruction was inadequate and the only proper remedy was a mistrial. Much of this argument is based upon the supposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that the trial court concluded that the prosecutor had engaged in a deliberate scheme to withhold evidence and introduce inadmissible hearsay. However, the trial court made no such findings. Therefore, Marti\u2019s argument in that regard is not supported by the record. Marti also argues that the prejudice resulting from the introduction of this inadmissible hearsay could only be remedied by a mistrial. Marti argues that this evidence substantially undermined his cross-examination of Rider. Viewed from the perspective of the entire record, however, Marti\u2019s assessment of damage is grossly overstated. The trial court initially struck the answer and then gave the instruction quoted <em>ante. </em>Marti, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123, argues that the answer given by Rider denied him his right of confrontation because it introduced evidence of a statement of a codefendant. Marti is mistaken. The complained of testimony made no mention of anything said by Mentzer. The statement was appropriately treated as inadmissible speculation. As such we find no denial of Marti\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We conclude that the instruction given by the trial court adequately dealt with whatever prejudice resulted from Rider\u2019s answer.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">6. <em>Mentzer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Defendant Mentzer contends that he joined in the pretrial motions of his codefendants to sever based on the argument that Greenberger\u2019s defense was in conflict with the defense of the other defendants. He argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion constituted prejudicial error. Respondent contends that Mentzer never raised this issue in the trial court and is precluded from doing so here. Mentzer further argues that the trial court erred in denying his request to sever at the close of the People\u2019s case-in-chief. He contends that the trial court should have permitted him to argue his case to the jury and have his case decided by the jury before the other defendants, especially Greenberger, presented their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The trial court heard oral argument and decided the issue of severance on August 24, 1990. Written motions to sever had been filed by Greenberger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Marti and Lowe. After counsel for Greenberger argued in support of her motion to sever on the ground of conflicting defenses, counsel for Mentzer stated: \u201cI did not join in that motion, Your Honor.\u201d After further argument by counsel for Marti, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: Excuse me, Your Honor. Having listened to counsel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cThe Court: You are persuaded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: I have been persuaded that I should join in the motion in a request for a severance. And I would point out one other factor that I think is important\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201cThe Court: Of course, I have nothing before me as to Mr. Mentzer\u2019s defense, although I can guess\u2014it would be a guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: Except that it was stated and I don\u2019t think you need to guess because I think it was stated in black and white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Shohat [Counsel for Greenberger] doesn\u2019t necessarily speak for you, as he just told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: That is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cThe Court: In fact, he may be swinging at you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: I will be sure to duck at the appropriate time. I would ask court to make\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">\u201cThe Court: Who are you aligning yourself with? Which camp, just so it is clear on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: I\u2019m certainly not aligned with the Greenberger camp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. So you are aligned with the Marti/Lowe camp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">\u201c[Trial counsel for Mentzer]: There seems to be at least a division. I think there is one other thing to consider, your honor, someone brought up . . . the necessity for us to look down the road and come to the conclusion that we may be looking at a penalty phase as to all four of these defendants. And if that is true. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">Counsel for Mentzer then proceeded to discuss the potential penalty phase problems of a joint trial. He never returned to any discussion of severance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>based on conflicting defenses. Mentzer never set forth how his defense conflicted with Greenberger\u2019s. As was correctly observed, counsel for Greenberger did not speak for Mentzer. The trial court was left to speculate about what motion Mentzer was joining. If he was joining in the motion of Lowe or Marti, Mentzer failed to set forth what his defense would be so that the trial court could evaluate whether there were sufficient grounds for severance. Mentzer has failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 906 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitcham, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1048.) Further, even if we were to conclude that he had preserved this issue, he presented such minimal support for his position in the trial court that it is clear that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever his case prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On March 25, 1991, at the conclusion of the People\u2019s case-in-chief, Mentzer requested that he be permitted to argue his case to the jury before the other defendants presented their defense. He further requested that the trial court instruct the jury pursuant to CALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61. When his requests were denied he made a motion for mistrial and for severance. He argued: \u201cIt just seems that the court is forcing us to face a second prosecutor in this case. And the court has had an opportunity to hear the evidence. There is a lot of evidence in this case, but, boy, none of it is exactly pure as the driven snow. It\u2019s tainted with prejudice, inconsistency, multiple impeachments.\u201d The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Mentzer renewed his motion on April 10, 1991, after Marti and Lowe rested. Lowe and Marti joined in his motion to have the jury decide each of their cases before the jury heard evidence from Greenberger. In the alternative each requested the court to instruct the jury that evidence introduced during Greenberger\u2019s defense was to be limited to her case. In denying the motions the trial court observed that it found no authority and none had been cited which sanctioned such a bifurcated procedure or limiting instruction requested by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Defendants Mentzer, Marti and Lowe renewed their motions on April 26, 1991, after Greenberger completed her direct examination. During the April 26 hearing, after the jury heard the direct examination of Greenberger, counsel argued the prejudicial impact of Greenberger\u2019s testimony on the codefendants. Greenberger also renewed her motion for severance on the grounds that the codefendants would be attacking her credibility during cross-examination. In denying the motions the court stated: \u201cMr. Conn [the deputy district attorney] is right, there was a strong case. There aren\u2019t any big factual gaps that the People were missing or weak on one element of their case. What you point to are really credibility things. . . . Certainly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>what you\u2019ve raised is cumulative of evidence already presented by the People from many different types of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Mentzer cites no authority for his argument that he should have been permitted to argue his case and have his case decided by the jury before the codefendants presented their defense. There is good reason why he has not. Such a procedure has apparently never been used in this state. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 468, fn. 5.) The procedure, referred to as a \u201cbifurcated trial,\u201d has been attempted occasionally in federal court, where it appears to be generally disapproved. \u201cWe note, however, that federal appellate courts have reversed convictions of defendants whose guilt has been determined in a bifurcated trial, concluding that it may be practically impossible for a jury to determine one defendant\u2019s guilt without impermissibly prejudging the guilt of another defendant jointly tried.\u201d <em>9Ibid:, </em>see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Goland </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 897 F.2d 405, 411.) We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mentzer\u2019s motion to have a bifurcated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant Mentzer\u2019s motions did not result in gross unfairness which denied him a fair trial or due process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 312.) We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that whatever evidence was presented during Greenberger\u2019s defense was merely cumulative of the strong case presented by the People in their case-in-chief. This was not a situation in which the People relied upon the defendants to bolster a weak prosecution case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">7. <em>Limitation on Mentzer\u2019s Cross-examination of Greenberger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Defendant Greenberger moved to Florida after Radin\u2019s murder and married Larry Greenberger, who subsequently died under suspicious circumstances at their home in Florida. At the conclusion of Greenberger\u2019s direct examination her attorney requested that the trial court limit cross-examination. One subject of this motion was the death of Larry Greenberger. Mentzer\u2019s trial counsel argued that he should be allowed to question on this subject since Greenberger had solicited Mentzer to kill her husband and, at his funeral, admitted to Mentzer that she was responsible for his death. Mentzer argued that this evidence would impeach Greenberger\u2019s credibility by demonstrating her participation in a crime of moral turpitude. He also argued that cross-examination on this subject would show Greenberger\u2019s bias and motive to lie because of her interest to see that Mentzer was convicted of Radin\u2019s murder so that he could not be a witness against her in any prosecution relating to the death of Larry Greenberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The court conducted a hearing on May 9, 1991, in which Greenberger testified that she did not ask Mentzer to kill her husband, and she did not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Mentzer that she had killed her husband. The trial court then stated it would permit the cross-examination on this subject by Mentzer if Mentzer were to first testify about Greenberger\u2019s statement to him. The court observed that questioning of Greenberger on this subject without the evidence to support the allegations would be \u201cabsolutely catastrophic.\u201d The trial court proposed a temporary pause in the cross-examination of Greenberger until Mentzer presented this evidence to the jury. Mentzer\u2019s counsel sought assurance from the trial court that the scope of Mentzer\u2019s cross-examination would be limited to the statements Greenberger made to him about Larry Greenberger\u2019s death. The trial court stated that it could not specifically define the scope of Mentzer\u2019s cross-examination. The court stated: \u201cWhen you get down to the topic of what is in the scope of direct examination it\u2019s not what someone directly said, but what is necessarily implied from their direct. . . . If he is going to testify, have him testify in front of the jury and I will make the rulings as the questions come.\u201d Mentzer refused to present his evidence before the jury and the trial court ruled that the questions could not be asked of Greenberger. The court based its ruling on Evidence Code section 352 and concluded that the probative value of the proposed questions without supporting evidence from Mentzer was substantially outweighed by prejudice to Greenberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Mentzer complains that the trial court\u2019s ruling deprived him of his right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and his right to present relevant evidence in his defense guaranteed by article I, section 28, subdivision (d) of the California Constitution. He argues that the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938] clearly stated that evidence of criminal acts involving moral turpitude, even conduct only amounting to a misdemeanor, is admissible to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Clearly, the crimes of murder and solicitation to commit murder are crimes of moral turpitude. However, no foundation was presented by Mentzer to justify asking the questions he proposed. The trial court correctly concluded that the potential prejudice to Greenberger which would result from allowing the questions substantially outweighed the probative value of such questioning since Greenberger denied making the statements and Mentzer did not prove that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">As discussed <em>ante, </em>a defendant in a criminal trial is guaranteed the right of cross-examination by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. However, the trial court retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination. <em>(Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 U.S. atp. 679 [106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>S.Ct. at p. 1435]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at pp. 1090-1091.) The right of a defendant to present relevant evidence is also subject to reasonable limitation pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sully, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1219-1020.) Further, the trial court has discretion to regulate the order of proof. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The situation in the case at bench is closely analogous to that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders, supra, </em>11 Cal. 4th at pages 512-514 wherein the trial court precluded defense cross-examination of prosecution witness Rogoway about allegations that Rogoway had collaborated with Richard Quine to accuse the defendant falsely. The trial court therein ruled that the defendant must first call Quine to testify about this collaboration. The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court properly exercised its discretion to require the defendant to establish the foundation for this impeaching evidence before questioning Rogoway. The court stated: \u201cEvidence Code section 403, subdivision (a)(4) provides: \u2018(a) The proponent of the proffered evidence has the burden of producing evidence as to the existence of the preliminary fact, and the proffered evidence is inadmissible unless the court finds that there is evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary fact, when ... (4) [t]he proffered evidence is of a statement or other conduct of a particular person and the preliminary fact is whether that person made the statement or so conducted himself.\u2019 In light of the undisputed background information provided to the court concerning Quine\u2019s questionable reliability and limited contact with Rogoway, the trial court properly required defendant to carry the burden of producing evidence as to the existence of the preliminary fact that Rogoway had indeed collaborated with Quine before permitting cross-examination on that point.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 514; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 908-910 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940].)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Based upon the record herein, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the inquiry about the death of Larry Greenberger pursuant to Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">8. <em>Lowe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Lowe filed a written motion to sever. His motion was argued and decided on August 24, 1990, at the same time motions by the other defendants were considered. Lowe argued that Greenberger\u2019s defense would establish that he was the limousine driver during Radin\u2019s kidnapping, and this would conflict with his alibi defense. His motion was supported by his counsel\u2019s declaration which stated counsel anticipated presenting an alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>defense. The trial court denied his motion.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Lowe, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Bean, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at page 940, argues that an assessment of what actually occurred during the trial establishes that failure to sever due to antagonistic defenses resulted in gross unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Lowe and Greenberger, however, did not have antagonistic defenses. Greenberger\u2019s defense consisted of her effort to prove that she did not know of the plan to kidnap or murder Radin. Lowe\u2019s defense was alibi. Greenberger\u2019s defense, to be successful, did not require the jury to believe Lowe drove the limousine or was otherwise involved in the crimes. Lowe\u2019s defense did not require the jury to believe Greenberger was involved in the planning of Radin\u2019s death. Therefore, in the narrow definition of the term, the defenses were not mutually antagonistic. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">However, even if the defenses can be characterized as totally antagonistic, Lowe\u2019s joinder with Greenberger did not result in gross unfairness. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>defendants Turner and Souza were tried jointly for burglary and murder, and Souza testified in his defense that he was forced to assist Turner in the burglary because of his fear of Turner. Turner presented no defense. The Supreme Court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in joining the defendants for trial, and further found that joinder did not result in gross unfairness. The court stated \u201c. . . no denial of a fair trial results from the mere fact that two defendants who are jointly tried have antagonistic defenses and one defendant gives testimony that is damaging to the other and thus helpful to the prosecution.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 313; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1515, 1520, fn. 4 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 230] [\u201cwhile joint trial of defendants who each accuse the other does pose problems, the complaint is that too much rather than too little truth might emerge in the process. While joint defendants might prefer otherwise, this dilemma may serve the public interest in accurate ascertainment of guilt or innocence, . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Lowe contends that Greenberger\u2019s testimony filled in significant gaps in the People\u2019s case. We disagree. The most damning evidence against Lowe came from his taped admissions to Rider and the testimony of Plzak and Korban. Greenberger\u2019s testimony that Lowe was in the limousine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>merely corroborative of the People\u2019s evidence. Lowe argues that the People did not present any evidence that Lowe went to Greenberger\u2019s house with Mentzer the day after she discovered the theft of cocaine and money. Even though Greenberger testified about this incident during her defense, we are not persuaded that it is significant. Lowe also complains that Greenberger testified she was instructed to inform him when Jonathan Lawson, Radin\u2019s personal assistant, left the hotel. Since Korban and Plzak both testified that Lowe was present during the meeting in which the plans relating to kidnapping Lawson were discussed, Greenberger\u2019s testimony in this regard caused Lowe no prejudice. We find that there is no reasonable probability that Lowe would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">V.-XL<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">XII. Issues Relating to Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendants contend that the trial court made numerous errors relating to jury instructions. Regarding the charge of aggravated kidnapping of Radin they contend the trial court erred by failing to define the word \u201creward.\u201d They argue that the trial court erred by failing to instruct properly on lesser offenses to both the charge of murder and the charge of aggravated kidnapping. Lowe, Mentzer, and Marti also argue that the trial court erred in instructions relating to the victim\u2019s consent to asportation on the kidnapping charge. We will first address the arguments relating to the charge of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">A. <em>Aggravated Kidnapping and \u201cReward\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The defendants argue that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to define the word \u201creward\u201d in its instructions relating to the crime of aggravated kidnapping.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> During discussion of jury instructions prior to argument, the prosecutor proposed instructions containing definitions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>various words used in the instruction (CALJIC No. 9.53) on aggravated kidnapping. The prosecutor indicated he had relied upon standard dictionary definitions in preparing his instructions. The defendants objected to use of dictionary definitions and, except for requesting the statutory definition of extortion, they opposed the prosecutor\u2019s request for additional definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">During opening argument the prosecutor argued that the evidence had established that Greenberger was either a principal in Radin\u2019s kidnapping or an aider and abettor. The prosecutor argued that as a principal Greenberger acted with \u201cthe purpose of extortion or to exact the money and drugs from him.\u201d In arguing that Greenberger was an aider and abettor the prosecutor stated the following: \u201c[Greenberger] assisted ... in getting Mr. Radin into a position where they could kidnap him. . . . And clearly the purpose that Mr. Mentzer, Mr. Marti and Mr. Lowe had in mind was a reward. They got paid for it. That is what a reward is. A reward is merely compensation given in return for some action or service. So, clearly under that theory the defendant Greenberger is an aider and abettor and an actual perpetrator. You understand she\u2019s also an aider and abettor for a kidnap for reward because even if she\u2019s not paid\u2014which she wasn\u2019t\u2014if she does the paying, she has aided and abetted a killing for payment.\" There was no objection to this argument by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Greenberger\u2019s counsel responded in closing argument: \u201cThe prosecution made some comment about well, the reward in this case could be the money, the kidnappers were going to be paid. That\u2019s really not quite true. A reward has to be something over and above a payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Before his closing argument the prosecutor again requested that the court define \u201creward\u201d in its instructions. The prosecutor stated he intended to reiterate the definition set forth in the People\u2019s opening argument. Lowe\u2019s counsel indicated he disagreed with the prosecution\u2019s definition. The court stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly common word and I don\u2019t think the jury is going to have a problem with it, notwithstanding conflicting arguments. . . .\u201d and then requested that each side brief the issue, indicating that the issue would be considered later. No briefs were filed, and the matter was not discussed further. The prosecutor then stated in closing argument: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, you will not. . . receive an instruction which is going to tell you that a reward has to be something over and above a payment as [Greenberger\u2019s counsel] said to you. That is simply not the case. We all know what reward means. It\u2019s a common usage. Reward you know to be something of benefit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>That\u2019s what it is. You know on May 13th Mr. Mentzer wasn\u2019t working. He was earning money. That\u2019s what he was doing. So, if he kidnapped Mr. Radin with the intent to hold him and detain him he did it for reward. He did it for his own personal benefit.\u201d Again the defendants made no objection to this argument.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Greenberger argues that the prosecutor\u2019s definition of \u201creward\u201d impermissibly expanded the scope of the crime of aggravated kidnapping by permitting conviction when one person hires another to commit a kidnapping. She argues that the use of the word \u201creward\u201d was intended for situations in which \u201cthe perpetrators intended to wait until the distressed family [of the victim] posted a reward, and then have some shill return the victim and collect the reward.\u201d Greenberger, relying upon dictionary definitions and her review of the legislative history of section 209, contends that a reward requires both a public offer of money for the safe return of the kidnapped person and the kidnapper\u2019s intent to obtain money or other valuables from those acting on the victim\u2019s behalf. Greenberger argues that the trial court committed reversible error by not providing a definition of \u201creward\u201d in its instructions to the jury. Lowe, relying upon dictionary definitions and his review of the legislative history of section 209, contends that \u201creward\u201d means financial gain, and he argues that the jury should have been so instructed: \u201cA \u2018reward\u2019 in this context means something of a material or pecuniary value which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>defendant had a prior expectation of receiving.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Lowe argues that by failing to define \u201creward\u201d in this manner the trial court permitted the jury to convict if it concluded the kidnapper was motivated by the prospect of nonfinancial benefits, such as \u201cmerely to obtain stature or approval in the eyes of his peers or to derive some sort of psychic pleasure.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">2. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We agree with Lowe that aggravated kidnapping requires the deprivation of a person\u2019s liberty for the purpose of obtaining a financial gain. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1227 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382].)<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> However, nothing said by the prosecutor in his closing argument and nothing in the trial court\u2019s instruction that defined aggravated kidnapping suggested otherwise. Also, we find nothing in the legislative history of section 209 that supports Greenberger\u2019s contention that \u201creward\u201d is limited to a public offer of money for the capture of a criminal or release of a kidnap victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Although not defined in the statute or in any California cases dealing with section 209, we conclude that the word \u201creward\u201d is not a technical term requiring separate definition for the jury. The California statute relating to aggravated kidnapping is based upon the federal Lindbergh Law which was enacted in 1932. In the context of that statute the Supreme Court stated that \u201creward\u201d generally \u201cimplies something given in return for good or evil done or received.\" <em>(Gooch </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1936) 297 U.S. 124, 126 [56 S.Ct. 395, 396, 80 L.Ed. 522].) This conforms with the common understanding of the word: \u201c[S]omething given in return for good or, sometimes, evil, or for service or merit\" (Webster\u2019s New World Diet. (3d college ed. 1991) p. 1150) or \u201csomething that is given in return for good or evil done or received and esp. that is offered or given for some service or attainment\u201d (Webster\u2019s New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Collegiate Diet. (8th ed. 1981) p. 985.) \u201cThere is no need to instruct a jury on the meaning of terms in common usage, which are presumed to be within the understanding of persons of ordinary intelligence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1229-1230.) Since the word did not require definition and because the defendants made no request for a definition and failed to object when the prosecutor stated his definition in closing argument, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision not to define the word \u201creward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">B. <em>Lesser Offenses to Aggravated Kidnapping</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">1. <em>Simple Kidnapping</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Greenberger, joined by her codefendants, argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on simple kidnapping as a lesser included<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> or lesser related offense to the charge of aggravated kidnapping.  \u201cGenerally, the jury must be instructed on crimes that are necessarily included within the offense charged[.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1233.) A trial court has the \u201cduty to instruct sua sponte on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present, but has no such duty when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 276 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A discussion of this issue requires a brief review of proceedings that occurred before trial and the unusual circumstances that existed when the court was called upon to decide whether to instruct on the lesser included offense of simple kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The municipal court complaint charged each defendant with the murder of Radin.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Mentzer, Marti and Greenberger, who had their preliminary hearing before Lowe\u2019s, were charged in the superior court information with the murder of Radin and in a separate count with the kidnapping of Radin in violation of section 207. Greenberger, joined by Mentzer and Marti, moved to dismiss the kidnapping charge pursuant to section 995, arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The People opposed the motion. The trial court agreed with the defendants\u2019 position, and that charge was dismissed. After Lowe\u2019s preliminary hearing, the People filed an amended information which added the charge of aggravated kidnapping in violation of section 209 as to each defendant.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The defendants argue here that the trial court erred in granting their pretrial motion to dismiss the simple kidnapping charge. They are correct. An arrest warrant was issued with the complaint on September 28, 1988, charging each defendant with the murder of Radin. During the period relevant to these proceedings the statute of limitations for simple kidnapping was six years (\u00a7 800). The prosecution for simple kidnapping would have had to commence on May 13, 1989, to avoid being barred by the statute of limitations. Section 803, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cNo time during which prosecution of the same person for the same conduct is pending in a court of this state is a part of a limitation of time prescribed in this chapter.\u201d Section 804 provides in part: \u201cFor the purpose of this chapter, prosecution for an offense is commenced when any of the following occurs: [U . . . [U (d) An arrest warrant or bench warrant is issued, provided the warrant names or describes the defendant with the same degree of particularity required for an indictment, information or complaint.\u201d Although respondent argues that Radin\u2019s kidnapping cannot be characterized as the \u201csame conduct\u201d as the murder of Radin, we are satisfied that the facts herein clearly establish that the kidnapping was part of the same conduct that resulted in Radin\u2019s murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitfield </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1652, 1659-1660 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 210]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1064 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 156].) Since the prosecution commenced on September 28,1988 with the issuance of the arrest warrant for the crime of murder and before the six-year statute of limitations had run for simple kidnapping, it was not barred.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We therefore agree with the defendants\u2019 argument on appeal that the trial court erred in granting their motion to dismiss the count charging a violation of section 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The effect of this error became manifest during discussion of jury instructions before argument when the trial court ruled on Greenberger\u2019s request to instruct on simple kidnapping (CALJIC No. 9.50) as a lesser included offense to the charge of aggravated kidnapping. The prosecutor responded: \u201cI think the case law is very clear that the trial court should not instruct on a lesser included offense which is barred by the statute of limitations. . . .\u201d Greenberger\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cWe may be willing to waive it for the purpose of the instruction.\u201d The prosecutor then cited cases to the court which stood for the then existing rule that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and cannot be waived by a defendant.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Counsel for Greenberger argued: \u201cI think that the defendant can waive the jurisdictional issue and by requesting the lesser included instruction we would be offering to do that.\u201d After a recess during which the trial court reviewed the cases cited by the prosecutor, the court ruled that it was \u201cbound to follow the court of appeals opinions, and therefore, I will refuse the 9.50.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The other defendants then joined in the request for this lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Greenberger, joined by the other defendants, argues on appeal: \u201cThe fact that neither the court nor counsel had correctly analyzed the statute of limitations issue during <em>pretrial </em>proceedings cannot in any way excuse the court\u2019s <em>subsequent </em>failure to instruct on simple kidnap during the crucible of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Respondent argues that any error committed by the trial court by failing to instruct on the lesser offense was invited by the defendants and is therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The trial court\u2019s mistaken belief that simple kidnapping was a time-barred lesser offense was the direct result of the successful arguments of Greenberger, Mentzer, and Marti to dismiss that charge prior to trial pursuant to section 995. During discussion of jury instructions no counsel attempted to correct the error, but instead talked in terms of waiving the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>limitations. We agree with respondent that the trial court error in ruling that the lesser offense of simple kidnapping was time-barred was invited by Greenberger, Mentzer, and Marti.  \u201cThe doctrine of invited error is designed to prevent an accused from gaining a reversal on appeal because of an error made by the trial court at his behest. If defense counsel intentionally caused the trial court to err, the appellant cannot be heard to complain on appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 330 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1234-1236 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 988, 1011 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 818, 874 P.2d 248]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41,109; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 825-833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We disagree with respondent, however, that the error was invited by Lowe. As discussed <em>ante, </em>Lowe did not participate in the section 995 motion to dismiss the simple kidnapping charge. Although he did join in the request that the court instruct on the time-barred lesser offense during the hearing in which the trial court considered Greenberger\u2019s offer to waive the statute of limitations, and his counsel never disputed the prosecutor\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations had run, we cannot conclude from this that his counsel\u2019s conduct invited the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This is not the end of the issue, however, as to Greenberger, Mentzer and Marti. The Supreme Court in <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 367, decided five years after the instant trial, disapproved the body of law upon which the trial court relied in denying the request for the lesser offense. In <em>Cowan </em>the defendant was charged with murder and entered a guilty plea to the lesser offense of manslaughter, a crime for which the statute of limitations had run. Prior to sentencing, and upon motion of the prosecution, the trial court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the time-barred offense and set aside the plea, reinstating the original charge. The defendant sought a writ of mandate which was granted by the Supreme Court. The court overruled <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 611 [36 P.2d 378] and its progeny which held that a court lacks fundamental subject matter jurisdiction over a time-barred criminal charge. <em>(Cowan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 374.) In addition to holding that a defendant may enter a guilty plea to a time-barred lesser offense, the <em>Cowan </em>court went on to conclude that a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a time-barred lesser offense if he waives the statute of limitations. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Cowan </em>did not address whether the rule announced therein was to be given prospective or retroactive application. Because <em>Cowan </em>announced a change in the long-standing rule of criminal procedure relating to trial court jurisdiction over time-barred lesser offenses, we conclude that the fair administration of justice requires that the rule announced in <em>Cowan </em>be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>prospective application only, i.e., to cases tried after the date it was decided. Prospective application would conform with past decisions of the Supreme Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510, 532, fn 13 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303] [rule regarding lesser related offenses to be prospective only]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murtishaw </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1001, 1012-1014 [258 Cal.Rptr. 821, 773 P.2d 172] [rule of imperfect self-defense was prospective].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Because of its erroneous belief that the statute of limitations had run on simple kidnapping, the trial court herein was faced with the choice of following the existing rule and not instructing on the lesser offense or of instructing on the lesser offense with the prospect of a conviction on a lesser offense over which the court would lack subject matter jurisdiction. We conclude that the trial court did not err by following the then existing rule in refusing to instruct on the \u201ctime-barred\u201d lesser offense of simple kidnapping as to Greenberger, Mentzer and Marti.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Even though Lowe is not tainted on appeal with the error invited by his codefendants, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing his request to instruct on simple kidnapping. \u201c[I]t has long been settled that the trial court need not, even if requested, instruct the jury on the existence and definition of a lesser and included offense if the evidence was such that the defendant, if guilty at all, was guilty of the greater offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 931, 959 [275 Cal.Rptr. 160, 800 P.2d 516]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 196, fn. 5 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Middleton </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 19, 30 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 366].) The evidence presented at trial demonstrated either that Lowe was guilty of aggravated kidnapping or not guilty of anything. \u201cUnder no view of the evidence\u201d was he guilty of simple kidnapping. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The day before the kidnapping Lowe was present at the meeting in Mentzer\u2019s apartment during which the plan to kidnap Radin was discussed. Mentzer stated he was being paid a \u201clot of money\u201d by Greenberger for the job. Lowe was described by Mentzer in the meeting as the person who would drive Radin and Greenberger in the limousine to a location where he would permit Mentzer and Marti to enter and Greenberger to exit, and would then drive the forcibly detained Radin to the desert where Mentzer and Marti would try to extract information regarding the stolen drugs and money from him. Mentzer and Marti were to be armed with guns and explosives, which were plainly visible during the meeting. The scheme was executed as planned. Thereafter, Lowe received payment of money and a car. Lowe presented an alibi defense. There was insufficient evidence to support a simple kidnapping instruction as a lesser included offense as to Lowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Relying upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 510, Lowe also contends that the trial court should have instructed on simple kidnapping as a lesser related offense. Lowe made no such request to the trial court. His counsel joined in Greenberger\u2019s request for simple kidnapping as a lesser included offense. Although one can speculate that the trial court would have erroneously concluded that simple kidnapping also was time-barred as a lesser-related offense, the issue was never presented to the trial court for ruling. He has therefore waived the issue on appeal. \u201c[H]ad defendant offered the argument [in the trial court] he would have provided an occasion to develop a record adequate for review. But as stated, he did not offer the argument below. Accordingly, he may not do so here.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, 50 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 1251-1252.) Further, since Lowe\u2019s defense was complete denial of culpability, the trial court would not have been required to instruct on lesser related offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 531-532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Lowe contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for aggravated kidnapping. He contends that the prosecution failed to establish that he participated in Radin\u2019s kidnapping with the expectation of financial reward.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">As the Supreme Court has observed, the role of an appellate court in reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence is limited.  \u201c \u2018The proper test for determining a claim of insufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.] On appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.] [*][] Although we must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends. [Citation.] Thus, if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our evaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact finder.

(a)). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 707, 713 [39 Cal.Rptr. 874].) We reject their argument for reasons related to the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">During the period relevant to these proceedings the statute of limitations for felony false imprisonment was three years (\u00a7 801). As discussed <em>ante, </em>the prosecution herein did not commence until September 28, 1988, with the filing of a complaint and the issuance of an arrest warrant in the municipal court. At that time the statute of limitations for false imprisonment had already run since the crime occurred on May 13, 1983. Even if <em>Cowan </em>were to be given retroactive application, the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on a time-barred lesser included offense unless the defendant affirmatively waived the statute of limitations. <em>(Cowan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 376.) Although the defendants offered to waive the statute of limitations for simple kidnap, no such offer was made as to the lesser offense of false imprisonment. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct on felony false imprisonment.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>4. <em>Issues Relating to Consent of the Victim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Lowe contends that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to give his requested instructions CALJIC Nos. 9.56 and 9.58.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> He argues substantial evidence supported the giving of these instructions and failure to give them deprived him of his right to present a defense. Lowe argues specifically that there was substantial evidence that Radin voluntarily entered the limousine he was driving and that he believed Radin consented to being transported in the limousine. The trial court denied his request stating: \u201cI think that the evidence cited by the defense is fanciful and doesn\u2019t require the instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Although the evidence herein suggests that Radin voluntarily entered the limousine with Greenberger believing he was going to dinner, the overwhelming evidence also demonstrates that Radin was forcibly detained and transported to the place where he was ultimately murdered. Lowe\u2019s defense herein was alibi. The trial court\u2019s assessment was correct. There was no substantial evidence to support the instructions he requested. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Simmons </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 573, 579 [261 Cal.Rptr. 760]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 541, 557, fn. 14 [271 Cal.Rptr. 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">5. <em>Alibi Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We find no merit in Lowe\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s instructions relating to alibi permitted the jury to convict him even if the jury believed his alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defense.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The instructions were a correct statement of law and, viewed in the light of all the instructions given, posed no potential for confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">C. <em>Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In addition to first degree premeditated and deliberate murder, the jury was instructed on second degree felony murder based upon the predicate felonies of aggravated and simple kidnapping.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The jury was not instructed on manslaughter. Greenberger and Lowe contend that the trial court erred by instructing on second degree murder with the predicate felony of simple kidnapping which they argue is not a felony inherently dangerous to human life. They also contend the trial court erred in failing to instruct on manslaughter based on a predicate of false imprisonment. Mentzer and Marti argue that the trial court erred by not instructing on heat of passion manslaughter, unreasonable self-defense and the effects of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">1. <em>Simple Kidnapping as a Predicate for Second Degree Felony Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">During discussion of jury instructions the prosecution requested that the jury be instructed on second degree felony murder based only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>predicate felony of aggravated kidnapping. Defendants Greenberger and Lowe, however, requested that the jury be instructed on simple kidnapping as a basis for second degree felony murder. The trial court expressed concern whether simple kidnapping was a felony inherently dangerous to human life which could support a conviction of second degree felony murder. Counsel for Lowe and Greenberger both answered that it was. Greenberger and Lowe now contend that the trial court erred in instructing that simple kidnapping could be a basis for the jury to return a verdict of guilty of second degree murder. We first observe, if the trial court erred in so instructing, such error was clearly invited by the defendants. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 330; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bunyard, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 1189, 1234-1236; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 988, 1011; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 41, 109; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 771, 825-832; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ojeda-Parra </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 46, 50-51 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 634]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 616, 625 [76 Cal.Rptr. 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We conclude, however, that the trial court did not err in this regard. \u201cA homicide that is a direct causal result of the commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life (other than the six felonies enumerated in Pen. Code, \u00a7 189) constitutes at least second degree murder.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772,795 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 615, 620 [262 Cal.Rptr. 195, 778 P.2d 549] the court stated that for application of the doctrine of second degree felony murder, an inherently dangerous felony is \u201can offense carrying \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 627.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1228 we concluded that aggravated kidnapping is such a felony. Simple kidnapping has likewise been held to be a felony inherently dangerous to human life which may support a conviction of second degree felony murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pearch </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1282, 1298 [280 Cal.Rptr. 584].) Greenberger and Lowe argue that <em>Pearch </em>was wrongly decided and invite us to come to a contrary determination. Since we agree with the conclusion reached in <em>Pearch </em>we decline their invitation. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s instruction on second degree felony murder predicated on the felony of simple kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">2. <em>Voluntary Intoxication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Mentzer, joined by Marti, argues that sufficient evidence was presented of his voluntary intoxication to raise a reasonable doubt of the existence of malice aforethought. He contends that the trial court erred in refusing instructions relating to voluntary manslaughter and the effects of intoxication. During discussion of jury instructions Mentzer pointed to evidence derived from the statements made by Lowe and Mentzer to Rider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>supportive of his position.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The trial court stated: \u201cI think the evidence is insubstantial on the issue. . . . As to Mentzer and Marti, the only statement that we have is that they really drank some wine to gear themself <em>[sic] </em>up to do the murder and I think that\u2019s insubstantial evidence to give the instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We conclude that the trial court was correct in its analysis that the evidence relating to voluntary intoxication was insubstantial. The trial court should instruct the jury on every theory of the case, \u201c \u2018but only to the extent each is supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 684-685) The evidence relied upon by Mentzer does not meet that standard. The facts herein are similar to <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1158, 1180-1181 [270 Cal.Rptr. 286, 791 P.2d 965], There the defendant had consumed eight to ten beers prior to the charged murder and the Supreme Court stated: \u201cBecause in this case there was no evidence presented at the guilt phase suggesting that defendant\u2019s drinking had affected his mental state in a manner that might negate the specific intent or mental state required for first degree murder, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 4.21 with regard to the first degree murder charge.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 1181; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mills </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 539, 544 [140 Cal.Rptr. 803]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Juarez </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 349 [65 Cal.Rptr. 630].)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>3. <em>Voluntary Manslaughter Based on Heat of Passion or Imperfect Self-defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Mentzer contends that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct on voluntary manslaughter based on heat of passion and imperfect self-defense or defense of another. He argues that there was sufficient evidence to support these instructions.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">As stated <em>ante, </em>a court need not instruct on lesser included offenses unless such offenses are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 684-685; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 250 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rich </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1036, 1112 [248 Cal.Rptr. 510, 755 P.2d 960]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dixon </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1547 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 859]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franco </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1540 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 478]; <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLeon </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 815, 824-825 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 825]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaulden </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 942, 951 [111 Cal.Rptr. 803].) The evidence herein was minimal and insubstantial at best. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on manslaughter based on these theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">4. <em>False Imprisonment as a Predicate for Involuntary Manslaughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Although she did not request such an instruction in the trial court, Greenberger contends that the court committed reversible error by failing to instruct sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter based on false imprisonment as a lesser included offense to the predicate felonies of aggravated and simple kidnapping. Greenberger contends that failure to so instruct precluded the jury from considering an involuntary manslaughter verdict and outright acquittal. Greenberger relies upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887], <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 86 [137 Cal.Rptr. 1, 560 P.2d 1180], <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1461 [280 Cal.Rptr. 609] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894]. Respondent argues that, because the evidence presented at trial showed that Greenberger was guilty of nothing less than aggravated kidnapping, the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on manslaughter based upon the predicate of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Involuntary manslaughter is the unintentional killing of a human being without malice, \u201cin the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection.\u201d (\u00a7 192, subd. (b).) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at page 835 the court stated: \u201c[A]n unintentional homicide committed in the course of a noninherently dangerous felony may properly support a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, if that felony is committed without due caution and circumspection.\u201d Felony false imprisonment is not an inherently dangerous felony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henderson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 90.) False imprisonment is a lesser included offense of aggravated kidnapping. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.2d at p. 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Greenberger contends that the jury\u2019s verdict of second degree murder implies that the jury necessarily found that at most she participated as an aider and abettor in a false imprisonment without the intent to kill, which she argues is consistent with her testimony. From this Greenberger argues that, had the jury been instructed on the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter based on the predicate of false imprisonment, there was a fair possibility that she would have been convicted of that offense. She contends that the jury may even have concluded that she acted with \u201cdue caution and circumspection\u201d in trying to warn Radin of his impending doom, and the jury may well have acquitted her of homicide entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We reject Greenberger\u2019s argument because it is premised on a faulty reading of the record. We are satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that she was either guilty of felony murder based on the predicate felony of kidnapping or not guilty of homicide. Her defense was that she believed that the other defendants were going to talk to Radin at the restaurant while she and Radin had dinner the night of Radin\u2019s murder. She denied any knowledge that they were going to detain or kidnap Radin. No evidence was presented from which a jury could conclude that she intended to participate in Radin\u2019s false imprisonment. There was a clear dichotomy in the evidence. The prosecution evidence supported the theory that Greenberger paid for the kidnapping of Radin in order to extract information from him. Greenberger\u2019s evidence supported her theory that she had no knowledge of the plans of the other defendants, and she did not share their intent. The evidence thus supported either a verdict that Greenberger was guilty of aggravated kidnapping or not guilty of anything. There was no evidence from which a jury could conclude that Greenberger was guilty of false imprisonment. There is no need for the court to instruct sua sponte unless substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>exists. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 684-685.)

Lowe was acquitted by a jury of both offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> The judgment states that Lowe\u2019s sentence for count 1 was stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654.
