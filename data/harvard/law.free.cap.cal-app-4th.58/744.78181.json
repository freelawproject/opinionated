J.</author>\n<p id=\"A77\">Plaintiff Michael Lucas appeals a judgment dismissing his lawsuit against defendants State of California, Jose Fernandez, Joseph Cottingham, and C. Lance Barnett (together State) after the superior court sustained without leave to amend the State\u2019s demurrer to his complaint for federal civil rights violation, wrongful termination, and writ of mandate. Concluding Lucas\u2019s complaint alleged facts sufficient to constitute causes of action, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">The State notified Lucas his civil service employment was terminated for cause. Lucas appealed to the State Personnel Board (SPB). While awaiting hearing before the SPB, Lucas applied for and obtained service retirement from the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). On the date scheduled for the SPB hearing, the State withdrew its disciplinary action against Lucas. Asserting such withdrawal effectively reinstated him to his position, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Lucas unsuccessfully sought reinstatement from the State Department of Personnel Administration (Personnel Administration). Lucas then requested a SPB hearing to clear his name and reinstate him. Claiming lack of jurisdiction, the SPB declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Lucas filed this lawsuit seeking reinstatement to his former position and damages. Concluding Lucas voluntarily resigned from his job by obtaining service retirement and did not timely seek reinstatement, the superior court sustained the State\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. However, since Lucas adequately pleaded claims against the State under applicable statutes, we conclude the court erred in sustaining the State\u2019s demurrer. Specifically, as we shall explain for purposes of surviving demurrer, the facts pleaded by Lucas were sufficient to establish that (1) Lucas was separated involuntarily from state service by dismissal; (2) during pendency of his appeal to the SPB, Lucas sought and obtained service retirement; (3) Lucas\u2019s service retirement after involuntary termination did not constitute resignation from service; (4) before the SPB hearing, the State withdrew its disciplinary action against Lucas; and (5) upon withdrawal of the State\u2019s disciplinary action, Lucas\u2019s involuntary separation from service ceased and he was entitled to reinstatement to his position subject to compliance with applicable PERS requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">For purposes of determining the propriety of the order sustaining the State\u2019s demurrer, we state the facts alleged by Lucas and matters judicially noticed by the superior court. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 699, 702 [263 Cal.Rptr. 119, 780 P.2d 349]; <em>Frommhagen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1292, 1299 [243 Cal.Rptr. 390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Lucas was a permanent civil service employee of the Bureau of Automotive Repair (Bureau) of the State\u2019s Department of Consumer Affairs (Consumer Affairs). Barnett was Consumer Affairs\u2019 chief deputy director. Bureau managers Fernandez and Cottingham were Lucas\u2019s supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In 1994 Fernandez told Lucas that Fernandez was assigning employee Franke to work for Fernandez under Fernandez\u2019s supervision in an undercover operation. Fernandez told Lucas that Lucas would not be responsible for supervising Franke during such assignment and would not have any supervisory duties in the operation. Fernandez entrusted Franke with cash for the undercover operation but did not supervise its use. Franke embezzled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>$2,000. Upon discovery of Franke\u2019s embezzlement, Fernandez and Cottingham made knowingly false accusations that Lucas stole the money and that Lucas failed to supervise Franke. An internal investigation revealed that Lucas was factually innocent of all charges and that Franke was guilty of embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">On March 10, 1995, instead of taking criminal, civil or administrative action against Franke, the State served Lucas with a notice of adverse action terminating his employment for cause effective March 17, 1995. The State knew the charges in the notice of adverse action were false and inadequate to support Lucas\u2019s termination from state employment. State employees Fernandez, Cottingham and Barnett also knew that Lucas\u2019s wife was in poor health, Lucas could not afford loss of his total income and medical insurance during pendency of administrative proceedings, and Lucas would be forced to retire or resign to keep his medical insurance and avoid total loss of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Upon receiving the State\u2019s notice of adverse action, Lucas immediately requested a pretermination Shelly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing and filed an appeal with the SPB. The State did not provide Lucas with a <em>Shelly </em>hearing before the effective date of his employment termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On April 11, 1995, while his SPB appeal was pending, Lucas applied for service retirement under the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law solely to mitigate damages and avoid losing his and his wife\u2019s medical insurance coverage. PERS staff assured Lucas his retirement could and would be set aside if his SPB appeal succeeded. PERS staff also assured Lucas such actions were routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">On June 5, 1995, the date set for hearing of Lucas\u2019s SPB appeal, Consumer Affairs unilaterally withdrew the notice of adverse action and all charges against Lucas.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">On June 8, 1995, Lucas wrote to Personnel Administration requesting reinstatement, asserting that withdrawal of the adverse action at the SPB administrative hearing effectively reinstated him under former Government Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 21101.5, now renumbered as section 21198. When the State refused to reinstate Lucas to his job, Lucas requested a hearing to clear his name and reinstate him. Denying Lucas\u2019s request, the SPB stated it lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing or reinstate Lucas since there was no longer any action pending before the SPB. The SPB stated only the appointing power could reinstate Lucas to his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>On June 15, 1995, the SPB notified Lucas his appeal of his dismissal from employment was closed because Consumer Affairs had withdrawn the adverse action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AEc\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Lucas\u2019s Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">On January 10, 1996, Lucas filed this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Lucas\u2019s cause of action for federal civil rights violation alleged the State infringed upon his due process rights by denying him an opportunity to be heard and by depriving him of his civil service employment without cause; and the State acted under color of law to deprive him of liberty and property without due process by terminating his employment based on false charges without good cause, not affording him a pretermination hearing or posttermination hearing, and refusing to reinstate him to his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Lucas\u2019s cause of action for wrongful termination alleged the State\u2019s conduct violated fundamental public policy that public employees be terminated only for just cause and with due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Lucas\u2019s cause of action for writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 alleged the State acted without authority by wrongfully using civil service termination procedures to terminate his employment and refusing to reinstate him upon withdrawing the notice of adverse action; upon withdrawing all charges against him, the State had a clear, present, ministerial duty enjoined by law to reinstate him to his job; and the State should be estopped from asserting his service retirement as a bar to reinstating him since the State acted wrongfully/fraudulently to induce his retirement and reinstatement would not harm any public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Lucas\u2019s complaint asked the court to enjoin the State from further due process violations against him, grant equitable relief including reinstatement to his former position, and award damages. Lucas\u2019s complaint also sought a writ of mandate ordering the State to set aside his retirement and reinstate him to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\n<em>State\u2019s Demurrer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The State demurred to Lucas\u2019s complaint on various grounds including failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Lucas\u2019s alleged harm was assertedly caused not by the State but instead by Lucas\u2019s voluntary retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In May 1996 the State\u2019s demurrer to Lucas\u2019s complaint came for hearing. As requested by the State, the superior court judicially noticed the State\u2019s notice of adverse action, Lucas\u2019s application to PERS for service retirement, Lucas\u2019s letter to personnel administration requesting reinstatement, and the SPB\u2019s letter about withdrawal of the adverse action.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">After hearing, the superior court sustained the State\u2019s demurrer to Lucas\u2019s entire complaint without leave to amend. Citing <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Department of Personnel Administration </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1102 [278 Cal.Rptr. 346, 805 P.2d 300] and <em>Pyne </em>v. <em>Meese </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 392 [218 Cal.Rptr. 87], the court concluded that Lucas\u2019s \u201cvoluntary retirement\u201d before the SPB hearing \u201cterminated\u201d his \u201cproperty interest in the procedural safeguards afforded to him under\u201d <em>Shelly. </em>The court also concluded: \u201cTherefore, [Lucas\u2019s] request for reinstatement was untimely under Govt Code \u00a7 19996.1 and <em>Bidwell </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Youth </em>Authority] (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 213 [210 Cal.Rptr. 381].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court entered judgment dismissing Lucas\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Lucas appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The facts alleged by Lucas were sufficient to plead claims against the State under the governing statutory scheme. For purposes of disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>proceedings involving separation from service, the State\u2019s dismissal of Lucas was an \u201cadverse action.\u201d (\u00a7 19570.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lucas was thus separated from service by involuntary termination. After such involuntary separation from service and pending hearing on his SPB appeal, Lucas sought and obtained service retirement benefits. Before the SPB hearing, the State withdrew its adverse action against Lucas. (\u00a7 19579.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon the State\u2019s withdrawal of the adverse action, Lucas was no longer separated from service by involuntary termination. Thus, Lucas pleaded facts that could establish the withdrawal effectively entitled Lucas to reinstatement to his former position unless such right was extinguished by Lucas\u2019s service retirement in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The State contends the superior court correctly determined Lucas\u2019s service retirement constituted resignation from employment and Lucas did not timely seek reinstat\u00e9ment from such resignation. (\u00a7 19996.1.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in light of the statutes governing separation from service, the court\u2019s determination was not consonant with the facts pleaded by Lucas. Specifically, section 19140, subdivision (a), expressly distinguishes separation from a civil service position by resignation and separation by service retirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, section 19996 expressly distinguishes among separations from service by resignation, removal for cause, and retirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We thus conclude that since Lucas sought and obtained service retirement benefits only after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>he was already separated from service by removal for cause (involuntary termination), his service retirement did not constitute a separation from service by resignation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, because Lucas was not separated from service by resignation, service retirement or other ground specified in section 19140, subdivision (a), we must also reject the State\u2019s attempt to deny Lucas reinstatement by invoking the appointing power\u2019s discretion mentioned in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Our conclusions are consistent with portions of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law governing reinstatement from retirement of persons retired for service after involuntary termination and later reinstated to employment. (\u00a721198; see also \u00a7 21220, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although not precisely applicable because there was no administrative or judicial determination reinstating Lucas to employment, section 21198 is instructive as expressly contemplating a situation involving reinstatement to civil service employment of a person retired for service after involuntary employment termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In sum, Lucas retired for service after the State involuntarily terminated his employment by dismissal for asserted cause. Once the State withdrew its disciplinary action before the SPB, Lucas continued seeking reinstatement to his former position. The State rejected Lucas\u2019s request for reinstatement. However, since the State\u2019s withdrawal of its disciplinary action foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Lucas from pursuing an administrative determination reinstating his employment, Lucas has by this lawsuit properly sought a judicial order of employment reinstatement. Such order would also form the basis for his reinstatement from retirement under section 21198.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Hence, since Lucas\u2019s complaint adequately pleaded facts entitling him to relief against the State under the governing statutes, we conclude the superior court erred in sustaining the State\u2019s demurrer. Determination whether Lucas can prove the alleged facts and overcome any defenses interposed by the State awaits another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The judgment is reversed. Lucas shall have costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">Huffman, J., and Haller, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"><em> Skelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 194 [124 Cal.Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d 774].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> A11 statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> As a ground for demurrer to Lucas\u2019s pleaded cause of action for wrongful termination, the State asserted that \u201cto the extent it alleges the tort of wrongful termination on the basis of violation of Government Code section 19572, California and the U.S. Constitution, [such claim] fails to articulate a fundamental public policy which inures to the benefit of the public, rather than plaintiff.\u201d However, in sustaining the State\u2019s demurrer on other grounds, the superior court did not reach the issue whether Lucas adequately pleaded a violation of public policy. Further, the State\u2019s appellate brief did not address that issue. Hence, we do not reach the issue whether Lucas has adequately pleaded a discharge in violation of public policy. Moreover, nothing in our opinion should be construed as expressing any view on that issue. Instead, the matter may be decided in the future by the superior court under an appropriate procedure such as motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> In <em>Bidwell </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Youth Authority </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 213, 218-219 [210 Cal.Rptr. 381], the appellate court deemed mandatory the 30-day limitations period contained in section 19996.1 for petitioning to set aside a resignation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b624-5\"> Section 19570 defines \u201c \u2018adverse action\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201cdismissal, demotion, suspension, or other disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> Section 19579 provides: \u201cFailure of either party (the employee, the employer, or their representatives) to proceed at the hearing shall be deemed a withdrawal of the action or appeal, unless the hearing is continued by mutual agreement of the parties, or upon showing of good cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Section 19996.1, a Personnel Administration statute involving separation from service, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Resignations from the state civil service are subject to department [Department of Personnel Administration] rules. ...
