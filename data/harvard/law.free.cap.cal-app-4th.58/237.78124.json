Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">John Creighton et al., appeal from a judgment in favor of the Board of Regents of the University of California in a class action challenging the university\u2019s voluntary early retirement incentive program on contract clause and equal protection grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The University of California manages three national laboratories under contracts with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Laboratory employees are covered by the University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP), a \u201cdefined benefit\u201d plan funded by employer and employee contributions. The UCRP provides monthly pension benefits based primarily on retirees\u2019 final salary, age, and years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In the spring of 1993, DOE advised the university to expect declining laboratory budgets resulting in the loss of about 1,500 positions. In order to minimize the number of involuntary layoffs, the university decided to offer a voluntary early retirement incentive program paid for by a surplus in the retirement fund. On May 21, 1993, while still consulting with DOE on the details, the Regents passed a resolution to amend the UCRP to authorize \u201cVERIP-m.\u201d Under this program, an eligible laboratory employee who, between July 1 and October 1,1993, elected to retire on November 1, 1993, would receive credit for three additional years of age and five additional years of service, as well as a lump-sum \u201ctransition assistance payment\u201d equal to three months\u2019 covered compensation (the \u201c3+5+3\u201d plan). In light of a shortfall in the university\u2019s state funding, at their June 18, 1993, meeting the Regents passed a resolution amending the UCRP to offer a similar VERIP-HI to campus employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Meanwhile, DOE was voicing objections to VERIP-III on the grounds that it might cause a major loss of key scientific personnel at the laboratories, and was more generous than similar programs at its other contractor-run facilities. After extensive negotiations, the university, concerned about maintaining its laboratory management contracts, reached an understanding with DOE. Accordingly, at their July 16, 1993, meeting, the Regents passed a resolution amending VERIP-HI to reduce the years of service credit from five to three for eligible retiring laboratory employees only (the \u201c3+3+3\u201d plan). The university mailed VERIP-III application packets to eligible employees. Those who applied were sent election packages stating what their monthly payments would be. Those who then wished to participate submitted written election forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Appellants represent the class of laboratory employees who were eligible to retire under VERIP-IH on May 21, 1993, continued to work through July 16, 1993, and thereafter elected to participate in the program, retiring on November 1, 1993. On April 8, 1994, they filed a second amended petition for writ of mandate, application for declaratory and injunctive relief, and complaint for damages, in which they alleged six causes of action based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>theories of impairment and breach of contract, third party beneficiary rights, breach of fiduciary duty, and equal protection. Appellants eventually dismissed their third party beneficiary claims, and the Regents\u2019 demurrer was sustained as to breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On October 17, 1995, the Regents filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c). On October 31, 1995, appellants filed a motion for writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1084 et seq.). The motions were consolidated for hearing, after which the trial court took the matter under submission. In its order after hearing, the court granted the Regents\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of appellants\u2019 contract causes of action but, finding the equal protection claim could not be summarily adjudicated, resolved that issue in the Regents\u2019 favor by denying appellants\u2019 petition for writ of mandate. On February 15, 1996, the trial court filed its judgment, and appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">A. <em>Contract Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The trial court disposed of appellants\u2019 contract claims on the Regents\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of issues,  \u201cIn reviewing an order granting summary adjudication of issues, we are governed by the rules generally applicable to review of summary judgments. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Heredia </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1345, 1353 [279 Cal.Rptr. 511].) \u201cThe standard of review in summary judgment cases is that of independent review. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Environmental Protection Information Center </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1015 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 892].)  \u201cA defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing a complete defense or negating each of the plaintiff\u2019s theories and establishing the action is without merit. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ramona Convent of the Holy Names </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 10, 19 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In their motion for summary adjudication of issues, the Regents claimed their July 16, 1993, amendment to VERIP-III, changing the terms from 3+5+3 to 3+3+3, did not constitute impairment or breach of contract, because the 3+5+3 incentive was not a vested pension right. The trial court agreed. Appellants challenge that conclusion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u201cTerms and conditions relating to public employment are controlled by statute or ordinance rather than by ordinary contract standards. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Thorning </em>v. <em>Hollister School Dist. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1598, 1605 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>[15 Cal.Rptr.2d 91].) However, a statutory grant to public employees of pension rights in return for services has long been held to imply a contractual obligation. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 494, 505-506 [202 Cal.Rptr. 611].) \u201cA public employee\u2019s pension constitutes an element of compensation, and a vested contractual right to pension benefits accrues upon acceptance of employment. Such a pension right may not be destroyed, once vested, without impairing a contractual obligation of the employing public entity.\u201d <em>(Betts </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 859, 863 [148 Cal.Rptr. 158, 582 P.2d 614] <em>(Betts), </em>citing <em>Kern </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 848, 852-853 [179 P.2d 799] <em>(Kern).) </em>An employee\u2019s contractual pension expectations are measured not only by benefits in effect when employment commences, but also by those conferred during the employee\u2019s subsequent tenure. <em>(Betts, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 866.) This principle has been applied to disability as well as service retirement benefits <em>(Frank </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 236, 243 [128 Cal.Rptr. 378]), to postretirement health benefits <em>(Thorning </em>v. <em>Hollister School Dist., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1602), and even to certain nonpension benefits <em>(California League of City Employee Associations </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Library Dist. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 135, 137, 139-140 [150 Cal.Rptr. 739] [longevity salary increase, extra vacation, paid sabbatical]).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The trial court found, however, that <em>Kern </em>and its progeny did not govern this case, because VERIP-III \u201cis not a retirement benefit for which employees accept lower compensation now with the expectation of future benefits,\u201d but rather, \u201cmore in the nature of a current gift which is offered to induce foreshortened service.\u201d Appellants note that the trial court\u2019s characterization seems to run afoul of the prohibition against making gifts of public funds (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 6; <em>Kern, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d at p. 851).  We are not bound, however, by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons, since we review the ruling, not its rationale. <em>(Ramona Convent of the Holy Names </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 19.)  That VERIP-III is not a \u201cgift\u201d does not mean it is a vested pension right.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The Regents emphasize the trial court\u2019s finding that VERIP-III was \u201coffered to induce foreshortened service,\u201d whereas pension benefits generally consist of compensation \u201c \u2018withheld to induce long-continued and faithful services.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kern, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d at p. 852.) Appellants argue that if this distinction were determinative\u2014if the characterization of rights or benefits were entirely dependent upon the employer\u2019s stated reason for offering them\u2014then \u201cemployee handbooks, personnel manuals, and policies relating to retirement would soon be filled with such reasons,\u201d defeating the rule of <em>Kern </em>and its progeny. But even if, as appellants insist, VERIP-HI <em>is </em>a retirement benefit, it is different <em>in kind </em>from the benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>governed by the <em>Kem-Betts </em>line of cases, none of which concerned a one-time, special, elective incentive offered to eligible employees during a short, specified \u201cwindow\u201d period, in response to specific financial exigencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In recognition of this difference, both versions of VERIP-III expressly provide: \u201cNotwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the crediting of additional age [credit] and Service Credit under Section 5 and/or payments associated with this contingent program shall not be a vested or accrued Plan benefit.\u201d (Par. 9(c), bracketed word added to July 16 version.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Appellants maintain that paragraph 9(c) means that the <em>only </em>two circumstances which do <em>not </em>trigger vesting of VERIP-III are (1) the crediting of additional age and service credits, and (2) the payment of enhanced benefits. Thus, they argue, paragraph 9(c) does not preclude their claim that their performance of services after May 21 gave rise to a vested contractual right. This interpretation is, in the Regents\u2019 words, \u201cstrange and incomprehensible. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As appellants remind us, ambiguous language in a retirement plan is subject to judicial construction <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 219, 224 [106 Cal.Rptr. 299]), and pension provisions should be liberally construed to favor the applicant <em>(Flint </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Employees\u2019 Retirement Assn. </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 659, 666 [210 Cal.Rptr. 439]). A provision is, however, ambiguous only when it is susceptible of two or more reasonable constructions. <em>(Delgado </em>v. <em>Heritage Life Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 262, 271 [203 Cal.Rptr. 672].) When, on the other hand, the language is clear and unambiguous, \u201c. . . there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d <em>(Solberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182, 198 [137 Cal-Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148].)  The latter principle applies here. We have no difficulty in concluding that the language in paragraph 9(c) clearly and unambiguously means that VERIP-III creates no vested right to either its additional age and service credits or the resulting enhanced pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Appellants contend that at the demurrer hearing the Regents \u201cconceded that the University could not seriously endorse the literal language of section 9(c).\u201d At the hearing in question, appellants argued that, if the enhanced benefits conferred by VERIP-III were not \u201cvested,\u201d an employee might retire and collect them for a time, only to have them canceled some years down the road. The court then asked the Regents at what stage the benefits would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cbecome vested\u201d to the point where this could not happen. The Regents replied that, once an employee retires and starts receiving payment in conformance with the terms of VERIP-III, \u201cwe would concede this is a vested benefit.\u201d This \u201cconcession\u201d is quite the opposite of appellants\u2019 reading of paragraph 9(c): The actual receipt of \u201cpayments associated with\u201d the program, i.e., enhanced benefits based on additional age and service credits, is the only event which <em>does </em>trigger \u201cvesting,\u201d in the sense that it gives rise to a right to continued enhanced payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Thus, the real meaning of the Regents\u2019 \u201cconcession\u201d is this: VERIP-III is not a pension benefit which immediately vests by implication as in the <em>Kern-Betts </em>line of cases. Rather, it is a limited offer of enhanced benefits which, upon an eligible employee\u2019s timely acceptance (election to participate, formalized between July 1 and October 1, 1993), and with consideration (retirement on November 1, 1993), creates a separate binding contract. Since there was no acceptance or consideration in response to the Regents\u2019 May 21 offer of a 3+5+3 plan by appellants, no binding contract was established. It follows that the withdrawal of that offer and substitution of the 3+3+3 plan on July 16 did not constitute impairment or breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We need not decide whether, as the Regents contend, the disclaimer in paragraph 9(c) is itself determinative on the grounds that \u201c. . . there can be no implied contractual term completely at variance with an express term of a contract\u201d <em>(Wagner </em>v. <em>Glendale Adventist Medical Center </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1379, 1393 [265 Cal.Rptr. 412]). Nor are we faced with the broader question of whether such a disclaimer would suffice to divest employees of the kind of pension rights at issue in <em>Kern </em>and <em>Betts. </em>We hold only that a one-time limited offer of special incentives for early retirement, accompanied by such an express disclaimer, is not governed by the <em>KernBetts </em>rule, and can be withdrawn or altered before acceptance without violating a vested contractual right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">B. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Appellants claimed below that the July 16 amendment to VERIPIII, reducing service credits for laboratory but not campus employees, violated their constitutional right to equal protection of the laws (Cal. Const., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>art. I, \u00a77, subd. (a)). Equal protection requires \u201cthat persons <em>similarly situated </em>with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(College Area Renters &amp; Landlord Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 677, 686 [43 Cal.App.4th 677, 50 Cal.Rptr.2d 515], italics in original.) If a law discriminates between similarly situated persons, \u201cthe classification (in ordinary cases) must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose .... [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The trial court found that whether laboratory and campus employees were similarly situated, and whether the Regents had a rational basis for distinguishing between the two groups, were questions of fact which could not be summarily adjudicated. It therefore considered appellants\u2019 equal protection claim as part of their writ petition. It denied that petition after finding that substantial evidence supported the determination that the two groups of university employees were not similarly situated \u201cand in any event, there is a rational basis for the differentiation in benefits.\u201d Based on these statements, the Regents contend the substantial evidence standard of review governs this claim on appeal. Elsewhere, however, they concede there was no real dispute as to any of the relevant facts, but simply a disagreement as to the legal effect of those facts.  \u201cWhen the facts before an administrative agency are uncontradicted, the trial court\u2019s determination of their legal effect involves solely a question of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Swaby </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 264, 269 [149 Cal.Rptr. 336].) \u201cOn questions of law arising in mandate proceedings, we exercise independent judgment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Burnett </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 843, 849 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 567].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellants contend they were treated differently from \u201csimilarly situated Plan [UCRP] participants (i.e., non-laboratory University employees eligible to participate in VERIP),\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and argue that the Regents\u2019 stated reasons for the differential treatment were not rationally related to the purpose of the UCRP, i.e., to provide retirement income to eligible university employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">There are several fallacies in this argument. To begin with, the \u201claw\u201d at issue here is not the UCRP, but VERIP-III, the purpose of which is to induce voluntary early retirement in lieu of involuntary layoffs which would otherwise be necessary. With respect to <em>this </em>legitimate purpose, appellants\u2019 assumption that eligible laboratory and nonlaboratory university employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>were similarly situated is simply not true. The two groups were engaged in different missions, at different locations, with different funding sources and constraints, and different staffing needs. Laboratory employees, engaged in scientific research, were subject to cutbacks in federal spending at the end of the cold war, which brought a change in focus from nuclear defense and weapons programs to such fields as environmental restoration and waste management. Campus employees, engaged in higher education, were threatened with cutbacks resulting from repeated shortfalls in the state budget. Appellants do not dispute the fact that, \u201c[t]he workforce reduction and restructuring needs differed between the national laboratories and the University\u2019s campuses.\u201d This concession leads to the inescapable conclusion that the two groups were not similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of VERIP-HI, and defeats appellants\u2019 equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Lambden, J., and Ruvolo, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 4, 1997, and appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme court was denied January 14, 1998.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> The preamble to the program defines it in words which emphasize its contingent, short-term nature: \u201cA special contingent financial incentive available for a fixed time period to effect substantial payroll savings in light of severe and cumulative budgetary shortfalls to a select targeted group of employee-Plan Members.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> At oral argument, appellants\u2019 counsel contended the option became \u201cvested\u201d immediately upon any claimant continuing in employment for even one day after the program\u2019s adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> In light of this conclusion, we need not reach appellants\u2019 contention that the Regents\u2019 July 16 resolution was an invalid amendment to VERIP-III under both case law governing modification of vested pension rights (see <em>Claypool </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 646, 665-666 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 77], and cases cited therein) and the UCRP revision provision (\u00a711.14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Certain nonlaboratory university employees, such as high-level administrators, were excluded altogether from VERIP-III, and members of the U.C.
