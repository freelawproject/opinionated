Zavala\u2019s amended complaint alleged three causes of action, named the father of the child (Gabriel Valdez) as a coplaintiff, and suggested in the title of the pleading that she was suing for wrongful death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Zavala\u2019s appellate briefs clarify Valdez is not a party to this appeal, she is not suing for wrongful death damages, and her appeal is only directed to the dismissal of her own claim for emotional distress damages based on a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Zavala appeals, contending the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Arce should be reversed because the cotut erred in ruling as a matter of law she had not stated, and could not state a claim for \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress damages. We thus address the issue whether a mother can recover monetary damages under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory of liability for emotional distress she has suffered as a result of the in \u00fatero death of her postterm fetus allegedly caused by the professional negligence of a physician with whom she entered into a physician-patient relationship for care during labor and delivery. Zavala further contends that because the court granted summary judgment solely on the ground she could not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, we may not review de novo the issue of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>evidence presented by the parties was sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">We agree with Zavala\u2019s first contention, and conclude the first cause of action alleged in her amended complaint is sufficient to constitute a professional negligence cause of action under which emotional distress damages are recoverable based on a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory. Because the professional malpractice alleged in this action, if proved by a preponderance of the evidence, would constitute a breach of a duty of care owed to the mother (Zavala) as well as to her postterm fetus, we hold the mother has stated a claim for recovery of \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress damages resulting from the breach of the duty. For public policy reasons, however, the mother\u2019s recoverable damages do not extend to emotional distress resulting from the loss of her child\u2019s affection, society, companionship and love, or other similar loss of filial consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Disagreeing with Zavala\u2019s second contention, we review de novo the merits of Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We conclude there are triable issues of material fact whether the medical care Dr. Arce provided to Zavala and her postterm fetus fell below the standard of care applicable to obstetricians under the factual circumstances from which this action arose, and whether any such negligence was a legal cause of the death of the fetus and any emotional distress Zavala may have suffered as a result thereof. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Factual Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">On January 21, 1993, when she was approximately 17 weeks into her pregnancy, Zavala became Dr. Arce\u2019s patient. Dr. Arce\u2019s partner was Dr. Del Aguila. Dr. Arce told Zavala her estimated delivery due date was June 29, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">On July 9,1993, more than a week after Zavala\u2019s due date, Dr. Del Aguila examined her and wrote in her medical chart, \u201cIf not deliver <em>[sic] </em>in less than three days, possible induction.\u201d On July 12 Dr. Arce examined Zavala, who informed him Dr. Del Aguila was going to induce labor and she was prepared to go to the hospital for that purpose. Dr. Arce told her labor would not be induced at that time because her cervix had not sufficiently dilated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>Dr. Arce wrote in Zavala\u2019s medical chart, \u201cPlan sono[gram] to rule out oligohydramnios.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">When Zavala returned the next day, July 13, Dr. Arce performed a sonogram. Although Dr. Arce testified during his deposition that the sonogram showed an amniotic fluid index of eight, Zavala testified during her deposition that Dr. Arce told her an eight was normal and although she had a five, indicating a low amniotic fluid level, there was no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Dr. Arce next saw Zavala on July 15, at which time he told her he would induce labor and delivery of her baby on Saturday, July 17. Following Dr. Arce\u2019s instructions, Zavala admitted herself into the hospital at 5 p.m. on July 17. She had felt her baby move in the morning, and believed he was still alive when she arrived at the hospital. Dr. Arce arrived and ordered a sonogram, which showed Zavala had oligohydramnios with an amniotic fluid index in the \u201clow millimeters\u201d and confirmed the baby had died. Zavala believed her baby was alive and healthy until she learned from Dr. Arce her baby had died. Dr. Milgram replaced Dr. Arce as Zavala\u2019s obstetrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Zavala spent the night of July 17 in the hospital with the deceased fetus still inside her womb, and the stillbirth delivery took place the next day after labor was induced. After consulting with Dr. Milgram, Dr. Arce determined the cause of the fetal death was an abrupt umbilical cord compression.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">A. <em>Zavala\u2019s Operative First Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">As we have discussed, Zavala\u2019s operative first amended complaint alleges three causes of action on her own behalf: medical malpractice (first cause of action), negligent infliction of emotional distress based on a bystander theory of liability (second cause of action), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (third cause of action). We note again although the title of Zavala\u2019s amended pleading suggests her malpractice claim is based on a wrongful death theory of liability, her appellate reply brief clarifies she is not suing for wrongful death damages and she concedes her only potentially viable cause of action is her \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress damages set forth in her first cause of action for medical malpractice. In her briefs Zavala also admits the father of her deceased baby (Valdez), who is named as a coplaintiff in her amended pleading, is no longer a party to this action. We thus limit our remaining discussion of the procedural history of this case to those matters affecting Zavala\u2019s purported \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>With respect to her first cause of action for medical malpractice, Zavala alleged in paragraph 8 of her amended complaint that she had a patient-physician relationship with Dr. Arce for medical care for herself and her fetus during her pregnancy. In paragraph 9, she alleged Dr. Arce negligently breached a duty of care he owed to her by negligently causing the death of her unborn child. With respect to the elements of damages and causation, Zavala alleged in paragraph 10 that as a result of Dr. Arce\u2019s negligence she \u201csuffered injury to her health, strength, and activities all of which injuries have caused, and continue to cause, [her] great mental, physical, and nervous pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">B. <em>Dr. Arce\u2019s Motion for Summary </em>Judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Dr. Arce filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting there was no merit to Zavala\u2019s action as a matter of law because she had not pleaded a claim for emotional distress under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory. Dr. Arce also argued that Zavala\u2019s first cause of action was a wrongful death claim based on the death of a fetus; that Zavala admitted the fetus had died prior to delivery; and thus to allow Zavala to recover damages on a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory would impermissibly allow a recovery for the death of a fetus contrary to the holding in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 580 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122], that a wrongful death action may not be maintained for the death of an unborn child. Dr. Arce further asserted he did not owe Zavala a duty of care, and Zavala was unable to present evidence creating a triable issue of material fact as to a breach of any standard of care and causation because she could not submit an adequate expert witness declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Zavala opposed the motion for summary judgment and submitted the declaration of her expert witness, Dr. Robert Trifunovic, who stated he had reviewed the medical charts and records, as well as the various deposition transcripts, and had concluded the care and treatment Dr. Arce had provided to Zavala fell below the standard of care. Dr. Trifunovic also stated it was his opinion that \u201clabor should have been induced when requested (prior to the fetal demise).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In her written opposition, Zavala argued she had alleged a viable wrongful death claim notwithstanding the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at page 580, that a wrongful death action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>may not be maintained for the death of an unborn child. Quoting from <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1076 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 831 P.2d 1197] (\u201cAny negligence during delivery which causes injury to the fetus and resultant emotional anguish to the mother, therefore, breaches a duty owed directly to the mother\u201d), Zavala also argued she had properly pleaded a \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">C. <em>The Court\u2019s Summary Judgment Ruling in Favor of Dr. Arce</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On September 30, 1994, the court issued a telephonic ruling granting Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ruling, however, was silent with respect to Zavala\u2019s claim for \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress damages. The court construed the first cause of action for medical malpractice to be a wrongful death claim which was barred as a matter of law by the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at page 580 (holding a wrongful death action may not be maintained for the death of an unborn child).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">On October 14, 1994, the court entertained oral argument with respect to its telephonic ruling granting Dr. Arce\u2019s summary judgment motion. Zavala\u2019s counsel argued Zavala\u2019s \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress as alleged in the first cause of action for medical malpractice was permitted under the decisions in <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1064, and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 1002 [177 Cal.Rptr. 63].</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Dr. Arce\u2019s counsel argued the <em>Burgess </em>and <em>Johnson </em>cases were distinguishable, Zavala had failed to plead a \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress claim, and she could not recover on a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory because <em>Burgess </em>allows such recovery only when the baby is bom alive after suffering an injury as a result of professional negligence during delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The court took the matter under submission, and later issued an undated minute order, which was apparently served on counsel by facsimile transmission on October 24, 1994, confirming the telephonic mling granting Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in favor of Dr. Arce.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">D. <em>Zavala\u2019s Unsuccessful Motion for a New Trial and Her Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Zavala filed a motion for new trial under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> section 657, subdivision 7, on the ground the court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Arce was an error in law which materially affected her rights. This motion was based on Zavala\u2019s assertion she had properly stated a claim for emotional distress as a \u201cdirect victim\u201d under <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In a final telephonic mling issued on March 3, 1995, without oral argument, the court denied Zavala\u2019s motion for a new trial. The court reasoned the <em>Burgess </em>case was distinguishable because it involved a live birth, Zavala had not alleged a claim for negligent delivery, and there was no \u201cawareness of injury by plaintiff Diana Zavala until after the death of the fetus.\u201d Zavala timely appealed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In evaluating the propriety of a grant of summary judgment our review is de novo, and we independently review the record before the trial <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 189.) In practical effect, we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards which govern a trial court\u2019s determination of a motion for summary judgment. <em>(Lopez </em>v. <em>University Partners </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1121-1122 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 359].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Under section 437c, subdivision (c), a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.; Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].) Because the granting of a summary judgment motion under section 437c involves pure questions of law, we are required to reassess the legal significance and effect of the papers presented by the parties in connection with the motion. <em>(Ranchwood Communities Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>Jim Beat Construction Co. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1408 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 386].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">We apply the same three-step analysis required of the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>(Ranchwood Communities Limited </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number><em>Partnership </em>v. <em>Jim Beat Construction Co., supra, 49 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1408.) First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings because the court\u2019s sole function on a motion for summary judgment is to determine from the submitted evidence whether there is a \u201ctriable issue as to any material fact\u201d (\u00a7 437c, subd. (c)), and to be \u201cmaterial\u201d a fact must relate to some claim or defense <em>in issue </em>under the pleadings (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial 3 (The Rutter Group 1997) \u00b6\u00b6 10:270 to 10:271).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Second, we determine whether the moving party has met its statutory burden of proof under either (1) subdivision (o)(l) of section 437c if the plaintiff or cross-complainant is the moving party, in which case he or she must produce admissible evidence of \u201c. . . each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action. . . ;\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or (2) under subdivision (o)(2) of section 437c if the defendant or cross-defendant is the moving party, in which case he or she must produce admissible evidence showing that \u201c. . . one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Finally, if the moving party has met its statutory burden of proof and the summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, we determine whether the opposing party has met its burden of demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of one or more material facts as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(l-2).) In making this determination, we strictly construe the evidence of the moving party and liberally construe that of the opponent, and any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn., supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 1107; <em>Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>Dr. Arce Owed a Duty of Care to Zavala</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Zavala contends the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Arce should be reversed because the court erred in ruling as a matter of law she had not, and could not, state a claim for emotional distress damages under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory of liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the facts of this case, the issue presented is whether a mother can recover monetary damages under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory of liability for emotional distress she has suffered as a result of the in \u00fatero death of her postterm fetus caused by the professional negligence of a physician with whom she entered into a physician-patient relationship for care during labor and delivery. The determination of this issue, however, necessarily involves a determination whether Dr. Arce owed a duty of care to Zavala, the negligent breach of which would allow Zavala to recover emotional distress damages resulting from such breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">A. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Citing <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1064, Zavala contends Dr. Arce owed her a duty of care to protect the health and well-being of her unborn child. Implicit in her argument is the contention Dr. Arce owed her a duty of care to avoid causing her to suffer emotional distress from a negligently inflicted injury to her unborn child.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Distinguishing the <em>Burgess </em>case on the ground it involved a <em>live </em>birth and the mother was allegedly aware that her baby was in jeopardy during the delivery, Dr. Arce contends an obstetrician does not owe a duty of care to an expectant mother regarding emotional distress she suffers when her fetus is stillborn as a result of the obstetrician\u2019s negligence. Dr. Arce cites <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 564, for the proposition that \u201cCalifornia law does not permit the grieving parents of a stillborn child to recover emotional distress damages, even if liability somehow could be proven.\u201d He further asserts \u201c[t]he sound public policy of not expanding tort liability to cover emotional distress from stillborn births is apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>B. <em>Dr. Arce Owed Zavala a Duty of Care as a Matter of Law Under the Burgess and Johnson Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We begin our analysis by recognizing it is well established that \u201c \u2018[t]he <em>negligent </em>causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort but the tort of <em>negligence . . . </em>.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply. [^Q Whether a defendant owes a duty of care is a question of law. Its existence depends upon the foreseeability of the risk and upon a weighing of policy considerations for and against imposition of liability.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Marlene F. </em>v. <em>Affiliated Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588 [257 Cal.Rptr. 98, 770 P.2d 278], italics in the original; accord, <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1072.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\u201cDirect victim\u201d emotional distress cases, as distinguished from \u201cbystander\u201d cases, are those in which damages for serious emotional distress are sought as a result of a breach of duty owed the plaintiff that is \u201c \u2018assumed by the defendant or imposed on the defendant as a matter of law, or that arises out of a relationship between the two.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1073.) In these cases, the limits on recovery in \u201cbystander\u201d cases as set forth in <em>Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 644, 647 [257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814], have no direct application, and well-settled principles of negligence are invoked to determine whether all elements of a cause of action, including duty, are present in a given case. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1073.) The term \u201cdirect victim\u201d is defined by the principle that a cause of action to recover damages for negligently inflicted emotional distress will lie, notwithstanding the criteria imposed upon recovery by bystanders, in cases where a duty arising from a preexisting relationship is negligently breached. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1074.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">1. <em>Burgess v. Superior Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Our Supreme Court has held in a factually similar case that when an obstetrician and a pregnant woman enter into a physician-patient relationship \u201c. . . the physician owes a duty to the pregnant woman with respect to the medical treatment provided to her fetus. Any negligence during delivery which causes injury to the fetus and resultant emotional anguish to the mother, therefore, breaches a duty owed directly to the mother.\u201d <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1076.) Because Dr. Arce contends <em>Burgess </em>is factually distinguishable, and the court below agreed with this contention in granting summary judgment in his favor, we further examine the <em>Burgess </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">In <em>Burgess, </em>a mother sued her obstetrician for negligently inflicted emotional distress after her baby suffered severe brain and nervous system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>damage during delivery. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1069-1070.) The undisputed facts established that shortly after the obstetrician artificially ruptured the mother\u2019s membranes, the mother heard him yell to the nurse: \u201cEmergency, prolapsed cord.\u201d Approximately 21 minutes elapsed between the time the obstetrician diagnosed the cord prolapse and the time the mother was taken to emergency surgery for a cesarean section delivery of the baby. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1070.) Although the baby was bom alive, he died during the litigation allegedly as a result of his injuries. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The mother in <em>Burgess </em>brought a medical malpractice action against the obstetrician alleging negligence in the delivery of her child. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1070.) The obstetrician brought a motion requesting summary adjudication that the mother was not entitled to recover damages for emotional distress. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1071.) In support of his motion, the obstetrician argued the mother had not contemporaneously observed her child\u2019s injury as required by the decision in <em>Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 644, for recovery in a \u201cbystander\u201d situation, and she was not a direct victim of his alleged negligence under <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 916 [167 Cal.Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813, 16 A.L.R.4th 518]. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1071.) Relying principally on <em>Thing, </em>the trial court granted the motion. The Court of Appeal granted the mother\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate to vacate the trial court\u2019s order. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Burgess </em>modified the Court of Appeal judgment to direct the trial court to reverse its order of summary adjudication, and held that although public policy precludes parents from recovering damages for loss of filial consortium, the mother was not barred from recovering damages as a \u201cdirect victim\u201d for emotional distress \u201carising from the \u2018abnormal event\u2019 of participating in a negligent delivery and reacting to the tragic outcome with fright, nervousness, grief, anxiety, worry, mortification, shock, humiliation and indignity, physical pain, or other similar distress.\u201d <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1085.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Here we are presented, as was the California Supreme Court in <em>Burgess, </em>with a \u201ctraditional\u201d plaintiff who has alleged a professional negligence cause of action against her former obstetrician for recovery of emotional distress damages caused by the obstetrician\u2019s negligence during the plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy resulting in physical injury to herself and to her in \u00fatero child. In paragraph 8 of her first amended complaint, Zavala alleges in connection with her first cause of action for medical malpractice that she had a patient-physician relationship with Dr. Arce for medical care for herself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>and her fetus during her pregnancy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although her medical malpractice cause of action is pleaded rather generally, her written opposition to Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment and her appellate opening brief clearly show she alleges the death of her baby and her resultant emotional distress were caused by Dr. Arce\u2019s negligent delay in inducing labor and delivery at a time when the standard of care required induction due to her postterm, low amniotic fluid pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We reject Dr. Arce\u2019s contention that the <em>Burgess </em>case is inapposite because it involved a <em>live </em>birth. The fact that the baby in <em>Burgess </em>survived the injuries caused by the obstetric negligence during delivery was immaterial to the determination of whether the obstetrician owed a duty of care to the mother. The Supreme Court in <em>Burgess </em>reasoned that \u201c. . . the obstetrician and the pregnant woman [who] enter into a physician-patient relationship . . . understand that the physician owes a duty to the pregnant woman with respect to the medical treatment provided to her fetus,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny negligence during delivery which causes injury to the fetus and resultant emotional anguish to the mother, therefore, breaches a duty owed directly to the mother.\u201d <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1076.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Citing with approval the decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 1002 (see discussion, <em>post), </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Burgess </em>also explained that the courts in California had already recognized a mother\u2019s right to recover for emotional distress she has suffered as a result of the negligently caused stillbirth of her fetus. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1073, 1078.) Noting that during pregnancy the mother and child are a unique physical unit and the welfare of each is intertwined and inseparable, the court quoted from the opinion in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at page 1007: \u201c \u2018It is . . . patently clear that a mother forms a sufficiently close relationship with her fetus during pregnancy so that its stillbirth [or injury] will foreseeably cause her severe emotional distress. Where the stillbirth [or injury] results from medical malpractice rather than from natural and unavoidable causes the loss is all the more poignant and should be legally redressable. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We also reject Dr. Arce\u2019s contention that the <em>Burgess </em>case is inapposite in that it involved a mother who was allegedly aware that her baby was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>jeopardy during the delivery. As we have explained, the limits on recovery applicable to \u201cbystander\u201d cases set forth in <em>Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at page 647\u2014such as the requirement that the \u201cbystander\u201d plaintiff must have been \u201c. . . present at the scene of the injury-producing event at the time it occurred] and [was] then aware that it [was] causing injury to the victim . . . .\u201d\u2014have no direct application in \u201cdirect victim\u201d cases such as the action at bar, and well-settled principles of negligence are invoked in such cases to determine whether all elements of a cause of action, including duty, are present in a given case. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1073.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">2. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Because the Supreme Court in <em>Burgess </em>relied on the decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 1002, we now examine the <em>Johnson </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In <em>Johnson, </em>a mother brought an action against a hospital alleging a cause of action for medical malpractice to recover for her own personal injuries, and a separate \u201ccause of action\u201d for \u201cbystander\u201d negligent infliction of emotional distress, after her baby died in \u00fatero of meconium aspiration while the mother was a maternity patient. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 1004.) The mother alleged she was negligently permitted to remain in labor for over 24 hours \u201c \u2018with ruptured membranes,\u2019 \u201d that she \u201c \u2018felt and perceived her then unborn viable fetus die within her body,\u2019 \u201d and as a result of the sensory perception of the death of the fetus she suffered profound shock and emotional trauma. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The trial court sustained without leave to amend the hospital\u2019s demurrer to the mother\u2019s purported \u201cbystander\u201d cause of action. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 1004.) Reasoning that \u201c. . . the sensory perception of the fetus\u2019 death and the emotional distress which it causes are aspects of the mother\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries which enhance her measure of damages,\u201d the Court of Appeal held the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the \u201cbystander\u201d cause of action, but issued a peremptory writ directing the trial court to permit the mother to amend her malpractice cause of action \u201cto include a claim for damages for the emotional distress suffered as a result of the sensory perception of the death of her fetus . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The importance of the <em>Johnson </em>decision thus lies in its recognition of the right of a mother to recover for emotional distress resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>negligently caused stillbirth of her fetus.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The holding in <em>Johnson </em>strongly supports Zavala\u2019s contention that Dr. Arce owed her a duty of care. The fact that the mother in <em>Johnson </em>alleged her emotional distress resulted from \u201csensory perception\u201d of the death of her fetus was immaterial to the issues of whether the hospital owed the mother a duty of care, and whether the mother could recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress. As we have discussed, the <em>Johnson </em>court stated the mother\u2019s sensory perception of her fetus\u2019s death was merely an \u201caspect\u201d of the mother\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries which \u201cenhance[d] her measure of damages.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">3. <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Dr. Arce cites <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 564, for the proposition that \u201cCalifornia law does not permit the grieving parents of a stillborn child to recover emotional distress damages, even if liability somehow could be proven.\u201d Dr. Arce\u2019s reliance on <em>Justus </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\"><em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>involved two factually similar actions for medical malpractice and wrongful death, each of which arose from the stillbirth of a fetus allegedly caused by negligent obstetrical care. <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 568-569.) The Supreme Court in <em>Justus </em>held that a fetus is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the California wrongful death statute (former \u00a7 377, repealed in 1992 and restated in \u00a7 377.60 et seq. without substantive change), which authorizes a cause of action for the wrongful death of a \u201cperson,\u201d and thus a wrongful death action may not be maintained for the death of an unborn child. <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 580, overruled on other grounds in <em>Ochoa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 171 [216 Cal.Rptr. 661, 703 P.2d 1].) The Supreme Court noted that in each case the mother asserted a personal injury cause of action seeking damages for injuries personally suffered by her in the negligent delivery. (19 Cal.3d at p. 567, fn. 1.) It is significant that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Justus </em>did not affect these personal injury claims asserted by the mothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">4. <em>Dr. Arce Owed a Duty of Care to Zavala, Who May Maintain a \u201cDirect Victim\u201d Claim for Emotional Distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Because Zavala has properly alleged she had a preexisting patient-physician relationship with Dr. Arce for medical care for herself and her fetus during her pregnancy, we hold Dr. Arce owed a duty of care to Zavala with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>respect to the medical treatment he provided to her and her unborn child from the moment she became Dr. Arce\u2019s patient to the time she terminated her patient-physician relationship with him on July 17, 1993, following the confirmation of the in \u00fatero death of her child on that date. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1076.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We further hold a mother can recover monetary damages under a \u201cdirect victim\" theory of liability for emotional distress she has suffered as a result of the in \u00fatero death of her postterm fetus caused by the professional negligence of a physician with whom she entered into a physician-patient relationship for care during labor and delivery. Zavala may thus maintain a properly pleaded claim for emotional distress under a \u201cdirect victim\" theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\n<em>The First Cause of Action for Medical Malpractice as Alleged in Zavala\u2019s First Amended Complaint Is Sufficient to Constitute a Cause of Action for Professional Negligence Under Which Zavala May Seek Recovery of \u201cDirect Victim\u201d Emotional Distress Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Zavala contends the court erred in ruling as a matter of law she had not stated, and could not state a cause of action for emotional distress damages under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">As we have discussed, a claim for negligently inflicted emotional distress is not an independent tort, but the tort of negligence, and the traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply. <em>(Marlene F. </em>v. <em>Affiliated Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc., supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 588; accord, <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1072.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Here, Zavala\u2019s first cause of action for medical malpractice sounds in negligence, and she has sufficiently alleged the essential elements of a professional negligence cause of action, including her claim for \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress as an element of damages. In paragraph 8 of her first amended complaint Zavala properly alleges she had a patient-physician relationship with Dr. Arce for medical care for herself and her fetus during her pregnancy: \u201c8. During a course of treatment Plaintiff employed Defendant Jorge Arce, M.D .... to provide medical treatment and care during the time period of Diana Zavala\u2019s pregnancy. Pursuant to this employment Defendant rendered professional services in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Plaintiff Diana Zavala for her condition, protection, and for the protection of the [P]laintiff\u2019s unborn child, Paulo Valdez.\u201d We have already concluded as a matter of law that Dr. Arce owed a duty of care to Zavala <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>with respect to the medical treatment he provided to her and her unborn child from the moment she became Dr. Arce\u2019s patient to the time she terminated her patient-physician relationship with him on July 17, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In paragraph 9 of her amended pleading, Zavala properly alleges Dr. Arce negligently breached a duty of care he owed to her, and thereby negligently caused the death of her unborn child: \u201c9. From then and after the time of the employment, Defendant[] ... so negligently failed to exercise the proper degree of knowledge and skill in examining, diagnosing, treating, supervising, and caring for Plaintiff Diana Zavala that said negligence caused the death of the [P]laintiff[\u2019s] unborn child Paulo Valdez on or about July 17, 1993. At the time of the death of Paulo Valdez, Diana Zavala was two weeks and four days overdue for her anticipated delivery date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">With respect to the elements of damages and causation, Zavala alleges in paragraph 10 that as a result of Dr. Arce\u2019s negligence she \u201csuffered injury to her health, strength, and activities all of which injuries have caused, and continue to cause, [her] great mental, physical, and nervous pain and suffering.\u201d The allegations in paragraphs 8 through 10 are sufficient to constitute a cause of action for professional negligence and a related \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\n<em>Summary Judgment Must Be Reversed Because Zavala Has Met Her Burden of Showing There Are Triable Issues of Material Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Zavala next contends that because the court granted summary judgment solely on the ground she could not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, we may not review de novo the issue of whether the evidence presented by the parties was sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact. We disagree with this unsupported contention, and review de novo the merits of Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>(Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Zavala does not dispute that Dr. Arce met his statutory burden of proof under subdivision (o)(2) of section 437c of producing admissible evidence showing that \u201c. . . one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. ...\u201d We note that Dr. Arce submitted the declaration of his medical expert, Thomas Moore, M.D., who is a board-certified obstetrician. Dr. Moore stated he had reviewed the medical records and it was his opinion that Dr. Arce\u2019s care and treatment of Zavala was appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>and well within the standard of care. Dr. Moore\u2019s declaration is prima facie evidence that is sufficient to negate the element of breach of duty in Zavala\u2019s professional negligence cause of action. The burden of proof shifted to Zavala to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In her written opposition to Dr. Arce\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Zavala submitted the declaration of her expert witness, Robert Trifunovic, M.D., who stated he is a board-certified obstetrician. Dr. Trifunovic stated he had reviewed the medical charts and records, as well as the various deposition transcripts, and had concluded the care and treatment Dr. Arce had provided to Zavala fell below the standard of care. Dr. Trifunovic also stated it was his opinion that \u201clabor should have been induced when requested (prior to the fetal demise).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Dr. Arce asserts Dr. Trifunovic\u2019s declaration is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact with respect to the element of causation because he did not state an opinion as to the cause of death of the fetus, nor did he opine that Zavala remained in a state of pregnancy longer than the standard of care would dictate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In determining whether Zavala as the party opposing the summary judgment motion has met her burden of demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of one or more material facts as to her professional negligence cause of action, we must strictly construe the evidence of Dr. Arce, who is the moving party, and liberally construe that of Zavala, who is the opposing party. <em>(Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 189.) We must resolve any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion in favor of Zavala, the party opposing the motion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Liberally construing the expert witness declaration of Dr. Trifunovic and resolving any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion in favor of Zavala, we conclude the declaration is sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact with respect to the issue of causation. If the trier of fact agrees with Dr. Trifunovic\u2019s expert opinion that Dr. Arce was negligent in failing to induce labor and delivery of Zavala\u2019s postterm fetus earlier while the fetus was still alive, we believe there is sufficient additional evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably find that but for such negligence the baby would not have died, and Zavala would not have suffered emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Dr. Arce testified during his deposition that he saw Zavala on July 13, 1993, and performed a sonogram. Although Dr. Arce also testified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>sonogram showed an amniotic fluid index of eight, Zavala testified dining her deposition that Dr. Arce told her an eight was normal and although she had a five, indicating a low amniotic fluid level, there was no problem. Zavala stated she had felt the fetus move during the morning of July 17, the day the fetus died. Dr. Arce testified that when he arrived at the hospital later that day he ordered a sonogram, which showed Zavala had oligohydramnios with an amniotic fluid index in the \u201clow millimeters\u201d and confirmed the baby had died. Dr. Arce also testified he determined the cause of the fetal death was an abrupt umbilical cord compression.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">We believe this evidence is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to the propriety of granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Arce. We are mandated to resolve this doubt in favor of Zavala as the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. <em>(Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">We conclude Zavala has met her statutory burden of showing there are triable issues of material fact whether the medical care Dr. Arce provided to her and her postterm fetus fell below the standard of care applicable to obstetricians under the factual circumstances from which this action arose, and whether any such negligence was a legal cause of the death of the fetus and any emotional distress Zavala may have suffered as a result thereof. Accordingly, the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Arce must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">\n<em>For Public Policy Reasons Zavala May Not Recover Damages for Loss of Filial Consortium</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Although we hold Zavala has stated a claim for recovery of \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress damages resulting from the breach of the duty and there are triable issues of material fact, for reasons of public policy expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pages 1084-1085, any such recovery by Zavala is limited as a matter of law. To the extent Zavala\u2019s emotional distress arose from the \u201cabnormal event\u201d of participating in a negligent delivery and reacting to the unexpected outcome of her pregnancy, she may recover damages for fright, nervousness, grief, anxiety, worry, mortification, shock, humiliation and indignity, physical pain, or other similar distress resulting from Dr. Arce\u2019s professional negligence, if any. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>However, for public policy reasons parents in California may not recover for loss of filial consortium.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1084, citing <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 461, 464.) Zavala\u2019s recovery may not include damages for emotional distress arising from loss of her child\u2019s affection, society, companionship and love, or other similar loss of filial consortium. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1085.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We reverse the judgment and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

[Citation.]\" We have already implicitly abandoned our holding in <em>Cox </em>by reviewing grants of summary judgment under the independent (de novo) review standard only. (See, e.g., <em>Branco </em>v. <em>Kearny Moto Park, Inc. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 184, 189 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 392].) We now explicitly reject the application of the abuse of discretion standard in evaluating the propriety of a grant of summary judgment. Although the pre-1973 version of section 437c (California\u2019s summary judgment statute) permitted summary judgment \u201cin the discretion of the court,\u201d the Legislature revised this section in 1973 to make the <em>granting </em>of a motion for summary judgment mandatory if there was no triable issue of material fact. <em>(Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385].) It was the intent of the Legislature in revising section 437c to \u201c. . . abrogate any real discretion the trial court had in <em>granting </em>the motion. [Citation.]\u201d (233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1512, italics added.) The 1973 revision, with certain subsequent modifications not relevant here, still governs the grant of summary judgment. Subdivision (c) of section 437c provides in part that \u201cThe motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\"> Subdivision (o)(l) of section 437c provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acz\">\u201c(o) For purposes of motions for summary judgment. . .:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">\u201c(1) A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> Subdivision (o)(2) of section 437c provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aagk\">\u201c(o) For purposes of motions for summary judgment. . . :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeE\">&lt;(</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj9U\">\u201c(2) A defendant or cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\"> We note the court did not expressly state in the telephonic ruling, at oral argument, or in the formal order granting Dr. Arce\u2019s summary judgment motion that Zavala had not stated and could not state a claim for emotional distress damages under a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory of liability. In her written opposition to the motion, however, Zavala cited <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at page 1076, in support of her argument she had properly pleaded a \u201cdirect victim\u201d claim for emotional distress damages. During oral argument, Dr. Arce\u2019s counsel argued that Zavala had failed to plead a \u201cdirect victim\u201d emotional distress claim, and existing case law did permit her to recover on a \u201cdirect victim\u201d theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\"> Paragraph 8 states in part: \u201c8.
