Sullivan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Sullivan) for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy found in Labor Code section 1025 of the Alcohol and Drug Rehabilitation Act (ADRA) (Lab. Code, \u00a7 1025 et seq.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for violation of section 1025, and for tortious intrusion into privacy. In the published portion of the opinion, we hold that a violation of section 1025 cannot support a cause of action for tortious wrongful termination. In the unpublished portion, we hold that Sullivan did not exhaust his administrative remedies as required before making a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>claim under section 1025, and that the claim for intrusion into privacy was filed after the one-year statute of limitations had run. Consequently, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Sullivan was employed by Delta until his discharge in 1991. In the two years before his discharge, Sullivan struggled with alcohol and drug abuse and was diagnosed as HIV positive. With Delta\u2019s financial support, Sullivan participated in two successive, progressively more intensive inpatient alcohol rehabilitation programs. The second was followed by Sullivan\u2019s participation in a residential rehabilitation program after he returned to work at Delta. In late September 1991, Sullivan\u2019s violation of house rules led to his discharge from the residential treatment program. He then checked himself into a hospital for inpatient psychological treatment, and, after being released by his doctor to return to work, refused to return to work when ordered by Delta. Delta suspended his employment on October 9, terminated him on October 17, and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Sullivan sued Delta on multiple legal theories arising from the termination of his employment. His second amended complaint contained 14 causes of action. Seven survived pretrial motions, and the jury found Delta liable on three: the second cause of action for tortious intrusion into privacy, the fourth cause of action for tortious discharge in violation of the public policy of section 1025, and the fifth cause of action for violation of section 1025 itself. The jury awarded Sullivan $275,000 for emotional distress. It was unable to reach a decision on the sixth cause of action for employment discrimination based on physical handicap related to HIV infection in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), The jury also deadlocked on whether punitive damages were appropriate for the fifth cause of action, Delta\u2019s violation of section 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of whether the evidence supported a punitive damages finding for the section 1025 violation, but otherwise denied Delta\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or a new trial. It also granted Sullivan\u2019s motion for a retrial on the sixth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Sullivan died on February 19, 1995, during the initial briefing on appeal. His mother was substituted as plaintiff and respondent. This court initially reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the grounds that emotional distress damages could not be awarded if plaintiff died before the appeal concluded. The California Supreme Court reversed in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 288 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 935 P.2d 781].</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The Supreme Court also resolved an issue regarding the finality of the trial court\u2019s judgment and accepted respondent\u2019s waiver of the right to a retrial on the sixth cause of action. As a result, the Supreme Court directed us to \u201camend the judgment of the trial court to reflect the rendition of judgment for defendant on counts 1, 3, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13, and 14, and the dismissal of count 6 with prejudice, all nunc pro tunc as of May 10, 1994; and . . . address the merits of the appeal, allowing the parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefs if they so request.\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 309.) Having received no requests to file supplemental briefs, we hereby amend the trial court judgment as directed and now decide the merits of Delta\u2019s appeal based on the parties\u2019 original briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">I. <em>Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Based on Section 1025</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">A. <em>The \u201cSubstantial and Fundamental\u201d Public Policy Requirement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Our Supreme Court recently reexamined and restated the elements of a cause of action for tortious wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy in <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 887-890 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157] (Stevenson).  A tortious discharge claim requires that the employee be discharged in violation of a policy that is: \u201c(1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) \u2018public\u2019 in the sense that it \u2018inures to the benefit of the public\u2019 rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 894.) Appellant questions whether the policies underlying section 1025 meet the second and third requirements, i.e., that the policy be public and well established.  We do not reach these issues, however, because we conclude that the policies expressed by section 1025 are not substantial and fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] <em>(Gantt), </em>the Supreme Court explained why a policy supporting a recovery for tortious discharge must be substantial and fundamental. \u201c[D]espite its broad acceptance, the principle underlying the public policy exception is more easily stated than applied. The difficulty, of course, lies in determining where and how to draw the line between claims that genuinely involve matters of public policy, and those that concern merely ordinary disputes between employer and employee. This determination depends in large part on whether the public policy alleged is sufficiently clear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>provide the basis for such a potent remedy. In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>[(1988)] 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373], we endeavored to provide some guidelines by noting that the policy in question must involve a matter that affects society at large rather than a purely personal or proprietary interest of the plaintiff or employer; in addition, the policy must be \u2018fundamental,\u2019 \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018well established\u2019 at the time of the discharge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 669-670.)\u201d <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1090.) An employer may only be fairly burdened with tort liability when it violates a public policy that is substantial and fundamental. \u201cThe employer is bound, at a minimum, to know the fundamental public policies of the state and nation as expressed in their constitutions and statutes; so limited, the public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law. Employees are protected against employer actions that contravene fundamental state policy. And society\u2019s interests are served through a more stable job market, in which its most important policies are safeguarded.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1095.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Thus, the primary rationale for requiring that a public policy be substantial and fundamental is \u201cto ensure that employers have adequate notice of the conduct that will subject them to tort liability to the employees they discharge.\u201d <em>(Stevenson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889; see <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 135-136 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074] <em>(Jennings).) A </em>corollary of the substantial and fundamental requirement, then, is that a \u201c \u2018constitutional or statutory provision must sufficiently describe the type of prohibited conduct to enable an employer to know the fundamental public policies that are expressed in that law.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1256, fn. 9 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022] <em>(Turner), </em>quoting <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1480 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 888] <em>(Sequoia); </em>see <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1147 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 718] <em>(Gould) </em>[fundamental policy must be \u201c \u2018sufficiently clear\u2019 to the employer at the time of the discharge . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The emphasis on sufficient notice to employers is reflected in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Stevenson. Stevenson </em>did not articulate a general test for determining whether a policy is substantial and fundamental, but did identify \u201ccertain considerations that lead us to conclude that the FEHA\u2019s policy against age discrimination in employment is indeed fundamental.\u201d <em>(Stevenson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 895.) These considerations can be grouped into two categories of factors that provide clear notice to employers that a discharge in violation of the policy will lead to liability in tort. The first factor is the similarity between the policy and other policies that have already been declared by the courts to be substantial and fundamental: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>policies against race and sex discrimination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 896.) The second factor is broad and consistent legislative and statutory support for the policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 896-897.) As we shall explain, our analysis of the notice provided to employers, including application of the factors emphasized in <em>Stevenson, </em>leads to the conclusion that the policy expressed by section 1025 is not substantial and fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">B. <em>Section 1025 Does Not Express a \u201cSubstantial and Fundamental\u201d Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Sullivan\u2019s fourth cause of action seeks tort damages for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy expressed by the ADRA. (\u00a7\u00a7 1025-1028.) The jury found that Delta terminated Sullivan\u2019s employment in violation of the public policy found in section 1025.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1025\u2019s first sentence requires that \u201c[ejvery private employer regularly employing 25 or more employees shall reasonably accommodate any employee who wishes to voluntarily enter and participate in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, provided that this reasonable accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the employer.\u201d (\u00a7 1025.) However, the second sentence of section 1025 reaffirms an employer\u2019s right to fire an employee for alcohol or drug use. It states that the ADRA does not prohibit an employer from \u201cdischarging an employee who, because of the employee\u2019s current use of alcohol or drugs, is unable to perform his or her duties, or cannot perform the duties in a manner which would not endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others.\u201d (\u00a7 1025.) Reading the two sentences of section 1025 together, the ADRA expresses three potentially conflicting policies: accommodation of employees involved in alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs, avoidance of undue hardship on employers, and intolerance to alcohol and drug use that interferes with employee performance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>We note that there is no explicit declaration of the significance of section 1025\u2019s policies in either the Constitution or the ADRA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Legislature also chose not to impose criminal sanctions for violation of section 1025.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, it is difficult to determine precisely what employer conduct section 1025 prohibits. It contains multiple conflicting undefined standards for employer conduct. First, the employer must \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d the employee\u2019s rehabilitation program. Second, however, the employer may avoid any obligation under the section if compliance would create an \u201cundue hardship.\u201d Although the Legislature\u2019s statement of policy enacted with the ADRA adds elements for an employer to consider when trying to decide what is reasonable accommodation and what is an undue hardship, it still does not either prohibit or recommend any specific employer conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The problem of identifying prohibited employer conduct is compounded by section 1025\u2019s broad grant of authority to employers to discharge employees for deficient performance caused by the same condition that precipitates the need for accommodation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Considered in its entirety, section 1025 expresses competing objectives which an employer must balance in attempting to accommodate the alcohol or drug rehabilitation efforts of an employee. Section 1025\u2019s undefined and potentially contradictory standards of conduct are insufficient to \u201c \u2018. . . enable an employer to know the fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>public policies that are expressed in that law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turner, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1256, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In our view the policy of requiring reasonable accommodation of an employee\u2019s alcohol or drug rehabilitation efforts does not resemble other public policies which have been found to support a cause of action for tortious discharge. The contrast with the policies discussed in <em>Stevenson </em>is especially illuminating. An employee\u2019s voluntary participation in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program does not reflect an immutable characteristic like race, gender or age. (Cf. <em>Stevenson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 896.) Rehabilitation involves an employee\u2019s positive choice to overcome an addiction, whereas the Supreme Court has emphasized that race, gender and age deserve special protection precisely because they are not the products of free choice. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Section 1025 also differs from the policy at issue in <em>Stevenson </em>because the ADRA is not buttressed by other consistent constitutional or statutory provisions. There is no recognized constitutional right of an employee to voluntarily enter a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. The Legislature has not given the policy behind section 1025 the same broad recognition as the fundamental public policy against race, gender, and age discrimination. Discrimination against participants in alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs has not been grouped with race, gender and age discrimination in the provisions of the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Section 1025 appears to be unique among California\u2019s statutes in providing qualified job protection when an employee chooses to participate in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program. Although there are statutes encouraging participation in rehabilitation programs for a variety of categories of individuals (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 1695 [dentists]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2340 [physicians and surgeons]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2360 [osteopaths]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a72497.1 [podiatrists]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a72662-2663 [physical therapists]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2770 [nurses]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3534-3534.1 [physician assistants]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4360 [pharmacists]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4860 [veterinarians]; Ed. Code, \u00a7 48916.5 [expelled students]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 647d [repetitive intoxication offenders]), none protect employment rights. In light of the multitude of statutes punishing alcohol and drug use (see, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (f) [public intoxication], Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a723152-23153 [driving while intoxicated]), and the case law establishing an employer\u2019s right to test for suspected drug and alcohol use <em>(Loder </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 846 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 927 P.2d 1200]; <em>Kraslawsky </em>v. <em>Upper Deck Co. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 179 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 297]), we cannot say that California maintains a consistent policy promoting the continued employment of employees undergoing alcohol and drug rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>We conclude that the policy underlying the ADRA\u2019s prohibition of employment discrimination based on voluntary participation in a rehabilitation program does not support a common law tortious discharge claim. In short, the statute attempts to protect both the rights of the employer and the employee, and in doing so does not clearly prohibit any specific employer conduct. Its policy is not reflected elsewhere in California\u2019s Constitution or statutes. As the Supreme Court cautioned in <em>Stevenson, </em>\u201c[b]ecause different forms of employment discrimination may be prohibited for different reasons and because the policies underlying different prohibitions may vary in strength, the conclusion that a prohibition of one form of employment discrimination will support a common law wrongful discharge claim does not necessarily mean that a prohibition of a different form of employment discrimination will do likewise.\u201d <em>(Stevenson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">II., in.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The judgment against appellant is reversed.

The jury found that Delta had complied with section 1026, and the last two sections were not the subject of jury findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> We emphasize that this appeal does not concern discrimination based on disability or medical condition. The jury found for Delta on two FEHA antidiscrimination causes of action, and the respondent abandoned the appeal of the FEHA cause of action on which the jury deadlocked. <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 308-309.) Thus, the only basis for tortious wrongful termination in this appeal is violation of the public policy in section 1025.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> The Legislature did enact a statement of policy to accompany the ADRA, but it only contatos interpretive guidance and is silent as to the significance of the policies of the ADRA. \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that employers subject to this act reasonably accommodate employees by providing time off necessary to participate in an alcoholic rehabilitation program when this will not impose an undue hardship on the employer. In determining whether providing the necessary time off would impose an undue hardship it is the intent of the Legislature that the size and type of the employer and facility, the nature and cost of the accommodation involved, notice to the employer of the need for the accommodation, and any reasonable alternative means of accommodation be considered.\u201d (Stats. 1984, ch. 1103, \u00a7 2, p. 3729.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> In a number of cases, the prospect of criminal sanctions to punish the violation of a policy has been a significant factor in the determination that a policy is substantial and fundamental. (See, e.g., <em>Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1097 [Gov. Code, \u00a7 12975]; <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Brenda Raceway Corp. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 547, 554 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 531] [\u00a7 971]; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1432-1433 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 172] [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001].) This follows logically from the due process requirements for criminal statutes. To satisfy constitutional due process standards, a statute imposing criminal liability \u201cmust be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heitzman </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 189, 199 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229].) Thus, when the act of violating the public policy inherent in a statute is properly defined as a crime, the employer will have sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct to permit imposition of tort liability when it discharges an employee for violating the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> See footnote 4, <em>ante. </em>This general language is much less informative to the employer than the definitional sections accompanying the FEHA.
