She further challenges the court\u2019s denial of her requests for an ordered placement and a bonding study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">We partially publish our opinion because we decide an issue of first impression\u2014whether, when there has been no ordered placement with a specific caretaker, section 387 requires SSA, before removing the child, to file a supplemental petition, give notice of a hearing and prove the existence of conditions which constitute a substantial risk of harm to the child. As we will explain, the answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d When a general placement order vests SSA with the minor\u2019s custody and the discretion to select suitable placement, the agency may, without further court order, react to changed circumstances by removing the child from an environment it deems no longer suitable and selecting another placement. We expressly do not decide issues implicating the relatives\u2019 status as potential adoptive parents; such issues were not preserved for appeal. (See fn. 12, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">This case comes before us via an extremely convoluted route, with alternating turns of elation and disappointment, joy and despair\u2014a rocky road leading ultimately to a child\u2019s separation from the only adult caretakers she had known since birth. We recount the factual and procedural history at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>Cynthia was bom January 30, 1991. Due to her parents\u2019 substance abuse and utter unreliability, she was rarely in their company and far more frequently in the care of her father\u2019s brother, William C., and his wife, Sharon. She became a permanent resident of their home at 10 months of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">SSA filed a dependency petition on Cynthia\u2019s behalf on March 2, 1992, alleging the father\u2019s incarceration and both parents\u2019 drug and alcohol abuse. At the detention hearing, SSA approved of the minor\u2019s placement with William and Sharon. In July, Cynthia was declared a dependent. SSA was vested with custody of the minor for suitable placement. The court ordered a reunification plan for the parents and granted William and Sharon de facto parent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Cynthia\u2019s mother and father failed to complete any aspect of their service plan. At the 12-month review hearing on July 13, 1993, the court terminated their reunification services and scheduled a permanency hearing under section 366.26. SSA, concluding adoption was probable, recommended assessment of William and Sharon as an adoptive resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Unfortunately, about the same time, disturbing information surfaced. There were child abuse registry reports (CAR\u2019s) alleging physical abuse of the couple\u2019s four minor sons, who shared the family residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, William, unemployed and receiving disability income as a result of a back injury, was involved in protracted litigation which the social worker perceived as \u201cundermining] the stability of the family and leading] to family tensions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Th\u00e9refore, in November, SSA, expressing second thoughts, noted \u201cfamily issues . . . preclude recommending [Cynthia\u2019s] adoption\u201d by William and Sharon. But recognizing the \u201cclose bond\u201d and the aunt and uncle\u2019s \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to their niece, the agency again recommended long-term foster care, to provide the couple \u201csufficient time to satisfactorily resolve their interpersonal family problems.\u201d William and Sharon had already begun counseling; they agreed with the plan, \u201cparticipating willingly and without resistance,\u201d hoping they would soon be reconsidered as adoptive parents. SSA believed there was an excellent prospect for that eventual outcome. At the November 10 section 366.26 hearing, the parties stipulated to the court\u2019s findings that return of the minor to the parents would create a substantial risk of detriment to her well-being, subdivision (c)(1)(D) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>statute applied,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> continued supervision was necessary and long-term foster care was appropriate. Cynthia\u2019s custody remained vested with SSA for suitable placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">By April 1994, things were going well with the aunt and uncle and SSA again recommended the couple be assessed as an adoptive home for Cynthia. But the rosy glow was short-lived. By June, William and Sharon had discontinued their counseling due to more problems, and their therapist opined she had \u201cnot seen [them] long enough in couples counseling to fully assess their ability to continue to provide the kind of stability required of prospective adoptive parents.\u201d SSA recommended, and the parties stipulated to the court\u2019s finding, long-term foster care remained the proper plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">November brought some improvement. William and Sharon had begun \u201cconsistent\" participation in counseling to enhance their marital stability. There had been no \u201cnotable incidents of concern\u201d within the family for some time, and \u201cthe problems that led to the original referral for counseling appealed] to have stabilized considerably.\u201d The therapist now opined Cynthia would benefit greatly from the relatives\u2019 adoption of her. SSA, giving William and Sharon credit for their continuing struggle to overcome the problems which had delayed the adoption process, once more recommended adoption as the permanent plan, including consideration of William and Sharon as potential adoptive parents. The court agreed and scheduled another hearing under section 366.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">In April 1995, in a supplemental court report for the permanency hearing, SSA reported that a psychological evaluation for adoptive assessment purposes had not yet been completed, but anticipated the results would be positive. It stated, \u201cThere is no doubt that [William and Sharon] will raise this minor with a great deal of love and concern.\u201d It found \u201cno [apparent] reason why [the couple would] not receive an approved home study enabling the adoption of the minor.\u201d Nonetheless, the agency expressed certain reservations, noting, \u201cThere has been a significant amount of difficulty in getting [William and Sharon] to complete the home study. There are still several documents outstanding and the home study has not yet been approved. [The couple] den[ies] any ambivalence about adopting, reporting instead that there have been many outside stresses in their family that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>interfered with the completion of the home study in a timely manner.\u201d The social worker further expressed concerns about the \u201coverall marital stability,\u201d suggesting the couple might be remaining together because of their four sons and Cynthia. Based on some background data, she was also worried about William\u2019s possible alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Nonetheless, SSA recommended terminating Cynthia\u2019s parents\u2019 rights, freeing the minor for adoption and referring her for adoptive placement. Accordingly, on April 5, 1995, the court made the requisite findings and entered orders terminating parental rights, selecting adoption as the minor\u2019s permanent plan, and approving SSA\u2019s continued discretion to place Cynthia with her relatives or \u201cany other adult deemed appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">In September\u2019s periodic review, SSA reported William and Sharon were in the process of adopting the minor. On December 8, the couple petitioned for adoption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Once again, matters took a turn for the worse. In January 1996, Billy, Jr., reported to the police that his father had punched him in the face and held him down while his older brother, Nicholas, repeatedly hit him. SSA, substantiating the report, noted Cynthia witnessed the incident, which frightened her. Further investigation revealed Billy, Jr.\u2019s nonattendance at school due to a local gang\u2019s \u201ccontract\u201d on him and one of his friends. In addition, William and Sharon reported their two younger sons were exhibiting \u201cextremely oppositional\u201d behavior. The social worker, believing the family\u2019s dysfunction was far more serious than previously known, opined it would not be in the minor\u2019s best interests to remain with her aunt and uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">Cynthia was removed from the residence on February 2, 1996. William and Sharon agreed with SSA\u2019s approval of placement with another aunt and uncle. But Cynthia\u2019s stay at that home was brief: The relatives did not comply with procedures to become licensed foster care providers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 18, the minor was placed in a foster home. William and Sharon were given eight hours unmonitored visitation weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">In March, Sharon submitted to the court an 18-page, handwritten letter, explaining the circumstances of the precipitating incident, describing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>boys\u2019 remorse and guilt at having caused the minor\u2019s removal, and pleading for Cynthia\u2019s return. At the March 8 periodic review hearing, the court appointed counsel for the couple. In April, as de facto parents, they petitioned this court for a writ, challenging SSA\u2019s removal of the minor without a supplemental petition under section 387. They also sought a stay of juvenile court proceedings pending determination of the writ, arguing a hearing scheduled for April 19 regarding placement issues might result in their loss of any opportunity to adopt Cynthia. We denied the petition by order filed April 16, 1996 <em>(William C. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>G019553 [nonpub. opn.]), noting there was an inadequate record presented for review and in any event the petition, filed more than 60 days from the removal, appeared to be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">William and Sharon did not file another petition for writ. Rather, on April 19, 1996, they petitioned the juvenile court under section 388 for modification of its April 5 and September 21, 1995, orders authorizing SSA to determine Cynthia\u2019s placement. They requested an ordered placement with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">The section 388 hearing was repeatedly continued or trailed. In the interim, the court ordered a comprehensive psychological evaluation of William and Sharon and their children. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 730.) Les Widerynski, Ph.D., was directed, inter alia, to assess the couple\u2019s ability to benefit from therapy and the likelihood of their physical abuse of Cynthia upon her reaching adolescence. Widerynski was to give his opinion \u201cwhether the minor . . . should be adopted by [the relatives]\u201d and whether \u201cthey require intervention in the form of therapy or parenting for successful placement to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">After completing his evaluation, the psychologist commented on several areas of family dysfunction and recommended implementation of four programs, including family therapy sessions, to gain a better understanding of the chain of events leading to family disruption, and individual counseling for William, Sharon and Billy, Jr., to address issues specific to each one. He was concerned the aunt and uncle might not be able \u201cto provide a setting in which a child would be protected from not only severe forms of discipline, but, also the emotional trauma which might occur in a home where such discipline or physical violence is observed.\u201d On the other hand, he noted there could be serious psychological consequences if Cynthia were permanently removed. He did not want the minor returned to William and Sharon until some progress was made. He suggested gradually increased visitation privileges, with the caveat that if another incident occurred, the couple should not be considered as an adoptive placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">The section 388 matter was scheduled to be heard with a progress review on August 22. The parties\u2019 written stipulation presented at that hearing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>ambiguous: The court itself noted it had \u201creceived a stipulation form, but that\u2019s a form only. It\u2019s not a true stipulation since there will be a hearing on the record.\u201d The reporter\u2019s transcript clearly indicates, however, the parties stipulated to continue the section 388 matter to another date and proceed with the contested periodic review. After receiving SSA\u2019s reports and the psychological evaluation, the court found adoption continued to be the appropriate plan and ordered Cynthia to remain in her foster care placement, with the relatives\u2019 visitation to be increased to two 8-hour visits per week, and to be further increased when William and Sharon showed compliance with Widerynski\u2019s recommendations. The court noted it would reassess the section 388 motion on October 7, anticipating return of the child might be possible at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Unfortunately, another bump in the road was encountered en route to the next hearing. At the end of September, William and Sharon separated, announcing their intention to dissolve the marriage. William moved out with one son (Michael); Nicholas, at age 18, apparently was on his own; and David and Billy, Jr., remained with Sharon, who was unemployed, receiving no financial support from William, and in the process of applying for public assistance. Due to a conflict in representation, the couple\u2019s attorney was relieved. At the court\u2019s suggestion, Sharon\u2019s new counsel withdrew the section 388 petition due to the family\u2019s drastically altered circumstances, without prejudice to filing a new petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">The next untoward development is reflected in an SSA report for the November 5 hearing: Cynthia returned to her foster home from a visit with her aunt and cousins, holding her \u201cprivate area\u201d and complaining about pain in her side; she also had decreased appetite. Questioned by her foster mother, she said her \u201cbrother\u201d David and a neighbor boy had \u201ctouched her privates.\u201d In a subsequent interview with the social worker, the minor stated the boys forced her into David\u2019s bedroom, where they both touched her \u201cprivates\u201d over her underwear and David showed her his \u201cwiener.\u201d She further reported Nicholas, left alone with her to babysit, touched her \u201cprivates\u201d with his \u201cwiener.\u201d SSA recommended restricting visitation to one monitored hour per week and prohibiting David and Nicholas from any contact, noting, \u201c[Sharon] failed to protect the minor in the past and is unwilling to believe the minor\u2019s statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">On December 3, Sharon filed a new section 388 petition, seeking immediate custody or, in the alternative, a bonding study. The petition alleged the minor had been removed from the home solely because of William\u2019s physical abuse of Billy, Jr. Now that Sharon and William were \u201cpermanently separated,\" the reason for the removal no longer existed. Sharon contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>because of the strong bond she shared with Cynthia, it was detrimental to the minor to be placed anywhere but with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">At the December 13 hearing, Sharon testified she wanted a service plan designed to help her get Cynthia back. She said she had been attending family counseling with William and three of the sons until the previous September 26, but had not engaged in the individual counseling required under Widerynski\u2019s recommendations because she was in the process of \u201cmoving to a different county.\u201d She disagreed with Widerynski\u2019s opinion she suffered from depression and anxiety; nonetheless, she said she was willing to begin participating in the recommended counseling in the future if that was what she had to do to obtain the minor\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Sharon, David and Billy, Jr., were staying with Sharon\u2019s sister and brother-in-law and their five children. Sharon was not ready for Cynthia\u2019s return until she could \u201cget into [her] own house,\u201d which she expected to do \u201cprobably sometime in January.\u201d The court observed \u201cthat creates a problem\u201d because it was required to rule on the state of the evidence then before it. Upon renewed questioning, Sharon testified it would be possible for Cynthia to live with her right away in the sister\u2019s home, although she acknowledged her two sons already had to sleep in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Sharon had seen the minor 13 times over the previous 3-month period. When she picked up Cynthia or dropped her off, she was sometimes accompanied by David or Nicholas, but she never allowed either of the boys to be alone with the minor. She did not believe the child\u2019s molestation disclosure; she said Cynthia was in her care at the time of the alleged sexual abuse and had not been alone with the boys. She was not concerned about Cynthia being alone with her sister\u2019s sons, but agreed it might be a good idea not to leave her alone with David or Nicholas under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">After considering Sharon\u2019s testimony and various SSA reports, the court determined a bonding study would not be helpful because \u201cthat\u2019s always been assumed since the child was removed from the home ... the child . . . was very attached and probably remains attached to [William and Sharon].\u201d In fact, the court observed, it was the obvious attachment which had prompted it to order the broad-scope psychological evaluation of William and Sharon and their sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">The court then turned to \u201cthe real issue\u201d of whether the child should be returned to Sharon that day and whether Sharon was entitled to \u201cany sort of plan or reunification\u201d to facilitate the return. It found the de facto parent had no such entitlement; further, it found Cynthia would suffer detriment if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>returned to Sharon\u2019s care because Sharon herself admitted her life was \u201csomewhat chaotic at this point.\u201d She was without permanent or stable housing, residing in \u201ca crowded living situation\u201d which, with the minor\u2019s return would be more crowded. She was not working and had no source of income; she had no evidence there would be sufficient funds to meet the family\u2019s needs if the minor were returned. The court perceived Sharon had not yet \u201ccome to terms with a lot of problems within [her] family, and a lot of problems that related to issues apart from why [William] left.\u201d It added, \u201cI really do not believe that [Cynthia] could be adequately protected or cared for in [Sharon\u2019s] custody.\" Denying the section 388 petition, it found Sharon failed to carry her burden of proving modification would be in Cynthia\u2019s best interests. SSA was directed to continue looking for an adoptive home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Sharon contends SSA had to file a section 387 supplemental petition and obtain a hearing before removing Cynthia from her home. SSA argues the appeal of the removal, coming more than one year after the incident, must be dismissed as untimely. In the alternative, SSA and the minor assert that Sharon\u2019s stipulation to the appropriateness of the minor\u2019s placement after her removal, and her withdrawing of the first section 388 petition, constitute a waiver of any challenge now. We reject the technical defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">First, the appeal is not untimely. In juvenile dependency cases, an appeal must be filed within 60 days of the challenged judgment or order. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 39(b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[A]ppellate jurisdiction is dependent upon the filing of a timely notice of appeal. [Citations.] \u2018An appeal from the most recent order entered in a dependency matter may not challenge prior orders, for which the statutory time for filing an appeal has passed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Megan B. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 942, 950 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 177].) Here, the child was removed from William and Sharon\u2019s home <em>without </em>a court order. Because no order triggered the 60 days, there is no beginning point from which to calculate the end of jurisdiction. Dismissal would be improper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">With regard to the waiver issue, we have rarely seen a record as convoluted and at times confusing as this. One thing is clear, however: From the moment Cynthia was removed, Sharon pleaded for relief. Inter alia, she delivered a poignant handwritten note to the court. She then filed a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>for writ in this court which failed not on the merits, but due to technical inadequacies. Obtaining no appellate relief, she petitioned the juvenile court under section 388. Before the matter could be heard, the marriage collapsed and the petition obviously had to be withdrawn. SSA and the minor hang their waiver hat on a stipulation which is <em>not </em>unconditional as to Sharon\u2019s acquiescence in the propriety of the removal or the foster care placement. We are unconvinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">We turn to the merits. Sharon argues SSA had to file a supplemental petition under section 387 before removing the child from her home. SSA and the minor maintain section 387 is inapplicable when the previous order vests custody with the agency for suitable placement. In such a case, they explain, section 388 controls, with the burden on the party seeking a change. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Section 387 states, \u201cAn order <em>changing or modifying a previous order </em>by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent, guardian, relative, or friend and directing placement in a foster home, or commitment to a private or county institution, shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (a) of the statute directs the agency to set forth \u201ca concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the <em>previous disposition </em>has not been effective in the . . . protection of the minor.\u201d (Italics added.) The statute umambiguously governs situations involving an <em>ordered </em>placement which the agency later considers ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">This interpretation is bolstered by rule 1430, which identifies different procedures for changing, modifying or setting aside orders made by the court, depending upon the particular circumstances. Rule 1430(b)(2) provides for a <em>subsequent </em>petition if, \u201c[a]t or after the disposition hearing the court <em>has ordered that a parent or guardian retain custody of the dependent child </em>and the petitioner receives information providing reasonable cause to believe the child is now, or once again, described by section 300(a), (d), or (e).\u201d (Italics added.) Rule 1430(c)(1) requires a <em>supplemental </em>petition when SSA concludes a <em>previous disposition </em>has been ineffective \u201cand seeks a more restrictive level of custody,\u201d according to a specific schedule. Neither rule was implicated here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>The court did not make an ordered placement with Sharon. Instead, its order vested custody with SSA to select a suitable placement. That order never changed throughout the proceedings. SSA was <em>always </em>authorized to exercise its discretion to reassess the suitability of the environment in which it had placed the child and, if deemed unsuitable, move the minor to an improved situation. (See <em>Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 721 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 239] [social services agency has sole authority to determine appropriate interim placement of minor pending adoption, subject only to judicial review for abuse of discretion].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor did the mere passage of time transform the general placement order into some sort of de facto order giving Sharon a right to custody or continued placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">SSA became aware of an incident of physical violence involving William and Billy, Jr. It learned Cynthia had witnessed the incident and was frightened. It further learned Billy, Jr., was not attending school because of a gang\u2019s threats, raising additional concerns about the safety of the home. Finally, William and Sharon themselves reported \u201cextremely oppositional\u201d behavior by their two younger sons. The social worker, finding far more serious family dysfunction than previously realized, decided the placement was unstable and potentially dangerous. SSA had no duty to file a section 387 petition and obtain a court order for Cynthia\u2019s removal to a licensed foster care home it deemed safer and more suitable. The matter was within its sound discretion. (See <em>Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 721.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Moreover, Sharon\u2019s status as a de facto parent does not give her a right to the minor\u2019s continued placement with her. Rule 1412(e) entitles a de facto parent to participate as an interested party in the dispositional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>subsequent hearings: \u201cThe de facto parent may: [&lt;J[] (1) Be present at the hearing; [^Q (2) Be represented by retained counsel or . . . appointed counsel; [f] [and] (3) Present evidence.\u201d Sharon fully exercised her rights as a de facto parent. She participated in all of the proceedings, testifying in her own behalf as to her interest in the companionship, care, custody and management of the child; she had an opportunity to call her own witnesses and to cross-examine SSA\u2019s witnesses. (See, e.g., <em>In re Kieshia E. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 68, 77, fn. 7 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 775, 859 P.2d 1290].) She was not entitled to any additional protection regarding the minor\u2019s continued placement in her home.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Sharon also asserts removal without notice and a hearing violated her statutory rights under Family Code section 8704, subdivision (b), and her due process rights under the federal Constitution.

(See, e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wraxall </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 658].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1288-10\"> Without much ado, we reject Sharon\u2019s contention SSA erred when it removed Cynthia from the home of the second set of relatives because they did not have a license. No one challenged the decision at the time. Assuming Sharon ever had any right to complain, she waived it. (See <em>In re Daniel D. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1823, 1831 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 245], and a plethora of like cases [in general, a party is precluded from urging on appeal a point not raised in the trial court].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1292-8\"> A11 rule references are to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1292-9\"> In light of this conclusion, we need not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 various additional arguments about other things Sharon could or should have done at the time of the challenged removal to obtain an appealable order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1293-9\"> Clearly, the applicable procedure is set forth in rule 1430(e), which mandates the filing of a modification petition under section 388 \u201cif there is a change of circumstances or new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>evidence that may require the court to: [1 (1) Change, modify, or set aside an order previously made; or [1 Terminate the jurisdiction of the court over the child.\u201d Sharon, in fact, properly utilized the procedure to seek relief from the court\u2019s prior orders vesting custody and placement discretion in SSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1294-7\"> Sharon mistakenly relies on <em>In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878] to demonstrate SSA was required to file a supplemental petition here. <em>Joel H. </em>is inapt; it involved an ordered placement with the maternal great-aunt and her husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1294-8\"> Apart from the issue of SSA\u2019s removal without a supplemental petition, Sharon raises no question regarding the agency\u2019s abuse of discretion. Nor does she contend the court improperly delegated discretionary authority to SSA. Indeed, such an argument would be futile. (See <em>Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at pp. 733-734.)</p>\n<p id=\"As0Z\">Because we determine there is no need for a supplemental petition under these circumstances, we necessarily reject Sharon\u2019s assertion SSA could not remove the child without first proving by clear and convincing evidence the existence of substantial danger to the minor\u2019s physical health, under section 361, subdivision (b). The statute is inapplicable, as is the case upon which Sharon relies, <em>In re Paul E. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 996 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 289].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1295-6\"><em> In re Kieshia E., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 68, also disposes of Sharon\u2019s argument she was entitled to reunification services. It states, \u201cDe facto parents are <em>not </em>entitled to reunification services and cannot be required to participate in such services. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 77, fn. 7, italics added.) As our Supreme Court observed, \u201c[E]ven those who attain the status of de facto parenthood \u2018are not equated with . . . parents or guardians for purposes of dependency proceedings and standing to participate does not give them all of the rights and preferences accorded [parents or guardians], [Citations.]. . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">Sharon protests she was uniquely related to Cynthia as a \u201cpsychological mother with whom the child had lived for five years.\u201d For that reason, she claims, she \u201cshould have been entitled to reunification services.\u201d We find no legal thread in the fabric of the argument. By definition, a de facto parent is \u201ca nonparent who has undertaken the parental role on a day-to-day basis, \u2018seeking to fulfill both the child\u2019s physical needs and his [or her] <em>psychological need for affection and care\u2019 </em>.... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Kieshia E., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 75, italics added.) Sharon cannot show she comes within some sort of special category entitling her to rights superior to those of all other de facto parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1295-8\"> In <em>In re Joseph E. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 653 [177 Cal.Rptr. 546], the parents appealed from an order terminating their parental rights. The father urged reversal based upon a lack of notice of the initial dependency proceedings years earlier. Declining to reach the merits, the reviewing court observed, \u201c[T|he claimed deficiency was not pointed out or relied upon in the superior court, and appears to be raised for the first time on this appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">Here, Sharon was appointed counsel in the dependency proceedings approximately one month after Cynthia was removed from her care. She then challenged the removal by petition for writ, without raising either the facts or the law upon which she now relies to defeat jurisdiction. Subsequently, she filed a section 388 petition, then withdrew it due to the collapse of the marriage. Then she filed another section 388 petition, seeking not to <em>invalidate </em>the SSA\u2019s discretionary placement authority, but to <em>change </em>prior orders regarding that authority and obtain, instead, an ordered placement. And she had a full hearing on the merits of her modification petition. Never once did she claim inadequate notice or object to violation of her rights under Family Code section 8704.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1296-7\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1479.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
