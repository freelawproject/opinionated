J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB0\">In this suit for administrative mandamus relief (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5 (section 1094.5)), petitioner Daniel M. Angelier (Angelier) seeks to overturn a decision by the California State Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Pharmacy (the Board)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which revoked Angelier\u2019s license to practice pharmacy. The trial court denied Angelier\u2019s request for relief. On appeal, Angelier challenges the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s statement of decision, and he questions whether the court applied the correct standard of review of the administrative evidence. Angelier also challenges the court\u2019s affirmance of the award of attorney\u2019s fees that was made by the administrative law judge in favor of the Board. We affirm the judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Background of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Board\u2019s charges against Angelier were drug related.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative law judge (ALJ) found Angelier had supplied his girlfriend and himself with prescription drugs without their having prescriptions for those drugs. This was done on several occasions. The drugs were Estrogen, Prostin, Percocet, Prozac and antibiotics. The ALJ also found Angelier had given his girlfriend a drug to induce an abortion at the home where they were living. Evidence showed the drug should only be administered by a physician and should only be used in a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The ALJ determined Angelier\u2019s license should be revoked and he should pay $6,809.50 to the Board as and for the Board\u2019s costs of investigating the charges against Angelier, including its legal fees. After the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s determination and recommendation, Angelier petitioned for reconsideration of the decision. The petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> Angelier\u2019s petition for writ relief was filed with the trial court in September 1995. The petition alleges, among things, that the findings made by the Board regarding the charges against Angelier are not supported by the weight of the evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Board\u2019s decision to revoke his license is not supported by the Board\u2019s findings. Angelier also challenged the validity of the ALJ\u2019s decision to include attorney\u2019s fees in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>award of costs to the Board. The Board moved for a change of venue to San Diego, which was denied. Angelier moved for a stay of the Board\u2019s decision to revoke his license. His motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">After the parties presented their respective positions to the trial court regarding whether a writ should be granted, Angelier requested a statement of decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 16, 1995, the trial court issued its minute order denying Angelier\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and directing the Board to file a proposed statement of decision. No explanation was given in the minute order for why the petition was denied. Angelier filed objections to the proposed statement of decision (which were impliedly overruled when the court signed the proposed statement of decision without modifying it). The court\u2019s statement of decision and judgment were signed and filed on January 25, 1996. Thereafter, Angelier filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On appeal, Angelier challenges the legal sufficiency of the portion of the trial court\u2019s statement of decision which pertains to the evidence presented at the administrative hearing. He also contends the record does not clearly show that the trial court applied the correct test when it reviewed the administrative record (the independent judgment test). Additionally, Angelier asserts there is no legal basis for imposing on him the costs for attorney work performed by the Attorney General\u2019s office for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">1. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Statement of Decision Is Not Deficient</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In his request for a statement of decision, Angelier requested an explanation of the factual and legal basis of the trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by the weight of the evidence. The proposed statement of decision submitted by the Board and adopted by the trial court states in part: \u201cThe [Board\u2019s] decision ... is supported by the Board\u2019s findings, which are in turn supported by the weight of the evidence.\u201d In his written objections to the proposed statement of decision, Angelier stated: \u201cThe [proposed] finding on the weight of the evidence does not specify what findings are supported by the weight of what evidence and therefore does not give a reviewing court factual findings which trace and examine this Court\u2019s analysis of the evidence under the independent judgment test. There are no findings of fact which bridge the analytic gap between the evidence and this Court\u2019s decision under the independent judgment test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">On appeal, Angelier renews his contention. He asserts the trial court failed to \u201cset forth any factual basis for its decision. There is no explanation as to how the weight of the evidence supported any particular factual finding at all.\u201d Angelier relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509 [206 Cal.Rptr. 164].</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">We do not find the statement of decision to be inadequate. \u201c[A] trial court rendering a statement of decision under . . . section 632 is required to state only ultimate rather than evidentiary facts because findings of ultimate facts necessarily include findings on all intermediate evidentiary facts necessary to sustain them. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Cheryl E. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 587, 599 [207 Cal.Rptr. 728]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc., supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 524 <em>(Casa Blanca).) </em>In <em>Casa Blanca, </em>the trial court, in its statement of decision, \u201cdeclared Casa Blanca had committed 67 specified \u2018acts\u2019 in violation of nursing home regulations constituting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>unlawful and unfair business practices. The court specifically described 10 different categories of \u2018acts\u2019 which occurred in Casa Blanca facilities on \u2018repeated\u2019 occasions. HQ Furthermore, in its statement of decision the court listed exactly how many \u2018acts\u2019 it found to have occurred within each of the categories described.\u201d <em>(Casa Blanca, </em>at p. 524.) The reviewing court held the trial court\u2019s \u201cstatement of decision fairly and completely sets forth the factual and legal basis for the court decision as required by . . . section 632. It lists all the ultimate facts necessary to decide the issues placed in controversy by the pleadings.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Casa Blanca </em>court rejected Casa Blanca\u2019s assertion that the trial court was required to make \u201cfindings with regard to detailed evidentiary facts, to make minute findings as to individual items of evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Unlike the trial court in <em>Casa Blanca, </em>the trial court in the instant case did not provide <em>detailed </em>ultimate facts in its statement of decision. However, unlike the trial court in <em>Casa Blanca, </em>the trial court in the instant case was not the original finder of fact. Stated another way, <em>Casa Blanca </em>was not an administrative mandamus case. Thus, the trial court\u2019s specificity, in <em>Casa Blanca, </em>in setting out its findings of ultimate facts, was to be expected. Here however, the ALJ had already set out various findings of misconduct by Angelier. In its statement of decision, the trial court stated <em>its </em>finding that the ALJ\u2019s various findings are supported by the weight of the evidence. As noted above, under the independent judgment rule, the trial court must weigh the evidence and make its own determination as to whether the administrative findings should be sustained. What the trial court\u2019s statement of decision lacked in specificity, it made up for by its statement that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by the weight of the evidence. In effect, the statement of decision incorporates by reference the findings of ultimate fact made by the Board; the statement of decision is therefore, in effect, detailed enough.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>2. <em>The Record Indicates the Trial Court Applied the Independent Judgment Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Angelier asserts the statement of decision does not state which standard of review the trial court used in examining the administrative record and decision. He contends \u201cone cannot be satisfied that the independent judgment test was rigorously applied. The tentative decision [i.e., the trial court\u2019s minute order] was simply that the petition for writ of mandate was denied with no reasoning. Without any guidance from the trial court, [the Board\u2019s] counsel was delegated the task of preparing the Statement of Decision. No hearing or ruling was made on appellant Angelier\u2019s Statement of Decision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree with the whole of Angelier\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Judgments and orders of the trial court are presumed to be correct, and reversible error must be affirmatively shown by persons challenging those decisions. <em>(Walling </em>v. <em>Kimball </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 364, 373 [110 P.2d 58].) Angelier has not met his appellate burden on this issue. The reporter\u2019s transcript shows that twice during a hearing on the Board\u2019s motion for a change of venue and Angelier\u2019s motion for a stay of the Board\u2019s decision, Angelier\u2019s counsel stated to the court that it was required to apply the independent judgment test in considering Angelier\u2019s petition for writ of mandate. The second time counsel made this assertion, the trial court stated: \u201cI understand that.\u201d Moreover, the statement of decision itself shows the proper test was applied. It states the trial court\u2019s determination that the Board\u2019s findings are \u201csupported by the <em>weight of the </em>evidence.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">3. <em>Inclusion of Attorney\u2019s Fees in the AU\u2019s Award of Costs Was Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">As noted above, the ALJ awarded the Board $6,809.50 \u201cin costs of investigation and prosecution of this action.\u201d Of that amount, $2,669.50 was for the cost of investigation and $4,140 was for charges made by the Attorney General\u2019s office. Business and Professions Code section 125.3 was cited by the ALJ as authority for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Business and Professions Code section 125.3 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, in any order issued in resolution of a disciplinary proceeding before any board within the department [of consumer affairs] . . . , the board may request the administrative law judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to direct a licentiate found to have committed a violation or violations of the licensing act to pay a sum not to exceed the reasonable costs of the investigation and enforcement of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201c(c) A certified copy of the actual costs, or a good faith estimate of costs where actual costs are not available, signed by the entity bringing the proceeding or its designated representative shall be prima facie evidence of reasonable costs of investigation and prosecution of the case. The costs shall include the amount of investigation and enforcement costs up to the date of the hearing, including, but not limited to, charges imposed by the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201c(j) This section does not apply to any board [within the Department of Consumer Affairs] if a specific statutory provision in that board\u2019s licensing act provides for recovery of costs in an administrative disciplinary proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On appeal, Angelier asserts the ALJ had no authority under Business and Professions Code section 125.3 to include, in the award of costs, the attorney\u2019s fees charged by the Attorney General for the legal work performed by his office on behalf of the Board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Angelier\u2019s assertion rests on the fact that Business and Professions Code section 125.3 does not specifically mention attorney\u2019s fees in its provisions for costs, whereas Business and Professions Code section 5107 (pertaining to disciplinary proceedings brought by the Board of Accountancy and Business and Professions Code section 3753.7 (pertaining to disciplinary proceedings brought by the Respiratory Care Board of California explicitly provide for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in their provisions relating to costs incurred for investigating and prosecuting a disciplinary case. Angelier argues that the language used in Business and Professions Code sections 5107 and 3753.7 shows the Legislature knows how to provide for attorney\u2019s fees when it intends to allow them. Angelier also notes that under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>subdivision (a)(10), attorney\u2019s fees are not allowed as costs unless expressly provided for by statute, law, or contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We agree that these basic rules pertaining to statutory construction and attorney\u2019s fees do cause one to wonder whether the Legislature intended to allow only some boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs to recover attorney\u2019s fees in disciplinary proceedings. However, a resolution of this question is found in Government Code sections 11042 and 11044 (section 11042 &amp; section 11044).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Section 11042 prohibits state agencies (other than those listed in section 11041 of the Government Code) from employing legal counsel other than the Attorney General, his or her assistants and his or her deputies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 11044 provides in part: \u201c(a) For state agencies, departments, or programs which are <em>charged </em>for the costs of legal services rendered by the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall <em>charge </em>an amount sufficient to recover the costs incurred in providing the legal services.\u201d (Italics added.) This language, coupled with the language in subdivision (c) of section 125.3, which states that costs which a board may recover from a licentiate in a disciplinary proceeding include <em>\u201ccharges </em>imposed by the Attorney General\u201d (italics added), leads us to conclude the Legislature intended that <em>all </em>boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs should recover fees they pay for attorney services in prosecuting disciplinary cases unless otherwise provided by subdivision (j) of section 125.3. Therefore, we construe the reference in subdivision (c) of section 125.3 to \u201ccharges imposed by the Attorney General\u201d to include what would be the equivalent of attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Our construction of section 125.3 produces a result that is reasonable because it puts the various boards in the Department of Consumer Affairs on an equal footing for recovery of costs incurred in disciplinary proceedings.  \u201cWhere the construction of a statute is necessary, it should be interpreted so as to produce a result that is reasonable; the court must look to the context of the law and, where uncertainty exists, consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Riles </em>v. <em>Windsor University </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 326, 332 [139 Cal.Rptr. 378].) Angelier\u2019s position that the Legislature intended to permit some boards to recover attorney\u2019s fees paid for legal services for the enforcement of their applicable licensing act while denying other boards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>such a recovery would mean that some persons licensed by the state would have to reimburse the taxpayers for the expenses which their wrongful acts have caused the state while others would not. We do not believe the Legislature intended such consequences. Moreover, our interpretation of section 125.3 produces harmony among the various statutory provisions for costs. \u201c[Statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.

Section 1094.5 states in part: \u201c(b) The inquiry [in an administrative mandamus case] shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. [H (c) <em>Where it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence, in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>independent judgment on the evidence, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence. </em>In all other cases, abuse of discretion is established if the. court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"A78-\">A trial court is required to utilize the \u201cindependent judgment test\u201d when a fundamental vested right is at stake. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 144 et seq. [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242].) \u201cThe right to practice one\u2019s profession is a fundamental vested right and if a person\u2019s license to practice that profession is revoked by an administrative agency, when a petition for a writ of mandate is brought for restoration of the license, the trial court must apply its independent judgment to its review of the facts underlying the administrative decision. [Citations.]. . . [H Under the independent judgment rule, the trial court must weigh the evidence and make its own determination as to whether the administrative findings should be sustained.\u201d <em>(Vaill </em>v. <em>Edmonds </em>(1991) 4 Cal.App.4th 247, 257-258 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) \u201cThe trial court examines the administrative record for errors of law and reweighs the evidence in a limited trial de novo. [Citation.] This judicial reweighing requires that a preponderance of the evidence support the administrative disposition. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(James </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1096, 1105 [218 Cal.Rptr. 710].) However, when an appeal is taken from the trial court\u2019s judgment and the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the weight of the evidence is challenged, the reviewing court applies a substantial evidence test, not an independent judgment test. The judgment \u201cis given the same effect as any other judgment after trial rendered by the court: the only question is whether the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>(not the administrative agency\u2019s) findings are supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.] Conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the judgment and where two or more inferences can be reasonably drawn from the facts, the reviewing court must accept the inferences deduced by the trial court.
