Baker had been disembarking to order supplies, one of her responsibilities as an employee. Evidence indicated Baker spent between 80 and 99 percent of her working hours on board the vessels to which she was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Baker sought recompense for her injuries in several forums and in the following order: (1) an application for benefits pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.); (2) a civil action in Los Angeles Superior Court (No. NC004844) against Long Beach Water Concessions (Employer), the City of Avalon (which had refused her tort claim), and Crowley Marine Services/H.Tourist doing business as Catalina Cruises, citing both the Jones Act (46 U.S.C. Appen. \u00a7 688) and general maritime law; (3) an application for benefits pursuant to the Jones Act; and (4) an application for benefits pursuant to the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3200 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Employer carried LHWCA and Jones Act insurance through real party in interest Navigators Insurance Company (Navigators), and state workers\u2019 compensation insurance through petitioner CNA Insurance Company (CNA). Settlement negotiations commenced in each forum. Baker\u2019s voluntary settlement conference statement in the civil case acknowledged she had applied for benefits in all of the forums and asserted she qualified to receive benefits in each. The document stated Baker was a Jones Act seaman. On April 13,1994, the Los Angeles Superior Court approved a $55,000 \u201cglobal\u201d settlement, to which both Employer, through Navigators, and the City of Avalon contributed. The settlement agreement does not state that Baker is a Jones Act seaman and does not include a jurisdictional finding. On July 21, 1994, LHWCA personnel approved a $36,235 agreed settlement (33 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00a7 908(i)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The findings included only the following: that Baker had alleged injury, that Navigators insured Employer for LHWCA, that the parties had agreed \u201con the pertinent issues and desire to settle the claim,\u201d that the settlement amount \u201cis commensurate with the claimant\u2019s disability,\u201d and that the agreement \u201cwas not secured under duress.\u201d There was no finding of jurisdiction. In each settlement agreement, Employer received credit for payments made. CNA was not a signatory to either agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Baker did not present a proposed settlement agreement to the state workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ); she did accept certain state workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Navigators requested contribution from CNA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CNA refused. Navigators petitioned the WCJ for relief. CNA opposed the petition, asserting, inter alia, that Baker was a Jones Act seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On December 20, 1995, the WCJ filed his order and opinion on decision, addressing issues relating to contribution, jurisdiction, and state workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The WCJ denied Navigator\u2019s request for contribution, holding that no settlement agreement had been presented for approval in the state workers\u2019 compensation forum and that Navigators lacked standing because it was not the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. (Navigators does not here challenge this ruling.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">With respect to the issue of jurisdiction, the opinion on decision states in part: \u201cThe WCAB [Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board] does have jurisdiction over any action taken by the Applicant relative to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and as far as any lien claimant that has provided services to the Applicant relative to her workers\u2019 compensation claim. [\u2018JQ It is also clear based upon the record and past action in this case that CNA has recognized that they are the duly responsible insurance carrier for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits. [f] . . . It is well established that there may be concurrent jurisdiction on [LHWCA] and the [state] workers\u2019 compensation system. Issues as to concurrent jurisdiction between the Jones Act and State Workers\u2019 Compensation rights are not so clearly defined.\" Without further discussion, the WCJ approved state benefits Baker had received that totaled $6,622.08 and ordered CNA to negotiate or litigate the related liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">CNA petitioned the WCJ for reconsideration. CNA reviewed evidence concerning Baker\u2019s employment and asserted she had consistently claimed seaman status for purposes of the Jones Act, arguing that under such circumstances federal maritime law must be her exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The WCJ denied the petition, noting that CNA had answered Baker\u2019s application and raised affirmative defenses thereto, appeared at a mandatory settlement conference where it \u201cadmitted injury,\u201d appeared at a trial setting conference where it agreed to pay rehabilitation benefits, and successfully petitioned to vacate the minute order memorializing that agreement. The WCJ held that CNA\u2019s prior participation waived the jurisdiction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As a second ground, the WCJ held that, although Baker\u2019s failure to seek WCAB approval of the \u201cglobal\u201d settlement reflected she had \u201cabandoned her claim,\u201d the lien claimants were entitled to stand in her place. The WCJ characterized the case presented to him as one relating solely to the specific interests of the two insurance companies, noting that Baker had not appeared at the hearing. Thus, the WCJ concluded, \u201c[t]he statement of facts provided by CNA is not binding on lien claimants\u2019 rights as no factual issues have been put into play by the Applicant or the lien claimants.\u201d The WCJ faulted CNA for failing to notice the lien claimants of the action before the WCAB and of its petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">As a final ground for denial, the WCJ stated that CNA\u2019s petition for reconsideration was unverified.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The WCAB denied reconsideration based upon the report of the WCJ. CNA successfully petitioned this court for a writ of review to determine the lawfulness of the denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Preliminarily, we agree that CNA\u2019s participation in the state forum did not waive the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.

Even so, as we shall explain, public policy supports Baker\u2019s application for benefits in multiple forums, and the circumstances of this case trigger CNA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The United States Supreme Court noted the mutual exclusivity of certain federal workers\u2019 compensation recovery schemes in <em>Chandris, Inc. </em>v. <em>Latsis </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 347 [115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314].  The Jones Act provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny <em>seaman </em>who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, . . ,\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (46 U.S.C.

The LHWCA provides compensation for injury to a \u201cbroad range of land-based maritime workers but . . . explicitly excludes from its coverage <em>\u2018a master or member of a crew of any vessel.' </em>44 Stat.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Chandris, Inc. </em>v. <em>Latsis, supra, </em>515 U.S. at p. 356 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2184], italics added.)  Although some states\u2019 statutes exclude persons covered under the Jones Act from state workers\u2019 compensation benefits (see, e.g., <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McKinnon </em>(8th Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>1352, 1354), CNA acknowledges that the California Labor Code does not do so. CNA also acknowledges it has long been held that a state may apply its own workers\u2019 compensation scheme to a land-based injury that falls within LHWCA coverage. <em>(Sun Ship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 715, 718-719 [100 S.Ct. 2432, 2435-2436, 65 L.Ed.2d 458].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>reviewed the evolution of workers\u2019 compensation coverage. We quote that opinion at some length because it provides historical background that illuminates the issues at bar, and because it puts in context the earlier Supreme Court cases CNA cites in its petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cIn 1917, <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>[(1917)] 244 U. S. 205 [37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086], declared that States were constitutionally barred from applying their compensation systems to maritime injuries, and thus interfering with the overriding federal policy of a uniform maritime law. Subsequent decisions invalidated congressional efforts to delegate compensatory authority to the States within this national maritime sphere. <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>253 U. S. 149 [40 S.Ct. 438, 64 L.Ed. 834] (1920); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>W. C. Dawson &amp; Co., </em>264 U. S. 219 [44 S.Ct. 302, 68 L.Ed. 646] (1924). At the same time, the Court began to narrow the <em>Jensen </em>doctrine by identifying circumstances in which the subject of litigation might be maritime yet \u2018local in character,\u2019 and thus amenable to relief under state law. <em>Western Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>257 U. S. 233 [42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210] (1921); <em>Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. </em>v. <em>Rohde, </em>257 U. S. 469 [42 S.Ct. 157, 66 L.Ed. 321] (1922). And, in 1927, Congress was finally successful in extending a measure of protection to marine workers excluded by <em>Jensen </em>by enacting a federal compensation law\u2014the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>That statute provided, in pertinent part, that \u2018 [compensation shall be payable [for an injury] . . . occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States ... if recovery . . . through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\u2019 44 Stat. 1426.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cFederal and state law were thus linked together to provide theoretically complete coverage for maritime laborers. But the boundary at which state remedies gave way to federal remedies was far from obvious in individual cases. As a result, the injured worker was compelled to make a jurisdictional guess before filing a claim; the price of error was unnecessary expense and possible foreclosure from the proper forum by statute of limitations. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>317 U. S. 249, 254 [63 S.Ct. 225, 228, 87 L.Ed. 246] (1942). After a decade and a half during which there had not been formulated \u2018any guiding, definite rule to determine the extent of state power in advance of litigation,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 253, the Court determined that the border <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>between federal and state compensation schemes was less a line than a \u2018twilight zone,\u2019 in which \u2018employees must have their rights determined case by case . . . ,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 256. Within this zone, <em>Davis </em>effectively established a regime of concurrent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><em>\u201cCalbeck </em>v. <em>Travelers Insurance Co., </em>370 U. S. 114 [82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368] (1962), further overlapped federal and state-law coverage for marine workers. <em>Calbeck </em>held that the LHWCA comprehended \u2018all injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 124, without regard to whether the locus of an event was \u2018maritime but local,\u2019 and hence within the scope of state compensation provisions. We interpreted the statutory phrase \u2018if recovery . . . may not validly be provided by State law\u2019 to mean that the LHWCA would \u2018reac[h] all those cases of injury to employees on navigable waters as to which <em>Jensen, Knickerbocker </em>and <em>Dawson </em>had rendered questionable the availability of a state compensation remedy ...[,] whether or not a particular one was also within the constitutional reach of a state workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 126-127.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201cYet having extended the LHWCA into the \u2018maritime but local\u2019 zone, <em>Calbeck </em>did not overturn <em>Davis </em>by treating the federal statute as exclusive. To the contrary, <em>Calbeck </em>relied upon <em>Davis, </em>and discussed at length its proposition that an injury within the \u2018maritime but local\u2019 sphere might be compensated under either state or federal law. 370 U. S., at 128-129. So, too, <em>Calbeck'&amp; </em>explanation of <em>Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>346 U.S. 366 [74 S.Ct. 100, 98 L.Ed. 77] (1953), indicated that although an injury might be compensable under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, \u2018there is little doubt that a state compensation act could validly have been applied to it.\u2019 370 U.S., at 129. Even more significantly, Calbeck's ruling that one of the employees in a consolidated case should not be held to have elected to pursue state remedies was necessarily premised upon the view that state relief was concurrently available. <em>Id., </em>at 131-132; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cIn 1972, Congress . . . extended] the LHWCA landward beyond the shoreline of the navigable waters of the United States. Pub. L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251, amending 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 903 (a). In so doing, the Longshoremen\u2019s Act became, for the first time, a source of relief for injuries which had always been viewed as the province of state compensation law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cAbsent any contradicting signal from Congress, the principles of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, supra, </em>and of <em>Calbeck </em>v. <em>Travelers Insurance Co., supra, </em>direct the conclusion that the 1972 extension of federal jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law. Given that the pre-1972 Longshoremen\u2019s Act ran concurrently with state remedies in the \u2018maritime but local\u2019 zone, it follows that the post-1972 expansion of the Act landward would be concurrent as well. For state regulation of worker injuries is even more clearly appropriate ashore than it is upon navigable waters. Compare <em>State Industrial Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Nordenholt Corp., </em>259 U. S. 263 [42 S.Ct. 473, 66 L.Ed. 933] (1922), with <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>244 U. S. 205 [37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086] (1917). Furthermore, the \u2018jurisdictional dilemma,\u2019 <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 255, that results when employees must claim relief under one of two exclusive compensation schemes is as acute when the jurisdictional boundary between schemes is fixed upon land, as it is when the line is drawn between two maritime spheres. To read the 1972 amendments as compelling laborers to seek relief under two mutually exclusive remedial systems would lead to the prejudicial consequences which we described in <em>Davis </em>as \u2018defeating] the purpose of the federal act, which seeks to give \u201cto these hardworking men, engaged in a somewhat hazardous employment, the justice involved in the modem principle of compensation,\u201d and the state Acts . . . which ai[m] at \u201csure and certain relief for workmen.\u201d \u2019 317 U. S., at 254. See <em>Calbeck, supra, </em>at 126.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cThe language of the 1972 amendments cannot fairly be understood as pre-empting state workers\u2019 remedies from the field of the LHWCA, and thereby resurrecting the jurisdictional monstrosity that existed before the clarifying opinions in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck.\u201d (Sun Ship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 717-720 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2435-2436].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In <em>Duong </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 980 [215 Cal.Rptr. 609], the court held that a land-based shipyard worker was entitled to receive state workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries incurred while making repairs on a vessel floating in federal navigable waters but tied to a dock, activities covered by both LHWCA and state compensation laws.  The court further held that \u201c[w]hen dual federal and state coverage is available, simultaneous applications under each act is permitted because the delay in determining whether both or only one of the acts covers injuries incurred in employment arguably overlapping both the state and federal jurisdictions, may allow a statute of limitations to ran for claims where the applicant files only with an agency lacking jurisdiction. Where concurrent jurisdiction allows coverage under both the state and federal acts, there is no danger of double recovery because an employer\u2019s contributions under one will be credited against the other. <em>(Calbeck </em>v. <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 114, 131 [82 S.Ct. 1196, 1205-1206, 8 L.Ed.2d 368].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 982.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The instant case differs from <em>Duong </em>in that it involves the relationship of the Jones Act to a later filed application for state workers\u2019 compensation coverage and it involves settlement agreements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">CNA equates the settlement of the Jones Act claim with receipt of compensation <em>pursuant </em>to the Jones Act. Two cases, <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Johnson Bros. Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 423, and <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>Campbell Industries </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 311, have reached contrary conclusions whether an award in one jurisdiction precludes further recovery in another. Both courts analyzed case law stemming from litigation that originated in California. We now review this history.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Gizoni </em>v. <em>Southwest Marine Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 385, the plaintiff was a rigging foreman who rode floating platforms that moved equipment and materials around the shipyard and on and off vessels being repaired. The plaintiff occasionally served as a lookout and gave maneuvering signals to tugboats moving the platforms. The plaintiff was injured when his foot broke through the deck of a platform in transit from the shipyard to a floating drydock. The plaintiff made a claim for and received medical and compensation benefits from his employer pursuant to the LHWCA. The plaintiff later filed a Jones Act suit against his employer, alleging negligence. The employer moved for summary judgment, asserting that the plaintiff was not a Jones Act seaman and that his claim was barred by the exclusivity provision of the LHWCA. The district court granted the motion on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The appellate court reversed. It first held that the question whether the plaintiff was a Jones Act seaman was one of fact in that case and that the issue should have been submitted to a jury. <em>(Gizoni </em>v. <em>Southwest Marine Inc., supra, </em>909 F.2d at p. 387.) As to the second ground, the court first quoted 33 United States Code section 905(a): \u201cThe liability of an employer prescribed in section 4 shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee. . . .\u201d It then noted that the LHWCA excluded \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel\u201d from the class of workers covered by the statute. (909 F.2d at p. 388.) The court stated it agreed with the holding of <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1986) 784 F.2d 732, 739: \u201cA plaintiff is not limited to the remedies available under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>LHWCA unless he is unable to show that a genuine factual issue exists as to whether he was a seaman at the time of his injury. [Citations.]\u201d Given that the plaintiff\u2019s status was a question of fact, the court remanded the matter, <em>(Gizoni </em>v. <em>Southwest Marine Inc., supra, </em>909 F.2d at pp. 388-389.) We note there was no settlement agreement involved in the <em>Gizoni </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><em>Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gizoni </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 81 [112 S.Ct. 486, 116 L.Ed.2d 405], affirmed <em>Gizoni.

[Citations.] <em>This is so, quite obviously, because the question of coverage has never actually been litigated. </em>Moreover, the LHWCA clearly does not comprehend such a preclusive effect, as it specifically provides that any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death pursuant to the Jones Act shall be credited against any liability imposed by the LHWCA.

The employer voluntarily initiated LHWCA compensation proceedings and commenced payments of LHWCA benefits. The plaintiff filed a Jones Act suit. The employer terminated the LHWCA payments. The plaintiff filed a LHWCA claim. As a defense to the claim, the employer and its insurer asserted that the plaintiff was a Jones Act seaman and therefore not eligible for LHWCA compensation. The parties settled the LHWCA claim with the approval of an administrative law judge. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(i).) In the Jones Act litigation, the district court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the employer and its insurer, holding in part that the settlement agreement constituted an election of the LHWCA remedy and precluded the suit brought under the Jones Act and general maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. It noted that the district court had relied upon <em>Vilanova </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(1st Cir. 1988) 851 F.2d l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It reviewed <em>Gizoni </em>and <em>Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>agreeing with the <em>Sharp </em>defendants that <em>Gizoni </em>was distinguishable on the basis that \u201c \u2018voluntary payments under the LHWCA without a formal award\u2019 do not bar Jones Act relief but that here the filed settlement agreement of a compensation claim does constitute a \u2018formal award.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sharp </em>v. <em>Johnson Bros. Corp., supra, </em>973 F.2d at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>Campbell Industries, supra, </em>45 F.3d 311, a California shipyard worker and tugboat operator alleged injury occurred while he was aboard a tugboat used in ship construction and repair that was tied to a San Diego dock. The plaintiff filed claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under both the state act and the LHWCA. Each claim for medical expenses and lost wages was compromised and settled, as reflected in a \u201cCompromise and Release\u201d approved by a WCJ and a \u201cFinal Compensation Order\u201d issued by the United States Department of Labor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313.) The plaintiff then filed an action pursuant to the Jones Act and general maritime law. Prior to trial, the court issued an order specifying that any award would be reduced by the amount already received in federal and state workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the plaintiff waived all claims except those for pain and suffering, which cannot be recovered under the LHWCA. The only evidence regarding damages was related to pain and suffering, and the jury awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>damages solely on that ground. By special verdict, the jury found the plaintiff had been a member of the crew and a seaman at the time he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">On appeal, the employer argued that the LHWCA settlement was an implicit finding that the plaintiff was not a \u201cmember of a crew\u201d and not a \u201cseaman,\u201d and also met the \u201cformal award\u201d requirement of <em>Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>thus barring any Jones Act recovery. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, first citing the holding in <em>Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>that a maritime worker whose occupation is included in those enumerated in the LHWCA may yet be a Jones Act \u201cseaman\u201d and entitled to bring an action under that statute. It dismissed the employer\u2019s formal-award argument, stating that <em>Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>\u201cnoted that the justification for this rule was not because no formal award had issued, but rather because double recovery under the two statutes is precluded: \u2018This is so, quite obviously, because the question of coverage has never actually been litigated. Moreover, the LHWCA clearly does not comprehend such a preclusive effect, as it specifically provides that any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death pursuant to the Jones Act shall be credited against any liability by the LHWCA.\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at p. 91.] . . . [&lt;]fl \u2018For this same reason, equitable estoppel arguments . . . must fail. Where full compensation credit removes the threat of double recovery, the critical element of detrimental reliance does not appear .... [Such an] [argument] . . . would force injured maritime workers to an election of remedies we do not believe Congress to have intended.\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at p. 92, fn. 5.]\u201d <em>(Figueroa </em>v. <em>Campbell Industries, supra, </em>45 F.3d at p. 315.) The appellate court noted that the LHWCA compensation order had made no finding regarding the jurisdictional issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 315.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>With respect to the employer\u2019s estoppel argument, the <em>Figueroa </em>court cited <em>Guidry </em>v. <em>Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co. </em>(W.D.La. 1965) 244 F.Supp. 691, 692, a case which involved an award pursuant to the LHWCA but no settlement: \u201c \u2018where the [LHWCA] Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding and award do not disclose any facts upon which his jurisdiction existed, the rule should be and is that complainant\u2019s right to determine his status as a seaman under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688, is not prejudiced thereby, and these questions are not subject to a plea of res judicata under the [LHWCA].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Figueroa </em>v. <em>Campbell Industries, supra, </em>45 F.3d at p. 316.) <em>Figueroa </em>also cited <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Norfolk Dredging Company </em>(4th Cir. 1966) 360 F.2d 360, which permitted two injured workers to bring Jones Act suits following one worker\u2019s receipt of compensation under the LHWCA and the other, under the state workers\u2019 compensation statute. Again, no settlements were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We note that in <em>De Court </em>v. <em>Beckman Instruments, Inc. </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 628 [108 Cal.Rptr. 109], the widow and children of a diver hired to test underwater equipment first recovered a state workers\u2019 compensation award and then filed an action against the decedent\u2019s employer to recover damages under the Jones Act. The trial court gave summary judgment to the employer. The court of appeal reversed, concluding that the workers\u2019 compensation forum had not determined the issue of jurisdiction under the Jones Act and such \u201ccan hardly be said to have been properly determined by implication. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 635; see also the following cases which allowed additional recovery but did not involve settlements: <em>Boatel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Delamore </em>(5th Cir. 1967) 379 F.2d 850, 855 [LHWCA followed by Jones Act]; <em>Mike Hooks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pena </em>(5th Cir. 1963) 313 F.2d 696 [Texas compensation award followed by Jones Act]; contra, <em>Benders </em>v. <em>Board of Governors </em>(R.I. 1994) 636 A.2d 1313 [Jones Act settlement extinguishes employer\u2019s state workers\u2019 compensation obligations]; <em>Hagens </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1943) 135 F.2d 842 [LHWCA award followed by Jones Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We return to the language of <em>Southwest Marine, Inc:. </em>\u201cIt is by now \u2018universally accepted\u2019 that an employee who receives voluntary payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>under the LHWCA <em>without a formal award </em>is not barred from subsequently seeking relief under the Jones Act. [Citations.] <em>This is so, quite obviously, because the question of coverage has never actually been litigated.\u201d </em>(502 U.S. at p. 91 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 493-494], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Obviously, parties settle for many reasons but surely economics is the driving force. The agreements hammered out by counsel in the instant case took into consideration the circumstances of Baker\u2019s injury, her likely entitlement to various benefits, and the benefits previously paid. The parties never brought the issue of jurisdiction to the LHWCA or state court forums that approved the settlement agreements. CNA absented itself from the negotiations, thus precluding it from raising the jurisdiction issue in the federal forum. There were no trials on the issue in any forum. The orders approving the settlement agreements did not include express findings of jurisdiction. It can be said, therefore, that \u201cthe question of coverage has never actually been litigated.\u201d <em>(Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gizoni, supra, </em>502 U.S. at p. 91. [112 S.Ct. at p. 494].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We are unable to rationalize the diverse outcomes of <em>Figueroa </em>and <em>Sharp. </em>The First Circuit\u2019s <em>Vilanova </em>position, cited by <em>Sharp, </em>is distinguishable in that the order approving the settlement therein included express jurisdictional findings. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>The survey of these and numerous other cases teaches that the lines drawn are sometimes driven by the language of the state statutes, sometimes by the evidence, sometimes by actual findings of fact or the lack thereof, sometimes by philosophy.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">During the early development of the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d doctrine, which recognized a state\u2019s interest in preventing injured citizens from becoming destitute and public charges, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court summarized the problem of the diversity of opinions and suggested an approach with which we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201c[Although apparently some heed must still be paid to the line between State and Federal authority as laid down in the cases following the <em>Jensen </em>case <em>[Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(1917) 244 U.S. 205 [37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086]], the most important question has now become the fixing of the boundaries of the new \u2018twilight zone,\u2019 and for this the case gives us no rule or test other than the indefinable and subjective test of doubt. . . . Probably therefore our proper course is not to attempt to reason the matter through and to reconcile previous authorities, or to preserve fine lines of distinction, but rather simply to recognize the futility of attempting to reason logically about \u2018illogic,\u2019 and to regard the <em>Davis </em>case <em>[Davis </em>v. <em>Department of Labor </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 249 [63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246]] as intended to be a revolutionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>decision deemed necessary to escape an intolerable situation and as designed to include within a wide circle of doubt all water front cases involving aspects pertaining both to the land and to the sea where a reasonable argument can be made either way, even though a careful examination of numerous previous decisions might disclose an apparent weight of authority one way or the other.\u201d <em>(Moores\u2019 Case </em>(1948) 323 Mass. 162 [80 N.E.2d 478, 480-481], affd. <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1948) 335 U.S. 874 [69 S.Ct. 239, 93 L.Ed. 417].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Professor Larson has simply stated that \u201cin those rare instances in which a \u2018successful\u2019 Jones Act proceeding might precede a compensation claim, the normal principle ought logically to be that the same rules apply as in the much more numerous cases in which the sequence is reversed.\u201d (9 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 90.52, p. 16-547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, Baker is a California resident, employed under a contract made within this state, and injured within territorial waters where the City of Avalon has control over the floating dock involved. All parties accept that the LHWCA and the state have concurrent jurisdiction where there is a showing of local interest. We conclude that Baker\u2019s contacts with California, coupled with the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of its citizens, conferred upon it concurrent jurisdiction with the Jones Act as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\n<em>CNA\u2019s Additional Contentions and Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">CNA suggests that the recent case of <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Calhoun </em>(1996) 516 U.S. 199 [116 S.Ct. 619, 133 L.Ed.2d 578] supports its position. <em>Yamaha </em>involved the death of a nonseaman who was killed while using a jet ski in territorial waters. The <em>Yamaha </em>court reviewed the tortured history of recovery in maritime wrongful death cases, concluding that state remedies were available when a nonseaman was killed in a jet ski accident within territorial waters. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 206-215 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 624-628].) It is questionable whether <em>Yamaha </em>is helpful to CNA, but in any event the instant case does not involve a wrongful death claim. (Cf. <em>Southwest Marine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gizoni, supra, </em>502 U.S. at pp. 90-91 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 493-494] [noting that the LHWCA is less complex and comprehensive than the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., and lacks the exclusivity language of the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">CNA acknowledges that \u201cwhere the subject-matter falls within admiralty jurisdiction, state law may \u2018supplement\u2019 federal maritime law but may not directly contradict it. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Southworth Machinery </em>v. <em>F/V Corey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Pride </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 994 F.2d 37, 41 [attorney fee provision in state statute held inconsistent with maritime law].) CNA fails to state in what way it believes the state workers\u2019 compensation law contradicts the federal law, asserting only that \u201cCongress, through the Jones Act, has addressed already what remedies are available to seamen injured in territorial waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">CNA frequently suggests that Baker is somehow obtaining a double recovery if CNA is held to be liable for the payments ordered. The record does not support its position. All expenses except for the $6,622.08 addressed by the WCJ were paid by Navigators on behalf of Employer. The settlement agreements took those payments into consideration. The amount assessed CNA consists of several small unpaid medical bills and money advanced by the California Employment Development Department. While the record indicates that Baker received the services billed and the income, there is no evidence these constituted a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">CNA cites California Labor Code section 3602 for the proposition that the state workers\u2019 compensation scheme is exclusive and that the employee may not seek redress in other forums.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is generally understood that the exclusivity provision refers only to other California forums.

[&lt;]n A more fundamental answer to the election defense, and one that applies as well to state compensation acts, is the argument, advanced in other connections where the doctrine has made its appearance, that the doctrine of election simply has no place in modem social insurance law. Whatever may have been its justification in the process of setting up ground mies for private adversary legal contests, it makes no sense when applied to public protective systems created to serve public as well as private purposes. The community has decided that injured workers and their families shall have as a minimum the security that goes with nonfault compensation. It is not for the individual, once he or she is part of that system, to elect whether its protection is a good idea or not. If the individual accepts or claims its benefits, this is not an election but merely the setting in motion of a protective process ordained by the state. This being so, it would undermine and prejudice the operation of this protective public program if the claimant were put in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>position of risking the loss of other valuable rights, such as those under the Jones Act, by the mere fact of accepting or invoking this basic system of compensation protection. It is of the nature of compensation, as distinguished from damage actions, that it is intended to be both prompt and reliable, in order to perform its function of caring for the immediate economic and medical needs of an injured worker and his or her family. If, then, he or she accepts or claims compensation as his or her first move, perhaps fully intending to follow this with a Jones Act action, this should not be thought to be sinister, deceitful, or avaricious on his or her part. The worker is setting out to ensure that the worker gets the minimal social insurance protection that the worker may be entitled to. If it turns out later that the worker is entitled to a more generous award under a different system, since the compensation award will be credited on the larger award, there has been no serious harm done.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 16-511 to 16-513, fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> Labor Code section 3602 provides as pertinent: \u201c(a) Where the conditions of compensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover such compensation is, except as specifically provided in this section and Sections 3706 [failure to secure compensation for damages] and 4558 [absence of power press guards], the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer, . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
