J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUSa\">Defendant Foresters Equity Services, Inc. (FESCO), appeals an order denying its motion to compel arbitration and stay plaintiff John Paul Clone\u2019s lawsuit for wrongful termination of employment. Asserting it was the third party beneficiary of an agreement by Cione to arbitrate the parties\u2019 dispute, FESCO contends the court should have compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>arbitration. We reverse and direct the superior court to enter an order granting FES CO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Soon after going to work for FESCO, Cione applied for registration with a securities industry self-regulatory organization. As part of his registration application form, Cione agreed to arbitrate any dispute with FESCO required to be arbitrated under the regulatory organization\u2019s rules. About three years later, Cione and FESCO executed a written employment agreement containing no reference to arbitration or to Clone\u2019s industry registration form.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">When a dispute arose about the circumstances surrounding Cione\u2019s separation from employment with FESCO, FESCO submitted the matter to industry arbitration. Cione filed this lawsuit against FESCO for wrongful termination. Based upon Clone\u2019s industry registration form, FESCO asked the superior court to compel arbitration. Denying FESCO\u2019s motion, the court concluded the parties\u2019 written employment agreement was an integrated contract not incorporating the arbitration provision of Clone\u2019s industry registration form or otherwise providing for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">On May 9, 1988, Cione began employment with FESCO, a \u201cmember\u201d firm of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">On May 12, 1988, Cione signed a Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration (Form U-4) requesting registration as a \u201cregistered options principal,\u201d \u201cfull registration/general securities representative,\u201d \u201cgeneral securities sales supervisor,\u201d \u201cgeneral securities principal,\u201d \u201cmunicipal securities principal,\u201d and \u201cagent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the Form U-4, Cione identified FESCO as his employing \u201cfirm.\u201d The Form U-4 contained an arbitration clause providing: \u201cI agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or any other person, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations with which I register, as indicated in item 10 as may be amended from time to time.\u201d In item 10 of the Form U-4, Cione registered with NASD.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">On May 21, 1991, Cione and FESCO entered into a written employment agreement containing provisions involving the length of Clone\u2019s employment and methods for terminating the agreement. Among the stated reasons for termination for cause was Clone\u2019s \u201cfailure to maintain any license necessary for the performance of his duties hereunder.\u201d The written employment agreement between Cione and FESCO also included an \u201cintegration\u201d clause providing: \u201cThis Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to in this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On June 29, 1994, Cione resigned from his employment with FESCO, assertedly under threat of discharge. A dispute arose between Cione and FESCO about Clone\u2019s separation from employment and the terms of his severance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On September 30, 1994, FESCO submitted its dispute with Cione to NASD for arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">On October 6, 1994, Cione sued FESCO for wrongfully terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On October 28, 1994, FESCO filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay this lawsuit. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. (the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)).) FESCO asserted that under Form U-4 Cione agreed to arbitrate any controversy arising between Cione and FESCO involving his employment and its termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">On November 10, 1994, filing opposition to FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, Cione asserted his written employment agreement with FESCO was an \u201cintegrated contract\u201d that set forth the parties\u2019 entire understanding about the terms of his employment with FESCO and did not contain any provision obligating him to arbitrate matters arising out of such written employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On December 13, 1994, in further opposition to FESCO\u2019s motion, Cione executed and filed his declaration asserting that in dealing with written employment contracts during his employment in the securities industry for more than 25 years, his experience was that \u201cNASD member firms insert specific arbitration clauses into such written employment contracts if in fact the parties agree to arbitrate their employment disputes and wish to insure that such disputes are in fact arbitrated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cione\u2019s declaration also asserted that the lack of an arbitration provision in his written employment agreement with FESCO \u201csignifies the specific agreement between myself <em>[sic] </em>and FESCO that arbitration with the NASD was not to be the sole forum for resolution of employment related disputes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">On December 16, 1994, in the superior court, counsel orally argued FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On December 20, 1994, the superior court entered an order denying FESCO\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">FESCO appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">FESCO contends the superior court erred in concluding that, although silent on the issue of arbitration, Clone\u2019s written employment agreement with FESCO negated Clone\u2019s separate written agreement (Form U-4) with NASD to arbitrate his employment dispute with FESCO. FESCO asserts federal and state law compelled a conclusion that Form U-4 obligated Cione to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In response, Cione essentially contends the written employment agreement\u2019s silence on the issue of arbitration, together with its integration clause, mandated a conclusion such agreement superseded the Form U-4 arbitration clause. However, as we shall explain, in light of the strong public policies favoring arbitration, on this record the superior court should have granted FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\u201cCongress enacted the FAA \u2018to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Its primary substantive provision states that \u201c[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Spellman </em>v. <em>Securities, Annuities &amp; Ins. Services, Inc. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 452, 458 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 427], quoting 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.) \u201c \u2018Section 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\u2019 [Citations.] [^fl \u2018 \u201cIn enacting \u00a7 2 of the federal Act, Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Spellman </em>v. <em>Securities, Annuities &amp; Ins. Services, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 458-459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\u201cIt is well settled that disputes between a member of a national stock exchange and its employee are governed by the [FAA] where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>binding arbitration agreement. [Citations.] In such instances, questions concerning the construction and scope of the arbitration clause are determined by federal law. [Citation.] However, the <em>\u2018existence </em>of a valid agreement to arbitrate involves general contract principles, and state law governs disposition of that question. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1259, 1263 [265 Cal.Rptr. 381].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Similarly, in <em>Heily </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 255, 258 [248 Cal.Rptr. 673], the appellate court observed that \u201cin <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 483 . . . , the court directly confirmed that the FAA controls lawsuits brought by employees against securities brokerage firms.\u201d \u201c[S]tate law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is applicable \u00a1\u00a1y that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In deciding whether Cione\u2019s employment dispute claims against FESCO were arbitrable, we must determine (1) whether an agreement to arbitrate existed, (2) whether FESCO waived its right to compel arbitration, and, if not, (3) whether Cione\u2019s claims came within the scope of such arbitration agreement. <em>(Wojcik </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. and Annuity Co., supra, </em>901 F.Supp. at p. 1286, citing <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24-34 [111 S.Ct. 1647, 1651-1656, 114 L.Ed.2d 26]; accord, <em>Hall </em>v. <em>MetLife Resources </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1995) Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 198,742, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>Formation of Contract to Arbitrate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cThe right to arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract. [Citations.] There is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate. [Citation.]\" <em>(Engineers &amp; Architects Assn. </em>v. <em>Community Development Dept. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 644, 653 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 800].)  As noted, the FAA does not apply until the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement is established under state law principles involving formation, revocation and enforcement of contracts generally. <em>(Platt Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>Andelson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 307, 313 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 597, 862 P.2d 158]; <em>Engineers &amp; Architects Assn. </em>v. <em>Community Development Dept., supra, </em>at p. 653; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1263; <em>Heily </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d at pp. 258-259; <em>Chan </em>v. <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pp. 639-640.) Hence, in seeking to compel arbitration, FESCO was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to prove the existence of an enforceable agreement containing a provision mandating arbitration of the employment dispute between Cione and FESCO. <em>(Pagett </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 620, 623-624 [119 Cal.Rptr. 536].) According to Cione, FESCO did not satisfy such affirmative burden. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Cione does not deny he signed a Form U-4 containing an arbitration provision when registering with NASD. Such agreement to arbitrate was a contract with NASD, not with FESCO. <em>(Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 25, fn. 2 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 1651-1652]; <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1995) 872 F.Supp. 1274, 1277.) Further, the arbitration agreement was not simply the Form U-4 but instead also included the NASD Code expressly incorporated by reference into such form. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1265; <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. and Annuity Co., supra, </em>901 F.Supp. at p. 1286.) However, citing <em>Chan </em>v. <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d 632, Cione contends the superior court properly denied FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. Clone\u2019s reliance on <em>Chan </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Nothing in <em>Chan </em>v. <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d 632, mandated denial of FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of this lawsuit. Instead, <em>Chan </em>was based upon a version of Form U-4 substantially different from the form signed by Cione. Distinguishing <em>Chan, </em>the appellate court stated in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at page 1264: \u201cThe U-4 form at issue in the instant case is markedly different from the form at issue in <em>Chan. </em>The most significant distinction is that the U-4 form signed by Baker clearly indicated her agreement to <em>arbitrate. </em>The basic arbitration provision was contained in the U-4 itself and not in a secondary document. In <em>Chan </em>the U-4 form contained no language notifying the applicant of an arbitration provision. The applicant there was forced to search the body of rules to find the arbitration provision.\u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, </em>at p. 1264, italics in original.) Similar to the situation in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, supra, </em>the Form U-4 executed by Cione clearly contained a provision requiring arbitration of disputes with FESCO. (Cf. <em>Spellman </em>v. <em>Securities, Annuities &amp; Ins. Services, Inc., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 457-458.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In sum, applying state law principles involving formation of contract, we conclude Cione entered into an agreement to arbitrate when in registering with NASD he executed a Form U-4 containing an express arbitration clause. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Aubry, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\n<em>Enforceability of Cione\u2019s Contractual Obligation to Arbitrate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As discussed, the right to compel arbitration depends upon a contract. <em>(Engineers &amp; Architects Assn. </em>v. <em>Community Development Dept., supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 653.) Cione contends the superior court properly concluded his arbitration agreement with NASD contained in Form U-4 was rendered unenforceable by FESCO by virtue of the \u201cintegration\u201d clause of his written employment agreement with FESCO lacking any provision for arbitration. However, Cione\u2019s contention betrays a misunderstanding of the contract FESCO sought to enforce. FESCO did not seek to enforce its written employment agreement with Cione. Instead, as an intended third party beneficiary, FESCO sought enforcement of Cione\u2019s Form U-4 agreement with NASD. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1559; <em>Div. of Lab. Law Enforcement </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 306, 309 [183 P.2d 932];<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> cf. <em>Reynolds Elec, etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 429, 433 [55 Cal.Rptr. 248, 421 P.2d 96]; <em>Sublett </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s etc. Lunch </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 273, 275 [131 P.2d 369].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u201cWhether the third party is an intended beneficiary or merely an incidental beneficiary involves construction of the intention of the parties, gathered from reading the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was entered. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Eastern Aviation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Airborne Express, Inc. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1452 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 355]; accord, <em>Bancomer, S. A. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1458 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 435].)  Here, the intent to benefit FESCO appears from the terms of the Form U-4. <em>(Kalmanovitz </em>v. <em>Bitting </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 311, 315 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 332].) Cione signed a Form U-4 containing his agreement \u201cto arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm . . . that is required to be arbitrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations with which I register . . . .\u201d On the Form U-4, Cione registered specifically with NASD and identified his \u201cfirm\u201d as FESCO. Hence, FESCO was an express beneficiary of Clone\u2019s Form U-4 agreement with NASD. <em>(Eastern Aviation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Airborne Express, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 1452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">FESCO\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, grounded specifically on Clone\u2019s execution of the Form U-4, was tantamount to a suit in equity seeking specific performance of Clone\u2019s agreement with NASD. <em>(Engineers &amp; Architects Assn. </em>v. <em>Community Development Dept., supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 653.) Opposing FESCO\u2019s motion, Cione essentially contended that third party beneficiary FESCO effectively waived any right to compel arbitration by entering into the written employment agreement containing an \u201cintegration\u201d clause assertedly superseding Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration obligation. However, even if the written employment agreement between Cione and FESCO were deemed to constitute the entire agreement between those two parties, such agreement said nothing about the intention of Cione and NASD with respect to the Form U-4 arbitration clause FESCO sought to enforce. <em>(O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., supra, </em>872 F.Supp. at p. 1277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., supra, </em>872 F.Supp. 1274, the court rejected a contention that an employment contract superseded a Form U-4 arbitration agreement. The court observed the Form U-4 \u201cis not a contract with defendants but rather an application to qualify with various security exchanges. The U-4 is a separate contract, and as long as this contract is effective, the terms of the agreement must be followed, regardless of the fate of a separate, though related, agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1277.) In <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., </em>the court also found \u201cthere was no clear and unambiguous agreement to waive or supersede the U-4 agreement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, this record does not demonstrate any intent by FESCO (or by NASD) that the written employment agreement would waive or supersede Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The \u201cintegration\u201d clause of Clone\u2019s written employment agreement with FESCO provided: \u201cThis Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to in this Agreement.\u201d Hence, by its terms the scope of the integration clause was \u201climited\u201d to the \u201csubject matter contained\u201d in the written employment agreement. <em>(Hayter Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1, 14 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 229]; cf. <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Farmers Group, Inc. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>718, 729-730 [269 Cal.Rptr. 299].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although containing provisions about the length of Clone\u2019s employment and methods for its termination, the written employment agreement did not specify any forum for resolving any disputes between the parties whether arising from Clone\u2019s separation from employment or otherwise. Neither did the written employment agreement refer to Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration agreement with NASD or otherwise make any mention of arbitration. In sum, neither in its integration clause nor elsewhere did the written employment agreement suggest it stated the parties\u2019 entire agreement as to all matters or that it otherwise superseded Clone\u2019s prior written arbitration agreement with NASD. On the contrary, the written employment agreement expressly recognized Clone\u2019s continuing obligation to comply with securities industry requirements by providing for termination if Cione failed to \u201cmaintain any license necessary for the performance of his duties hereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Thorup </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 228 [225 Cal.Rptr. 521], the appellate court stated \u201c. . . the right to arbitrate, like any other contract right, can be waived, either expressly or by implication. [Citations.] Whether a right to arbitrate has been waived will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. [Citation.] But the particular facts must be viewed in light of the strong policy favoring arbitration. [Citation.] Thus, the party claiming waiver has a heavy burden; and a waiver will not be lightly inferred. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234.) Absent any showing that his written employment agreement with FESCO was either expressly or implicitly inconsistent with his arbitration obligation under Form U-4, Cione may not rely on the written employment agreement\u2019s silence about dispute resolution to establish that such agreement superseded his Form U-4 obligation to arbitrate. <em>(Ibid.; </em>cf. <em>J. Alexander Securities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1093 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 826]; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Nomura Securities International </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 43, 46-48 [268 Cal.Rptr. 45].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Further, even if we were to deem Clone\u2019s written employment agreement with FESCO to be wholly integrated, we would nonetheless conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration obligation was not superseded. Evidence would be properly admissible \u201c \u2018to prove the existence of a separate . . . agreement as to any matter on which the document is silent and is not inconsistent with its terms\u2019 . . . even though the instrument appeared to state a complete agreement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Masterson </em>v. <em>Sine </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 222, 226 [65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561].) Since the written employment agreement was silent on the forum for dispute resolution, Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration agreement with NASD was probative and admissible as not inconsistent with the terms of such employment agreement. Hence, since the written employment agreement was reasonably susceptible to the meaning that it did not supersede the Form U-4, any doubts must be resolved in favor of arbitration. <em>(Thorup </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Clone\u2019s purported evidence of custom, practice and usage in the securities industry was insufficient to support a contrary result. As noted, Cione submitted his declaration asserting that NASD member firms ordinarily inserted specific arbitration clauses into written employment contracts if the parties actually wished to arbitrate their employment disputes. Cione also submitted three assertedly \u201csample\u201d employment agreements containing arbitration and integration clauses. Citing such evidence, Cione contends the absence of any arbitration provision in his written employment agreement with FESCO compelled a conclusion this lawsuit was not subject to arbitration. However, although Cione asserts such purported evidence of custom, practice and usage in the securities industry in May 1991 was properly admissible to explain the meaning of his written employment agreement with FESCO <em>(Hayter Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 1),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the record indicates Cione did not receive any of the three asserted \u201csample\u201d industry agreements until at least seven months after he executed the written employment agreement with FESCO. Further, Cione did not attempt to present any other evidence suggesting that during the time of negotiating and executing their written employment agreement FESCO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>and Cione ever discussed the issue of Clone\u2019s Form U-4 arbitration agreement with NASD. Hence, on this record we cannot say the parties had a clear mutual understanding that an employment termination dispute would not be subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In sum, applying general state law principles involving revocation and enforcement of contracts, we conclude that by entering into the written employment agreement with Cione, FESCO did not waive its right to compel arbitration as a third party beneficiary of the arbitration clause contained in Clone\u2019s Form U-4\u2019s agreement with NASD. Thus, the Form U-4 arbitration clause was not superseded by Clone\u2019s separate written employment agreement with FESCO. <em>(Thorup </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 234; <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., supra, </em>872 F.Supp. at p. 1277.)

Noting the provisions of NASD Code sections 1 and 8(a) before those amendments were \u201cvery broad\u201d in scope, the appellate court in <em>Spellman </em>concluded such provisions were \u201c \u2018. . . certainly broad enough to cover a dispute between an NASD member and an employee, not stemming from the purchase and sale of securities.\u2019 [Citations.] [H Significantly, courts have broadly construed language similar to that contained in NASD rules . . . as to the arbitrability of claims of nonmembers \u2018 \u201carising out of the business\u201d of a member.\u2019 [Citations.] Such claims, arising out of employment or termination of employment and not directly entailing transactions, are arbitrable regardless of whether the employment contract itself is invoked. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Spellman </em>v. <em>Securities, Annuities &amp; Ins. Services, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 464-465.) The appellate court also stated: \u201cCongress has delegated broad powers to self-regulatory organizations within the securities industry, including NASD, to police the conduct of their members.

[Citation.] The association stated that the purpose of the 1993 amendment was simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to \u2018clear up any ambiguity\u2019 and \u2018to assure\u2019 that employment disputes are arbitrable under Section 8.

Similarly, in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., supra, </em>872 F.Supp. 1274, the court concluded the October 1993 amendments to the NASD Code merely clarified the then existing rule encompassing employment disputes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1278.) The court observed: \u201cNASD had interpreted its Code to include employment disputes as early as 1987. [Citation.] Thus, \u2018 \u201cNASD has taken the position that employment disputes are arbitrable under Section 8, but in order to clear up any ambiguity, it is proposing the changes.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] While the amendment, seen in a vacuum, would seem to be a change in the existing policy, when seen in the light of NASD\u2019s public announcement that it is a clarification, the Court should give credence to the intent of the maker of the Code.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>First Investors Corp., supra, </em>at p. 1278.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the same vein, the court in <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. &amp; Annuity Co., supra, </em>901 F.Supp. 1282, observed that NASD \u201cexplained that the amendments were designed to clarify its long-held understanding that employment disputes are arbitrable under section 8 of the Code. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1287, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Moreover, even if the preamendment NASD Code were construed as <em>not </em>requiring submission of the parties\u2019 employment dispute to arbitration, arbitration would nonetheless be compelled since such dispute arose after the amendments\u2019 effective date. As noted, by expressly agreeing in the Form U-4 to abide by NASD rules as they might \u201cbe amended from time to time,\u201d Cione at the time of contracting intended to be bound by amendments to those rules. The 1993 amendments to the NASD Code govern arbitrability issues in disputes arising, as here, after the amendments\u2019 effective date of October 1, 1993. <em>(Wojcik </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. and Annuity Co., supra, </em>901 F.Supp. at pp. 1286-1289; <em>Scher </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur.

In <em>Wojcik </em>the court concluded: \u201cSince Wojcik filed his claim after the effective date of the amendment, the amendment is applicable to Wojcik\u2019s case without retroactive application.\u201d <em>(Wojcik </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. and Annuity Co., supra, </em>at pp. 1288-1289.) In <em>Scher </em>the court stated: \u201cScher agreed to comply with the NASD rules \u2018as they are and may be adopted, changed or amended from time to time.\u2019 [Citation.] Significantly, the amendment occurred prior to the filing of this law suit. Scher must comply with the NASD Code as it existed at the time he commenced his action.\u201d <em>(Scher </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur.

Co. of America </em>v. <em>Lai, supra, </em>42 F.3d 1299 <em>(Lai), </em>the appellate court in <em>Renteria </em>observed: \u201cIn <em>Lai, </em>we held that \u2018a Title VII plaintiff may only be forced to forego her statutory remedies and arbitrate her claims if she has knowingly agreed to submit such disputes to arbitration.\u2019 [Citation.] This \u2018knowing waiver\u2019 requirement, which we concluded was \u2018apparent from the text and legislative history of Title VII,\u2019 [citation] \u2018reflects our public policy of protecting victims of sexual discrimination and harassment through the provisions of Title VII and analogous state statutes\u2019\u2014\u2018a policy that is at least as strong as our public policy in favor of arbitration.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Renteria, supra, </em>at pp. 1105-1106, fn. omitted.) However, the <em>Lai/Renteria </em>knowing waiver requirement does not apply here since Clone\u2019s claim asserts age discrimination, not sex discrimination under title VII of the Federal Civil Right Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) or analogous California statutes. Under federal law, age discrimination is prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), not by title VII. In <em>Lai, </em>the court observed that <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate!Johnson Lane Corp., supra, </em>500 U.S. 20, \u201cmade it clear that the ADEA does not bar agreements to arbitrate federal age discrimination in employment claims.\u201d <em>(Lai, supra, </em>at p. 1303, fn. omitted.) Similarly, in <em>Kuehner </em>v. <em>Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 84 F.3d 316 <em>(Kuehner), </em>the court indicated the <em>Lai </em>knowing waiver requirement did not apply to claims under the ADEA or to wrongful discharge claims under California statutory law. <em>(Kuehner, supra, </em>at p. 319.) Indeed, citing <em>Kuehner, </em>the court in <em>Renteria </em>expressly acknowledged that the <em>\u201cLai </em>knowing waiver requirement applies only to a comparatively small class of claims arising under title VII or similar laws . . . [and] would have no bearing on various other classes of claims .... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Renteria, supra, </em>at p. 1107.) We also note that even as to title VII cases the \u201cknowing waiver\u201d portion of <em>Lai </em>restated in <em>Renteria </em>has been severely criticized by other federal courts and by another California appellate court. <em>(Brookwood </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1667, 1673, fn. 5 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 515], citing <em>Maye </em>v. <em>Smith Barney Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1995) 897 F.Supp. 100, 107.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Lai </em>and <em>Renteria </em>are not controlling authority as to the facts present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In sum, Clone\u2019s employment dispute with FESCO came within the scope of the arbitrability clause of his Form U-4 agreement with NASD.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">FESCO as a third party beneficiary sought enforcement of the arbitration clause of Clone\u2019s Form U-4 agreement with NASD. Although Clone\u2019s later written employment agreement with FESCO contained an integration clause indicating such agreement was complete between Cione and FESCO with respect to its subject matter, such agreement did not purport to say anything about the Form U-4 or the forum for resolving employment disputes. Hence, the integration clause did not mean the written employment agreement applied to the exclusion of Clone\u2019s contract with NASD.
