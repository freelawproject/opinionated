J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWG\">Amvest Mortgage Corporation (Amvest) appeals an order denying its petition for administrative mandamus. The petition sought an order from the superior court requiring respondent, Jim Antt, Jr., as Commissioner of the Department of Real Estate (collectively, the Department), to set aside an order suspending the firm\u2019s corporate real estate broker\u2019s license for 30 days. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">On June 1, 1993, the Department filed an accusation against Amvest and its designated broker/officer, Thomas J. Kerrins, alleging several violations of laws and regulations governing the conduct of a mortgage loan broker. A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) who issued a proposed decision finding Amvest, through Kerrins\u2019s negligence or failure to supervise Amvest employees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> committed the following unlawful acts: (1) the firm\u2019s trust account was short $1,136.09 (a deficiency the firm repaid); (2) Amvest did not follow required reconciliation practices for its trust accounts pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 10, section 2831.2; (3) the two Amvest employees who were permitted to withdraw funds from the trust account were not licensed either as brokers or real estate salespersons, nor did Amvest maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage for these persons (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 2834); (4) Amvest did not supply all borrowers with the proper lending disclosure documents (Bus. &amp; Prof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Code, \u00a7 10240)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (5) Amvest was subject to a prior thirty-day suspension order which had been stayed on condition the firm refrain from committing further acts that would be cause for disciplinary action within one year of that prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The ALJ concluded these violations warranted discipline under section 10177 subdivision (d), and ordered Amvest\u2019s corporate real estate broker\u2019s license suspended for two years, which suspension was stayed under the following conditions: (1) thirty-day actual suspension; (2) Amvest obey all laws and responsibilities applicable to a real estate licensee; and (3) it pay the reasonable cost of the Department\u2019s audit. The commissioner adopted the proposed decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Amvest\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and it petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus. Appellant challenged the findings and the suspension order on the following grounds: (1) the violations were not willful as required by section 10177, subdivision (d); and (2) because Kerrins had disassociated himself from the firm prior to the hearing, the last paragraph of section 10177 bars imposition of any sanctions against the firm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The superior court denied the writ petition, ruling that willfulness is not required by section 10177, subdivision (d), and Kerrins\u2019s disassociation from the firm did not prevent the Department from imposing these sanctions. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">\n<em>Suspension Is Improper for the Current Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Amvest contends section 10177 prevents suspension because the broker/officer who had responsibility to ensure compliance with the law and regulations, Thomas Kerrins, was no longer associated with the firm. Am-vest does not challenge the evidence finding it was vicariously responsible for these violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">Because the right to continue one\u2019s trade or profession is fundamental, the trial court was required to exercise its independent judgment and determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>evidence presented at the disciplinary hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>California Real Estate Loans, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1575, 1580 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 462] (Wallace); <em>Apollo Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Real Estate </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 625, 634 [220 Cal.Rptr. 199]; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 276, pp. 1077-1078.)  On appeal from an order granting or denying an administrative mandamus petition, the appellate court gives the superior court\u2019s judgment the same effect as if a trial were held in that court. <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 907, 914-916 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d 33]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 379-380, pp. 428-432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">Section 10177 provides in part: \u201cThe commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of any real estate licensee, ... or may suspend or revoke the license of, ... a corporate applicant if an <em>officer, </em>director, or person owning or controlling 10 percent or more of the corporation\u2019s stock has done, any of the following: HD ... HD (d) Willfully disregarded or violated the Real Estate Law [or] regulations . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (o) provides: \u201cThe commissioner may not deny or suspend the license of a corporate real estate broker if the offending officer, director, or stockholder has been completely disassociated from any affiliation or ownership in the corporation.\u201d The 1988 amendment to the statute added the first and last paragraphs quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">A. <em>Kerrins Was an Officer Under Section 10177.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">First we address the issue of whether Kerrins was a corporate officer of Amvest within the meaning of section 10177. Since the evidence was undisputed, the issue becomes a question of law. (See generally, <em>Tieberg </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 943, 951 [88 Cal.Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975] [where facts are undisputed, nature of employment relationship is question of law]; <em>David Kikkert &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shine </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 112, 116 [86 Cal.Rptr. 161].) The uncontroverted records provide substantial evidence that Kerrins, as the designated \u201cbroker/officer,\u201d was a corporate officer for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">It is undisputed that at all pertinent times, Amvest operated as a corporate real estate broker only through and because of Kerrins\u2019s license. (\u00a7 10211; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 2740.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If there is no licensed officer, the corporation cannot perform licensed activities. (2 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7 4:8, p. 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>The accusation alleged the violations resulted from Kerrins\u2019s negligent supervision of Amvest employees. Amvest does not contend otherwise. Throughout these proceedings, the Department referred to Kerrins as the company\u2019s designated broker/officer. Paragraph IV of the accusation alleged: \u201c. . . Amvest was and is licensed as a real estate broker corporation <em>acting by and through respondent Kerrin </em>[sic] <em>as designated broker </em>officer.\u201d (Italics added.) Paragraph XIV alleged Kerrins was the officer responsible for \u201cthe supervision and control of the activities conducted on behalf of the corporation by its officers and employees, and failed to so exercise reasonable supervision and control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">The license certification document prepared by the Department as part of its investigation and admitted into evidence as exhibit 2, reflects that Kerrins was Amvest\u2019s designated broker/officer from November 12, 1991, until April 8,1994. In its own audit report, upon which the trust account violation is based, the Department identified Kerrins as the \u201cdesignated officer\u201d of Amvest, holding the corporate title of vice-president. He and owner/president Ronald James were identified as the only officers of the corporation. In his findings of fact, the ALJ specifically found Kerrins was the \u201cbroker officer of Amvest [who] was responsible for the supervision and control of Amvest\u2019s activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Given this undisputed evidence, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe evidence also did not clearly show that Kerrins was a corporate officer or director . . .\u2019\u2019is incomprehensible. Not only is this finding unsupported by the weight of the evidence, it is refuted by the relevant statutes. (\u00a7\u00a7 10159, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was simply no evidence, nor is there any law, to support the ALJ\u2019s finding. Kerrins was an officer of the corporation within the meaning of section 10177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">B. <em>Kerrins\u2019s Disassociation From Amvest Precludes Suspension.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">As we have noted, the final sentence of section 10177 reads: \u201cThe commissioner may not deny or suspend the license of a corporate real estate broker if the offending officer, director, or stockholder has been completely disassociated from any affiliation or ownership in the corporation.\u201d Amvest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>argues this provision precluded any suspension in this case because, at the time it was imposed, Kerrins no longer had any connection with Amvest. In spite of the straightforward language of the quoted sentence, the Department contends it really does not mean what it says. While the Department\u2019s interpretation is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous, we must decide the issue as a pure question of law. <em>(San Lorenzo Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 841, 850 [187 Cal.Rptr. 432, 654 P.2d 202]; <em>Wallace, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1582.)  \u201cTo determine the intent of legislation, we first consult the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. . . . When \u2018 \u201cstatutory language is . . . clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d \u2019 . . . The plain meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning is \u2018 \u201crepugnant to the general purview of the act,\u201d or for some other compelling reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>(DaFonte </em>v. <em>Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">The Department asserts the language should be interpreted to apply only in the limited circumstance when the corporation is innocent of any <em>independent </em>wrongdoing, e.g., the \u201ccorporate licensee (\u2018Corporation A\u2019) which terminates its relationship with an officer . . . who violated the law while in the employ of a different broker, or violated the law in a transaction unrelated to Corporation A\u2019s business, is not to be disciplined by the Commissioner.\u201d (Original emphasis.) The Department relies on the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest to the bill (Sen. Bill No. 1891) which declared, inter alia: \u201cExisting law specifies the grounds for the revocation or suspension ... of any real estate licensee. [*][] This bill would authorize those actions to be taken against a corporate licensee ... if an officer, director, or person owning more than 10% of the stock of the corporation has committed any of the prohibited acts, as specified.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1891, 4 Stats. 1988 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 158.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest does little more than restate the wording of the amended statute. Merely restating the amended language does not demonstrate that the exception set forth in the final paragraph of the statute does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The sentence in question could not be more clear. The argument that the meaning ascribed to it by Amvest is somehow repugnant to the purposes of the regulatory scheme is not convincing. We must presume the Legislature was fully aware that, by this sentence, it was permitting a corporation to avoid suspension of its corporate license for the unlawful acts of an officer if that person divested himself or herself of any connection with the corporation. This undoubtedly was a trade-off by which a corporation and its employees would be allowed to continue to operate under the license of another broker/officer which was in good standing. It is the type of compromise routinely made by the Legislature, and we have been presented with no compelling reason to subvert the Legislature\u2019s straightforward intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>In addition to the absence of any supporting legislative history for its interpretation, the Department\u2019s position is also not supported by logic. The basic policy which supports the imposition of a suspension upon a corporate licensee for improper conduct of its officers is the doctrine of respondeat superior. (See <em>Wallace, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1583-1584.) Thus, there must be a connection between improper conduct by an officer, director or shareholder and the corporate entity sought to be disciplined in order for responsibility to attach. If the last sentence of section 10177 is interpreted to apply only to the scenario the commissioner posits, it would render that language superfluous since, even without the exception, there could be no corporate responsibility under principles of respondeat superior. (See generally, 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 115, pp. 109-110; 5 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 37, p. 96.) We must presume the Legislature intended to accomplish something by adding the last sentence to section 10177. The interpretation which the Department suggests would essentially render it meaningless since vicarious responsibility could never attach under the circumstances the Department contends it was intended to reach, i.e., violations unrelated to the corporate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The Department has staked out an interpretation which is unsupported by legislative history or logic. We reject it and read the plain and unambiguous provisions of the final sentence of section 10177, added in 1988, as declaring the Department may not suspend a corporation\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license if the offending officer has completely disassociated himself or herself from the corporation at the time the suspension is imposed. That is this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The judgment is reversed and remanded with directions to the superior court to issue a writ of mandate directing respondent to set aside its order suspending petitioner\u2019s corporate real estate broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">Parrilli, J., and Walker, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Prior to the date of this hearing, the Department settled the charges against Kerrins and he was not a party to the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">All untitled statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">That paragraph reads: \u201cThe commissioner may not deny or suspend the license of a coiporate real estate broker if the offending officer, director, or stockholder has been completely disassociated from any affiliation or ownership in the corporation.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 521, \u00a72, p. 1956.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Section 10211 reads: \u201cIf the licensee is a corporation, the license issued to it entitles one officer thereof, on behalf of the corporation, to engage in the business of real estate broker without the payment of any further fee, such officer to be designated in the application of the corporation for a license.
