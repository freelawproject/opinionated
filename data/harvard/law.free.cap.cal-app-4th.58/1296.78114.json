J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIp\">In this inverse condemnation action, Jack D. and Angela Adams Scott, as trustees of the Angela Adams Scott trust (together Scott), and Edwin C. Lynch, as trustee under trust agreement dated May 25, 1988, appeal a judgment entered in favor of the City of Del Mar (Del Mar) after the trial court determined Del Mar\u2019s removal of their seawalls, riprap and patios encroaching on the public beach was not compensable under constitutional takings principles. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">Scott and Lynch own neighboring oceanfront homes between 23d and 24th Streets in Del Mar which when purchased had wooden seawalls with riprap in front of the walls and private patios between the walls and homes. The seawalls, built in 1928 (Lynch) and 1946 (Scott), were not on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>residential lots but between 15 and 16 feet seaward of the westerly lot lines on public beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">After storms in 1983 damaged the seawalls, Scott and Lynch\u2019s predecessor in interest made repairs. Del Mar sent Scott a notice the seawall, along with a new windbreak and stairs to the beach, were located 15 feet 10 inches west of the property line and would have to be removed within 10 days unless permits were obtained. Scott invited Del Mar to send him the necessary paperwork but it did not respond. Del Mar sent Lynch\u2019s predecessor in interest a similar letter, advising the seawall, new decking and stairs to the beach were 16 feet west of the property line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In 1988 Del Mar adopted the Beach Overlay Zone by the initiative process, enacted as chapter 30.50 of the Del Mar Municipal Code, to \u201cprotect public access to and along the shoreline, while promoting public safety, health and welfare, and providing for the protection of private property.\u201d (Del Mar Mun. Code, \u00a7 30.50.010.) The ordinance prohibits seawalls and other structures west of the shoreline protection area line, which runs north to south along the coast and generally coincides with the westerly property lines of oceanfront lots. Property west of the shoreline protection area line is in the shoreline protection area. The ordinance requires removal of preexisting nonconforming structures, but a shoreline protection permit is available under certain circumstances for a seawall up to five feet west of the shoreline protection area line. (Del Mar Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 30.50.040A, 30.50.100 &amp; 30.50.060G.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">In October 1988 Del Mar sent Scott and Lynch notices their improvements encroached on the shoreline protection area, and an administrative hearing would be scheduled to determine an abatement period. Del Mar advised Scott and Lynch that if they disagreed with its determination, they should submit survey information showing their property lines, the existing development, the shoreline protection area line and the distance five feet west of that line. Further, Del Mar advised it would continue the hearing if Scott or Lynch wished to apply for a shoreline protection permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Having received no response, on March 13, 1992, Del Mar sent Scott and Lynch certified notices of an April 6, 1992, administrative hearing to consider staff\u2019s recommendation they be ordered, at their own expense, to remove the noncomplying structures. The notices informed of the right to present evidence and warned: \u201cIn any further legal proceedings concerning this subject matter you may be limited to the evidence and issues raised at this hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">Jack D. Scott, an attorney, appeared at the hearing on his and Lynch\u2019s behalf. He did not, however, present any evidence. After staff\u2019s presentation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>Del Mar adopted resolution Nos. 92-39 and 92-40, declaring the Lynch and Scott improvements to be encroachments extending into the shoreline protection area, which deny public access to the beach and adversely impact \u201cshore processes.\u201d Del Mar ordered abatement of the nonconforming improvements by May 15, 1992. Lynch and Scott removed their brick patios, but not the seawalls and riprap. Over their objections, Del Mar removed them in late May 1992. Scott and Lynch did not apply for shoreline protection permits to build seawalls closer to their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">In April 1993 Scott and Lynch sued Del Mar in inverse condemnation, alleging they were entitled to compensation for the property taken for public beach, the improvements and increased vulnerability of their homes to storms, vandalism and burglary. In a bench trial on the issue of liability<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the court determined there was no taking of the underlying property because the subdivider dedicated it to public use in 1912. The court also determined there was no taking of the improvements as Del Mar had the power to declare them public nuisances and to abate them; because Scott and Lynch failed to pursue a mandamus action challenging Del Mar\u2019s nuisance finding, the court was bound by that finding. Lastly, the court determined there was no entitlement to diminution in value caused by removal of the improvements because Scott and Lynch failed to mitigate damages by obtaining permits for protective seawalls in conformance with the beach overlay zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">On appeal, Scott and Lynch contend there is insufficient evidence the property in question was dedicated to public use, and alternatively, any public right was abandoned. They further contend the trial court erred in relying upon Del Mar\u2019s nuisance finding and in imposing an unreasonable mitigation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">A. <em>Inverse Condemnation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">\u201cBoth eminent domain proceedings and inverse condemnation actions implement the constitutional rule that private property may not be \u2018taken\u2019 (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) or \u2018taken or damaged\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a719) for public use without just compensation. When a public entity exercises its power of eminent domain to condemn private property, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>ordinarily no question that it has \u2018taken or damaged\u2019 that property. But the same is not true of inverse condemnation: \u2018While, in eminent domain litigation, the focus is usually limited to the amount of compensation owed the property owner under the \u201cjust compensation\u201d clause, in an inverse condemnation action, the property owner must first clear the hurdle of establishing that the public entity has, in fact, taken [or damaged] his or her property before he or she can reach the issue of \u201cjust compensation.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 939-940 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 724, 920 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">\u201cA public entity \u2018takes or damages\u2019 private property when it causes physical damage to that property without physically invading it. (E.g., <em>Holtz </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 296 . . . [withdrawal of lateral support caused by excavation of adjacent street]; <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1885) 66 Cal. 492 . . . [converse: damage from increased lateral pressure caused by filling of adjacent street].) . . . [f A public entity also \u2018takes or damages\u2019 private property when it physically invades that property in any tangible manner. (E.g., <em>Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 250 . . . [landslide]; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 276 . . . [floodwaters].)\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 940.) Inverse condemnation also lies where the government\u2019s conduct \u201cresults in an intangible intrusion onto the plaintiff\u2019s property that does not physically damage the property,\u201d if the \u201cintrusion has resulted in a burden on the property that is direct, substantial, and peculiar to the property itself.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 298 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43] [offensive odors emanating from sewage plant, rendering nearby home uninhabitable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">B. <em>Failure of Proof re Compensable Taking or Damaging</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjK\">1. <em>Land Underlying Improvements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">The first question is whether the trial court correctly determined the land underlying the improvements Del Mar removed was public land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A statutory dedication is effected when, in compliance with the map act then in force, an offer of dedication is accepted by the public agency. <em>(Galeb </em>v. <em>Cupertino Sanitary Dist. </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 294, 301 [38 Cal.Rptr. 580].) Map 1450 of Del Mar Subdivision No. 3 depicts block Nos. 124 through 127, between 21st and 24th Streets, which run east to west; each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>block contains residential lots, numbered 1 through 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A 15-foot-wide area designated \u201cPublic Sidewalk\u201d runs north to south through the development, intersecting each block between lots 8, 9,10 and 11 to the west, and 6, 7, 12 and 13 to the east.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The map contains South Coast Land Company\u2019s offer to \u201cdedicate to the public use all public Highways shown on this map within this subdivision.\u201d The county accepted and recorded the dedication in June 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Scott and Lynch assert \u201call public Highways\u201d would exclude the Public Sidewalk. \u201cHighway,\u201d however, was used at the relevant time to denote a variety of public rights-of-way. \u201cSection 2618 of the Political Code as reenacted in 1883, and which was in force until 1935, declared the law with respect to what constituted public highways and antedated the earliest travel over the route by vehicle. As reenacted it read as follows: \u2018In all counties of this state public highways are roads, streets, alleys, lanes, courts, places, trails, and bridges . . . .\u201d <em>(Ball </em>v. <em>Stephens </em>(1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 843, 846 [158 P.2d 207].) Sidewalks were specifically included within the definition of streets <em>(Heath </em>v. <em>Manson </em>(1905) 147 Cal. 694, 698 [82 P. 331]; <em>Short Line Associates </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 50, 56 [143 Cal.Rptr. 921]), and as noted, streets and highways were used synonymously. Map 1450 contained no \u201chighways,\u201d but \u201cpikes,\u201d or streets, and the Public Sidewalk. The reference to \u201chighways\u201d thus necessarily includes all public rights-of-way or the dedication offer would be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Further, controlling at map 1450\u2019s recordation was the 1907 subdivision act, which required the subdivider to record a map describing: \u201cFirst: All parcels of ground . . . offered for dedication for public uses, whether they be intended for public highways, parks, courts, commons or other public uses, and their dimensions and boundaries and the courses of their boundary lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">\u201cSecond: All lots intended for sale, or reserved for private purposes and not offered for dedication to the public use, <em>either by number or letter, </em>and their dimensions and boundaries and the courses of their boundary lines. All parcels of land offered for dedication as public highways and not accepted by the proper authorities . . . , shall also be designated by number or letter.\u201d (Stats. 1907, ch. 231, \u00a7 1, p. 290, italics added.) The Public Sidewalk was not designated by number or letter, as required if reserved for private use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>The sidewalk\u2019s dimensions, 15 feet by about 1,000 feet, further indicate an intended use as a public thoroughfare. \u201c[T]here is a strong intimation of an intention on the part of the owner to offer to the public for use as a street or alley an unnumbered or unlettered parcel of ground that did not conform in either shape or dimensions to any of the lots or blocks delineated.\u201d <em>(Gross </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1932) 125 Cal.App. 238, 244 [13 P.2d 820].) This is particularly true where the only means of accessing some of the subdivision lots is over the property in question. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, a county land surveyor testified that when map 1450 was recorded, numerous interior lots would have been landlocked absent access from the Public Sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Additionally, South Coast Land Company developed subdivisions north and south of map 1450\u2019s area, and those subdivisions also included public rights-of-way of similar dimensions seaward of the oceanfront lot lines. There was evidence that the dedicated area in the southern development once contained a concrete sidewalk. Lastly, the county has treated the Public Sidewalk as a public right-of-way since 1912. The area appears on assessor maps as public property, and the county stopped assessing property taxes for the Public Sidewalk area when map 1450 was recorded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, after reviewing the entire record we conclude the court\u2019s finding the Public Sidewalk was dedicated to public use in 1912 is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Scott and Lynch alternatively argue Del Mar is estopped to deny it abandoned the property by never building a sidewalk on it, and by ignoring the private seawalls and other improvements for decades. It is well settled, however, that a public agency\u2019s mere nonuse of dedicated land does not show abandonment or give rise to an estoppel claim. <em>(City of Imperial Beach </em>v. <em>Algert </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 48, 51 [19 Cal.Rptr. 144]; <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(1956) 146 Cal.App.2d 114, 123 [303 P.2d 549].) Further, Del Mar\u2019s failure to return the beach to the public until the beach overlay zone was enacted does not amount to a \u201cclear affirmative rejection\u201d of the Public Sidewalk area, as required by <em>Algert, </em>upon which Lynch and Scott rely, before estoppel will be applied against a public entity. <em>(City of Imperial Beach </em>v. <em>Algert, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d at pp. 52-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">2. <em>Improvements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Scott and Lynch next contend they are entitled to just compensation for the seawalls, riprap and patios, even if they were built on public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>land.  In proper cases, recovery in inverse condemnation is available for the taking or damaging of personal property. <em>(Sutfin </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 50, 53 [67 Cal.Rptr. 665].) Generally, any actual physical injury to the property which is proximately caused by a deliberately designed and constructed public project is compensable without regard to foreseeability. <em>(Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 250, 263 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129].) However, there are exceptions to this rule of liability without fault. \u201cThe decisive consideration is whether the owner of the damaged property if uncompensated would contribute more than his proper share to the public undertaking.\u201d <em>(Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 628, 642 [220 P.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">\u201c[U]nder the pressure of public necessity and to avert impending peril, the legitimate exercise of the police power often works not only avoidable damage but destruction of property without calling for compensation. Instances of this character are the demolition of all or parts of buildings to prevent the spread of conflagration, or the destruction of diseased animals, of rotten fruit, or infected trees where life or health is jeopardized.\u201d <em>(House </em>v. L. A. <em>County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 384, 391 [153 P.2d 950].) In the nonemergency situation, the government also has the power to declare what constitutes a nuisance and to abate it, after affording the owner reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>(City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>Soffer </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 378, 383 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 735]; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Coalinga </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1627, 1634 [236 Cal.Rptr. 124]; <em>Mohilef v. Janovici </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 286 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].) For instance, in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Hadley Fruit Orchards, Inc. </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 49 [130 Cal.Rptr. 287], the court held there was no constitutional entitlement to compensation for the loss of advertising billboards removed as public nuisances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Here, the court determined it was bound by Del Mar\u2019s administrative findings that the improvements were nuisances, because Scott and Lynch failed to challenge the findings in a mandamus action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) We need not determine whether that was error, as Scott and Lynch argue, because the evidence introduced at trial proved that the seawalls, riprap and patios were abatable nuisances per se. \u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s order, not its reasoning, and affirm an order if it is correct on any theory apparent from the record.\u201d <em>(Blue Chip Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brent-wood Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 706, 712 [139 Cal.Rptr. 651].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he legislature has the power to declare certain uses of property a nuisance and such use thereupon becomes a nuisance <em>per se.\u201d </em>[Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>. . . Nuisances <em>per se </em>are so regarded because no proof is required, beyond the actual fact of their existence, to establish the nuisance.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(City of Costa Mesa </em>v. <em>Soffer, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 382, fn. omitted.) The Legislature has declared that the obstruction of a public right-of-way is an abatable nuisance. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3479, 3480, 3491.) A city may \u201cprohibit and prevent encroachments upon or obstruction in or to any sidewalks, street, alley, lane, court, park, or other public place and provide for the removal of such encroachment or obstruction.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 38775.) Additionally, under Del Mar\u2019s Beach Overlay Zone ordinance, any nonconforming structure constitutes a public nuisance subject to abatement at the owner\u2019s expense. (Del Mar. Mun. Code, \u00a7 30.50.100A &amp; B.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">As discussed above, the evidence established. (1) the Public Sidewalk on map 1450 was dedicated to public use in 1912, and (2) the private seawalls, riprap and patios on the Scott and Lynch properties completely obstructed public access to the Public Sidewalk area. Accordingly, the improvements were nuisances per se, and Del Mar had the power to declare them such and remove them, after complying with due process requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compensation is not constitutionally mandated, even if, as Scott and Lynch contend, appropriate permits were obtained for the original construction of the improvements. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Hadley Fruit Orchards, Inc., supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d at pp. 53, 55-56; see also <em>County of El Dorado </em>v. <em>Al Tahoe Investment Co. </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 407, 410-412 [346 P.2d 205] [removal of gasoline pumps installed on public highway pursuant to permit not a compensable taking].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">3. <em>Increased Exposure to Storms, Vandalism and Burglary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Lastly, Scott and Lynch contend they are at least entitled to the diminution in value of their homes caused by increased vulnerability to storms, vandalism and burglary. They rely upon the testimony of Scott A. Jenkins, Ph.D., an oceanographer, that seawalls were needed to protect the homes from \u201cany event with a wave height significantly greater than an average wave,\u201d and if the seawalls had not been in place during a 1988 storm, the homes would have sustained damages. Additionally, Ronald M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>Noble, an engineer, testified that absent seawalls, the residences could be flooded or destroyed in a significant storm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">An action for inverse condemnation lies \u201cwhere the taking results in property damage [or] other depreciation in market value .... [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Jordan </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1257 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 340].) However, \u201c. . . a diminution in property value is not a \u2018taking or damaging\u2019 of the property, but an element of the measure of just compensation when such taking or damaging is <em>otherwise </em>proved.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 942, italics added.) Thus, for instance, \u201c. . . a zoning action which merely decreases the market value of property does not violate the constitutional provisions forbidding uncompensated taking or damaging . . . .\u201d <em>(HFH, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 508, 518 [125 Cal.Rptr. 365, 542 P.2d 237].) There, the court noted: \u201cPlaintiffs fail to distinguish between the \u2018damaged\u2019 property which is a requisite for a finding of compensability and the \u2018damages\u2019 by which courts measure the compensation due. Reasoning backwards, plaintiffs erroneously contend that since they can calculate damages (by measuring decline in market value), they must have been \u2018damaged\u2019 within the meaning of the state Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Likewise, Scott\u2019s and Lynch\u2019s claims that Del Mar\u2019s removal of the protective structures caused their properties to decrease in value fails to establish a constitutionally compensable \u201ctaking or damaging.\u201d To the contrary, as discussed above, Del Mar\u2019s abatement of the encroachments on public land was a reasonable exercise of its police power, which does not give rise to an inverse condemnation action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Hadley Fruit Orchards, Inc., supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d 49, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

Del Mar\u2019s ordinances also declared the improvements to be nuisances because they blocked public access to the beach and thus the evidence regarding erosion is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1117-7\"> Scott and Lynch characterize their alleged damages as \u201cseverance damages\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.410, subdivision (a), which applies to eminent domain actions and provides: \u201cWhere the property acquired is part of a larger parcel, in addition to the compensation awarded ... for the part taken, compensation shall be awarded for the injury, if any, to the remainder.\u201d Where appropriate, eminent domain principles apply to inverse condemnation actions. <em>(Chhour </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1996) <em>46 </em>Cal.App.4th 273, 280 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 585].) There could be no \u201cseverance damages\u201d here, however, because Del Mar did not acquire any part of Scott\u2019s or Lynch\u2019s real property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1117-8\"> In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>City of Del Mar </em>(Nov. 1, 1994) D020803 (nonpub. opn.), we stated that even if the seawalls and other improvements were on public property, \u201cthe appellants\u2019 complaint can be read as including a claim for compensation based on damages (threatened physical damage from storms, vandalism and burglary) caused by a public works type project (removal of patios, seawalls and rip rap).\u201d Scott and Lynch assert this establishes their entitlement to damages. The statement again teaches that an appellate court would do well to avoid ill-considered dicta. In any event, the statement is no more than a recitation of the pleading allegations and does not establish any right to compensation under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"Akl\">Our holding makes it unnecessary to consider whether the court erred in determining damages were unavailable because Scott and Lynch failed to obtain shoreline protection permits to build new seawalls. Again, we review the court\u2019s ruling, not its rationale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
