The People petitioned this court to issue a writ of mandate ordering reinstatement of the charges and requested that the trial of real party in interest, Elena Shamis, be stayed pending this court\u2019s determination of the merits of the petition. We stayed the trial proceedings and issued an alternative writ of mandate. Shamis filed an opposition to the petition and we held a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing on the matter on September 18, 1997. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>find the People\u2019s contention the trial court erred in dismissing the murder and insurance fraud counts has merit and determine a peremptory writ of mandate commanding reinstatement of the charges should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">1. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Sometime in 1989 or 1990, Filemon Santiago was introduced to Elena Shamis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shamis was the office administrator for an attorney, Gary Paul Miller, and Santiago had gone to the office to discuss the \u201caccident business.\u201d When Santiago spoke with Shamis about referring accident cases to Miller\u2019s law office, Shamis indicated Santiago would be paid between $4,000 and $5,000 per accident, depending on the number of people involved. When Shamis and Santiago discussed a \u201cper head\u201d rate, Shamis indicated Santiago would be paid between $1,100 and $1,200 for each individual involved in a particular accident. Santiago would be paid the fees approximately two weeks after making the referral, after the case was \u201cverified].\u201d If the law office later \u201cdropped\u201d the case, Santiago would be required to either return his fee or make another referral without pay. The form of payment to Santiago was generally \u201chalf checks, half money\u201d for referrals. A number of checks made out to Santiago were signed by Shamis.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Approximately nine months after he first began referring cases to Miller\u2019s law office, Santiago discussed with Shamis \u201chow some of these accident cases came about.\u201d Shamis and Santiago discussed \u201chow many people were [involved]\u201d and whether the damage to the car exceeded $500. The cases referred by Santiago were almost always \u201crear-enders\u201d involving at least three people. Shamis and Santiago discussed which insurance companies paid claims quickly and which did not, and Santiago was informed the office would not handle cases involving certain insurance companies because they took too long to pay claims. Santiago also spoke to Shamis about \u201cgetting money [to purchase] insurance\u201d when he did not have enough money to \u201cfinance\u201d a case. Santiago told Shamis that if he was to bring in accident cases, he would need \u201cmoney to buy insurance for people who were going to be in the accidents.\u201d Shamis \u201cdid not refuse to give [Santiago] money for insurance.\u201d All of the cases for which Santiago sought money for insurance were staged. In total, Santiago referred three or four cases per week to Miller\u2019s office, the \u201cmajority\u201d of which had been \u201cstaged.\u201d Santiago usually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>brought the cases to Shamis, who then sometimes discussed them with Miller.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">For a period of approximately three months, beginning in June of 1991, Santiago stopped referring cases to Shamis. In approximately September of 1991, he resumed making referrals and continued to do so until June 17, 1992. During that time, Santiago \u201csometimes\u201d discussed with Shamis or Miller accidents that \u201coccurred or would occur on the freeway.\u201d These conversations usually took place in Shamis\u2019s office. During at least one discussion, Shamis told Santiago that \u201cthe bigger [the] case, [the] bigger the money.\u201d Santiago understood this to mean that, while a \u201cregular\u201d street collision was probably worth about $35,000, a case which occurred on the freeway and involved an automobile and a big-rig truck could be worth $100,000 or more. After Santiago \u201cbrought in\u201d a case involving a big-rig truck and an automobile, both Shamis and Miller indicated the accident was \u201cgood\u201d and involved \u201cgreat damage.\u201d Both Shamis and Miller then told Santiago to \u201cbring in more [freeway truck] cases,\u201d and Santiago agreed to do so. Although he never told Shamis the accidents were staged, at one point Santiago informed her that he would \u201cbring in an accident case [the] next week.\u201d Santiago later brought to the office eight more cases involving rear-end freeway collisions between big-rig trucks and automobiles. At some point, Santiago had a discussion with Shamis during which he requested an increase in the amount of money he was being paid for the big-rig cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Santiago was personally involved in at least one attempt at a \u201cbig-rig\u201d accident. Santiago and three men, one of whom is Shamis\u2019s codefendant, Juan Carlos Amaya, met on 24th Street, near the intersection of San Pedro Street and Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles. Santiago had known Amaya for a number of years and the two men were friends. Amaya had staged a number of collisions which Santiago then referred to Miller\u2019s office. Santiago had paid Amaya as much as $3,000 for each of these referrals. On this particular day in either late May or early June of 1992, the men agreed Amaya would drive the lead car and Santiago would follow him. Amaya and Santiago were to position themselves in front of a truck. Amaya would brake, making it necessary for Santiago to brake in front of th\u00e9 big-rig. Two additional cars would pull up, one on each side of the big-rig, to prevent the truck from changing lanes. As the lead car veered off, the car immediately in front of the truck would slam on its brakes, causing the truck to rear-end the car. Although the men drove onto the freeway in their various cars, the group did not succeed in causing an accident that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">On June 17, 1992, Jorge Sanchez was approached by his neighbor, Luis Perez. Perez told Sanchez that he could make $300 by helping Sanchez to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>\u201cmake an accident.\u201d Sanchez, Perez and a man named Isiais got into a black car and drove to an area near 24th Street, where the group met Amaya, another man, and a woman. The woman got into the black car with Perez, Sanchez and Isiais. Amaya got into his own car and Amaya\u2019s male companion got into a third car. At some point, Perez got into the backseat of the black car and told Sanchez to get into the driver\u2019s seat. Sanchez did so and the three cars, with Amaya leading the group, drove onto the Interstate 5 freeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">After driving for awhile, Sanchez saw a large big-rig pulling a trailer loaded with cars. Driving erratically as he attempted to follow Amaya, Sanchez maneuvered the black car behind Amaya\u2019s and immediately in front of the truck. When Amaya stepped on his brakes, Sanchez braked. The big-rig truck attempted to move around the black car, but was unable to do so. When Sanchez \u201cslammed on [his] brakes,\u201d the truck driver lost control of the big-rig and was unable to avoid colliding with his car. The big-rig jackknifed and the trailer, which was fully loaded with cars, fell over onto the back of the black car, killing Perez.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Amaya, who was ahead of the accident, drove off the freeway. Later that day, Amaya telephoned Santiago and told him what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On June 18, 1992, the day after Perez was killed, Santiago went to see Miller. During their conversation, Miller told Santiago that, \u201cbecause of the accident,\u201d Santiago should \u201cleave the country.\u201d Santiago followed Miller\u2019s advice and went to Mexico. While in Mexico, Santiago ran short of funds and he sent a letter, addressed to both Miller and Shamis, asking for money. In the letter, Santiago claimed he needed $20,000 to \u201c \u2018start a new life at a different place.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Karen Magdaas and Hilda Jones were legal assistants at Miller\u2019s law firm. When a case was first referred to the law office, either Shamis or Miller would review it. The case would then be given to any one of a number of assistants, who would attempt to settle the matter. Shamis was in charge of \u201cthat phase of the practice of the office.\u201d If a problem occurred, the case would go to Shamis or Miller. If an insurance investigator indicated the damages of a particular case did not coincide with the accident, the case would be handled by Shamis or Miller. Shamis or Miller would sometimes have these problem cases \u201cdropped\u201d; the law firm would send letters to the client and the insurance company indicating it would no longer handle the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>matter. After the law offices were searched by police officers and Miller was arrested in October of 1993, the firm dropped \u201ca lot\u201d of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Shawn Ferris works with the California Department of Insurance investigating staged traffic collisions. On April 11, 1996, Ferris interviewed a man named Randy Harris. Harris told Ferris that, from sometime in the late 1980\u2019s until 1992, he had staged traffic accidents, then referred the cases to Miller\u2019s law office. Harris met Shamis at Miller\u2019s office. It was Harris\u2019s understanding that Shamis was \u201cworking the office . . . with Mr. Miller,\u201d and that if Miller were ever unavailable, Harris could see Shamis. In late 1991 or early 1992, Harris attended a meeting at Miller\u2019s office. Miller, Shamis, Santiago and a man named Emil Shamis were present, and the group discussed \u201cmixing up accidents.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was determined that if Santiago, who is Hispanic, and Harris, who is African-American, worked together, \u201cthey could be creating accidents which weren\u2019t all Hispanics or all Blacks but a mix . . . .\u201d It was concluded it is \u201ceasier to get settlements when [the accidents don\u2019t] show a pattern\u201d and that \u201cinsurance companies don\u2019t look at [the accidents] as closely if they [involve people] of mixed ethnic background^].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">During his investigation, Ferris seized a number of checks and other documents from Miller\u2019s office. Ferris determined that for the period between March of 1991 and October of 1992, Miller paid Shamis approximately $421,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">2. <em>Procedural History.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In an information filed on August 26, 1996, in case No. BA116066, real party in interest Elena Shamis and a codefendant, Juan Carlos Amaya, were charged with one count of murder (count one) (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), three counts of conspiracy (counts two, three, and four) (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182), and seven counts of insurance fraud (counts five to eleven) (Ins. Code, former \u00a7 1871.1, subd. (a)(3)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Following the preliminary hearing, the magistrate held Shamis to answer to all the counts alleging insurance fraud, including count 11, which charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Shamis committed insurance fraud by knowingly causing or participating in the June 17, 1992, accident which caused Perez\u2019s death. However, after stating he had \u201cproblems with count 1 [the murder count] as to Miss Shamis only,\u201d the magistrate declined to hold her to answer to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On January 24, 1997, the People filed a second information pursuant to Penal Code section 739.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This information again charged Shamis with one count of murder (count one) (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187). The information also charged Shamis with one count of conspiracy to commit insurance fraud (count two) (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182; Ins. Code, former \u00a7 1871.1), one count of conspiracy to commit grand theft (count three) (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 182, 487), and fourteen counts of insurance fraud (counts four to seventeen) (Ins. Code, former \u00a7 1871.1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In March of 1997, Shamis moved to set aside the information pursuant to Penal Code section 995.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At a hearing held on the matter on April 8, 1997, the trial court indicated it believed there was \u201ca conspiracy to commit an inherently dangerous act[;] [*][]... [t]o set up an accident where [one] would brake in front of a big[-]rig.\u201d However, the trial court declined to hold Shamis to answer to the charges stemming from the fatal accident of June 17, 1992. The court stated, \u201cWhat I am finding is that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that [Shamis] was involved in any conspiracy regarding this particular fatality, this particular staged accident.\u201d The trial court granted Shamis\u2019s section 995 motion to dismiss as to count one of the information, the murder charge, and count seventeen of the information, the count alleging insurance fraud in connection with the June 17 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The People filed the present petition seeking a writ of mandate directing the trial court to reinstate the charges of murder and insurance fraud in connection with the June 17 collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">To determine whether charges in an information can withstand a motion to dismiss, \u201cneither the superior court nor the appellate court may reweigh the evidence or determine the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Jurado) </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1226 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 242]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 718 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278].) It is the magistrate who is the finder of fact. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, \u201c[wjhere \u2018[n]othing in [the magistrate\u2019s comments] can be interpreted as a factual finding . . . ,\u2019 but at best merely indicate \u2018the magistrate formed the ultimate, legal conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to show probable cause . . .\u2019 [citation], \u2018the ultimate question [on refiling a charge in the information] is whether the . . . charge finds evidentiary support in the record.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Quinteros) </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 12, 20 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 462].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Probable cause to hold a defendant to answer is shown if a person \u201c \u2018 \u201cof ordinary caution or prudence [would be led] to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused [citation]. . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ortega </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 244, 256 [185 Cal.Rptr. 297].) \u201cTo support a felony information, there need be only \u2018some rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it\u2019 [citation], and an information will not be set aside or a prosecution prohibited thereon if this standard is met.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Quinteros), supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 20.) On review, \u201c[e]very legitimate inference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the information.\u201d <em>(Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 471, 474 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Here, neither the magistrate nor the superior court made adverse factual findings. Instead, they impliedly and expressly found the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the murder charge. The superior court also determined the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the charge of insurance fraud alleged in connection with the June 17, 1992, fatal collision. However, both the magistrate and the superior court found the evidence sufficiently established probable cause to hold Shamis to answer to the counts alleging conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of conspiracy plays a dual role in our criminal law. First, conspiracy is a substantive offense in itself\u2014\u2018an agreement between two or more persons that they will commit an unlawful object (or achieve a lawful object by unlawful means), and in furtherance of the agreement, [one or more of those persons] have committed one overt act toward the achievement of their objective.\u2019 [Citations.] Second, proof of a conspiracy serves to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>impose criminal liability on all conspirators for crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thus, \u2018where several parties conspire or combine together to commit any unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associates or confederates committed in furtherance of any prosecution of the common design for which they combine. In contemplation of law the act of one is the act of all.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Salcedo </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 209, 215 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 539], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Kauffman </em>(1907) 152 Cal. 331, 334 [92 P. 861]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Quinteros), supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 21.) Further, \u201ca conspirator is criminally liable for the act of a coconspirator which follows as a probable and natural consequence of the common design, even though it [is] not intended as a part of the original design or common plan. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Luparello </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 410, 442 [231 Cal.Rptr. 832].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The complaint filed in superior court on January 24, 1997, alleged 16 overt acts committed in furtherance of the two alleged conspiracies, including the causing by conspirators of seven different \u201ccollisions\u201d with big-rig trucks. Included, and alleged as overt act number 13, is the fatal collision which occurred on June 17, 1992.  A review of the evidence, as construed by the magistrate, supports the determination there is probable cause to believe Shamis committed the conspiracies and that those conspiracies included the staging of the fatal June 17 collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Shamis was a person of authority in the Miller law office. If Miller was unavailable, office personnel and others went to Shamis. She reviewed cases, attended meetings during which collisions between automobiles and big-rig trucks were discussed, and apparently had the authority to \u201cdrop\u201d a case if problems arose. For her services, Miller paid Shamis over $400,000 in less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">In addition, Shamis had significant contact with other conspirators. There is evidence Santiago discussed with Shamis \u201chow some of these accidents came about\u201d and that Shamis was the one who told Santiago how much he would be paid for accidents. Santiago also spoke to Shamis about \u201cgetting money to purchase insurance\u201d when he did not have enough money to \u201cfinance\u201d a case. Santiago specifically told Shamis that he would need money to \u201cbuy insurance for people who were going to be in [the] accidents.\u201d During at least one conversation, Shamis told Santiago that \u201cthe bigger [the] case, [the] bigger the money,\u201d and that a case which occurred on a freeway and involved a big-rig truck was preferred. Finally, Santiago and Shamis discussed an increase in the amount of money he would be paid for big-rig accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">On this record, a person of ordinary caution or prudence would be led to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion Shamis entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>express or tacit agreements to defraud and steal from insurance companies by staging accidents involving automobiles and big-rig trucks, and that one or more coconspirators took overt acts in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy. Included among those acts was the staging of the accident between a car and a big-rig truck on June 17, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">As a conspirator, Shamis is liable for the acts of her coconspirators which follow \u201cas a probable and natural consequence of the common design, even though [they are] not intended as a part of the original design or common plan. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Luparello, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 442.) Here, the evidence shows collisions between cars and big-rigs were staged according to a particular plan. The car which was to be in the collision was loaded with two or three passengers so that the insurance claim would be larger. A lead car, followed by one or more others, would drive onto the freeway. The lead car and the car immediately behind it would position themselves in front of a big-rig truck. At times, two additional cars would pull up, one on each side of the big-rig, to prevent the truck from changing lanes. The lead car would then brake, making it necessary for the car behind it, and immediately in front of the big-rig, to break. The car immediately in front of the truck would then slam on its brakes, causing the truck to rear-end the car. That Perez\u2019s death was the probable and natural consequence of such a planned collision is beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Moreover, the circumstances of Perez\u2019s death support a charge of second degree murder. A prosecution for murder requires a finding of malice. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 296 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279].)  \u201c[S]econd degree murder based on implied malice has been committed when a person does an \u2018 \u201c \u2018act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life\u2019 \u201d . . . .\u2019 [Citations.] Phrased in a different way, malice may be implied when [a] defendant does an act with a high probability that it will result in death and does it with a base antisocial motive and with a wanton disregard for human life. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 300; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Nieto Benitez </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 91, 103-104 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 864, 840 P.2d 969].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Here, Shamis\u2019s coconspirators staged an accident between a passenger car and a big-rig truck for the base, antisocial purpose of defrauding and stealing large amounts of money from insurers. The staging of the June 17, 1992, accident involved intentionally placing three passengers and a driver in a passenger car, driving the car onto the Interstate 5 freeway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>driving the car immediately in front of a fully loaded big-rig truck, then slamming on the car\u2019s brakes to cause the truck to collide with the car. If this conduct does not show a wanton, reckless disregard for human life, we would be hard pressed to find conduct which would. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Shamis\u2019s assertion she cannot be held to answer for Perez\u2019s murder because he was a coconspirator who \u201cintentionally helped [to] create the danger[ous] [incident],\u201d is without merit. Her reliance on the court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43] is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Antick, </em>Antick\u2019s accomplice, a man named Bose, \u201cinitiated a gun battle with the police in order to escape apprehension for a burglary which he and [Antick] had . . . committed. The police officer responded by killing Bose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 90.) The court indicated Bose\u2019s conduct in initiating a shootout with police could establish the malice required for murder. \u201cHowever, [the court determined,] Bose\u2019s malicious conduct did not result in the unlawful killing of <em>another </em>human being, but rather in Bose\u2019s own death. The only homicide which occurred was the justifiable killing of Bose by the police officer. [Antick\u2019s] criminal liability certainly [could not] be predicated upon the actions of the officer. As Bose could not be found guilty of murder in connection with his own death, it is impossible to base [Antick\u2019s] liability for this offense upon [the] vicarious responsibility for the crime of his accomplice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91, italics in original.)  In reaching this conclusion, however, the <em>Antick </em>court recognized that, in general, an accomplice will be \u201c \u2018. . . vicariously responsible for any killing attributable to the intentional acts of his associates committed with conscious disregard for life, and likely to result in death,\u2019 [citation] even though the immediate cause of death was the act of a third party.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>It is only in cases like <em>Antick, </em>where the defendant\u2019s responsibility for murder is based on his vicarious liability for the acts of an accomplice <em>who could not himself have been guilty of the offense </em>that liability will not lie. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Here, Perez, who would have been Shamis\u2019s coconspirator, died as a result of the big-rig accident. We recognize that, since Perez cannot be found guilty of murder in connection with his own death, Shamis\u2019s vicarious liability for Perez\u2019s murder cannot be based solely upon Perez\u2019s conduct. However, that does not preclude Shamis\u2019s vicarious liability based on the conduct of any number of other coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mai </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 117, 127 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 141], the court noted that in cases involving vicarious liability, the \u201cprovocative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>act doctrine\u201d is frequently implicated. The court stated, that in such cases, \u201cthe trier of fact will always be confronted with a chain of events involving at least three\u2014but often more\u2014individuals: By definition, the doctrine cannot apply unless there are two or more cofelons and the provocative acts by those who survive are sufficiently egregious to provoke a lethal response by a victim, police officer, bystander, or some combination of the foregoing. But in the typical case, ... the accomplice who is killed also engaged in provocative conduct. This means there are usually several layers of proximate cause analysis .... One is whether the defendant engaged in provocative conduct that can fairly be labeled as a proximate cause of an accomplice\u2019s death. Another ... is whether a surviving cofelon engaged in provocative conduct that can fairly be labeled as a proximate cause of an accomplice\u2019s death. If so, then even when the defendant on trial did not participate in the provocative act, he or she is nevertheless vicariously liable for the surviving accomplice\u2019s conduct and may be convicted of murder in the death of the accomplice who is killed. A third is whether the decedent caused his own demise by engaging in provocative conduct.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) To incur liability, \u201cthe provocative act of [a] defendant or . . . cofelon must be a substantial factor in the killing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Here, Shamis argues Perez caused his own death by getting into the car knowing the intent of the driver and others was to drive onto the freeway and stage an accident with a big-rig truck. Although Perez\u2019s act of getting into the car contributed to his death, it was far from the only cause. Amaya\u2019s conduct in driving onto the freeway and leading another car to a position immediately in front of a big-rig truck, then putting on the brakes was life-endangering, provocative conduct which substantially contributed to Perez\u2019s death. In addition, Sanchez, who, while following Amaya, drove erratically, maneuvered his car immediately in front of the big-rig, then slammed on his brakes, intentionally committed a life threatening act which was a substantial factor in the killing of Perez. It was Sanchez\u2019s and Amaya\u2019s conduct which caused the big-rig\u2019s driver to lose control of the vehicle, the truck to jackknife, and the trailer to fall onto the car. Shamis is criminally responsible for Amaya\u2019s and Sanchez\u2019s actions. As such, Shamis may be held to answer for Perez\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent superior court to vacate its order of April 8, 1997, dismissing as to real party in interest Elena Shamis counts one (murder, Pen.
