Saxbe, </em>attorney general, and <em>Mr. Walter J. Howdy shell, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-12\"><em>Mr. Francis H.

The appropriation of private property for public use is in derogation of the rights of the property owner firmly imbedded in laws and tradition. Therefore, it can be taken only by appropriation authority under a system as set forth in the statutes giving such rights, and under such circumstances as there required, and should be strongly construed in favor of the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The certificate of appropriation, asking for the appropriation of the Kampfer property does not contain a statement as to whether there was such authority for the appropriation for this specific land or for any land by the Governor of the state of Ohio, and where such authorization could be found, if made.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The court, however, will not dismiss the action on a certificate of appropriation, but does hereby rule that the pleadings be made definite and certain by pleadings indicating whether:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">1. The Governor of the state of Ohio had authorized appropriation of the within property and;</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">2. Further, when it was so authorized, and where such authority is on record.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The state of Ohio is given leave to amend said pleadings in accordance with the above decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>Motion to make definite and certain granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
