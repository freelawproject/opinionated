The Motion (Doc. 25) applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in both of these consolidated actions, and subsumes the original Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16), filed in 09-cv-938 alone. Upon consideration of Western Union\u2019s Motion and in keeping with my Preliminary Order issued on May 5, 2010 (Doc. 24), I DENY the Motion with regard to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment and/or conversion and order both cases set for a Pretrial/Scheduling Conference to be held in accordance with Fed. R.Civ.P. 16 and D.C.COLO.L.Civ.R 16.1. While I remain inclined to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 individual fraud claims, I invite oral argument on that issue, which I will hear at the scheduling conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">As previously introduced, Plaintiffs James Tennille and Robert Smet assert claims for conversion, unjust enrichment and consumer fraud against Western Union on behalf of the same nation-wide class of wire transfer customers, or various state subsets thereof. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations center on Western Union\u2019s practice of failing to notify customers when their attempted wire transfers fail or go unclaimed, and holding those funds in interest-bearing accounts, sometimes for years, until individual state unclaimed property laws trigger a notification obligation. Western Union then attempts to return customers\u2019 unclaimed deposit, but keeps the accrued interest for itself. Plaintiffs contend the failure to notify customers that their deposits are unclaimed is fraudulent, and the retention of interest that is properly customers\u2019, not Western Union\u2019s, is wrongful and subjects Western Union to equitable or quasi-equitable claims for conversion and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">In my May 5 Order, I determined I had subject matter jurisdiction over the putative class actions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) and <em>Woodmen of World Life Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Manganaro, </em>342 F.3d 1213, 1216-17 (10th Cir.2003), but warned Plaintiffs that the issue may be revisited if, at any stage of this litigation, it appears Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are determined not to be maintainable as a class action. I also rejected Western Union\u2019s blanket affirmative defense of \u201cimmunity\u201d from suit, premised on a theory that its practices are privileged under existing state unclaimed property laws, expressed doubt as to the viability of Western Union\u2019s statute of limitations defenses, and observed that the complex choice of law issues presented in the maintenance of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as a class action were not amenable to resolution at the pleading stage. Preliminary Order (Doc. 24) at 7, 8, &amp; 10. I now issue the following dispositive ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion and unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">\n<em>Legal Standard.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-11\">To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint generally must satisfy only the minimal notice pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Rule 8(a)(2) requires only that the complaint include a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are unnecessary \u2014 the statement need only \u201c \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what ... the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 93, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). All allegations of material fact are taken as true. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197. That said, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citations and quotations omitted). The allegations in the complaint \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Tenth Circuit articulates it, the <em>Twombly </em>plausibility standard means that \u201cthe mere metaphysical possibility that <em>some </em>plaintiff could prove <em>some </em>set of facts in support of the pleaded claims is insufficient; the complaint must give the court reason to believe that <em>this </em>plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of mustering factual support for <em>these </em>claims.\u201d <em>Ridge at Red Hawk, LLC v. Schneider, </em>493 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir. 2007) (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">The parties disagree as to which state\u2019s laws should apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in these cases. As I have previously stated, the choice of law issues are complex. Colorado\u2019s choice-of-law rules apply, <em>see Anderson v. Commerce Const. Servs., </em>531 F.3d 1190, 1193 (10th Cir.2008), and under these rules, the state having \u201cthe most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties\u201d will supply the law. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145(1) (1971). What state bears the most significant relationship is, however, not easy to ascertain. Western Union holds and transfers money electronically, from bank to bank, and held funds do not reside in any particular place in a physical way. Western Union\u2019s actions in failing to disclose the fact that funds have gone unclaimed \u201coriginate,\u201d according to Plaintiffs, in Missouri, but are \u201cdirected at,\u201d and \u201ccause injury to,\u201d customers, according to Western Union, in the individual states where they reside. Western Union conducts business in every state and throughout the world. It is headquartered in Colorado, where Plaintiffs chose to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">Plaintiffs argue that Missouri or, in the alternative, Colorado law applies to their claims. Defendants, contend the law of the states where individual customers seek out Western Union\u2019s services (Alabama, for Mr. Tennille and Illinois, for Mr. Smet) applies. Because the result is the same under each of these four states\u2019 laws, however, I do not resolve the conflict of law issue at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">1. <em>Unjust Enrichment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-10\">In support of their claims for unjust enrichment, Plaintiffs allege Western Union accrued interest on moneys belonging to Plaintiffs, during the entire period of time Western Union held those moneys without informing Plaintiffs they remained unclaimed, under circumstances where retaining that interest for itself rather than returning it to Plaintiffs was unfair, inequitable, and unjust. As the Supreme Court has long recognized, a claim that a defendant holds money, \u201cwhich ex aequo et bono belongs to the plaintiff\u2019 is less restricted and fettered by technical rules and formalities and approaches nearer to a bill in equity \u201cthan any other common law action.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Jefferson Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>291 U.S. 386, 402-03, 54 S.Ct. 443, 78 L.Ed. 859 (1934) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-11\">In Colorado, a claim for unjust enrichment is established by proving the following: \u201c(1) defendant received a benefit (2) at the plaintiffs expense (3) under circumstances that would make it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without commensurate compensation.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Colorado State Lottery Div., </em>179 P.3d 998, 1007 (Colo.2008) (citing <em>DCB Constr. Co., Inc. v. Central City Development Co., </em>965 P.2d 115, 119-120 (Colo.1998)). The essence of the claim is the retention of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>benefit under circumstances where it would be unjust not to return it, which principle is equally reflected in the law of Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama. <em>See Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Mid-West Elecs., Inc., </em>49 S.W.3d 236, 241 (Mo.Ct.App.2001) (cause of action in Missouri stated by alleging (1) benefit conferred by one party on another, (2) appreciation or recognition by the receiving party of the fact that what was conferred was a benefit, and (3) acceptance and retention of the benefit under circumstances that would make that retention inequitable); <em>HPI Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., </em>131 Ill.2d 145, 137 Ill.Dec. 19, 545 N.E.2d 672, 679 (1989) (to state a cause of action for unjust enrichment under Illinois law, plaintiff must allege that defendant has \u201cunjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiffs detriment, and that defendant\u2019s retention of the benefit violates the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and good conscience\u201d); and <em>Jewett v. Boihem, </em>23 So.3d 658, 661 (Ala.2009) (an action for unjust enrichment/money had and received \u201cis founded upon the equitable principle that no one ought justly to enrich himself at the expense of another, and is maintainable in all cases where one has received money under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain because in justness and fairness it belongs to another\u201d)(quoting Jenelle M. Marsh <em>&amp; </em>Charles W. Gamble, <em>Alabama Law of Damages </em>\u00a7 34:2 (5th ed. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">Western Union contends this theory of relief is unavailable to Plaintiffs because their relationship is governed by an express contract, which under any of the applicable states\u2019 law bars recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Mot. Dismiss (Doc. 25) at 7-8. Plaintiffs deny there was any express contract governing their relationship and certainly no express agreement concerning Western Union\u2019s right hold and leverage the time value of the money they deposited for transfer indefinitely. Even if Western Union\u2019s obligation to accept and transfer a customer\u2019s money in accordance with his wishes was in an express agreement, Plaintiffs deny such an agreement would preclude their recovery based on the facts alleged. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">While it is true that neither equity nor tort law provides a means for shifting risk one has assumed under contract, that maxim does not prevent recovery where the wrong alleged falls outside or exists independently of that contract. This is true in all four of the subject states, and precludes the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment. <em>See Lawry v. Palm, </em>192 P.3d 550, 563-64 (Colo.App.2008) (if the elements of unjust enrichment are established, a plaintiff may be entitled to relief even in the face of a contractual relationship to force the return of property that in equity and good conscience does not belong to the person who holds it); <em>Childress Painting and Assocs. Inc. v. Hammons Hotels Two LP, </em>106 S.W.3d 558, 562-63 (Mo.App.2003) (unjust enrichment is a theory of recovery under the doctrine of quasi-contract, and contractual provisions such as an indemnification clause will not constitute a defense to such claim if the elements of the claim in equity otherwise exist), <em>cf. Howard v. Turnbull, </em>316 S.W.3d 431, 438 (Mo.App.2010) (an agreement voluntarily entered into, with known risks and with the expectation of a profit, cannot be compensated for via a claim for unjust enrichment); <em>Utility Audit, Inc. v. Horace Mann Serv. Corp., </em>383 F.3d 683, 688-89 (7th Cir.2004) (a party may bring a claim for unjust enrichment even if its relationship with the other party is governed by a contract if the claim falls outside the contract)(Illinois law); <em>Hendrix Mohr &amp; Yardley, Inc. v. City of Daphne, </em>359 So.2d 792, 796 (Ala.1978) (while Alabama law generally bars unjust enrichment claims where there is an express contract govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>ing the conduct at issue, recovery in equity under an implied or quasi-contract is recognized where the existence of an express contract is not proven or where the other party has prevented its performance). Here, where the terms and import of any express contract between the parties is in dispute, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment are not barred under any of the applicable states\u2019 common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Alternatively, Western Union argues Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitations in each of the subject states. I disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries were continuously accruing as long as Western Union retained their deposited funds without notifying them they remained unclaimed. Because Western Union continued to generate and retain interest on Plaintiffs\u2019 unclaimed funds until such time as they notified Plaintiffs that their deposits had not been redeemed, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until then. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaints were filed within the earliest period asserted by Western Union to be applicable in this case (3 years), I reject Western Union\u2019s argument that Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are time-barred or that Plaintiffs sat on their right to demand the return of their unclaimed deposits so long that they are barred by the doctrine of laches from seeking compensation for the time value of those deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Western Union accrued, retained, and failed to return the interest it earned on Plaintiffs\u2019 unclaimed deposits over the period of years it held them state a valid claim for unjust enrichment under the law of Colorado, Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama. Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">2. <em>Conversion Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">Plaintiffs also assert claims for conversion arising out of Western Union\u2019s retention of their deposited funds and the interest accrued thereon for five or more years until providing notice for their return. While the parties expend considerable effort parsing the elements of a claim for conversion under the subject states\u2019 law, the essence of Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claim is the same as their claim for unjust enrichment: By holding customers\u2019 unclaimed deposits, sometimes for years, while those deposits accrued interest, and then failing to return that interest or an amount compensating Plaintiffs for the lost time-value of their deposits, Western Union exercised dominion over, and benefitted at Plaintiffs\u2019 expense by holding, moneys that belonged to Plaintiffs, not Western Union, which in equity and justice should be returned to them. Because Plaintiffs acknowledge Western Union returned the deposit principle, the essential harm alleged is the wrongful retention, and failure to return and/or the conversion of, the interest earned on that principle. The remedy for the alleged conversion, as with the unjust enrichment claim, is for restitution or disgorgement. Viewed this way, Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment and conversion claims are substantively the same, and are simply pled in the alternative. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims survive dismissal under a Rule 12(b)(6) standard, so do their claims for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Western Union\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 conversion claims focuses on alleged technical pleading failures, such as the failure to demand a return of the moneys held. While this may be relevant to Defendants\u2019 retention, for a period of years, of the deposit principle (the parties agree Plaintiffs were entitled to a return of their unclaimed deposits upon request, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>never asked), it has no application to the interest accrued on that principle. If a technical \u201cdemand and refusal\u201d is necessary to state a claim for conversion of that interest, then the filing of these lawsuits clearly satisfies this requirement. To the extent Plaintiffs have pled a completed conversion \u2014 i.e. that Western Union accrued interest on Plaintiffs\u2019 unclaimed deposits while it was holding them and converted that money to its own use without any express contractual right to do so\u2014 pleading demand and refusal serves no logical function and is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">Based on the foregoing, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 25) is DENIED to the extent it seeks the dismissal, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), of Plaintiffs\u2019 equitable claims for unjust enrichment and/or conversion. Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claims is held in abeyance, and will be set for oral argument by separate Minute Order coincidentally with a Rule 16 Scheduling Conference. The earlier-filed Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16), having been subsumed by Document 25, is DENIED as MOOT. The parties are specifically directed to confer in good faith regarding the principles set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(a) and (c)(2), and draft their proposed Scheduling Order accordingly. Specific consideration should be given to resolving this case short of protracted litigation based on the rulings issued to date.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
