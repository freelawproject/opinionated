Barron petitions this Court for a Writ of Actual Innocence pursuant to Chapter 19.3 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia. He contends he is innocent of burglary, attempted robbery, and the use of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery, of which he was convicted and sentenced in the Circuit Court of Henrico County on June 25, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(0, this Court ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Attorney General to file a response to the petition. This Court granted petitioner\u2019s request for appointment of counsel and permitted appointed counsel to file a reply to the Attorney General\u2019s response to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Upon consideration of the petition, the response of the Attorney General, the reply filed by petitioner\u2019s counsel, and the records of prior proceedings in the case, this Court dismisses the petition pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13 for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Facts Adduced at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The Commonwealth proved that around midnight on August 3, 1995, Marquis Owens was visiting Kevin Wood at Wood\u2019s apartment. Owens testified he heard a knock at the door of the apartment, but no one was there when he opened the door. Shortly thereafter, someone kicked open the door. Owens heard gunfire. Wood returned gunfire with a nine millimeter pistol. Wood suffered injury to his left leg, groin and abdomen. Regina Halstead, Wood\u2019s neighbor, returned home from work about the time of the attack. She heard gunshots at Wood\u2019s apartment and then saw a man run away. Police officers found petitioner\u2019s shotgun outside Wood\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Norma Lane, a nurse in the emergency department of Richmond Memorial Hospital, testified that petitioner arrived at the hospital at 12:15 a.m. on August 3, 1995. Petitioner received treatment for a gunshot wound to his leg. The hospital was located 2.5 miles from Wood\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Wood was killed in October of 1995. While investigating the homicide, Investigator Jim Dorton spoke to petitioner. Dorton testified that on December 5, 1995, petitioner said he and an accomplice went to Wood\u2019s apartment to rob Wood. Petitioner said his gun discharged accidentally, and he and the accomplice fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Testifying in his own behalf, petitioner denied any involvement in the offenses against Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\n<em>Emergency Room Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In support of his petition for a writ of actual innocence, petitioner contends he obtained in 2003 a copy of a report from the emergency department of Richmond Memorial Hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The report indicates petitioner sought treatment at the hospital on August 3, 1995 at 12:15 a.m. for a gunshot wound to the leg. According to the report, the injury had occurred about thirty minutes before petitioner appeared at the emergency room on a \u201cstreet near home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">To be entitled to the issuance of a writ of actual innocence pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13, the petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe previously unknown or unavailable evidence is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(viii). The pertinent information contained in the hospital report was cumulative of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and merely corroborated Lane\u2019s testimony. The report had no tendency to establish an alibi for petitioner at the time of the offenses or otherwise prove petitioner innocent of the charged offenses. Therefore, petitioner is not eligible for the writ based upon this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Dorton\u2019s Letter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Petitioner also produces a copy of a handwritten note, dated October 8, 1998, purportedly written to him by Dorton. The note states Dorton had spoken with the prosecutor about \u201ccharging AD\u201d and the prosecutor did not believe he \u201chad a good enough case on AD.\u201d Dorton advised petitioner to contact the prosecutor to explain petitioner\u2019s \u201cposition on this.\u201d By affidavit, petitioner contends \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s knowledge of someone else\u2019s guilt by the name \u2018A.D.\u2019 and Det. Dorton\u2019s attempt to puruse [sic] the real culprit of the offenses [he was] ... unjustly convicted of cast real doubt\u201d on petitioner\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>To be entitled to relief under Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13, a petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the previously unknown or unavailable evidence \u201cis material and when considered with all the other evidence in the current record, will prove that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii). Dorton\u2019s note and petitioner\u2019s accompanying affidavit fail to meet this standard, as they in no way affect the sufficiency of the evidence to support petitioner\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dorton\u2019s note indicates only that petitioner, after conviction and incarceration, attempted to blame \u201cAD\u201d for the offenses, but the police responded they did not have sufficient evidence to charge \u201cAD\u201d with any level of participation in the incident. While perhaps conveying suspicion on the part of the police that \u201cAD\u201d was involved in the crimes against Wood, the note does nothing to establish petitioner\u2019s innocence. Thus, petitioner is not eligible for the writ on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We deny petitioner\u2019s request to remand to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing as the pleadings and records before us do not support petitioner\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Because the issues addressed herein are of first impression and potential litigants and members of the bar may benefit from the directives herein, we direct the Clerk to publish this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">This Court\u2019s records reflect that Randall G. Johnson, Jr., Esquire, is counsel of record for petitioner in this matter. The Circuit Court of Henrico County shall allow the said court-appointed counsel the fee set forth below and counsel\u2019s necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses. The Commonwealth shall recover of petitioner the costs in this Court. The Attorney General shall recover of the petitioner his costs expended herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Costs due the Commonwealth by petitioner in Court of Appeals of Virginia:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Attorney\u2019s fee $400.00 plus costs and expenses Attorney General\u2019s costs:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Attorney\u2019s fees: $ 50.00</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\">. Petitioner also contends he is innocent of two crimes of which he was acquitted, malicious wounding and using a firearm in the commission of malicious wounding. Because petitioner was not convicted of these offenses, we need not consider his guilt or innocence of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">. For purposes of this case, we assume, without deciding, that petitioner\u2019s contention he obtained the hospital report at some point in 2003 was sufficient to satisfy Code \u00a7 19.2-327.1 l(A)(v), which requires a petitioner to state \"the date the previously unknown or unavailable evidence became known or available to the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">. On direct appeal, both this Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected petitioner's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
