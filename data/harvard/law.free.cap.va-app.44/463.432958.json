HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Shawn Rachine Maye appeals his convictions, following a bench trial, for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2), possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled substance (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A)), and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248). Maye first contends the trial court erred in finding that police executed a search warrant in compliance with the \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-56 and that it therefore erred in denying his motion to suppress the related evidence. Maye further contends that the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to establish that he constructively possessed the firearm and the cocaine. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Maye\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">In accord with settled principles, we review the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the party prevailing below, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">So viewed, the evidence presented below established that a \u201cconfidential, reliable informant\u201d advised Detective J.A. Meeks, Jr., of the Newport News Police Department, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMU\">On May 14, 2001 ... [the informant] had been to a motel room during the last 72 hours where he/she observed a quantity of cocaine that was available for sale. The informant identified the motel Room as 149 of the Econo Lodge located at 11845 Jefferson Avenue inside the City of Newport News. This motel room is commonly referred to as 11845 Jefferson Avenue, Room 149, Newport News, Virginia. The informant state[d] that while he/she was at Room 149, he/she observed a black male known as Shawn Maye in possession of a quantity of cocaine that was available for sale. The informant advised ... that Shawn Maye carries a firearm for protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Based upon that information, Detective Meeks \u201cidentified Shawn Maye as Shawn Rachine Maye,\u201d \u201cdescribed as a black male,\u201d \u201capproximately 5'10\" tall [weighing] about 180 pounds.\u201d Meeks obtained search warrants for the motel room and Maye\u2019s person that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Meeks executed the warrants eleven days later, during the early morning hours of May 25, 2001. Detectives Torres and Sorrell assisted Meeks during the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Detective Sorrell was the first officer to enter the motel room. Upon entry, he observed that there were two beds in the room. Maye was \u201con the first bed as [he] went into the room, to [his] right.\u201d George P. Brooks \u201cwas on the other bed.\u201d The beds were \u201cset up in the room parallel to one another.\u201d The \u201conly light in the room\u201d \u201cwas a TV that iUuminated the room, which was opposite [a] nightstand\u201d that \u201cseparate[d] the two beds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Upon searching the room, Detective Sorrell located a gun in the nightstand. The gun was lying in a lower, open portion of the nightstand, \u201cright next\u201d to \u201cwhere [Maye] was lying in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>bed.\u201d Detective Torres located digital scales containing \u201csuspected cocaine residue\u201d in the \u201cside pocket\u201d of a \u201cblack and tan bag.\u201d Detective Torres found the bag on the \u201cright side\u201d of the bed Maye was lying in. Torres asked Maye if the bag belonged to him. Maye stated that the \u201cbag was his.\u201d Detective Meeks searched Maye\u2019s person and located \u201capproximately $2200.00 in U.S. currency from his pants pocket[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">After the detectives read Maye his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Detective Meeks \u201casked [Maye] if he had ever possessed the firearm.\u201d Maye replied that \u201che had,\u201d but he claimed that the gun belonged to Brooks. Maye stated that he \u201cwould occasionally move it\u201d \u201cfrom one place to the other when he was cleaning up.\u201d For that reason, Maye acknowledged that the detectives would find his fingerprints on the gun. Maye also acknowledged \u201che was not able to possess a firearm because he was a convicted felon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">With regard to the \u201cduffel bag,\u201d Maye confirmed that the bag belonged to him. However, when he overheard Detectives Meeks and Torres discussing the apparent \u201ccocaine residue\u201d on the scale, Maye stated \u201cthat there was no cocaine on the scale.\u201d When the detectives placed Maye under arrest for \u201cpossession of cocaine\u201d and \u201cpossession of a firearm by [a] convicted felon,\u201d Maye was in \u201cdisbelief,\u201d and stated: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you arrested me for cocaine. You didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d Maye repeated these statements \u201c[s]everal times throughout the night.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Detective Larry W. Taylor, also of the Newport News Police Department, was summoned back to \u201cthat room,\u201d by the motel manager, later that same morning. When Detective Taylor arrived, he found the door to the room \u201cpulled to, but it wasn\u2019t secure.\u201d He observed that the room \u201cappeared to have been searched by the Vice-Narcotics Unit,\u201d and saw a VCR that had \u201cbeen knocked over.\u201d The VCR had a \u201cloose top.\u201d Taylor looked inside the VCR and found \u201ccocaine in a plastic bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Maye was subsequently indicted for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled substance, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Prior to his trial on these charges, Maye moved to suppress the evidence, contending that: (1) the \u201cinformation relied upon in obtaining the search warrant became \u2018stale\u2019 after the warrant was issued but prior to the police executing it,\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment; and (2) the \u201csearch warrant [was not] executed forthwith\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">During the hearing on Maye\u2019s motion to suppress, Detective Meeks testified that he \u201cobtained the search warrants] May 14, [at] approximately 8:00 p.m.\u201d \u201cOn May 15 and May 16\u201d he was on \u201cspecial assignment, and duty hours for the Vice-Narcotics Squad were switched from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. respectively\u201d on those days. May 17 and May 18, a Saturday and Sunday, were days Meeks was \u201csigned off duty.\u201d \u201c[T]hen that following week, 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd, [Meeks] was on assignment in Oklahoma.\u201d When Meeks returned on May 23, 2001, he and his fellow detectives attempted to \u201cset up the suspect,\u201d but Maye was not at the \u201clocation of the search warrant.\u201d Accordingly, the detectives returned the following evening, \u201cset up surveillance and waited until [they] confirmed that [Maye] was inside\u201d to execute the warrant. The detectives, thus, \u201cactually executed [the warrant] in the early morning hours of the 25th[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Meeks further testified that \u201cthere were additional times that [the] rehable informant had been to that same location and observed quantities of cocaine for sale.\u201d Specifically, he stated that on or near May 1, 2001, the informant advised that he or she had been at that location and observed the cocaine. However, because the informant had observed this activity more than 72 hours prior to reporting it to Detective Meeks, Detective Meeks was \u201cunable to obtain a search warrant based on that information at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">On cross-examination, Detective Meeks agreed that \u201call other information with regard to this prior visit to this hotel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>room with regard to Shawn Maye, so forth, [was] exactly the same, i.e., it was several weeks prior to May 14th, 2001.\u201d He farther explained the police department \u201cpractice\u201d with regard to search warrants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">Typically, the detective who obtains a search warrant will be the detective who completes the briefing and executes the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Nevertheless, when he left for assignment in Oklahoma, he left the search warrants on his desk \u201cto be executed if work needed to be done or if [other officers] needed something to do.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">After hearing argument by the parties, the trial court held: I think the delay has been sufficiently explained and it still falls within the reasonable, practical reason for having the delay and it\u2019s not an unusual delay and I am going to deny the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">During Maye\u2019s subsequent trial, Detective Taylor testified that, prior to being called back to the motel room on May 25, 2001, a \u201cgentleman ... that worked for the motel and a female maid\u201d \u201chad been in there, had been into the room.\u201d He stated that his \u201cunderstanding was, [the VCR] was knocked off, the drugs had fallen out of it and the drugs were replaced and that\u2019s when they called [the police].\u201d Detective Taylor acknowledged that, \u201c[i]n [his] judgment,\u201d the door to the motel room was in such a state that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t be secured.\u201d He also acknowledged that no fingerprints were found on the bag of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Pursuant to an agreement with the Commonwealth, Brooks testified on behalf of the Commonwealth. Brooks stated that he had been living at the motel with Maye for approximately five months prior to the \u201cincident\u201d and that Maye had \u201crented\u201d the room. He testified that he had purchased the gun that the detectives found in the room. Specifically, he stated that he and Maye looked for the gun \u201ctogether,\u201d that Maye gave him the money to buy the gun, but that he made the actual purchase because Maye did not have identification and because Brooks knew the \u201cpeople\u201d at the store. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>testified that he carried the gun, that he kept it in his car \u201cfor it to be visible,\u201d and that the gun was in the car when he and Maye would go \u201cout or whatever.\u201d He also acknowledged that he had seen Maye \u201chandling\u201d the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">With regard to the VCR, Brooks testified that the VCR belonged to Maye and that he had been with Maye when Maye had purchased it, approximately two months prior to the day the search warrants were executed. He acknowledged that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even know whether [the VCR] was hooked up, really\u201d and stated that he never \u201cshowed a movie on it,\u201d nor saw Maye \u201cshow a movie on it.\u201d In response to questioning by the court, Brooks stated that he never sold drugs, but had used drugs himself. He testified that he obtained the drugs he used from Maye.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Maye\u2019s counsel subsequently conceded that if the trial court were to find that Maye possessed the drugs found in the VCR, he would not argue \u201cthat\u2019s not possession with intent to distribute.\u201d Certificates of analysis demonstrated that cocaine was found on the digital scale and that the plastic bag contained \u201c155.7 grams\u201d of \u201cCocaine Hydrochloride.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Subsequent to the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Maye\u2019s counsel made a motion to strike, which was denied by the trial court. Without presenting evidence, Maye\u2019s counsel rested his case and renewed the motion to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth had failed to establish that Maye either actually or constructively possessed the cocaine or the gun. The trial court disagreed, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">First of all, as far as the possession of cocaine in and of itself, I think the evidence is more than sufficient. They found in his duffel bag the scales and with comments that he made, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">The question as to possession with intent to distribute may be a little more difficult, but when you have, as in this case, a co-defendant who takes the stand \u2014 and I believe he told the truth. He simply tried to avoid saying things that would make it a little bit more tight. It\u2019s what you call dumb like a fox. He just simply attempted to avoid doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>what he had promised to do in exchange for a deal with the Commonwealth taking one of the charges away from him, in fact, when he pled guilty. His testimony was not rebutted in any way, that is, that the VCR was that of Mr. Maye, that he never saw any drug with the exception of that that mysteriously appeared on the nightstand between them, which he assumed came from Mr. Maye. So I think the connection there is sufficient to find the defendant guilty of the charge of possession with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">As to the firearm, once again, Mr. Brooks testifies that he purchased it because he had a discussion with Mr. Maye that they needed a firearm because Mr. Maye had been robbed at some point. They were living in the hotel at the time he purchased it. They both handled it. It was in open and obvious sight at the time that the police went into the hotel. I believe he testified he never actually saw Mr. Maye move it, but Mr. Maye, by his own admission to the officers, stated that it could well have his fingerprints on it, that he had moved it around from time to time. The Court feels the evidence is sufficient to find the defendant guilty of that charge as well and so finds. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The trial court ultimately sentenced Maye to serve five years in prison on the charge of possession of a firearm, with three years suspended; five years on the charge of possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled substance; and ten years on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, with nine years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Maye raises two contentions on appeal. First, he contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to suppress because the police failed to execute the search warrants in conformity with the \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-56, and thus violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Second, he argues the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to prove that he constructively possessed either the gun or the cocaine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon [the appellant] to show that the ruling ... constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the prevailing party below. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). \u201c \u2018In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (quoting <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Further, a defendant\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Because \u201cthe requirements of the Virginia statutes controlling the issuance of search warrants and forbidding searches without a warrant ... are in substance the same as those contained in the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 806, 808, 167 S.E.2d 411, 412 (1969), in reviewing the trial court\u2019s determination of whether the search warrants were executed in a timely manner, we therefore \u201cgive deference to the factual findings of the trial court and independently determine whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained meets the requirements of [Code \u00a7 19.2-56 and] the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2002); <em>see also Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 737, 742, 420 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1992) (noting that Code \u00a7 19.2-56 includes \u201ca codification of the constitutional require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ment that the search must be conducted while probable cause continues to exist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-56 contains two time limitations, a fifteen-day bar and a \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement. The fifteen-day bar \u201cserves to extinguish absolutely the viability of a search warrant if not executed within fifteen days, regardless of circumstances.\u201d Turner, 14 Va.App. at 740, 420 S.E.2d at 237. The \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement, on the other hand, \u201chas an independent substantive meaning,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238, and is intended to \u201cdefine[ ] the policy of the Commonwealth that search warrants be executed as soon as reasonably practical [and] while probable cause continues to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 420 S.E.2d at 237. However, although the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-56 does \u201ccodifyf ] the constitutional mandate ... that probable cause must [ ] exist at the time a search warrant is executed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 743, 420 S.E.2d at 239, the statute \u201cgoes beyond that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238. That is, we have interpreted the \u201cforthwith\u201d provision as requiring something more than a mere showing of the continued existence of probable cause: specifically, that \u201cpolice officers [ ] execute[d] the warrant with reasonable dispatch and without undue delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 420 S.E.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Here, Officer Meeks clearly executed the search warrants within the fifteen-day period prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-56. This does not, however, end our inquiry into whether the warrants were executed in a timely manner. As we noted in <em>Turner,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">By establishing a fifteen-day limitation period in Code \u00a7 19.2-56, the General Assembly did not intend to provide that search warrants executed within that time would be conclusively presumed to have been executed timely. Such an interpretation would render the \u201cforthwith\u201d language of the statute meaningless, a result that we cannot attribute to the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238. Accordingly, the dispositive question here is whether the officers executed the search warrants \u201cforthwith,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-56, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>before probable cause had dissipated, as required by both the Virginia statute and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">As we explained in <em>Turner, </em>\u201cforthwith\u201d does not require that a search warrant be executed \u201cimmediately or as soon as physically possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>491 F.2d 724, 725 (6th Cir.1974)). Similarly, \u201c[i]t does not mandate that officers must immediately execute the search warrant without regard to the circumstances that obtain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, we have interpreted \u201cforthwith\u201d as requiring the execution of search warrants \u201cwith reasonable dispatch and without undue delay,\u201d in order \u201c \u2018to lessen the possibility that the facts upon which probable cause was initially based do not become dissipated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Nepstead, </em>424 F.2d 269, 271 (9th Cir.1970)). Ultimately, then, \u201cforthwith\u201d is meant to embody \u201ca practical and flexible standard which must conform to the necessities of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that Detective Meeks executed the warrant with \u201creasonable dispatch and without undue delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the ten-day delay between the issuance of the warrant and its first attempted execution is somewhat troublesome, we noted in <em>Turner </em>that one relevant consideration as to whether a warrant was executed \u201cforthwith\u201d is whether there are \u201cother competing law enforcement interests which preclude an immediate execution of the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747 n. 2, 420 S.E.2d at 241 n. 2. Here, Detective Meeks testified that it was standard police department \u201cpractice\u201d for a warrant to be executed only in the presence of the officer who obtained the warrant, so that the investigating officer could brief the other officers involved prior to the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>After Detective Meeks obtained the warrants on the evening of May 14, 2001, he was on special assignment on May 15 and 16, he was \u201csigned off duty\u201d on May 17 and May 18, and he was on assignment in Oklahoma on May 19, 20, 21 and 22. Detective Meeks attempted to execute the warrant immediately after his return, on May 28, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Detective Meeks\u2019 job-related absences constitute a \u201ccompeting law enforcement interest\u201d that prevented him from attempting to execute the warrant until his return from Oklahoma. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the eleven-day delay had been \u201csufficiently explained\u201d by Detective Meeks and that the search warrants were therefore executed as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>In fact, in the context of a staleness challenge, we specifically have recognized that an officer\u2019s delay in procuring an arrest warrant for a period of \u201celeven\u201d days, partly because the officer was handling other cases or had days off, did not invalidate the warrant. <em>Perez v.

The nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of the activity in which the informant observed Maye engage would lead one reasonably to believe that the room was used exclusively for the distribution of contraband and that evidence of such activity would still be located in the motel room when the officers conducted the search. Indeed, the drugs were described as a \u201cquantity\u201d significant enough for \u201csale.\u201d Further, approximately two weeks before the issuance of the warrant, the informant advised Detective Meeks that he/she had been \u201cto that same location and observed quantities of cocaine for sale\u201d on a prior occasion.

Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence supported Maye\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As to the cocaine, while we recognize that the motel door was not \u201csecure\u201d when the officer returned and found the drugs inside the VCR, we must also recognize that: (1) the officers found cocaine on the digital scales in the duffel bag that Maye admitted belonged to him; (2) Brooks testified that the VCR belonged to Maye and that he did not know if the VCR was ever \u201chooked up\u201d; (3) Brooks testified that Maye provided him with cocaine; (4) Maye possessed a large quantity of cash when searched by the officers; (5) the informant identified Maye to Detective Meeks as the person related to the cocaine he or she had observed for sale in that particular motel room; and (6) Maye made several suspicious statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to the officers, claiming that there was no \u201ccocaine\u201d on the digital scales and that he should not be arrested because the officers initially failed to \u201cfind anything.\u201d Based upon the totality of this evidence, we find that a reasonable fact finder could have rejected Maye\u2019s claims that the drugs did not belong to him and could have found that the evidence supported his conviction in this regard beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm Maye\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">.

We note that there is some conflict between Officer Meeks\u2019 testimony that it was \"standard police practice\" for the police officer who obtains a search warrant to be present when the warrant is executed, and his testimony that he left these warrants on his desk while he was in Oklahoma in case any of the other police officers \"needed something to do.\" It certainly makes sense to have the investigating officer present when a search warrant is executed whenever it is practical to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Moreover, in the absence of evidence that any of the other police officers actually had an opportunity to execute the warrants, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the delay had been \"sufficiently explained\" by Detective Meeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">. Because Maye was not present at the motel at that time, the officers did not execute the warrant until the following evening. We have previously recognized that, where a search warrant is issued for both a premises and its occupant, it may be appropriate to delay the execution of the search warrant on the premises until the occupant is present, but only if probable cause for both searches continues to exist. See <em>Turner, </em>14 Va.App. at 747, 420 S.E.2d at 241 (holding that a search warrant was executed \"forthwith\u201d despite an eleven-day delay between the issuance of the warrant and its execution where the warrant specified that both a resident and its occupant were to be searched, and the warrant was executed \"immediately after learning that the described occupant had returned\u201d to the premises). Because probable cause for this search had not dissipated when the warrants were executed, see <em>infra, </em>this one-day delay would not \u2014 standing alone \u2014 render the search untimely. <em>See id.; see also Whitaker v.

Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 737, 420 S.E.2d 235 (1992), the statutory requirement of \u201c \u2018forthwith\u2019 ... has an independent substantive meaning\u201d and \u201cdefines the policy of the state that search warrants, which are the foremost safeguard to protect against unreasonable searches proscribed by the Fourth Amendment, are to be executed with reasonable dispatch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238. Thus, the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d obviously requires \u201ca reasonable promptness, diligence or dispatch in executing a warrant, considering the difficulties actually encountered in attempting to perform the task.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>428 F.2d 1013, 1016 (5th Cir.1970). It does not countenance the execution of the warrant at the leisure of the police or when deliberately delayed by the police for their own purposes. <em>Id. </em>By construing the statute to require the warrant\u2019s execution with \u201creasonable dispatch and without undue delay,\u201d we have held that \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-56 accords police officers a limited amount of flexibility in deciding when to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>execute search warrants.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>14 Va.App. at 743, 420 S.E.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The evidence in the record does not suggest that the delay-in this case was \u201cunavoidable, necessary, or even desirable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The warrant was issued on May 14, 2001 and not executed until eleven days later, on May 25, 2001. The execution of the warrant was delayed merely because the officer who obtained the warrant was engaged in other tasks. The police department had no policy, written or otherwise, that required the warrant to be executed by the officer who obtained the warrant from the magistrate. The officer who obtained the warrant testified \u201cthat is basically the practice [he] found [when he was assigned to] Vice-Narcotics.\u201d He also testified that this procedure \u201ctypically\u201d allows the officer who obtained the search warrant to be the one who \u201ccompletes the briefing and executes the search warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This informal practice of the vice-narcotics officers is nothing more than a convenience to the officers. Indeed, the officer testified that he left \u201cthe search warrant on [his] desk\u201d for four days to be executed by other officers \u201cif work needed to be done or if [the other officers] needed something to do.\u201d He also testified that on the night he went to execute the warrant neither he nor any other officer \u201cbriefied] the problem out beforehand in its actual formal proceeding in preparation of executing the search warrant.\u201d The record further establishes that another officer, who did not obtain the warrant from the magistrate, signed the warrant as the \u201cexecuting officer.\u201d In other words, the record discloses that the convenience of the officers was in actuality the principle that governed executing the warrant. Furthermore, nothing in this record establishes that this informal practice has any rational relationship to the search or to good police practice or that this informal practice \u201cmakes sense\u201d for any law enforcement objective. Indeed, as this record establishes, the convenience of this informal practice was subject, in fact, to being disregarded if the other officers needed \u201csomething to do.\u201d For these reasons, I would hold that the evidence in this record failed to establish that the search warrants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201cexecuted with reasonable dispatch.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>14 Va.App. at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Oddly, we observed in <em>Turner </em>that the \u201cforthwith\u201d language in Code \u00a7 19.2-56 is merely \u201cdirectory.\u201d 14 Va.App. at 740, 747, 748 n. 3, 420 S.E.2d at 237, 241, 242 n. 3. It bears noting, however, that despite <em>Turner\u2019s </em>use of the words \u201cdirectory\u201d and \u201cdirective\u201d in describing the forthwith requirement, <em>Turner\u2019s </em>analysis leaves no doubt that the term \u201cforthwith\u201d is a mandatory, not directory requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 740, 741, 747, 420 S.E.2d at 237, 238, 241. As <em>Turner </em>holds, Code \u00a7 19.2-56 reveals the legislature intended \u201cforthwith\u201d to have a meaning independent of the fifteen-day period. <em>Id. </em>at 742, 420 S.E.2d at 238. The opinion also holds that the meaning of forthwith is not only \u201cindependent,\u201d but \u201csubstantive\u201d as well. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, compliance in executing the warrant within the fifteen-day period is mandatory, and a failure to comply results in an invalid warrant. <em>Id. </em>If we were to read <em>Turner </em>as deeming \u201cforthwith\u201d to be directory, its holding would be incongruous because in one place it would mean one statutory requirement confers substantive rights, and the other not. <em>Turner </em>expressly holds that \u201c[t]he \u2018forthwith\u2019 requirement has an independent substantive meaning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In addition, the opinions from each jurisdiction that we found persuasive in <em>Turner </em>interpreted \u201cforthwith\u201d in favor of it conferring substantive rights when the procedure was not followed. Thus, we adopted the interpretation in which any delay in executing the warrant required the government to prove that the delay was \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742-43, 420 S.E.2d at 238-39. We held that a reviewing court must then examine justification for and length of the delay to decide the issue of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Suppression seems clearly to be the remedy when the delay is unreasonable because Code \u00a7 19.2-56\u2019s forthwith requirement goes to the essence of the statute \u2014 it involves the public\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. We have noted, however, that \u201cour Supreme Court has steadfastly refused to extend that rule to encompass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>evidence seized pursuant to statutory violations, absent an express statutory provision for suppression.\u201d <em>Troncoso v.
