Background</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">When sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we \u201creview the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted). So viewed, the evidence establishes that on September 3, 2002, Holley approached an employee, Cindy Anderson, at a Portsmouth Food Lion and \u201csaid that he needed some boxes.\u201d After failing to find \u201ca few boxes\u201d \u201cby the dairy department,\u201d Anderson called her assistant manager to ask if they could \u201cget [Holley] a box or two.\u201d Anderson\u2019s assistant manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>responded, \u201cYes, send him over here by the grocery room.\u201d Holley then walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">A few moments later, Anderson saw Holley leaving the store. Holley was carrying a box. Anderson observed \u201ccartons of Marlboros sticking out of the top of the box.\u201d After asking a cashier if Holley had paid for the cigarettes, Anderson \u201cwent out the door,\u201d observed Holley \u201cjump[ ] into a van,\u201d and heard him say \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d Anderson told her coworkers to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Officer Jorge Quiros, of the Portsmouth Police Department, happened to be \u201cdoing a direct patrol\u201d at the shopping center at that time. Officer Quiros was driving a \u201cmarked police K-9 Unit\u201d and was in \u201cfull uniform.\u201d As he was \u201cdriving around,\u201d he noticed a blue van parked \u201cnear the front of the shopping center close to the Food Lion.\u201d He observed a woman wearing a \u201cFood Lion type uniform\u201d waving at him and pointing at Holley. Quiros saw that Holley was walking toward the blue van at a \u201cquick pace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As Quiros drove his patrol unit toward the van, he could hear Holley \u201cyelling.\u201d Quiros rolled down his window, and the Food Lion employee (Anderson) advised Quiros that \u201c[Holley] had just stolen some merchandise from the store.\u201d \u201cAs this conversation was taking place,\u201d Quiros observed Holley approach the van, \u201cyelling and screaming.\u201d Officer Quiros then saw people emerging from the van, and \u201cit appeared ... that [Holley] extracted a young lady out of the vehicle.\u201d Anderson yelled, \u201cLook out!\u201d Quiros then realized that Holley had started the van motor and begun to accelerate. The woman Holley had \u201cextracted\u201d from the van yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s stealing my van.\u201d Quiros had to move his \u201cK-9 truck out of the way before\u201d the van struck him. The van \u201ctook off at a high rate of speed,\u201d and Quiros pursued after activating his \u201clights and sirens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Holley drove the van \u201caround [the] little shopping area twice at a high rate of speed,\u201d despite the fact that \u201c[i]t was a very busy night for that shopping center\u201d and \u201cthere were people scattering.\u201d Without slowing, Holley exited onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Portsmouth Boulevard, causing \u201ctraffic to lock up with brakes and skid.\u201d Holley then accelerated and \u201cforced traffic to open up for him,\u201d apparently ignoring the red light at the intersection. Holley continued driving, \u201cjump[ing] the median\u201d several times and driving in the wrong direction on busy roads. At one point, Holley turned and drove back in the direction he had come from. Because of his earlier erratic driving, traffic was \u201ccongested,\u201d and several cars \u201cwere actually in a \u2018V\u2019 where they had [earlier] been forced off onto the sidewalk and to the median.\u201d \u201cIt was so tight\u201d there that Holley had to bring the van to a complete stop. At that time, Officer Quiros \u201ccame around facing him head-on approximately 15 to 20 feet away.\u201d As Officer Quiros stepped out of his patrol unit and drew his weapon, Holley \u201clooked in [his] direction, accelerated the van, and came right at [him],\u201d passing between two cars. Quiros had to \u201cdive back into his K-9 truck,\u201d slamming the door shut behind him, to \u201cavoid being struck.\u201d The van \u201cpassed within inches of [Quiros\u2019s] truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Due to the \u201ctraffic and everybody else around [him],\u201d Quiros realized \u201cthere was no way [he] could continue that pursuit on [Holley].\u201d Accordingly, Quiros called to request a marked unit to take over the pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Holley was ultimately apprehended after Officer Roberta Monell, also of the Portsmouth Police Department, joined in the pursuit. Monell was able to stop Holley when she \u201cmoved [her] police car forward and pushed the rear of his van against [a] guardrail so he could not proceed anymore\u201d \u2014 all of this occurring after Holley had already backed into Monell\u2019s police car in an effort to \u201cget away from [Monell].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Holley was charged with one count of eluding police, one count of driving in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of another after having been declared an habitual offender, one count of destruction of property, one count of grand larceny of an automobile, one count of grand larceny, and two counts of attempted malicious wounding of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>During Ms trial, Holley made a motion to strike with respect to both charges of malicious wounding of a law enforcement officer. Holley\u2019s counsel argued that the Commonwealth failed to produce evidence that Holley possessed the requisite intent to maliciously wound the officers and that, instead, the evidence merely proved that Ms intent was to \u201cget away from the police.\u201d The trial court demed the motion and ultimately found Holley guilty of all the charges, with the exception of the charge of attempted malicious wounding of Officer Monell. In dismissing that count, the trial court held that \u201cthe evidence [was] insufficient as it relate[d] to Officer Monell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">On appeal, Holley contends that the trial court erred in findmg the evidence sufficient \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Holley] acted with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill\u201d Officer Quiros, \u201cas required by Virginia Code Section 18.2 \u2014 51[.l] and as alleged in Count One\u201d of the indictment. Holley asks us to reverse and dismiss his conviction for attempted malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">If any person maliciously causes bodily injury to another by any means including the means set out in \u00a7 18.2-52, with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill, and knowmg or having reason to know that such other person is a law-enforcement officer ..., such person shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for a period of not less than five years nor more than 30 years and, subject to subsection (g) of \u00a7 18.2-10, a fine of not more than $100,000. Upon conviction, the sentence of such person shall include a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of two years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Accordingly, to convict the defendant of attempted malicious wounding of a law enforcement officer, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant attempted the criminal act and that he acted \u201cwith intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>maim, disfigure, disable, or Mil\u201d the law enforcement officer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201c\u2018An attempt to commit a crime is composed of two elements: (1) The intent to commit it; and (2) a direct, ineffectual act done towards its commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 657, 180 S.E. 395, 397 (1935)] (citation omitted). \u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind and may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances. It is a state of mind which may be proved by a person\u2019s conduct or by his statements.\u201d <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 153, 156, 169 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1969); <em>see Nobles v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977). \u201c[A] person is presumed to intend the immediate, direct, and necessary consequences of his voluntary act.\u201d <em>Nobles, </em>218 Va. at 551, 238 S.E.2d at 810. \u201c[W]hether the required intent exists is generally a question for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Haywood v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 562, 565-66, 458 S.E.2d 606, 607-08 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he intent required to be proven in an attempted crime is the specific intent in the person\u2019s mind to commit the particular crime for which the attempt is charged.\u201d <em>Wynn v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 283, 292, 362 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1987). In this vein, Holley contends the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence presents two reasonable hypotheses, one consistent with his innocence and the other with his guilt, and that the evidence fails to exclude the hypothesis of innocence. <em>Moody v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 702, 706-07, 508 S.E.2d 354, 356 (1998) (citing <em>Haywood, </em>20 Va.App. at 567, 458 S.E.2d at 608). Specifically, Holley contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed- to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that he accelerated toward Officer Quiros, not with the specific intention to \u201cmaim, disfigure, disable, or Mil\u201d him, but with the intention of merely escaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In support of his argument, Holley relies upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Haywood, </em>20 Va.App. at 562, 458 S.E.2d at 606. In that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Haywood, who had been drinking heavily, fled the scene of a public altercation in his truck. On two separate occasions, a police officer positioned his vehicle in the road so as to block Haywood\u2019s path. On each of these occasions, however, Haywood failed to slow down or change his course and, but for the officers\u2019 last-minute evasive actions, would have struck the police vehicles. <em>[Haywood, </em>20 Va.App. at 564-65, 458 S.E.2d at 607.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">On Haywood\u2019s appeal from two convictions of attempted capital murder of a police officer, we addressed the question of \u201cwhether Haywood, while driving his truck, formed the specific intent to use his vehicle as a weapon for the unequivocal purpose of murdering the police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 458 S.E.2d at 608. We reversed the convictions because the Commonwealth presented no direct evidence that Haywood, by running the road blocks, intended to kill the police officers and because the circumstantial evidence did not exclude the reasonable hypothesis of innocence that Haywood only intended to avoid police apprehension by driving through their vehicular roadblocks. <em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 458 S.E.2d at 609.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Moody, </em>28 Va.App. at 707-08, 508 S.E.2d at 357 (explaining <em>Haywood, </em>20 Va.App. at 564-68, 458 S.E.2d at 607-09).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">While we recognize Holley clearly sought to escape apprehension, the evidence in this case <em>farther </em>proves his intent to injure Officer Quiros in the process of doing so. In the course of his attempted escape, Holley was forced to bring the van to a complete stop. After stopping the van, Holley saw Officer Quiros standing in his path. Holley then accelerated the van directly towards Officer Quiros, without making any effort to veer or avoid striking Officer Quiros. The fact finder could conclude that Officer Quiros avoided being struck only by taking the evasive action of diving into his patrol unit. Thus, the fact finder could further conclude that, in his effort to escape, Holley attempted to drive through Officer Quiros. Here, we do not have a situation where Holley swerved, from which two inferences can be drawn, one consistent with innocence and the other consistent with guilt. The fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Holley may have been attempting to escape, on these facts, is not inconsistent with the equally reasonable hypothesis that he was attempting to do so by running over Officer Quiros. Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1; <em>see also Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003) (noting that the \u201cissue upon appellate review is not whether \u2018there is some evidence to support\u2019 \u201d the defendant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, but \u201cwhether a reasonable [fact finder], upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected [the defendant\u2019s] theories in his defense and found him guilty\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Holley\u2019s actions are therefore factually distinguishable in several respects from those presented in <em>Haywood. </em>Specifically, in <em>Haywood, </em>the defendant never halted his truck, but instead continued driving at a high rate of speed despite the presence of the police cars that had been placed in his path. The evidence did not show that Haywood knew that an officer was in the car and that Haywood specifically intended to maim, disable, disfigure or kill an officer. <em>See Haywood, </em>20 Va.App. at 564-65, 458 S.E.2d at 607. The circumstances of the present case, however, more closely resemble the facts in <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 528, 567 S.E.2d 537 (2002). In <em>Stevens, </em>this Court affirmed a conviction for the attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer where the defendant \u201ccame to a stop\u201d approximately ten feet away from a stopped police car, \u201cand, looking right at [the police officer], rapidly accelerated directly toward him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 567 S.E.2d at 541. Because Stevens \u201cdeliberately turned his car in [the officer\u2019s] direction and drove toward him,\u201d we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Stevens \u201chad the requisite specific intent to use his vehicle as a weapon for the unequivocal purpose of murdering Officer Hines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Holley was charged with attempted malicious wounding rather than attempted capital murder, the reasoning in <em>Stevens </em>is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Haywood, </em>Holley \u201cwas not attempting to run through an inanimate object; rather, the obstacle in his path consisted\u201d of Officer Quiros visibly standing behind his open patrol unit door. <em>Moody, </em>28 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>at 708, 508 S.E.2d at 357. In fact, Officer Quiros had parked his patrol unit only 15 to 20 feet away from Holley and had \u201cstepped out of his patrol unit and [drawn] his weapon.\u201d After Holley \u201clooked in [Officer Quiros\u2019s] direction, [he] accelerated the van, and came right at [him].\u201d In order to avoid injury, Quiros had to \u201cdive\u201d into his patrol unit, slamming the door shut behind him. In <em>Haywood, </em>by contrast, the evidence established only that the defendant drove toward parked police cars that had been set up as roadblocks. In contrast, the trial court here could have reasonably concluded that, when Holley aimed the van directly at Officer Quiros \u2014 rather than the parked police car \u2014 Holley had formulated the specific intent to \u201cmaim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d the officer. Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1; <em>see Moody, </em>28 Va.App. at 707, 508 S.E.2d at 356 (affirming conviction for attempted malicious wounding where the defendant, \u201cwho saw [a pedestrian] blocking the only avenue of his escape, deliberately chose to accelerate his car toward the pedestrian, never decelerating, braking, or swerving to avoid him,\u201d and the pedestrian \u201cwas spared certain injury only by jumping out of the vehicle\u2019s path at. the last moment\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Upon consideration of the evidence, the trial court could have reasonably found that Holley accelerated toward Officer Quiros in order to escape apprehension by running down the officer. This is not a situation where to accept the theory that Holley was attempting to escape would necessarily exclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>hypothesis that he was also attempting to maim or injure Officer Quiros. The evidence raises the sole inference that Holley intended to escape even if in so doing he had to drive his accelerating vehicle into the officer who stood before him. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1. We, nevertheless, remand this matter for the purpose of correcting the clerical error reflected in Holley\u2019s sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">.
