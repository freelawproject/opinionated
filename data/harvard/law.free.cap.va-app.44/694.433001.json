Giannoukos advising her that the Department of Health Professions was obligated by federal law to report her prior administrative adjudication to the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. In response to that letter, Dr. Giannoukos filed an action in circuit court seeking appellate review under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq. </em>The circuit court dismissed the appeal, holding the VAPA did not apply because the agency\u2019s letter regarding its own reporting obligations under federal law did not constitute a \u201ccase decision\u201d concerning Dr. Giannoukos. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Dr. Giannoukos practices medicine in Delaware. She also maintains a license to practice in Virginia. In 2002, after an informal hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4019, the Virginia Board of Medicine found Dr. Giannoukos in violation of Code \u00a7 54.1-2910.1 and 18 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 85-20-280, <em>et seq. </em>for failing to submit a professional profile describing her qualifications and practice. Under Virginia law, the failure to submit the required profile exposes \u201cthe licensee to disciplinary action by the Board.\u201d See 18 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 85-20-300(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Prior to a formal administrative hearing, Dr. Giannoukos and the Board agreed to the entry of a consent order. In its findings of fact, the order found that Dr. Giannoukos \u201cdid not provide, within the required timeframe and in response to four (4) letters from the Board between March and September 2001, the information required by Section 54.1-2910.1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Code and Part VII, Practitioner Profile System (18 VAC 85-20-280 <em>et seq.) </em>of the Board\u2019s General Regulations.\u201d Acknowledging that the order affected her \u201clicense to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d Dr. Giannoukos received a $250 fine. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 54.1-2401 (authorizing Board to impose a monetary penalty upon a finding that \u201ca respondent has violated any provision of statute or regulation pertaining to the Board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In a cover letter to the Board enclosing the consent order, Dr. Giannoukos\u2019s counsel asked the Board not to report the consent order to the federal Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). The HIPDB serves as a national databank for \u201cthe reporting of final adverse actions\u201d against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e(a). The databank cannot be accessed by the public at large. Only governmental agencies and health plans may review the names on the list. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e(d); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.12(a). Doctors can review their own entries, but no others. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.12(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Under federal law, federal and state agencies \u201cresponsible for the licensing and certification of health care providers\u201d must report to the HIPDB any \u201cnegative action or finding by such Federal or State agency that is publicly available information.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e(g)(l)(A)(iii)(III). An agency may be sanctioned for failing to report an adverse action against a licensee. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e(b)(6)(B); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.7(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The Board entered the consent order on June 20, 2003, in lieu of a formal administrative hearing. Nothing in the order addressed whether the Board would later report Dr. Giannoukos\u2019s state-law violation to the HIPDB. Never appealed, the consent order constitutes a final, binding agency case decision. See Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4023, 2.2-4026.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Several months later, the Virginia Attorney General\u2019s office notified Dr. Giannoukos that it interpreted federal law to require the consent order be reported to the HIPDB. The executive director of the Virginia Board of Medicine followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>up with a letter to Dr. Giannoukos stating: \u201cBased on the advice of counsel, I understand the Department will report this order to the HIPDB early next week. The report will contain an appropriate explanation to present the Order in its proper light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In response to the Board\u2019s letter, Dr. Giannoukos filed a VAPA action in circuit court. In her petition for appeal, Dr. Giannoukos took issue with the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of federal law concerning \u201cthe legal requirements that govern reports by the Board and Department to the HIPDB.\u201d Alleging that federal law did not require the report, Dr. Giannoukos requested injunctive relief forbidding the Board and the Department from reporting the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The circuit court dismissed the appeal, holding that the letter did not fall within the definition of a \u201ccase decision\u201d under Code \u00a7 2.2-4001 because the letter itself addressed only the question whether the agency had a reporting duty under federal law, not whether Dr. Giannoukos had violated any law. As the circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">In the case at bar, the Director\u2019s letter does not express a factual determination that a party \u201ceither is, is not, or may or may not be\u201d in violation of a law or regulation. Instead the letter summarily communicates the Department\u2019s determination that it has a legal duty to report something to HIPDB. Essentially it announces a decision about what the Department believes it should do rather than a decision about a party\u2019s action. For these reasons, this court finds that the letter is not a case decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Dr. Giannoukos appeals to us, claiming the circuit court erred in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Under the VAPA, the circuit court reviews the agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201cequivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>J.P. v. Carter, </em>24 Va.App. 707, 721, 485 S.E.2d 162, 169 (1997) (quoting <em>Sch. Bd. v. Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1061-62, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991)) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Allen, </em>24 Va.App. 272, 277, 482 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1997) (citation omitted); <em>Pence Holdings, Inc. v. Auto Ctr., Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 703, 708, 454 S.E.2d 732, 734-35 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The VAPA, however, does not vest circuit courts with appellate authority over all agency decisions. Only those within the definition of a \u201ccase decision\u201d fall within the scope of the VAPA\u2019s judicial review provisions. Code \u00a7 2.2-4026. A \u201ccase decision\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">any agency proceeding or determination that, under laws or regulations at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact, or of threatened or contemplated private action, either is, is not, or may or may not be (i) in violation of such law or regulation or (ii) in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or retaining a license or other right or benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4001. At the \u201cheart\u201d of a case decision \u201cis a fact determination respecting compliance with law.\u201d <em>Kenley v. Newport News Hosp. Assoc., </em>227 Va. 39, 44-45, 314 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1984) (quoting reviser\u2019s note D to predecessor statute, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Under Code \u00a7 2.2-4001, the definition of a case decision focuses on the named party\u2019s alleged violation of law or entitlement to a legally cognizable right or benefit. Except to the extent it informs this central question, the scope of the agency\u2019s legal duties is entirely beside the point.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, a case decision represents a determination \u201cunder laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>or regulations at the time\u201d that the named party is or may be in violation of \u201csuch laws or regulations\u201d or out of compliance with some requirement for obtaining some right or benefit. Code \u00a7 2.2-4001. A determination addressing only the agency\u2019s legal duties does not qualify for VAPA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The circuit court recognized this subtle, but critical, distinction. As the court observed, the Board\u2019s letter to Dr. Giannoukos merely informed her that (based on its understanding of federal law) the agency had a legal duty to report the consent order to the HIPDB. The court acknowledged the letter represented a determination of sorts \u2014 -just not one making any independent adjudication of the legality of Dr. Giannoukos\u2019s conduct. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Applied to the Board\u2019s letter, the case decision definition\u2019s reference to \u201csuch laws or regulations\u201d could only mean the federal statutes and regulations governing the agency\u2019s reporting duties. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.7. Dr. Giannoukos had no statutory duty to report an adverse agency action, even one she concedes to be legally reportable. The letter cannot itself be fairly characterized as an independent determination that Dr. Giannoukos violated state statutes and regulations by failing to file her professional profile with the licensing authority. That determination had already been made, several months earlier, by the entry of a final, unappealed consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">To Dr. Giannoukos, this reasoning is both illogical and unfair: Illogical, because the agency\u2019s federal statutory duty to report the consent order implies a determination that her violation of state law was a reportable offense. Unfair, because including her in the federal HIPDB places her, as she puts it, in the company of \u201cfrauds and cheats\u201d \u2014 thereby exposing her to considerably more guilt-by-association than her simple (and allegedly trivial) violations of bureaucratic paperwork rules justify. We find neither assertion persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">From a logical point of view, we accept that the Board \u2014 in order to determine its own reporting duties \u2014 must necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>decide whether the consent order is a reportable event. Federal law defines a reportable event as any \u201cnegative action\u201d against a licensee that is \u201cpublicly available information.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7e(g)(1)(A)(iii)(III); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.7(a)(3); <em>see also </em>45 C.F.R. 61.3 (defining \u201c[a]ny other negative action\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The federal definition, therefore, did not require the Board to decide whether Dr. Giannoukos violated state law. The consent order had already resolved that issue. The only thing left to do was to decide, under federal law, how to characterize the consent order: negative or non-negative, public or private.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">As to the ostensible unfairness of being included on the HIPDB list, Dr. Giannoukos makes an emotively appealing point. The principal reason for the federal database appears to be an effort at exposing fraudfeasors in the medical profession. And her paperwork violation of state licensure regulations, she argues, falls far below the culpability threshold for being included on the list. <em>See generally </em>64 Fed.Reg. 57740, 57744 (Oct. 26, 1999) (summarizing public comments prior to adoption of final regulation).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That may or may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>be so. Like the circuit court, we offer no opinion on the subject. Her equitable argument, however, can be made directly to the HIPDB list administrator for review. <em>See </em>45 C.F.B.. \u00a7 61.15(b) (establishing procedures for \u201cdisputing a report with the reporting entity\u201d). Whether that effort might prove successful or futile does not change the state-law definition of \u201ccase decision\u201d under Code \u00a7 2.2-4001. But it does undermine her claim that being included on the HIPDB list constitutes an irreversible harm that, by necessity, must be addressed within the carefully drawn limits of the state administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In sum, we hold that the Board\u2019s letter advising Dr. Giannoukos that the consent order would be reported to the HIPDB does not constitute a \u201ccase decision\u201d under Code \u00a7 2.2-4001. The trial court, therefore, correctly dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">.
