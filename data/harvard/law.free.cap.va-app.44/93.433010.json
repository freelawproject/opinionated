He also argues his property settlement agreement, incorporated into his final divorce decree, authorizes termination on these grounds. We disagree with both assertions and affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">In 1989, in anticipation of divorce, the parties executed a property settlement agreement. The agreement fixed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>amount of spousal support and provided that it \u201cshall cease upon the death of Husband or upon the death of Wife, or upon the remarriage of Wife.\u201d The agreement also authorized either party to later request that a court \u201cmodify, change or amend\u201d the amount of support upon a showing of changed circumstances. The agreement further provided that, if the parties did get a divorce, the agreement would be \u201cincorporated by reference and made a part of\u2019 any final decree. The parties later obtained a final divorce decree that \u201cratified, confirmed, and approved\u201d the agreement. The decree also stated the agreement was \u201cincorporated herein by reference and made a part of this decree.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel prepared the order and consented to its entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Eight years later, in 1997, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 20-109. Among other changes, the legislature divided the then-existing first paragraph of the statute into subsections (A) and (B). To subsection (A), the legislature added this new language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">Upon order of the court based upon clear and convincing evidence that the spouse receiving support has been habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to a marriage for one year or more commencing on or after July 1, 1997 the court may decrease or terminate spousal support and maintenance unless (i) otherwise provided by stipulation or contract or (ii) the spouse receiving support proves by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of such support would constitute a manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">1997 Va. Acts, ch. 241. After amendments in 1998, 2000, and 2001, the present version of Code \u00a7 20-109(A) now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4K\">Upon order of the court based upon clear and convincing evidence that the spouse receiving support has been habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to a marriage for one year or more commencing on or after July 1, 1997, the court shall terminate spousal support and maintenance unless (i) otherwise provided by stipulation or contract or (ii) the spouse receiving support proves by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>support would be unconscionable. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all orders and decrees for spousal support, regardless of the date of the suit for initial setting of support, the date of entry of any such order or decree, or the date of any petition for modification of support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In 2002, appellant moved to terminate his spousal support obligations pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A), asserting that appellee had been living in a cohabitation relationship analogous to marriage for the preceding two years. Appellee opposed the motion, arguing that no statutory right to termination existed (because Code \u00a7 20-109(A) did not apply retroactively to impair contractual rights) and no contractual right of termination existed (because the agreement did not authorize termination for cohabitation, only remarriage).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The chancellor denied the motion to terminate and granted appellant leave to amend. Appellant filed an amended motion adding a second ground for termination based upon the ehange-of-circumstances provision of the agreement. Shortly thereafter, however, appellant moved the court to reconsider, arguing that <em>Hardesty v. Hardesty, </em>40 Va.App. 663, 581 S.E.2d 213 (2003) <em>(en banc), </em>undercut the basis of the trial court\u2019s initial ruling. Appellant then withdrew his amended motion to terminate, stating he was content to \u201crise or fall\u201d on the statutory bar of Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and the specific language of his agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The chancellor agreed to reconsider his ruling, heard additional argument, and permitted <em>ore tenus </em>examination of appellee regarding cohabitation. The trial court found the evidence proved appellee\u2019s cohabitation in a relationship analogous to marriage. The court, however, again denied the motion to terminate. The court held Code \u00a7 20-109(A) could not be applied retroactively. And the agreement, the court further found, did not authorize termination on cohabitation grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">On appeal, appellant acknowledges he has abandoned his change-of-circumstances argument, conceding that changes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>his ability to pay support would likely offset any economies of scale enjoyed by his former wife in her cohabitation arrangement. Even so, he argues, both Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and his agreement provide him with a right to terminate support as a matter of law. We disagree, finding neither ground sufficient to permit \u2014 much less require \u2014 termination as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">A. <em>Statutory Right To Terminate Spousal Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Appellant contends Code \u00a7 20-109(A) bars spousal support to his former wife given the trial court\u2019s finding that she cohabited in a relationship analogous to marriage. The statutory right to termination, he argues, applies here because the final divorce decree ordering support may be modified at any later date pursuant to then-extant law. The appellant interprets the last sentence of subsection (A) \u2014 making the cohabitation bar applicable to all orders regardless of the date of entry \u2014 to require this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Appellant\u2019s reasoning, while persuasive as far as it goes, does not go far enough to answer the question presented. In this case, the final decree expressly \u201cincorporated herein by reference and made part of this decree\u201d a bilateral agreement vesting the appellee with a contractual right to <em>permanent </em>spousal support. The decree did not involve an exercise of judicial power to resolve a litigable contest over appellee\u2019s entitlement to statutory spousal support. No judicial balancing of the statutory decisionmaking variables outlined in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) can be imputed to this decree. It merely ordered appellant, at his urging, to do what he had already agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Nor can the decree be characterized as a mere scheduling order preserving the status quo, or an agreed-upon <em>pendente lite </em>order addressing temporary support, or a consent order agreeing to nothing more than the parties\u2019 joint desire to put a contested matter off until a later hearing. Instead, the final decree embodied and enforced something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>quite different: a negotiated agreement between the parties vesting appellee with a contractual right to permanent spousal support. The decree\u2019s contractual character places it within the general rule recognizing that vested contractual rights\u2014 whether incorporated by, memorialized in, or merged into a final decree \u2014 \u201ccannot be judicially modified or terminated at the unilateral request of a contract party unless the agreement expressly authorizes such relief.\u201d <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 568-69, 593 S.E.2d 533, 539 (2004) <em>(en banc); Smith v. Smith, </em>41 Va.App. 742, 747, 589 S.E.2d 439, 441 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Under these circumstances, to apply Code \u00a7 20-109(A) retroactively would amount to an unconstitutional impairment of appellee\u2019s vested contractual right to support \u2014 something the legislature surely did not intend and something we could not approve even if it did. <em>See Rubio v. Rubio, </em>36 Va.App. 248, 255, 549 S.E.2d 610, 613-14 (2001) <em>(en banc) </em>(holding that giving \u201cretroactive effect\u201d to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) would \u201caccomplish a forbidden impairment of Ms. Rubio\u2019s contractual entitlement to support\u201d); <em>Hering v. Hering, </em>33 Va.App. 368, 375, 533 S.E.2d 631, 634 (2000) (holding that application of the \u201camended language of Code \u00a7 20-109(A) to the circumstances of these parties would be an unconstitutional impairment of contract\u201d); <em>accord Smith, </em>41 Va.App. at 752, 589 S.E.2d at 443 (concluding that there is \u201cno reason for applying a different result from that reached in <em>Rubio </em>and <em>Hering </em>where the contracts did not merge\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Peter N. Swisher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Lawrence D. Diehl &amp; James R. Cottrell, <em>Virginia Family Law: Theory, Practice &amp; Forms </em>\u00a7 9.11, at 259-60 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As to the last sentence of Code \u00a7 20-109(A), making the cohabitation bar applicable to support orders regardless of the date of entry, we view that 2001 amendment to the statute as a clarification of the trial court\u2019s authority over <em>non-contractual </em>support awards \u2014 not as a legislative attempt to impair preexisting <em>contractual </em>rights to support. The 2001 amendment appeared to target the panel decision in <em>Rubio, </em>which limited the statute to a purely prospective application. <em>See Rubio v. Rubio, </em>33 Va.App. 74, 531 S.E.2d 612 (2000). Under that precedent, only non-contractual support decrees entered after the statute\u2019s enactment could be terminated on cohabitation grounds. The cohabitation bar thus had no effect on non-contractual support decrees entered before the statute\u2019s enactment. We specifically rejected this reasoning in our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Rubio, </em>finding that the 2001 amendment made clear the \u201clegislature did not intend that result.\u201d <em>Rubio, </em>36 Va.App. at 252, 549 S.E.2d at 612. We likewise made clear, however, that the statute could not be applied retroactively if doing so would impair vested contractual rights. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 549 S.E.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">For these reasons, the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to terminate spousal support to the extent the motion asserted the statutory cohabitation bar of Code \u00a7 20-109(A). Enacted after the parties\u2019 agreement, Code \u00a7 20-109(A) cannot of its own force terminate a preexisting contractual right to spousal support. If appellant has any right to terminate support on cohabitation grounds, that right must be rooted in the express terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">B. <em>Contractual Right To Terminate Spousal Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The parties\u2019 agreement nowhere authorizes termination on cohabitation grounds. Instead, it permits termination only upon death or remarriage. Acknowledging this omission, appellant argues that the contract did not need to mention cohabitation directly because our decision in <em>Hardesty v. Hardesty, </em>40 Va.App. 663, 581 S.E.2d 213 (2003) <em>(en banc), </em>implies the cohabitation provision as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Only an express declaration precluding termination on cohabitation grounds, appellant reasons, can survive scrutiny under <em>Hardesty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We read <em>Hardesty </em>differently. Both the reasoning and the result in <em>Hardesty </em>assume the particular statutory bar in dispute applies of its own force. Starting from that presupposition, <em>Hardesty </em>then addresses the level of specificity in contractual language required to preclude the operation of the statutory bar. Put another way, when one of the statutory bars in Code \u00a7 20-109 applies, <em>Hardesty </em>requires that the agreement \u201cexpressly <em>preclude </em>termination of the contractual duty of spousal support\u201d on that ground. <em>Newman, </em>42 Va. App. at 570, 593 S.E.2d at 540 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf it fails to do so, the contractual obligation may be terminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this way, <em>Hardesty </em>can best be understood as recognizing a statutory preset that can be undone only by the clearest possible expression of contractual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">On the other hand, when Code \u00a7 20-109\u2019s statutory bars do not apply, ordinary principles of contract law do \u2014 and they, not <em>Hardesty, </em>determine the scope of the payee\u2019s right to receive spousal support and the payor\u2019s right to terminate it. Under those principles, the general rule prevails: \u201cAbsent equitable grounds warranting rescission, a contract cannot be judicially modified or terminated at the unilateral request of a contract party unless the agreement expressly authorizes such relief.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>42 Va.App. at 568-70, 593 S.E.2d at 539-40. Thus, whether a statutory bar to spousal support must be <em>expressly included </em>in the agreement as a ground for termination or <em>expressly excluded </em>depends entirely on whether the agreement predates or postdates the legislative enactment creating the bar. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 593 S.E.2d at 540 (recognizing that, when applicable, subsections (A) &amp; (D) of Code \u00a7 20-109 reverse the normal contractual sequence for cases involving \u201ccohabitation, remarriage, or death\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>In this case, the property settlement agreement predated the first version of the statutory cohabitation bar by some eight years. The termination provision of the agreement authorizes termination of support upon remarriage or death, but says nothing about cohabitation. We cannot \u201crewrite\u201d the agreement to include a right of termination for cohabitation. <em>Hering, </em>33 Va.App. at 375, 533 S.E.2d at 635. To do so would be contrary to the maxim that no court can \u201cinsert by construction, for the benefit of a party, a term not express in the contract.\u201d <em>Am. Spirit Ins. Co. v. Owens, </em>261 Va. 270, 275, 541 S.E.2d 553, 555 (2001) (citation omitted); <em>Jones v. Harrison, </em>250 Va. 64, 68, 458 S.E.2d 766, 769 (1995) (emphasizing that \u201cwe have stated on a number of occasions that we do not rewrite contracts to insert provisions that have been omitted by the parties\u201d). The trial court, therefore, properly denied the motion to terminate support to the extent it asserted a contractual entitlement to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Because the parties\u2019 agreement predated the cohabitation bar of Code \u00a7 20-109(A), appellant has no statutory right to terminate spousal support on cohabitation grounds. And, because the agreement does not authorize termination on cohabitation grounds, appellant has no contractual right to terminate. Finding the trial court\u2019s reasoning sound and its result correct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">. Under <em>Newman, </em>a decree does not attain contractual character purely by virtue of its consensual entry. One can consent to the entry of an order without entering into a binding bilateral agreement. As with all contractual instruments, the party asserting the existence of an agreement bears the burden of persuasion to prove its existence. That posed no problem in <em>Newman </em>because the final consent decree stated that \"all matters in dispute\u201d were \"settled and agreed\u201d and then recited verbatim the terms of the parties' agreement on permanent spousal support. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 593 S.E.2d at 535. The parties, moreover, reaffirmed in open court (at trial and on appeal) the contractual character of the decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">. In <em>Hardesty, </em>the parties entered into their property settlement agreement in 2000, long after the enactment of Code \u00a7 20-109(D)\u2019s statutory bar to spousal support after remarriage of the payee spouse \u2014 the only statutory bar relevant to that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
