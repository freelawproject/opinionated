The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission held the Act does not apply. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">While at home on June 27, 2000, Terri Meador fell and began experiencing cramping. About six months pregnant at the time, she visited her obstetrician, Dr. Gustafson, for an office visit. Dr. Gustafson treated her and released her to return home that afternoon. At around 1:00 a.m. the following morning, she gave birth to a son, Kyle, at home alone. Born with a gestational age of only 23 weeks, Kyle had a low heart rate and apnea. EMS technicians rushed the newborn to the hospital, where he was intubated and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Later, Kyle developed seizures and suffered from severe respiratory distress syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Kyle\u2019s parents filed a motion for judgment in the Circuit Court for the City of Salem against George Maxymiv, M.D., Mark W. Gustafson, M.D., Jane Doe, R.N. or L.P.N., and the Lewis-Gale Clinic, alleging the defendants committed medical malpractice by failing to properly examine, treat, and diagnose Kyle and his mother. The defendants responded to the suit by claiming tort immunity under Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B) of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act and by moving to refer the claim to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for a determination of the Act\u2019s applicability. The trial court granted the reference and sent the case to the commission over the claimants\u2019 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Before the commission, the claimants agreed to abandon their tort suit in exchange for statutory compensation. Together with the malpractice defendants, the claimants argued in favor of the statute\u2019s applicability to this ease. Represented by the Attorney General, the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program defended the claim and asserted that the statute was inapplicable because Kyle\u2019s birth did not occur in a participating hospital, nor did a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>participating physician perform obstetrical services at his birth. The Chief Deputy Commissioner agreed and dismissed the claim. On review, the full commission unanimously affirmed the dismissal \u2014 in effect remanding the case back to the trial court for continued prosecution, if the claimants so desired, of the tort suit against the malpractice defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On appeal, both the claimants and the malpractice defendants contend the commission misinterpreted the Act. Their argument raises a pure question of statutory construction, which we consider <em>de novo. See Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 675 (2004) (recognizing that, under Virginia law, \u201cpure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As we recently explained, the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act \u201cprovides claimants with a no-fault remedy for compensation for qualified injuries.\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 271, 590 S.E.2d 631, 635 (2004) (citing Code \u00a7 38.2-5009). When the Act applies, its award of statutory compensation serves as the \u201csole remedy for infants who have incurred a birth-related neurological injury caused by a \u2018participating physician\u2019 or a \u2018participating hospital,\u2019 and bars infants who have sustained injuries of this nature from maintaining a common law tort action against such a \u2018participating physician\u2019 or \u2018participating hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Berner v. Mills, </em>265 Va. 408, 411, 579 S.E.2d 159, 160 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The Act cannot be applied with any interpretative preset in favor of coverage, for to do so would undermine two important features of the Act. First, the statute\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">finely engineered <em>quid pro quo ... </em>does not uniformly favor claimants or potential tort defendants. In cases where malpractice litigation appears ill advised, a claimant may seek the application of the Act to his claim to obtain benefits from the statutory compensation fund. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5009, 38.2-5015(A). But in cases where litigation may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>more promising, a claimant may seek to <em>defeat </em>the application of the Act to his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><em>Whitfield, 42 </em>Va.App. at 271, 590 S.E.2d at 635 (emphasis in original). Our prior cases involve examples of both types,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and our interpretation of the statute cannot depend on who is on which side of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Second, when statutes displace common law principles governing tort liability, the statutes should be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d and not \u201cbe enlarged in their operation by construction beyond their express terms.\u201d <em>Jan Paul Fruiterman, M.D. &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. Waziri, </em>259 Va. 540, 544, 525 S.E.2d 552, 554 (2000) (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Brownlee, </em>253 Va. 159, 166, 482 S.E.2d 827, 831 (1997)); <em>see also Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2004) (en banc) (\u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intent otherwise, statutes should not be construed to displace long-established common law principles.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Guided by these general principles, we \u201cbegin, as always, with the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>276, 590 S.E.2d at 638 (citing <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 172, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2124, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001)). Working from the statutory text, \u201cwe strive to give that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003)). And, by literal, we mean the statutory words \u201cshould be given their \u2018common, ordinary and accepted\u2019 \u201d understanding. <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 583, 575 S.E.2d 567, 570 (2003) (quoting <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">For compensation to be awarded under the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, the commission must first find that the infant sustained a \u201cbirth-related neurological injury\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 38.2-5001. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(l), 38.2-5009(A)(i). But that finding, standing alone, does not mean the Act applies. The commission must also find either \u201cthat obstetrical services were delivered by a participating physician at the birth or that the birth occurred in a participating hospital.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(ii). If neither condition is met, the Act requires the commission to dismiss the claim for compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">If the Commission determines (i) that the injury alleged is not a birth-related neurological injury as defined in \u00a7 38.2-5001, or (ii) that obstetrical services were not delivered by a participating physician at the birth and that the birth did not occur in a participating hospital, it <em>shall dismiss the petition </em>and cause a copy of its order of dismissal to be sent immediately to the parties by registered or certified mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In this case, Kyle was bom at home without the aid of a physician. Because of that fact, the commission held that no obstetrical services were delivered \u201cby a participating physician at the birth\u201d and the \u201cbirth did not occur in a participating hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The claimants point out, however, that this ruling assumes the word \u201cbirth\u201d to be essentially synonymous with \u201cdelivery.\u201d And, if the legislature intended the word to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>mean that, it would have said so directly. Thus, the claimants conclude, the word \u201cbirth\u201d should be construed to mean the entire \u201ccourse of labor, delivery or resuscitation\u201d \u2014 the phrase used by the legislature to define the boundaries of a \u201cbirth-related\u201d neurological injury in Code \u00a7 38.2-5001, the Act\u2019s definitional section.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program advances a similar argument in the opposite direction, pointing out that if the legislature wanted the word \u201cbirth\u201d to mean the entire \u201ccourse of labor, delivery or resuscitation,\u201d it would have used that precise phrase. Creating symmetry between \u201cbirth-related\u201d in \u00a7 38.2-5001 and \u201cbirth\u201d in \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(5)(ii), the Program argues, would require nothing short of a judicial amendment to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">To the extent these opposite constructions of the statute can be viewed in rough equipoise, the interpretative tiebreaker comes from the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s reminder in <em>Fruiterman </em>that this statute is in \u201cderogation of common law\u201d and thus its terms must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d to avoid unintended reach of either the compensation remedy or its accompanying tort immunity. <em>Jan Paul Fruiterman, M.D. &amp; Assocs., P.C., </em>259 Va. at 544, 525 S.E.2d at 554. From this perspective, the term \u201cbirth\u201d cannot be enlarged to cover premature labor experienced by a mother months before her expected due date. Nor can the term \u201cbirth\u201d be expanded to include the efforts of hospital staff members to resuscitate a child who was born at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In ordinary speech, \u201cbirth\u201d usually denotes the \u201ccomplete extrusion of a newborn baby from the mother\u2019s body,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>179 (8th ed.2004), thus explaining expressions like birthday and birth weight. The General Assembly employed a similar meaning in Code \u00a7 32.1-249(6), defining \u201clive birth\u201d for purposes of issuing birth certificates as the \u201ccomplete or substantial expulsion or extraction from its mother\u201d of a live child. To be sure, it was just this denotation that Dr. Gustafson (one of the malpractice defendants) used when describing what happened in this case. As he put it, Kyle\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>mother was admitted to the hospital \u201cafter the birth of her son.\u201d Kyle arrived in the emergency room, Dr. Gustafson noted, \u201cthirty minutes after his birth.\u201d The independent physician panel reviewing this case likewise used the term this way, stating that Kyle was \u201cborn unexpectedly and precipitously at home\u201d and arrived at the hospital after his \u201cbirth.\u201d Though none of these doctors intended to offer advice on statutory interpretation, they did nonetheless \u2014 for their use of the term provides telling examples of its \u201ccommon, ordinary and accepted\u201d meaning. <em>Mouberry, </em>39 Va.App. at 583, 575 S.E.2d at 570 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We also find support for this interpretation embedded in the claimants\u2019 argument to the contrary. By seeking to equate \u201ccourse of labor, delivery or resuscitation\u201d in \u00a7 38.2-5001 with \u201cbirth\u201d in \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(5)(ii), the claimants overlook the specific concept being defined in the earlier definitional provision. Section 38.2-5001 defines a \u201cbirth-related\u201d neurological injury. The hyphenated modifier has a broadening effect. A son is related to his father, but the paternal relationship does not make both son and father the same person. They are different, but related. Here too, the expression \u201cbirth-related\u201d neurological injury in \u00a7 38.2-5001 addresses a concept related to \u2014 but not identical with \u2014 \u201cbirth\u201d in \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(5)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The commission properly interpreted the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act and found it inapplicable to the unique circumstances of this case. We thus affirm the dismissal of the claim for statutory benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. In <em>Whitfield, </em>the claimants sought to defeat the Act's application (preferring instead their tort remedies) while the defendants argued in favor of the Act\u2019s coverage (seeking its statutory immunity from tort liability). Other cases involve the opposite scenario. <em>See, e.g., Wolfe v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Program, </em>40 Va.App. 565, 580, 580 S.E.2d 467, 474 (2003); <em>Kidder v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Program, </em>37 Va.App. 764, 778, 560 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2002); <em>Coffey v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Program, </em>37 Va.App. 390, 401-02, 558 S.E.2d 563, 569 (2002); <em>Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Program v. Young, </em>34 Va.App. 306, 318, 541 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. The claimants argue \"it is particularly inappropriate\u201d for the <em>Fruiterman </em>principle to apply to their case because in <em>Fruiterman </em>\"it was the health care provider, <em>not </em>the infant, who sought to invoke the Act,\u201d whereas here \"the <em>injured infant </em>himself is requesting relief under the statute.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief at 20 n. 7 (emphasis in original). Under this view, the Act would apply in cases where the claimants consider the statutory <em>quid pro quo </em>to be an acceptable bargain \u2014 but not in cases where they reach an opposite conclusion and seek to hold on to their common law remedies. Suffice it to say, our commitment to the objective application of neutral principles of law precludes us from adopting this <em>ad hoc </em>method of statutory construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
