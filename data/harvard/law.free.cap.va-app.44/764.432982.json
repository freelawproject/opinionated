For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court did not err and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In accord with settled principles of appellate review, on appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002); <em>Shaver v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 789, 794, 520 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">So viewed, the evidence here establishes that, on September 15, 2000, Officer David Doughty, an investigator with the Northampton County Sheriffs Office, executed a search warrant at Anzualda\u2019s home. The warrant was based on an affidavit sworn to by Doughty on the same day. The affidavit stated the \u201cmaterial facts constituting probable cause\u201d for the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">On March 17, 2000, Carlos Tolentito and Hildeberto Velasco were shot to death with 9 millimeter rounds on Occohannock Neck Road. An individual incarcerated in the Northampton County Jail has become a suspect in the offense in that he has made incriminating statements to at least three persons. An intimate friend of the suspect has informed the undersigned that the suspect informed the intimate friend that he had traded a pistol to an individual named as \u201cCowboy\u201d for marijuana, \u201cCowboy\u201d being known to her as residing at the place to be searched. The undersigned has personal knowledge that \u201cCowboy\u201d is Delio Anzualda.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The affidavit described the \u201cthing to be searched for\u201d as a \u201c9 millimeter pistol and/or ammunition,\u201d and the place to be searched as the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">dwelling house (single-wide trailer), outbuildings, motor vehicles and any other structures or containers on the property located at 9182 Franktown Road, Franktown, Va----The property is occupied by Delio Anzualda and family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>While searching Anzualda\u2019s home, Doughty and his fellow officers found several items that they suspected were stolen. They also discovered cocaine and related paraphernalia, marijuana, and several firearms. However, a pistol was not among the items seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">After Officer Doughty arrested Anzualda, Anzualda made several incriminating statements relating to the drugs and other items discovered during the search. A grand jury subsequently indicted Anzualda on several charges, including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Before a trial on the merits, Anzualda filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home, contending that both the evidence and his resulting statements were obtained in violation of the \u201cFourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Anzualda argued specifically that the evidence and statements should be suppressed because the affidavit, upon which the warrant was based, failed to \u201cset sufficient facts on its face to cause a reasonably detached magistrate to believe that the subject matter of the search for a pistol was at [Anzualda\u2019s] home,\u201d reasoning that the affidavit failed to provide a sufficient nexus between the item sought and the place to be searched. Anzualda further argued that, because the affidavit alleged that the murders occurred on March 17, 2000, but the warrant was not issued until September 15, 2000, \u201cthere [was] no way to conclude that the evidence [police] want[ed] to seize or look for [was] at [Anzualda\u2019s] residence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion to suppress, reasoning that, even if the warrant was not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>probable cause, the evidence was admissible under the <em>Leon </em>exception to the exclusionary rule, which permits the introduction of evidence seized in good faith reliance on a defective search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Anzualda subsequently entered a conditional plea of guilty to each of the drug-related charges. On appeal, a divided panel of this Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>See Anzualda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 481, 592 S.E.2d 761 (2004). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for <em>en banc </em>review, stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the judgment of the trial court and reinstate Anzualda\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Anzualda contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress for two reasons. First, Anzualda argues that the search warrant was defective because it was not based upon probable cause, reasoning that the underlying affidavit \u201clack[ed] specificity with respect to the time between the communication of the information, and the issuance thereof.\u201d Second, Anzualda argues the warrant cannot be \u201csaved\u201d under the good faith exception because it was \u201cso lacking in the indicia of probable cause as to be fatally defective on its face.\u201d Specifically, Anzualda contends that the affidavit failed to set forth \u201cany\u201d facts establishing a connection between \u201cthe premises to be searched, and a reasonable belief that the evidence to be seized would be located on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">We begin by noting that, although \u201c \u2018[w]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them,\u2019 ... we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of legal standards ... to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McCracken v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 254, 258, 572 S.E.2d 493, 495 (2002) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc)) </em>(citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>911 (1996)). Further, \u201c[i]n reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon [the appellant] to show that the ruling ... constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 197, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A. Whether the Warrant Was Supported by Probable Cause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Generally, \u201c \u2018[t]he existence of probable cause is determined by examining the totality-of-the-circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janis v. Commonwealth, 22 </em>Va.App. 646, 651-52, 472 S.E.2d 649, 652 (quoting <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 64, 68, 408 S.E.2d 602, 604 (1991)), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 696, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>affidavit before him ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citation omitted); <em>see also Tart v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 384, 387, 437 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1993) (\u201cThe initial determination of probable cause requires the magistrate to weigh the evidence presented in light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d). When determining whether probable cause exists, the magistrate may draw reasonable inferences from the material supplied to him. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 68, 354 S.E.2d 79, 87 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">However, \u201c[i]t is well settled \u2018that after-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tart, </em>17 Va.App. at 388, 437 S.E.2d at 221 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. at 2331) . Rather, \u201c \u2018the duty of the reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for ... conclud[ing] that probable cause existed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 437 S.E.2d at 221 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332) (alterations in original) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Janis, </em>22 Va.App. at 652, 472 S.E.2d at 652. This deferential standard of review \u201c \u2018is appropriate to further the Fourth Amendment\u2019s strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tart, </em>17 Va.App. at 388, 437 S.E.2d at 221 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>4 Va.App. at 68, 354 S.E.2d at 87); <em>see also Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 914, 104 S.Ct. at 3416 (\u201cReasonable minds frequently may differ on the question whether a particular affidavit- establishes probable case, and we have thus concluded that the preference for warrants is most appropriately effectuated by according \u2018great deference\u2019 to a magistrate\u2019s determination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Anzualda argues that, considering all of the circumstances of this case, the information set forth in the affidavit was insufficient to provide the magistrate with a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for finding probable cause to believe that the pistol sought would be found in Anzualda\u2019s home. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Initially, the warrant, which was issued on September 26, 2000, provides no time frame as to when the murder suspect made the incriminating statements to the confidential informants, nor does it indicate when the alleged marijuana-for-pistol trade occurred. The warrant also fails to indicate when the suspect was incarcerated, and it provides no facts from which the magistrate could have inferred that the alleged trade did, in fact, take place after the murders and before the suspect\u2019s incarceration. The only date contained in the warrant merely gives the date on which the murders occurred\u2014 March 17, 2000 \u2014 some six months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Generally, \u201c[t]here is no fixed standard or formula establishing a maximum allowable interval between the date of events recited in an affidavit and the date of a search warrant.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 654, 671, 529 S.E.2d 769, 778 (2000). \u201cInstead, a warrant will be tested for \u2018staleness\u2019 by considering whether the facts alleged in the warrant provided probable cause to believe, at the time the search actually was conducted, that the search conducted pursuant to the warrant would lead to the discovery of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Sgro v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 206, 210, 53 S.Ct. 138, 140, 77 L.Ed. 260 (1932); <em>United States v. McCall, </em>740 F.2d 1331, 1336 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Huff v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 710, 715-16, 194 S.E.2d 690, 695 (1973); <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 137, 142-43, 486 S.E.2d 578, 581-82 (1997). As we have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201c \u2018The vitality of probable cause cannot be quantified by simply counting the number of days between the occurrence of the facts supplied and the issuance of the affidavit.\u2019 <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>461 F.2d 285, 287 (10th Cir.1972). Rather, we must look to all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the unlawful activity alleged, the length of the activity, and the nature of the property to be seized. <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\"><em>Perez, </em>25 Va.App. at 142, 486 S.E.2d at 581 (quoting <em>McCall, </em>740 F.2d at 1336).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Thus, although a six-month lapse, standing alone, would not necessarily compel a finding that a search warrant was not supported by probable cause, we are troubled by this particular warrant\u2019s failure to identify <em>any </em>dates other than that of the murders. Absent any reference to the dates on which the described activities allegedly occurred, it is next-to-impossible to determine whether the information supporting this warrant is recent enough to establish a \u201cfair probability\u201d that the pistol might be found at Anzualda\u2019s home. Because the officer failed to provide any sort of a temporal context for the events described, the magistrate did not have a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that there was probable cause to issue the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Moreover, we agree that the information provided in the warrant fails to provide a sufficient nexus between the item sought (the pistol) and the premises to be searched. At most, the warrant indicates that: (1) six months earlier, two individuals had been murdered with a pistol; (2) a prison inmate informed three people that he had committed the murders; (3) a Mend of the inmate informed the police that the inmate had traded a pistol to \u201cCowboy\u201d in return for marijuana; (4) \u201cCowboy\u201d is Anzualda; and (5) Anzualda lived at the premises to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Based on these facts, the magistrate could have inferred that Anzualda might have had a pistol that might have been given to him by the murder suspect. However, \u201c[t]he critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that there is [probable] cause to believe that the specific \u2018things\u2019 to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.\u201d <em>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, </em>436 U.S. 547, 556, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 1976-77, 56 L.Ed.2d 525 (1978). Noticeably absent from this affidavit are any facts that would have permitted the magistrate to infer not only that Anzualda had a pistol, but that he was keeping that pistol at his home. Although it is generally true that, \u201cin the ease of drug dealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live,\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>States v. Angulo-Lopez, </em>791 F.2d 1394, 1399 (9th Cir.1986), this affidavit does not provide any facts supporting the inference that Anzualda was, in fact, a known drug dealer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The affidavit describes but a single drug transaction, which could have been an isolated transaction just as readily as it could have been part of a larger scheme. The affidavit similarly contains no assertion that persons involved in drug transactions tend to keep the fruits of those transactions in their home. Nor does the affidavit indicate that a pistol had been observed in either Anzualda\u2019s possession or in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Although the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts set forth in the affidavit, suppositions and guesswork cannot equate to a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that there is a \u201cfair probability\u201d that the item sought will be found at the place to be searched. Thus, although the facts listed in the affidavit do provide some basis for believing that the pistol might be at Anzualda\u2019s home, this nexus is too tenuous to support a finding of probable cause. <em>See Janis, </em>22 Va.App. at 652, 472 S.E.2d at 652 (holding that the magistrate \u201clacked a substantial basis for finding that probable cause existed\u201d because \u201c[t]he affidavit, while not a \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit, failed to provide a \u2018nexus\u2019 that linked the [item sought] to [the place searched]\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Kenney, </em>595 F.Supp. 1453, 1461 (D.Me.1984) (\u201c[W]ithout more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>than merely the statement in the affidavit that [the defendant] has committed a drug offense, the Court cannot find that there was adequate probable cause to search his house.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Accordingly, despite the deference we must pay to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, we hold that the magistrate here lacked a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for finding that the facts set forth in the affidavit established probable cause. <em>See Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 915, 104 S.Ct. at 3416-17 (\u201cEven if the warrant application was supported by more than a \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit, a reviewing court may properly conclude that, notwithstanding the deference that magistrates deserve, the warrant was invalid because the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the circumstances .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">B. <em>Application of the Good Faith Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Our conclusion that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause does not, however, end our inquiry into whether the trial court should have granted Anzualda\u2019s motion to suppress. Generally, \u201c[w]here law enforcement officers illegally search private premises or seize property without probable cause ... the illegally seized evidence will be excluded____\u201d <em>Colaw v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 806, 810, 531 S.E.2d 31, 33 (2000) (citing <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961)). The exclusionary rule, created with the intent of deterring police misconduct, \u201coperates \u2018as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than [to protect] a personal constitutional right of the party accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 906, 104 S.Ct. at 3412 (quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 620, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974)); <em>see also Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 422, 410 S.E.2d 662, 667 (1991); <em>Colaw, </em>32 Va.App. at 810, 531 S.E.2d at 33. However, because \u201c[t]he deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule \u2018is absent where an officer, acting in objective good faith, obtains a search warrant from a magistrate and acts within the scope of the warrant,\u2019 \u201d <em>Janis, </em>22 Va.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>653, 472 S.E.2d at 653 (quoting <em>Derr, </em>242 Va. at 422, 410 S.E.2d at 667), evidence seized pursuant to an invalid search warrant \u201cis nevertheless admissible if the officer executing the warrant reasonably believed that the warrant was valid.\u201d <em>Lanier v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 541, 547, 394 S.E.2d 495, 499 (1990) (citing <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 918-21, 104 S.Ct. at 3418-19); <em>see also Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 462, 464, 389 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Under the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception, then, \u201c[w]here a police officer has an objectively reasonable belief that the issuing magistrate had probable cause to issue the search warrant, the officer may rely upon the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination and the evidence will not be excluded, even though the affidavit may not have provided the magistrate ... with probable cause to issue the warrant.\u201d <em>Colaw, </em>32 Va.App. at 810-11, 531 S.E.2d at 33. In this case, although we have determined that the underlying affidavit did not provide the magistrate with probable cause to issue the warrant, there is no evidence that Officer Doughty acted other than in good faith and with a reasonable belief that the warrant was valid. <em>See United States v. Merritt, </em>361 F.3d 1005, 1013 (7th Cir.2004) (observing that the officer\u2019s \u201cdecision to obtain a warrant is prima facie evidence of good faith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">There are, however, four recognized situations in which the good faith exception will not be applied, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">(1) Where the magistrate was misled by information in the affidavit which the affiant knew was false or should have known was false, (2) the issuing magistrate totally abandoned his judicial role, (3) the warrant was based on an affidavit \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause\u201d as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable or (4) where the warrant was so facially deficient that an executing officer could not reasonably have assumed it was valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4f\"><em>Colaw, </em>32 Va.App. at 811, 531 S.E.2d at 33 (citing <em>Atkins, </em>9 Va.App. at 464, 389 S.E.2d at 180); <em>see also Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 642, 647, 453 S.E.2d 916, 918 (1995). Here, Anzualda argues that the third exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>good faith rule applies, contending that the underlying affidavit was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonable police officer would not have believed that the warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As discussed above, the magistrate in this case lacked a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for determining that there was probable cause to issue the warrant. The absence of a \u201csubstantial basis,\u201d however, does not necessarily mean that the affidavit was so entirely lacking of indicia of probable cause that a police officer could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the validity of the warrant. In other words, \u201cno substantial basis\u201d does not automatically equate to \u201cno indicia of probable cause.\u201d As aptly noted by the Fourth Circuit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\u201cSubstantial basis\u201d provides the measure for determination of whether probable cause exists in the first instance. If a lack of a substantial basis also prevented application of the <em>Leon </em>objective good faith exception, the exception would be devoid of substance. In fact, <em>Leon </em>states that the third [exception to the good faith rule] prevents a finding of objective faith only when an officer\u2019s affidavit is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421 (citation omitted). This is a less demanding showing than the \u201csubstantial basis\u201d threshold required to prove the existence of probable cause in the first place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9n\"><em>United States v. Bynum, </em>293 F.3d 192, 195 (4th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). \u201cThus, it is entirely possible that an affidavit could be insufficient for probable cause but sufficient for \u2018good-faith\u2019 reliance.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>380 F.3d 236, 241 (6th Cir.2004). Hence, as long as there is <em>some </em>indicia of probable cause in the underlying affidavit, we will apply the good faith exception as long as a reasonable police officer, after assessing the facts set forth in the affidavit, could have believed that the warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Here, we find that the underlying affidavit does contain some indicia of probable cause. The underlying affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>is not a \u201cbare-bones\u201d affidavit that merely sets forth conclusory allegations with no recitation of the facts supporting those conclusions. <em>See Colaw, </em>32 Va.App. at 813, 531 S.E.2d at 34 (\u201cA police officer could not reasonably have believed that the warrant was properly issued when it was based on a \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit that contained only conclusory assertions by a third-party informant about a future event without supporting facts to constitute probable cause.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Weaver, </em>99 F.3d 1372, 1378 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201cAn affidavit that states suspicions, beliefs, or conclusions, without providing some underlying factual circumstances regarding veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge, is a \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit.\u201d). Rather, the underlying affidavit describes with particularity the item sought, the place to be searched, and the transaction that led the police to believe that the item sought would have been found at the place to be searched. <em>See Atkins, </em>9 Va.App. at 464, 389 S.E.2d at 179 (finding evidence admissible under good faith exception where the affidavit had sufficient indicia of probable cause, specifically, it \u201ccontained a detailed description of the nature of the offense, the premises to be searched, the items for which they were searching, and the transaction which led the informant to believe that the drugs would be in this apartment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">As noted above, the underlying affidavit does fail to list the dates on which the described events allegedly occurred. But a reasonable police officer would not necessarily have concluded that the warrant was invalid merely because the affidavit failed to specifically identify the dates on which the described activities occurred. \u201c \u2018In the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination or his judgment that the form of the warrant is technically sufficient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tart, </em>17 Va.App. at 390, 437 S.E.2d at 222 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 921, 104 S.Ct. at 3419). Here, a reasonable police officer, after reading the affidavit, would have concluded that the events described occurred within the previous six months. It was not unreasonable for the officer to have also concluded that the pistol, obtained sometime within the preceding six months, could still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>be in Anzualda\u2019s possession. <em>Cf. </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.7(d) (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cWhere the object of the search is a weapon used in [a] crime ... the inference that the item[ ] [is] at the offender\u2019s residence is especially compelling, at least in those cases where the perpetrator is unaware that ... [he] has been ... identified] ... [by] the police.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the affidavit\u2019s failure to identify the specific dates upon which the described events occurred does not, as the dissent asserts, render the affidavit so lacking in probable cause that a reasonable police officer could not have concluded that it was valid. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, </em>851 F.2d 727, 729-30 (4th Cir.1988) (where defendant allegedly possessed a gun suspected to have been used in an unrelated murder, court applied the good faith exception to admit the gun and silencer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>seized from defendant\u2019s residence, noting that even though the court was \u201ctroubled by the fact that there is no disclosure in the warrant, or in the affidavit, of either the date of the crime or the date upon which the defendant had offered to sell the pistol to the informants[,] ... [t]here was no dispute over whether the magistrate or the investigator acted in good faith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">As discussed above, the underlying affidavit also failed to provide a sufficient nexus between the item sought and the premises searched. This does not mean, however, that the affidavit failed to provide <em>any </em>nexus between the pistol and Anzualda\u2019s residence. The facts listed in the affidavit indicate that Anzualda had obtained a pistol from a murder suspect. The affidavit also indicates that Anzualda resided at the premises to be searched. And, because a reasonable police officer could also infer that Anzualda was keeping the pistol at his home, the affidavit does establish a nexus \u2014 however slight \u2014 between the item sought and the premises to be searched. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Maneti, </em>781 F.Supp. 169, 177 (W.D.N.Y.1991) (\u201cIn the case of firearms ... [it is] reasonable [to] infer[ ] [that] ... one would likely keep such evidence [ ] at home.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Anzualda, however, argues that our decision in <em>Janis </em>mandates a finding that, because there was an insufficient nexus between the pistol and the premises searched, the affidavit was so lacking in probable cause that a reasonable police officer would have known that the warrant was invalid. In <em>Janis, </em>we declined to apply the good faith exception where the underlying affidavit described certain criminal activities and provided an address to be searched, but failed to indicate <em>why </em>that address was being searched <em>(e.g., </em>because one of the suspects resided at or was otherwise connected to that address). <em>See </em>22 Va.App. at 652, 472 S.E.2d at 653. Because the officer \u201cmight just as easily have supplied the magistrate with an address belonging to an unrelated third party,\u201d we concluded that \u201c[t]he affidavit gave absolutely no indication that the fruits of criminal activity would probably be found at that location, rendering [the officer\u2019s] belief in probable case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>based solely on the affidavit, objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 472 S.E.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In <em>Janis, </em>then, we did not hold that the failure to establish a sufficient nexus between the item sought and the premises to be searched automatically precluded application of the good faith exception. Rather, we held that, where the underlying affidavit failed to provide <em>any </em>connection whatsoever between the alleged criminal activity and the premises to be searched, that affidavit was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonable police officer could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief as to the validity of the warrant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\"><em>Janis, </em>therefore, is factually distinguishable from the present case. Unlike the affidavit in <em>Janis, </em>which contained <em>no </em>information connecting the criminal activity to the premises to be searched, the affidavit here did establish <em>a </em>nexus (albeit an insufficient nexus for a finding of probable cause) between the pistol and the premises to be searched. Specifically, the affidavit at issue in this case states that Anzualda was \u201cknown to [the confidential informant] as residing at the place to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>searched,\u201d and additionally indicated that the address to be searched \u201cis occupied by Delio Anzualda and family.\u201d The affidavit also indicates that a murder suspect had traded a pistol to Anzualda in exchange for marijuana. It is therefore apparent on the face of the affidavit that the premises were to be searched because Anzualda, the person presumably in possession of the pistol, resided there. Accordingly, the vital link that was missing in <em>Janis </em>is present here: the affidavit clearly connected Anzualda to the pistol and connected Anzualda to the place to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>360 F.3d 591 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 261, 160 L.Ed.2d 84 (2004), a recent case from the Sixth Circuit, is also instructive. In <em>Carpenter, </em>the court concluded that the magistrate did not have a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for a finding of probable cause because the facts contained in the underlying affidavit \u201cwere too vague, generalized, and insubstantial\u201d to establish a sufficient nexus between the place to be searched and the evidence sought. <em>Id. </em>at 595. The court, however, admitted the seized evidence under the good faith exception, reasoning that \u201cthe affidavit was not completely devoid of <em>any </em>nexus between the residence and the [item sought].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595-96. Noting that \u201cthe affidavit was not totally lacking in facts connecting the residence to the [item sought],\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe affidavit contained a minimally sufficient nexus between the illegal activity and the place to be searched to support an officer\u2019s good-faith belief in the warrant\u2019s validity,\u201d despite the fact that these facts \u201cwere too vague to provide a substantial basis for the determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Similarly, here, the affidavit did provide some facts linking the pistol to the premises to be searched, and these facts \u201cwere not so vague as to be conclusory or meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we hold that the affidavit was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonable police officer would not have believed that it was valid. <em>Cf. United States v. Beckett, </em>321 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that, although the affidavit\u2019s \u201csupport of a nexus between evidence of the murders and [the defendant\u2019s] residence is less than overwhelming^] ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>affidavit established the nexus element sufficiently to pass muster under <em>Leon\u201d); United States v. Loy, </em>191 F.3d 360, 368-69 (3d Cir.1999) (holding that, although the affidavit failed to provide sufficient facts to establish the \u201crequisite nexus between the item to be seized and the place to be searched,\u201d the warrant was not \u201cso facially deficient or lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate judge\u2019s authorization\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In <em>Leon, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized a constitutional preference that police officers seek search warrants from neutral and detached magistrates, holding that \u201csuppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant [issued by a magistrate] should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 918, 104 S.Ct. at 3418; <em>see also Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 987-88, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 3427-28, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984). This is not one of those \u201cunusual cases.\u201d Rather, \u201c[although certainly not a thing of beauty, the affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>vit is not so lacking in \u2018indicia of probable cause\u2019 as to render objectively reasonable good faith in a warrant issued pursuant to it impossible.\u201d <em>United States v. Craig, </em>861 F.2d 818, 822 (5th Cir.1988). Because the officer possessed an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause \u2014 namely, that \u201cthe fruits of criminal activity would probably be found at\u201d the place to be searched, <em>Janis, </em>22 Va.App. at 653, 472 S.E.2d at 653 \u2014 we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the seized evidence under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The judgment of the trial court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-16\">. In addition to these charges, Anzualda was charged with five counts of receiving stolen goods valued at $200 or more, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108. However, the disposition of those charges is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. In the alternative, Anzualda argued that his statements should be suppressed because Anzualda, who is Hispanic, could not sufficiently understand the officers and, therefore, could not freely and voluntarily waive his rights. After hearing evidence submitted by the parties, the trial court denied Anzualda\u2019s motion on this basis. Anzualda has not appealed that portion of the trial court's ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. We recognize, as the concurrence has noted, that courts both within this Commonwealth and elsewhere will frequently bypass the issue of probable cause and proceed directly to the question of whether the good faith exception applies. However, we also believe that consistently sidestepping the issue of probable cause in favor of applying the good faith exception will inevitably permit the exception to swallow the rule. Moreover, we disagree with the concurrence\u2019s belief that the probable cause issue should be addressed only if the circumstances present a \"novel question of law.\u201d As the Supreme Court expressly noted in <em>Leon </em>itself, \"[e]ven if the Fourth Amendment question is <em>not </em>one of broad import, reviewing courts could decide in particular cases that magistrates under their supervision need to be informed of their errors and so evaluate the officers\u2019 good faith only after finding a violation.\" <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 925, 104 S.Ct. at 3422 (emphasis added). Further, \"it frequently will be difficult to determine whether the officers acted reasonably without resolving the Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Here, the concurrence suggests that we should avoid any discussion of whether the magistrate had a \"substantial basis\u201d for concluding that probable cause existed. However, if we repeatedly fail to address the threshold question of probable cause, we will continue to neglect our duty to adequately educate our magistrates and to provide them with discrete legal guidelines, concomitantly reducing their role in the issuance of warrants to little more than that of a rubber-stamp. Considering the dearth of recent Virginia caselaw on this specific question, and mindful of the fact that we are issuing this opinion <em>en banc, </em>we elect to substantively address the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-5\">. <em>Cf.

We note that, in <em>Leon </em>itself, the warrant lacked probable cause because the information provided by the informant was six-months old and, therefore, \"fatally stale.\u201d 468 U.S. at 904-05, 104 S.Ct. at 3410-11. Despite the staleness of the information, the Supreme Court concluded that \"the officers\u2019 reliance on the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause was objectively reasonable, and application of the extreme sanction of exclusion is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926, 104 S.Ct. at 3422.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Other jurisdictions, after concluding that a warrant was not supported by probable cause because the information contained in the underlying affidavit was stale, have also been willing to admit evidence under the good faith exception.

Hove, </em>848 F.2d 137 (9th Cir. 1988), the case we principally relied upon in <em>Janis, </em>has been similarly distinguished within its own jurisdiction. In <em>United States v.

Ruiz, </em>257 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir.2001), for example, the Ninth Circuit held that a warrant was not supported by probable cause because it \"failed to show a nexus between the criminal activity and the places to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. The <em>Ramos </em>court, however, applied the good faith exception to admit the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 1354-55. The <em>Ramos </em>court distinguished <em>Hove </em>by noting that, \"[i]n contrast to the situation presented in <em>Hove, </em>here the affidavit supporting the warrant clearly linked [the premises] to the criminal enterprise observed by the officers,\u201d concluding that, \"[w]hile the affidavit supporting the [] search warrant may not have been the model of thoroughness, it cannot be said that the document \u2018d[id] not link this location to the defendant.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1354 (quoting <em>Hove, </em>848 F.2d at 140) (second alteration in original).

I agree, therefore, with the majority opinion\u2019s holding that the affidavit was insufficient to support a conclusion that a fair probability existed of finding the pistol in the residence. The same facts that support this holding compel a further conclusion, however, that the warrant failed to satisfy the requirements necessary for the good faith exception as described in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">When the Supreme Court adopted in <em>Leon </em>an \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard for the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, the Court required \u201cofficers to have a reasonable knowledge of what the law prohibits.\u201d 468 U.S. at 919 n. 20, 104 S.Ct. at 3419 n. 20. <em>See, e.g., United States v. King, </em>227 F.3d 732, 753-54 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that an officer who searched the basement of a duplex did not act with objective reasonableness when the basement area was not mentioned in warrant). In adopting this standard the Supreme Court noted, however, that \u201cit frequently will be difficult to determine whether the officers acted reasonably without resolving the Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 925, 104 S.Ct. at 3422. In this case, the resolution of the probable cause issue establishes that the facts in the affidavit provide virtually no basis for believing the pistol would be in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Leon </em>that an officer does not \u201cmanifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421 (citation omitted). As the Supreme Court noted the magistrate cannot merely ratify \u201c \u2018the bare conclusions of others,\u2019 \u201d 468 U.S. at 915, 104 S.Ct. at 3416 (citation omitted), and, thus, \u201c[n]othing in <em>[Leon] </em>suggests ... that an officer could obtain a warrant on the basis of a \u2018bare bones\u2019 affidavit.\u201d 468 U.S. at 923 n. 24, 104 S.Ct. at 3420 n. 24. Furthermore, the Court held that \u201ca warrant may be so facially deficient ... that the executing officer cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">To invoke the good faith exception, the Commonwealth must present evidence to establish the officer\u2019s reliance on this defective warrant was based on \u201cobjective reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924, 104 S.Ct. at 3421. In considering these matters, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion concerning the applicability of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>King, </em>227 F.3d at 753; <em>United States v. Manning, </em>79 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The record in this case fails to establish that the officers acted with objective reasonableness because the timing nexus surrounding the events is so woefully deficient in this affidavit as to be nonexistent. It is beyond dispute that a reasonably trained officer should be familiar with the warrant requirement of a temporal component connecting the events in the affidavit and the warrant. When, upon an examination of the four corners of the affidavit, the omission of any reference to the time of the critical events is so complete that the nexus between them cannot be reasonably inferred, it cannot be said that an officer\u2019s good faith cures the defect. <em>Herrington v. State, </em>287 Ark. 228, 697 S.W.2d 899, 901 (1985). <em>See also United States v. Huggins, </em>733 F.Supp. 445, 449 (D.D.C.1990) (holding that the <em>Leon </em>good faith exception is inapplicable where the dates of critical events are not disclosed in the affidavit).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The only date or time reference contained in the affidavit is March 17, 2000, the date of the homicides. In the absence of dates regarding the other critical events alleged in the affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>vit, the magistrate and the officers made a number of unsupported assumptions based on speculation, and not facts. For example, without specifying any dates, the affidavit relates that an unidentified suspect told a friend, who was an unidentified informant, that he (the suspect) traded a pistol to Anzualda. The affidavit does not disclose when the suspect had the conversation with the informant. Furthermore, the substance of the conversation does not convey any time frame or other facts which would suggest when the suspect had the conversation. The conversation just as likely occurred a year prior to the date of the affidavit as at any other hypothesized time.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Indeed, the absence of any critical dates and times in the affidavit leaves vague and undisclosed the connection of the \u201csuspect\u201d to the homicides. The affidavit notes only that an individual incarcerated in jail \u201chas become a suspect in the offense in that he has made incriminating statements to at least three persons.\u201d If the individual became a suspect merely because he told the informant and others that he traded a pistol to Anzualda, then nothing in the affidavit links the March 17, 2000 killings and the pistol. Only by assuming that the suspect\u2019s statements suggested he was the killer could the magistrate conclude the transfer of the pistol occurred after March 17, 2000. Such an assumption, however, is grounded in no fact that is recited in the affidavit. Thus, the affidavit renders speculative whether the suspect was present during the homicides, whether he knew the identity of the killer, or whether he implicated himself as the killer. Most significant, the affidavit renders speculative the date or time when the transfer of the pistol occurred. The omission of dates or times renders any connections between the alleged critical events indiscernible from the face of the affidavit and, thus, negates any conclusion that the officials acted with objective reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">When the staleness or timing nexus is viewed in relation to the nature of the other activity that is alleged in the warrant, it is clear both that the affidavit was facially \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>existence entirely unreasonable\u201d and that the warrant was so facially deficient that the officer could not have reasonably believed it was valid. In the absence of critical dates and times that would establish the timing nexus, the affidavit required both the magistrate and the officer to speculate as to a nexus between the homicides and the pistol that was the object of the search warrant. The absence of a date or indication of timing nexus bears on these omissions because no reasonable inference can be drawn by a magistrate or reasonably trained officer concerning the relationship of the pistol to the events giving rise to the allegation of a need to obtain the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Specifically, the lack of any dates or times in the affidavit led to three unsupportable assumptions. First, the lack of a date made it purely speculative when the suspect traded the pistol \u2014 whether the suspect transferred the pistol before or after the homicides. Thus, there was no basis to conclude the pistol was used to commit the homicide. Second, the affidavit does not contain even a suggestion of when, if ever, the pistol was seen in the residence or even where the trade occurred. Thus, the information communicated by the suspect does not disclose a reasonable probability that the pistol the suspect traded would be at the residence on September 15, the date the warrant was issued and executed. Finally, the affidavit\u2019s statement of material facts does not even disclose whether the pistol the suspect traded was a \u201c9 millimeter\u201d firearm or was believed to be a weapon capable of discharging \u201c9 millimeter rounds.\u201d This deficiency is directly connected to the affidavit\u2019s failure to provide any critical dates or times because, by failing to allege that the pistol was traded at a time so as to be connected with the homicide, no inferences could be drawn from the four corners of the affidavit about the pistol\u2019s connections to the event.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The omission of critical dates simply does not permit any objectively reasonable officer or magistrate to draw inferences about the recency of the events and, therefore, the nexus requirement became merely a matter of guesswork and supposition. Simply put, the absence of times and dates renders these critical events mere speculative assumptions. These leaps of logic negate any suggestion of \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d and are based upon suppositions that no reasonable officer or magistrate could make. For these reasons, the \u201cwarrant [was] based on an affidavit \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence as entirely unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421 (citation omitted). I would hold, therefore, that the circuit court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">. In addition to failing the nexus requirement, this third assumption also graphically demonstrates the warrant\u2019s failure to satisfy both the Fourth Amendment and the statutory warrant requirement of specificity. <em>See Coolidge v.
