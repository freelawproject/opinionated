Long Akers, appellant, appeals the trial court\u2019s order terminating her residual parental rights to her child H.A.L. under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C). She contends the trial court erred (1) in finding that Fauquier County Department of Social Services provided reasonable and appropriate efforts; (2) in finding appellant failed to maintain continuing contact with H.A.L. and failed to provide a reunification plan; (3) in finding that appellant failed within a reasonable time to substantially remedy the conditions that brought H.A.L. into foster care; (4) in finding it was in the child\u2019s best interest to terminate parental rights; and (5) in relying on the preference of a twelve-year-old child to terminate parental rights. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Appellant had a documented history of alcohol abuse and treatment since 1995, including occasions in 1995 and 1996 where the department of social services intervened and H.A.L. was placed with the maternal grandmother due to appellant\u2019s intoxication and resulting inability to care for H.A.L. H.A.L. was later returned to appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">On December 22,1999, by emergency removal order, H.A.L. was placed in the custody of Fauquier County Department of Social Services. By order of December 27,1999, the maternal grandmother, Helen Agnew, was given physical custody of H.A.L. Appellant was ordered to undergo a psychiatric eval\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tion and a substance abuse evaluation. The court found H.A.L. was abused and neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Despite a number of letters written to appellant by Fauquier County Department of Social Services, appellant did not maintain regular contact with the department of social services. On February 11, 2000, appellant and the department of social services met to develop a foster care plan which included AA attendance, parenting skill classes, various evaluations and individual therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The Fauquier County Department of Social Services\u2019 file contained twenty-one letters from January 2000 through March 2002 to appellant and her counsel, \u201ctrying to make referrals ..., trying to make contact with her, trying to figure out her whereabouts because there were many periods of time during this process when we weren\u2019t aware of her whereabouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The Fauquier County Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations District Court approved the foster care plan by order of June 2, 2000. The order restricted contact between appellant and H.A.L., and continued the mental health evaluations. The goal was \u201creturn to parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On several occasions the supervised visitation was marred by \u201cinappropriate\u201d behavior by appellant. On July 13, 2000, appellant became \u201cindignant\u201d over the requirement of supervised visitation and became \u201clouder and louder,\u201d embarrassing the child. In September 2000, H.A.L. became \u201chysterical\u201d after appellant accused the child of posing for nude photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Fauquier County Department of Social Services lost contact with appellant for the months of September through November 2000. Appellant obtained a custody petition for H.A.L., but did not appear for the October 6, 2000 hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Supervised visitation ended in February 2001 when appellant stopped her visitation. Her whereabouts were unknown. Appellant had not completed any of the ordered evaluations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>but had attended counseling \u201csporadically\u201d with Mary Beth Williams, a licensed clinical social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Appellant was admitted into Dominion Hospital on March 4, 2001, \u201cbeing on an alcohol binge for one week.\u201d She left the hospital the next day against medical advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">By order of May 22, 2001, the Fauquier County Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations District Court changed the goal to \u201cpermanent foster care\u201d and suspended any contact between appellant and H.A.L. The Foster Care Service Plan indicated appellant \u201chas not stabilized her behaviors nor has she demonstrated that she can provide [H.A.L.] with a structured, stable environment constantly for any length of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">After the change of goal to \u201cpermanent foster care,\u201d Fauquier County Department of Social Services\u2019 focus was to provide supportive services to appellant and the maternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Fauquier County Department of Social Services filed a Foster Care Review Plan dated April 22, 2002, which recommended a change of goal to \u201cadoption.\u201d Fauquier County Department of Social Services reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">[H.A.L.] would be at serious risk for further abuse and neglect if she were returned to her mother\u2019s care. Ms. Long currently reports that she has stopped drinking and has a stable home and stable job. However, Ms. Long\u2019s self report has always been unreliable. Ms. Long has never been able to maintain her sobriety consistently for any substantial period of time. She cycles back and forth between being sober, finding a job, and finding a place to live and excessive drinking which inevitably leads to losing her housing and her employment. All along when Ms. Long has reported that she is pulling herself together again, she gets a new attorney, a new therapist, and a new psychiatrist. By ending services with providers that have seen the effects of her alcoholism first hand and later starting services with new providers, Ms. Long can continue to deny that there has ever been a problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The plan, along with a petition to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights, was filed and docketed for a hearing on May 23, 2002. After appellant was served with the petition, she relapsed and was hospitalized from May 24, 2002 to May 26, 2002 for in-patient detoxification.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Due to her intoxication, appellant did not attend the May 23, 2002 hearing, which was also the return date for a custody petition filed by appellant. Appellant did appear at the termination hearing on September 6, 2002. Appellant\u2019s parental rights were terminated by order of the Fauquier County Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations District Court on September 25, 2002. Appellant appealed, and a <em>de novo </em>termination hearing was scheduled in circuit court for July 30, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Again, appellant became intoxicated and was hospitalized from July 25 through July 28, 2003. Her BAC was .253 upon admission. However, she appeared at the termination hearing on July 30, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">A number of mental health professionals testified at the circuit court termination hearing that H.A.L. does not want to return to appellant. They further opined that reunification would not be in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Mary Beth Williams, appellant\u2019s therapist, treated appellant from the spring of 2000 through April of 2001. Williams described periods of sobriety and relapses. On April 14, 2000, appellant came to Williams\u2019 office inebriated. Following this incident, Williams recommended appellant be hospitalized. She felt appellant needed \u201ca lot more treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Sharon D. Banks, H.A.L.\u2019s foster care social worker, testified H.A.L. was presently in therapeutic foster care. The child had made substantial improvement. Banks indicated she was doing well in school, was very disciplined, and her earlier inappropriate behavior had ceased. Her foster mother confirmed H.A.L.\u2019s progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Appellant entered the Comprehensive Addiction Treatment Services (CATS) outpatient relapse prevention program in April 2002. She successfully completed the program in January 2003. Jeanne Giles, a counselor in that program, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that a relapse is part of recovery, but appellant has learned \u201cways to manage the trigger signs and stressors\u201d that cause relapses. She indicated a relapse is not a sign of failure. Ms. Giles confirmed that appellant had been hospitalized for alcohol detoxification in March of 2001, May of 2002, June of 2002, and July of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Daniel Bowman, appellant\u2019s present therapist, indicated he began treating appellant in July of 2001. He testified appellant is now \u201cvery stable,\u201d with no signs of depression. He was aware of appellant\u2019s July 2003 hospitalization. He did not view this relapse as \u201cfailure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">William Zuckerman, a licensed clinical psychologist, characterized appellant as \u201chighly motivated\u201d to reunite with H.A.L. Despite a number of relapses, she has had \u201cmany, many, many days that she is trying very hard to work her program----\u201d She has shown motivation and has strengths as a parent. Dr. Zuckerman indicated appellant has stabilized herself \u201cto some degree\u201d and pointed to her new marriage as providing financial and emotional stability for appellant. He opined it would not be in the child\u2019s best interest to sever the relationship between appellant and H.A.L. Dr. Zuckerman, however, expressed concerns for appellant\u2019s parenting. He did not suggest the child should be returned to appellant at the present time, nor could he rule out another relapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Cindy Horne, a caseworker with Fauquier County Department of Social Services, described appellant as \u201cnever able to maintain sobriety for any length of time or demonstrate that she could put her child\u2019s needs before her own or maintain a stable home environment.\u201d Ms. Horne said appellant was never able to achieve any of the service plan goals. Ms. Horne testified as to a number of incidents when appellant violated the court\u2019s \u201cno contact\u201d order of May 22, 2001. Appellant had attempted to send presents to H.A.L. There were a number of telephone calls initiated by appellant. These calls created an emotional setback for the child. Horne admitted that after the goal was changed to permanent foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>care, the agency did not provide additional services to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Appellant testified as to twelve months of sobriety until her most recent relapse. Her life is now stable with a devoted husband. She indicated a number of stressors caused the relapse. She attended depositions of a witness who gave damaging testimony. She also referred to the death of her mother, H.A.L.\u2019s birthday, and church activities as stressors. She testified her life is now in order and she has strong support systems in her husband, her AA sponsor, and her therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">H.A.L.\u2019s counselor, Chicly Powell, a licensed clinical social worker, testified by deposition that she began therapy with H.A.L. in January of 2003. The counseling focused on H.A.L.\u2019s \u201cmanipulating, lying, defying authority____\u201d H.A.L. has now made \u201cconsiderable improvement in taking responsibility for her behaviors.... \u201d Ms. Powell indicated H.A.L. has consistently expressed a desire not to return to her mother because her foster home provides \u201ca family that loves and cares about her.\u201d Ms. Powell opined that there is no bond between appellant and H.A.L., nor does H.A.L. trust her mother. The therapist quoted H.A.L. as saying appellant ruined her life because she wouldn\u2019t stay away from alcohol. H.A.L. is now \u201cflourishing under a very consistent parenting style____\u201d Ms. Powell predicted potential harm if H.A.L. were reintroduced to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In an opinion letter terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights, the trial court reviewed appellant\u2019s history of alcoholism, her efforts at rehabilitations, and her relapses. While the court found \u201ctangible improvement\u201d over the last twelve months, the latest relapse indicated that appellant still has not demonstrated her ability to provide for the emotional and physical needs of H.A.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Appellant contends the Fauquier County Department of Social Services had an ongoing duty to provide services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>even after a plan for permanent foster case had been approved. She maintains that social services must continue to render services to her up to and including the appeal hearing in the circuit court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283 embodies \u201c[t]he statutory scheme for the ... termination of residual parental rights in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Rader v. Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>5 Va.App. 523, 526, 365 S.E.2d 234, 235 (1988). This \u201cscheme provides detailed procedures designed to protect the rights of the parents and their child,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 526, 365 S.E.2d at 235-36, balancing their interests while seeking to preserve the family, <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 539, 394 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1990). However, we have consistently held that \u201c[t]he child\u2019s best interest is the paramount concern.\u201d <em>Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Social Servs., </em>16 Va.App. 821, 827, 433 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) further provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">2. The parent or parents, without good cause, have been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201cThe twelve-month time limit ... was designed to prevent an indeterminate state of foster care \u2018drift\u2019 and to encourage timeliness by the courts and social services in addressing the circumstances that resulted in the foster care placement.\u201d <em>L.G. v. Amherst County DSS, </em>41 Va.App. 51, 56, 581 S.E.2d 886, 889 (2003). Within this \u201creasonable period\u201d time frame, the various supportive and rehabilitative agencies must use \u201creasonable and appropriate efforts\u201d to assist the parent in remedying those conditions. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). \u201cIf the parent fails to substantially remedy those conditions within twelve months the court may act to prevent the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>from lingering in foster care.\u201d <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 57, 581 S.E.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">However, this statutory mandate is not open-ended. As we said in <em>Lecky v. Reed, </em>20 Va.App. 306, 312, 456 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The statute clearly contemplates that efforts to resolve the \u201cconditions\u201d relevant to termination are constrained by time. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2). Absent \u201cgood cause,\u201d a parent or parents receiving the \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services of \u201crehabilitative agencies\u201d must \u201cremedy substantially\u201d the \u201cconditions which led to ... foster care\u201d of the child in a \u201creasonable period not to exceed twelve months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provision protects the family unit and attendant rights of both parents and child, while assuring resolution of the parent/child relationship without interminable delay. \u201cIt is clearly not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming ... responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood, </em>10 Va.App. at 540, 394 S.E.2d at 495.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The statutory language is precise, and the statutory scheme is well delineated. Under basic rules of statutory construction, we examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases. <em>Earley v. Landsidle, </em>257 Va. 365, 369, 514 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1999). When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. <em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appellant cites <em>Roanoke City Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Heide, </em>35 Va.App. 328, 544 S.E.2d 890 (2001), to support her argument. Yet, <em>Heide </em>does not require departments of social services to provide \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services through the date of the termination appeal hearing. <em>Heide </em>does not even address services provided by departments of social services. Instead, it addresses the time frame in which the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d should be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">As previously discussed, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0 provides a two-prong requirement to . terminate parental rights: (1) termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>nation is in the best interests of the child, and (2) the parent has been unwilling or unable to remedy substantially the conditions that brought the child into foster care or that the parent failed to maintain continuing contact under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>Heide </em>only addressed the first prong, i.e., the best interests of the child. In <em>Heide, </em>the father was unsuccessful in completing a number of alcohol rehabilitation programs and did not follow through with the services recommended by the department of social services. The uncontested facts of <em>Heide </em>disclose that only after the goal was changed to adoption did the father become serious in treatment, complete various programs, become employed and remain sober. \u201c[T]he focus shifted from family reunification to a focus on placement for adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 544 S.E.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Despite Heide\u2019s progress, the department of social services declined to investigate his reformation \u201cbecause it no longer provided services to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 544 S.E.2d at 892. The department of social services argued Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) mandates a \u201ctwelve month cut-off beyond which a parent\u2019s efforts to remedy the conditions are not relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 544 S.E.2d at 893. We disagreed, finding that a parent\u2019s post-petition efforts to remedy the conditions may be considered by the trial court in determining whether termination is in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">In this case, DSS\u2019s construction of the statute would deny the fact finder the opportunity to evaluate the present best interests of the child. The trial court may discount the parent\u2019s current \u201cprogress\u201d if the best interests of the child would be served by termination. However, as in the instant ease, the trial court may determine that a parent\u2019s delayed, but nonetheless substantial, progress may overcome the time delay. We will not deprive the trial court of the opportunity to weigh the rights of the parents and the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 337, 544 S.E.2d at 894. <em>Heide </em>clearly opines that a parent, despite a goal of adoption, may, on his or her own initiative, seek help and remedy the conditions that brought the child into foster care. The best interests of the child are to be determined at the time of the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In our subsequent decision in <em>L.G., </em>41 Va.App. 51, 581 S.E.2d 886, we found that the trial court did not consider the mother\u2019s efforts of rehabilitation after the twelve-month period had expired. We reversed, holding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">had the trial court considered this evidence it may well have concluded either that (1) good cause existed for L.G.\u2019s not having corrected the conditions within the statutory twelvemonth time period, and/or (2) that termination was no longer in the best interests of K. or L.G. because L.G. had substantially remedied many of the conditions that led to the foster care placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 59, 581 S.E.2d at 890. We remanded for the trial court \u201cto consider [the mother\u2019s] progress, not only during the twenty-one-month period prior to the August 2002 trial court [termination] hearing but also through the time of the remand hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">It is uncontested that after May 22, 2001, the date of the order for permanent foster care, Fauquier County Department of Social Services provided no further services for appellant. Appellant does not question the services prior to the change in goal. Appellant offers a number of consequences that she argues flowed from the department of social services\u2019 failure to provide post-petition services. She claims the failure hindered her efforts to comply with the existing order, inhibited her efforts to prepare for trial, and impaired her efforts to reunite with her child because visitation was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The facts belie these arguments. Appellant could have and did continue in alcohol counseling. At trial she produced testimony concerning her efforts of sobriety and the stability of her life. The issue before the trial court was appellant\u2019s sobriety and whether her recent efforts were sufficient. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>pellant, as did Mr. Heide, offered evidence to show it was not in the child\u2019s best interest to terminate her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Appellant further contends that the cessation of efforts by Fauquier County Department of Social Services hindered her efforts to plan a reunification with the child and hindered her efforts to comply with the existing court orders. One of the statutory bases for termination is Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1) which authorizes termination upon a finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">The parent or parents have, without good cause, failed to maintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the child\u2019s placement in foster care notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to communicate with the parent or parents and to strengthen the parent-child relationship. Proof that the parent or parents have failed without good cause to communicate on a continuing and planned basis with the child for a period of six months shall constitute prima facie evidence of this condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Essentially, appellant argues that with the cessation of visitation and other services, she was unable to \u201cmaintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child.... \u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1). Again, this argument ignores the time limitation set forth in that subsection. As we discussed above, there is a finite time frame for both subsections (C)(1) and (C)(2). Any potential handicaps created by the clear statutory scheme are matters of policy, the sole province of the legislature, not the judiciary. <em>See Wood v. Board of Supervisors of Halifax Cty., </em>236 Va. 104, 115, 372 S.E.2d 611, 618 (1988) (\u201c[I]t is the responsibility of the legislature, not the judiciary, to formulate public policy, to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests, and to devise standards for implementation.\u201d). \u201cOnce the legislature has acted, the role of the judiciary \u2018is the narrow one of determining what [the legislature] meant by the words it used in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dionne v. Southeast Foam Convert</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>ing &amp; Packaging, </em>240 Va. 297, 304, 397 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1990) (quoting <em>Diamond v. Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. 303, 318, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 2213, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980)). \u201c[T]he contentions now pressed on us should be addressed to the political branches of the Government ... and not to the courts.\u201d <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. at 317, 100 S.Ct. at 2212.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellant maintains an additional consequence of the cessation of services is that the burden of proof shifted to her to prove she had substantially complied with the conditions that led to foster care placement. She reasons that because Fauquier County Department of Social Services no longer offered services, she must prove she had prepared a reunification plan and that she had substantially remedied the conditions. The record does not support this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Clearly, the burden is on the Fauquier County Department of Social Services to prove the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1) and (2) by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Ange v. York/Poquoson DSS, </em>37 Va.App. 615, 630, 560 S.E.2d 474, 481 (2002). The trial court, in its opinion letter of August 18, 2003, found the department met its burden of proof as to both Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1) and (2). Nothing suggests any burden was shifted from Fauquier County Department of Social Services to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Thus, we conclude the trial court did not err in ruling Fauquier County Department of Social Services did not have to afford appellant services after the goal was changed to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Appellant contends that the Fauquier County Department of Social Services did not, by clear and convincing evidence, prove that she failed to maintain continued contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1) and that she had been unwilling or unable to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child\u2019s foster care placement under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>In <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dept. of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">When addressing matters concerning a child, including the termination of a parent\u2019s residual parental rights, the paramount consideration of a trial court is the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See Toombs v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>223 Va. 225, 230, 288 S.E.2d 405, 407-08 (1982); <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990). On review, \u201c[a] trial court is presumed to have thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 329, 387 S.E.2d at 796 (citing <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 200, 237 S.E.2d 89, 92 (1977)). Furthermore, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below and its evidence is afforded all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795. \u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Eichelberger v. Eichelberger, </em>2 Va.App. 409, 412, 345 S.E.2d 10, 11 (1986). The trial court\u2019s judgment, \u201cwhen based on evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 364 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The trial court must determine under (C)(1) whether the evidence establishes: (1) that termination is in the best interests of the child; and (2) that the parents, without good cause, failed to maintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the child\u2019s placement. Under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2), a court must determine whether the evidence establishes: (1) that termination is in the best interests of the children; and (2) that the conditions, which resulted in the foster care placement, have not been remedied within twelve months from placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Here, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. The evidence showed appellant had a longstanding fight with alcoholism. H.A.L. was placed in foster care in December of 1999, at age eight. The six-month time period provided by Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1) within which the parent is expected to \u201cmaintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child\u201d elapsed in June of 2000. The twelve-month time period of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) elapsed in late December of 2000. For the first two months of 2000, appellant did not maintain regular contact with Fauquier County Department of Social Services. During supervised visitation, appellant on several occasions became abusive. On one occasion, she accused H.A.L. of posing for nude photographs and H.A.L. became hysterical. Fauquier County Department of Social Services lost contact with appellant from September through November of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In February 2001, it was reported appellant had not completed any of the ordered evaluations but had sporadically attended counseling with Mary Beth Williams. The foster care plan filed in March 2001 indicated appellant had neither stabilized her behavior nor demonstrated that she can provide H.A.L. with a structured, stable environment for any length of time. In April 2001, appellant appeared at her counselor\u2019s office in an inebriated state. Appellant had substantial relapses requiring hospitalization for detoxification in March of 2001, May of 2002, June of 2002, and July of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">A foster care plan dated April 22, 2002, approved by the court by order entered May 22, 2002, reported H.A.L. would be at \u201cserious risk for further abuse and neglect\u201d if returned to appellant. A number of mental health professionals also testified it would not be in H.A.L.\u2019s best interest to reunite with appellant. Other testimony revealed that there was no emotional bond between H.A.L. and appellant. H.A.L., who told a number of social workers and counselors she did not want to return to her mother, indicated her life was ruined because of her mother\u2019s alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>H.A.L. has been flourishing in her present foster home. She had attained stability in her life. Her behavior of \u201cmanipulating, lying, defying authority\u201d has ceased. She is now-taking responsibility for her behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Appellant testified as to her desire to have H.A.L. returned to her, her progress in therapy and the stability of her present life. She indicated she maintained sobriety for twelve months prior to a relapse in July of 2003, only several weeks before the termination hearing in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Daniel Brown, appellant\u2019s current therapist, testified appellant is \u201cvery stable.\u201d Dr. Zuckerman indicated appellant was \u201chighly motivated\u201d and has strengths as a parent. He opined it would not be in the child\u2019s best interest to sever appellant\u2019s relationship with H.A.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The trial court discounted this testimony and resolved the conflict in the evidence in favor of the Fauquier County Department of Social Services. The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is a matter within the sole province of the finder of fact. <em>Courembis v. </em>Courembis, 43 Va.App. 18, 36, 595 S.E.2d 505, 514 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">From the evidence presented, the trial court did not err in finding that the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-382(0(1) and (2) were proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion by relying on the preference of the twelve-year-old child in deciding to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights. Appellant refers to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(G) which provides termination shall not be granted \u201cif it is established that the child, if he is fourteen years of age or older or otherwise of an age of discretion as determined by the court, objects to such termination.\u201d This statute gives a child who is subject to a termination proceeding a \u201cveto right\u201d if the child is fourteen years or older or has reached an age of discretion. This statute does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Appellant cites <em>Deahl v. Winchester Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>224 Va. 664, 299 S.E.2d 863 (1983), and <em>Hawks v. Dinwiddie Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>25 Va.App. 247, 487 S.E.2d 285 (1997), to support her position. Both cases address the trial court\u2019s duty to determine if a child, subject to a termination proceeding, under the age of fourteen has reached the age of discretion to \u201cveto\u201d termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(G). These cases are not relevant to our inquiry. The provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(G) simply do not apply when a child cannot legally \u201cveto\u201d termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The fact that the trial court made no finding that the child had reached the age of discretion is of no moment. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(G) does not establish the standard for admitting a child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The proper standard is whether the child is competent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court said in <em>Cross v. Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 62, 64, 77 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">There is no specific age at which a child must have arrived in order to be competent as a witness. A child is competent to testify if it possesses the capacity to observe events, to recollect and communicate them, and has the ability to understand questions and to frame and make intelligent answers, with a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth. Wigmore on Evidence, 3d ed., Infancy, sec. 506, p. 596; 5 Jones Commentaries on Evidence, 2d Ed., Competency of Witnesses, sec. 2106, p. 3953; 70 C. J., Witnesses, secs. 121, 122, pp. 91-94.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Nevertheless, the trial court did not base its decision solely on the child\u2019s stated wishes. In the context of the trial court\u2019s opinion letter, it was not the d\u00e9terminative factor. The trial court methodically traced appellant\u2019s alcohol addiction, the efforts of rehabilitation and the child\u2019s history of neglect. The court characterized appellant\u2019s history as having a \u201cyo yo\u201d effect on the child. The court further noted appellant\u2019s histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ry of progress in treatment and relapses, the most recent relapse five days before the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The trial court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">This Court cannot take a chance that future stressors could cause a repeat of such behavior and lead to the same type of experiences for [the child] that were so common in the past. This child has suffered enough. She appears to be healthy and thriving in her present environment. To force her back with her mother against her wishes at the age of 12, when the mother has so recently repeated her past indiscretions would be an irresponsible action on the part of the Court. Mrs. Akers has had sufficient opportunities to rehabilitate and repair the damage done to her relationship with her daughter. The Court cannot wait forever to determine if Mrs. Akers can become responsible enough to resume her parental duties. <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 394 S.E.2d 492 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in considering the child\u2019s preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\">. Appellant does not contend on appeal that the child was incompetent to testify. Code 8.01-396.1 states that no child shall be incompetent to testify solely because of age.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
