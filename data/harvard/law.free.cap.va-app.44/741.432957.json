We find that Thomas waived all but one of his arguments by not properly raising them at trial. On the one question preserved for appellate review \u2014 whether the court erred in admitting into evidence 46 plastic baggies described by an expert narcotics officer as indicative of drug distribution \u2014 we hold the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. We thus affirm Thomas\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">We review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). \u201cOn appeal this court must \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and <em>all fair inferences to be drawn there</em>from..\u2019 \u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (citation omitted and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">Officers Darren DeCoster and Sean Bauer stopped Thomas\u2019s vehicle on a suspected traffic violation. During the stop, DeCoster asked for and received consent to search the vehicle. \u201cImmediately upon entering the vehicle,\u201d the officer testified, he smelled the \u201codor of marijuana coming from the vehicle\u201d and found \u201cresidue of marijuana throughout the entire vehicle, in the seats, on the floorboard, in the center console, and eventually found some in the trunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>DeCoster also noticed that a rear seat cushion was \u201ca little bit ajar.\u201d He looked under the cushion and found a fully loaded, semi-automatic handgun. \u201cAt that point,\u201d he testified, \u201cfor officer safety purposes, I had some non-verbal communication that I use with my partner.\u201d DeCoster then drew his weapon and placed Thomas, who was standing outside the vehicle, under arrest. \u201cAt that point in time,\u201d Thomas later admitted, \u201che knew they had found the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">When questioned about the firearm, Thomas said he had been \u201cshooting with a friend.\u201d His fingerprints might be on the gun, Thomas stated, because he had \u201cshot the gun in the past.\u201d Thomas then said he had visited shooting ranges that turned him away \u201cbecause he was a convicted felon.\u201d He and his friend, however, found a range where \u201cthe person didn\u2019t do their [sic] job, hence not checking him to see if he was a convicted felon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Officer Bauer transported Thomas\u2019s car to the police station. As he was exiting the vehicle, Bauer \u201cgrabbed the driver\u2019s side door handle to close the vehicle\u201d and \u201cthe door handle portion came off\u201d in his hand. Bauer then saw a hidden compartment in the \u201cdoor frame or door well\u201d ordinarily covered up by a piece of the door secured to the frame. In that compartment, he found a medium-sized zip-lock bag containing 46 smaller zip-lock plastic baggies.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence Thomas\u2019s prior convictions for burglary and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Officer DeCoster testified, without objection, that during his search of the vehicle, he \u201cfound the residue of marijuana throughout the entire vehicle, in the seats, on the floorboard, in the center console and eventually found some in the trunk.\u201d When the Commonwealth asked DeCoster about the 46 plastic baggies, however, Thomas objected. \u201cIt\u2019s drug contraband,\u201d the prosecutor replied. It explained why Thomas, an alleged drug dealer, might simultaneously possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">After pointing out that Thomas \u201cdid not object to the testimony about marijuana residue,\u201d the trial judge overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Ms objection to the baggies. \u201cIt clearly has the potential to prejudice your client,\u201d the judge stated to Thomas\u2019s counsel, \u201cbut I\u2019m not prepared to say it\u2019s not relevant.\u201d The evidence appeared to be \u201cdrug dealing paraphernalia,\u201d the judge reasoned, that Thomas allegedly possessed \u201cat the same time\u201d as the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The trial judge offered a cautionary instruction to Thomas making clear that he was \u201cnot charged with any offense relating to drug dealing in tMs case,\u201d and thus, tMs evidence should be considered only for purposes of deciding the firearm charge. \u201cI can give it to the jury now or I can give it to the jury later,\u201d the judge said. Thomas\u2019s counsel asked that no such instruction be given until the end of trial when it could be included with the \u201crest of the instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">When asked about the relevance of the 46 plastic baggies, Officer DeCoster testified as a drug interdiction expert that the baggies were \u201cindicative of illegal narcotics distribution, packaging.\u201d In the drug trade, he explained, \u201c[depending on what the drug was, it would be measured or weighed and put inside the small, zip lock baggie to more easily distribute it.\u201d The Commonwealth offered a photograph of the baggies as Exhibit 1 and the actual baggies as ExMbit 2. Thomas renewed Ms objection each time, and the trial court overruled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Thomas took the stand in Ms own defense. Thomas admitted that, in the past, he \u201cdistributed\u201d marijuana and had been convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. With respect to the 46 plastic baggies, Thomas claimed Ms \u201cmom uses them to put jewelry in.\u201d Beyond that, Thomas said, he did not know of any other use for the baggies, nor did he know how they ended up in a Mdden compartment of the driver\u2019s side door of Ms car.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">At the end of the trial, the trial judge asked Thomas\u2019s counsel about the cautionary instruction previously offered. \u201cI decided I don\u2019t tMnk we need a cautionary instruction,\u201d counsel replied, \u201cI think it might do more harm than good.\u201d The trial court gave the final instructions to the jury omitting, as requested, any cautionary instruction concerning the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>dence of the 46 plastic baggies or Officer DeCoster\u2019s testimony about them. The jury convicted Thomas of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On appeal, Thomas challenges his conviction on four grounds. First, he contends that the trial court erred by \u201cadmitting evidence of marijuana seeds and zip lock bags.\u201d Second, he contends the court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>intervene to cut off the prosecutor\u2019s argument seeking to connect the drug-related evidence to the firearm. Third, Thomas asserts the court erred by \u201cpermitting the jury\u201d to rely upon the drug-related evidence in support of the firearm charge. Thomas\u2019s final contention asserts the court erred by not giving a cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">A. <em>Waiver Of All But One Issue On Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">As a precondition to appellate review, Rule 5A:18 requires a contemporaneous objection in the trial court to preserve the issue on appeal. Not just any objection will do. It must be both <em>specific </em>and <em>timely </em>\u2014 so that the trial judge would know the particular point being made in time to do something about it. <em>See, e.g., Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 325, 601 S.E.2d 555, 571 (2004) (holding that appellant waived challenge to double-tier hearsay by failing to specifically object to trial court\u2019s incomplete ruling as to only one of the two tiers).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>In this case, Rule 5A:18 bars all but one of Thomas\u2019s contentions on appeal. His first argument \u2014 that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of marijuana seeds and 46 plastic baggies \u2014 must be severed, as Thomas objected to the introduction of the baggies, but not to the seeds. The objection also did not address the testimony about the marijuana residue \u201cthroughout the entire vehicle\u201d or the odor of marijuana permeating the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Thomas likewise failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument asserting a logical link between the firearm in Thomas\u2019s vehicle and the various indicia of drug distribution associated both with Thomas and his vehicle <em>(i.e., </em>Thomas\u2019s admission of having \u201cdistributed\u201d drugs in the past; his prior possession-with-intent-to-distribute marijuana conviction; the marijuana odor coming from his vehicle; the presence of marijuana residue throughout the entire vehicle; and the 46 baggies hidden in a secret door compartment).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Finally, by refusing the trial court\u2019s offer of a cautionary instruction and by not proposing one of his own, Thomas waived any claim of error associated with that issue. <em>See Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 126, 130 n. 1, 596 S.E.2d 542, 544 n. 1 (2004) (\u201cAppellant may have been entitled to a cautionary instruction. However, we do not address this aspect of the question presented because appellant never requested a cautionary instruction at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Rule 5A:18 is not absolute, however. If the ends of justice warrant an exception to the general rule, we may set it aside. We do so, however, only in \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d where the defendant can prove a substantial miscarriage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>justice. <em>Bazemore v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 203, 218-19, 590 S.E.2d 602, 609-10 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). \u201cThe record \u2018must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 424, 442, 592 S.E.2d 391, 399 (2004) (citations omitted); <em>see also Michaels v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 601, 608, 529 S.E.2d 822, 826 (2000) (observing that defendant must show \u201cshe was convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense\u201d or \u201can element of the offense did not occur\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Thomas argues that the ends-of-justice exception applies to his assertion on appeal that the trial court erred by not giving a cautionary instruction. On that issue, we discern no reason to suspend the procedural default of Rule 5A:18. Experienced trial lawyers know that cautionary instructions, even when perfectly worded, sometimes highlight problematic evidence and, thus, as Thomas\u2019s counsel concluded in this case, \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d For this reason, \u201ccounsel may wish to avoid such an instruction for sound tactical reasons.\u201d <em>Commercial Distribs., Inc. v. Blankenship, </em>240 Va. 382, 394, 397 S.E.2d 840, 847 (1990) (citation omitted). To compel a trial judge to give a cautionary instruction \u2014 in the face of defense counsel\u2019s express request that he not do so \u2014 would compromise the court\u2019s objectivity and interfere with the prerogative of trial counsel to the detriment of the adversarial system. The ends-of-justice exception, therefore, cannot be invoked under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">B. Admissibility Op The 46 Plastic Baggies And Officer <em>DeCoster\u2019s Testimony About Their Use In The Drug Trade</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Thomas objected to the evidence of the 46 plastic baggies found in the hidden compartment of his vehicle and Officer DeCoster\u2019s expert testimony that they were \u201cindicative of illegal narcotics distribution, packaging.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, finding the evidence relevant to provide a hypothesis for why Thomas would possess a loaded handgun also hidden in the same vehicle. On appeal, Thomas (i) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>objects to the logical relevance of the drug-related evidence, (ii) claims it violates the prior-bad-acts and other-crimes doctrines, and (in) contends it was unduly prejudicial in any event. We disagree with each of these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">(i) <em>Logical Relevance Of Drug-Related Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Two threshold principles govern appellate review of evidentiary decisions. First, we do not review such decisions <em>de novo. </em>\u201cGiven the \u2018broad discretion\u2019 of a trial judge over evidentiary matters, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review.\u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 752, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004) (citation omitted). This standard, if nothing else, means that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.\u201d Henry J. Friendly, <em>Indiscretion about Discretion, </em>31 Emory L. J. 747, 754 (1982). Only when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Second, every fact, \u201chowever remote or insignificant, that tends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue is relevant.\u201d <em>Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Dungee, </em>258 Va. 235, 260, 520 S.E.2d 164, 179 (1999) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cPut another way, evidence has relevance if it \u2018tends to cast any light\u2019 on any material point.\u201d <em>Seaton, </em>42 Va.App. at 752, 595 S.E.2d at 15 (quoting <em>Ricks v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 330, 334, 573 S.E.2d 266, 268 (2002)). It is its <em>tendency </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>prove or disprove \u2014 not its sufficiency, standing alone, to satisfy the ultimate burden of proof \u2014 that makes a fact relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0A\">It is universally recognized that evidence, to be relevant to an inquiry, need not conclusively prove the ultimate fact in issue, but only have \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>McKoy v. North Carolina, </em>494 U.S. 433, 440, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 1232, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (1990) (citations and internal brackets omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This standard entrusts juries with the task of weighing evidence of all probative gradations and gives them the freedom to accept or reject what they will. \u201cWe are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill.\u201d <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 28, 33, 396 S.E.2d 386, 389 (1990) (quoting <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 116, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2254, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Guided by these principles, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the 46 plastic baggies or Officer DeCoster\u2019s expert testimony about their use in the illegal drug trade. Thomas had been previously convicted for possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. He admitted to distributing drugs in the past. At the time of his arrest, marijuana residue was found \u201cthroughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the entire vehicle\u201d owned and operated by Thomas. The odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle was immediately apparent. The 46 plastic baggies, commonly used in the drug trade for distribution purposes, were hidden in a secret compartment of the driver\u2019s side door. Suffice it to say, the jury was entitled to find it unlikely that Thomas\u2019s mother stored her supply of empty jewelry bags in a hidden compartment of Thomas\u2019s marijuana-infested car.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Both individually and collectively, these facts <em>tended </em>to show just what the prosecutor argued \u2014 that Thomas was still engaged in the distribution of marijuana. A logical basis exists for making this point in a case involving weapons. Many courts have acknowledged the commonsense \u201crelationship between the distribution of controlled substances ... and the possession and use of dangerous weapons.\u201d <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 445, 452 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1994) <em>(en banc); Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 704, 714 n. 5, 536 S.E.2d 477, 482 n. 5 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc). Guns are the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d in the underground drug world. <em>United States v. White, </em>875 F.2d 427, 433 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">While not alone dispositive, evidence linking a defendant to drug distribution may be considered as one factor in determining whether he may have had a motive to possess a firearm. <em>See Logan, </em>19 Va.App. at 445, 452 S.E.2d at 369. On the question of motive, \u201cdrug-related evidence\u201d has a rational bearing of a charge of \u201cfirearm possession\u201d because of the commonly accepted correlation between the two. <em>United States v. White, </em>356 F.3d 865, 870 (8th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the 46 plastic baggies or Officer DeCoster\u2019s expert testimony about their use in the drug trade. What weight, if any, these facts should have been given when placed in the context of all of the other evidence in the case is a question for the jury, not the court, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">(ii) <em>Prior-Badr-Acts and Other-Crimes Doctrines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We also disagree with Thomas that the admission of this evidence conflicts with the prior-bad-acts doctrine (he has done it before, thus, he did it this time) or the other-crimes principle (he committed one crime, thus, he committed another). Both are applications of the same rule prohibiting the use of propensity evidence in criminal prosecutions. In this context, drug-related evidence does not attempt to prove mere propensity \u2014 it instead addresses a possible \u201cmotive\u201d for the defendant to possess a firearm. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>292 F.3d 90, 98 (1st Cir.2002) (finding evidence of drug-related activity \u201ceasily clears the relevancy hurdle\u201d by providing \u201ca compelling motive for possessing the gun\u201d); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1033 (11th Cir.2001) (admitting drug-related evidence \u201cto prove knowing possession of the firearm, not character\u201d); <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>887 F.2d 144, 147 (8th Cir.1989) (holding admission of \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d evidence relevant to motive to possess a firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In other words, Thomas\u2019s possession of the drug baggies was neither a prior bad act nor a simultaneous, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>unrelated, crime. It was just a factual circumstance of the crime scene.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe policies underlying the rule are simply inapplicable when some offenses committed in a single criminal episode become \u2018other acts\u2019 because the defendant is indicted for less than all of his actions.\u201d <em>United States v. Butcher, </em>926 F.2d 811, 816 (9th Cir.1991) (citation omitted) (holding that a \u201crational trier of fact could infer from the presence of the scales, plastic bags, and the pay and owe sheets\u201d that the defendant possessed the nearby firearm); <em>United States v. Simon, </em>767 F.2d 524, 527 (8th Cir.1985) (propensity evidentiary rules do not preclude \u201cadmitting the drug-related evidence\u201d at a trial involving a \u201cfirearms charge\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">(ii) <em>Balancing Potential Prejudicial and Probative Qualities</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">For similar reasons, we are unpersuaded by Thomas\u2019s argument that the evidence of the hidden drug baggies should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial. In a sense, all \u201cevidence tending to prove guilt is prejudicial\u201d \u2014 at least from the point of view of the person standing trial. <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 107, 141, 590 S.E.2d 587, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>558 (2004). Virginia law, however, intervenes only when the alleged prejudice tends to inflame irrational emotions or leads to illegitimate inferences. And even then, it becomes a matter of degree. \u201cRelevant evidence may be excluded only if the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value.\u201d <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 461, 470 S.E.2d 114, 127 (1996): <em>see also Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 564, 597, 604 S.E.2d 21, 39-40 (2004) (holding that evidence can be excluded only when its \u201cprobative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect\u201d). We generally defer to trial judges on this subject because they, unlike us, participate first person in the evidentiary process and acquire competencies on the subject that we can rarely duplicate merely by reading briefs and transcripts. <em>See generally Dandridge v. Marshall, </em>267 Va. 591, 596, 594 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2004) (recognizing this decision \u201crests within the sound discretion\u201d of the trial judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s theory of the case suggested Thomas was still engaged in marijuana distribution and possessed the firearm in support of that endeavor. This assertion, however, did not rely solely on the evidence of the hidden drug baggies. The prosecutor also stressed to the jury the evidence of Thomas\u2019s prior conviction for possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute, Thomas\u2019s concession on the stand that he had distributed marijuana in the past, the presence of marijuana residue throughout the entire vehicle, and the odor of marijuana coming from the interior compartment of the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thomas did not object to any of this evidence or the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">It is in this context that the trial judge had to determine whether the incrementally greater prejudice allegedly added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>by the evidence of the drug baggies was of sufficient magnitude to warrant their outright exclusion. On balance, he held, it was not. In an exercise of commendable caution, the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>offered to give a cautionary instruction. Thomas declined it. Concurring with the views of other appellate courts, we find no abuse of discretion under these circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In sum, we hold that Thomas waived all but one of his appellate arguments by failing to make specific and timely objections at trial. On the issue he preserved for appeal, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the contested evidence.

Objecting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the testimony about the small plastic baggies and the introduction of them in evidence, Thomas\u2019s trial attorney said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is relevant.\u201d During the discussion about the objection, the prosecutor indicated that he intended to argue that \u201cwhen you find drugs its a reasonable inference that somebody can be armed and dangerous.\u201d Thomas\u2019s attorney argued \u201cthe probative value does not outweigh the prejudice because [it is] immensely prejudicial for the jury to hear ... there were all these bags ... in the car.\u201d The trial judge admitted the evidence, \u201cfind[ing] that the probative value does outweigh the prejudice.\u201d Thomas argues on appeal as he did at trial: that the evidence was \u201cirrelevant\u201d and lacked \u201cprobative value\u201d and that \u201cthe prejudice ... greatly outweighed any tenuous probative value.\u201d I would hold that the objection was well stated and that the trial judge erred by admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">This evidence plainly was inadmissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">It is well established in our jurisprudence that evidence of other offenses is generally not admissible to prove guilt of the crime for which a defendant is presently on trial. <em>See Stockton v.

Thus, even if we assume the inference the prosecutor desired is a rational one, the evidence must be excluded when the jury might give the evidence prejudicial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">This is such a case. The only evidentiary value of the empty baggies was to suggest an inference that Thomas had the propensity to distribute narcotics. On this inference, the prosecutor pyramided further inferences that Thomas must have known the gun was in the car because the jury could assume that drug distributors possess guns. The trial judge\u2019s admission of evidence that empty baggies were found in the car was error because this evidence allowed a speculative inference Thomas had committed or intended to commit another crime, which had no connection to the offense for which he was being tried. \u201cThe accused comes to trial to meet the specific charge against him, not to vindicate or to explain every collateral charge that may be made in the course of the introduction of the evidence.\u201d <em>Limbaugh v.

This is upon the principle that such evidence confuses the issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>jury, unfairly surprises the accused with a charge he is not prepared to meet, and tends to prejudice him in the minds of the jury by showing his depravity or criminal propensity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 274-75, 105 S.E.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Prior bad acts evidence is admissible for limited purposes, for example to show identity, intent, or motive. <em>Sutphin v.

Indeed, we have ruled that \u201cin a prosecution for possessing drugs with the intent to distribute, the fact that an accused has sold drugs on a prior occasion, where the prior sale is not shown to have been related to the charged offense, has great potential for prejudice.\u201d <em>Jones v.

This is so because \u201c[ejvidence of unrelated drug sales suggests to the jury that the accused has a propensity to commit a crime of this nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[B]oth this Court and the Virginia Supreme Court have repeatedly rejected the admission of evidence of separate and unrelated prior drug transactions to show a defendant\u2019s sale of drugs or possession of drugs with the intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Cooper v.

If a prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute narcotics would be inadmissible to prove knowledge of or intent to possess the gun or the baggies, then certainly the evidence of the empty baggies and the inferences the prosecutor sought to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>from them were inadmissible here, where the speculation required to make any conclusion is far greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Beyond prejudice, this evidence should have been excluded because of its dubious probative value in establishing the charge of possession of a firearm. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Guill,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cif the circumstances [of the other event] have no intimate conne[ct]ion with the main fact; if they constitute no link in the chain of evidence ... they ought to be excluded, because they are irrelevant; [and] if they denote other guilt, they are not only irrelevant, but they do injury, because they have a tendency to [cause] prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 491 (quoting <em>Walker v.

The evidence that empty baggies were found in the car merely allowed the jury to draw a speculative inference that Thomas had committed or intended to commit another crime, which had no connection to the offense for which he was being tried. Moreover, no evidence at trial proved that any of the baggies contained marijuana or any other controlled substance. Here, the prosecutor offered the empty baggies as evidence and then sought to use the discovery of the baggies in the car to support a chain of impermissible inferences involving Thomas\u2019s previous conviction of drug distribution. It offered the evidence as a basis to argue to the jury the following: First, it could infer these baggies were items connected with a trade in narcotics. Second, it could infer from Thomas\u2019s previous conviction for possession of narcotics that he possessed the baggies as an incident of his trade as a drug dealer. Third, it could speculate that drug dealers carry guns as an incident of the drug trade. Lastly, it could infer from Thomas\u2019s possession of items of the drug trade that Thomas was engaged in the distribution of drugs and, therefore, knowingly possessed the gun. Allowing such a long chain of speculation, far removed from the facts, is not probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>For these reasons, I would hold that the judge erred in admitting in evidence the empty baggies.
