HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">This matter comes before the Court on a rehearing <em>en banc </em>from an unpublished panel decision rendered December 9, 2003. <em>See Medley v. Commonwealth, </em>03 Vap UNP 1567021, 2003 WL 22887860 (2003). In that decision, a divided panel of this Court reversed Medley\u2019s convictions for possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>cocaine with intent to distribute (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248) and transporting more than one ounce of cocaine into the Commonwealth with the intent to distribute (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01), finding that police officers failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d Medley\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, therefore, that the trial court should have granted Medley\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">By order dated January 13, 2004, we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing this case <em>en banc, </em>we affirm Medley\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">On appeal of a denial of a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence presented below in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">So viewed, the evidence presented during the hearing on Medley\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence established that on the afternoon of August 17, 2000, State Police Officer C.S. Wade and several other officers were assigned to monitor southbound traffic at the toll plaza of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Northampton County and to \u201cintercept people smuggling guns and.drugs ... from the New York area ... to the Tidewater area.\u201d While looking \u201cfor violations on the vehicles and ... for any unusual responses or reactions as [occupants] approaeh[ed] the toll booth,\u201d Officer Wade observed a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire approach the booth. The car\u2019s license plate number had a prefix on it that Officer Wade was not \u201cfamiliar with as being issued over here on this side of the water,\u201d so he \u201cassumed that this vehicle was from across the bay.\u201d Officer Wade, who was standing near the toll booth where he could be seen by the driver, looked into the car and noticed that the driver\u2019s \u201ceyes were bugged out,\u201d \u201c[t]hey were great big and round.\u201d For that reason, Officer Wade asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>one of Ms fellow officers, Trooper Hawkins, to cheek the car \u201cwhen it came up in his lane of travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">When Medley, the driver, stopped to pay the toll, Trooper Hawkins observed that the car had a \u201cdark window tint\u201d and that there was a \u201cdangling object in the rear-view mirror.\u201d Trooper Hawkins advised Medley \u201cthat his window tint appeared to be too dark under Virgima law and [that] it was also a violation to have any objects hanging from the mirror that could obstruct your view.\u201d He then asked Medley to pull over so that he could \u201ctalk to him about those violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">When Trooper Hawkins asked Medley for Ms driver\u2019s license and registration, Medley said he had no identification. After a female passenger indicated that the automobile was hers and gave Trooper Hawkins the registration, Trooper Hawkins walked Medley to his car so that he could \u201cr[u]n him through DMV.\u201d While Trooper Hawkins and Medley waited for the report concerning Medley\u2019s driving status, Hawkins asked Medley \u201cwhere he was coming from.\u201d Medley said he and his passenger intended to drive to New York from Norfolk, but they had had an argument and were returning to Norfolk. At some point, Trooper Hawkins learned that Medleys driver\u2019s license was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">During that time, another officer, Special Agent Wendell, questioned Medley\u2019s female passenger about her travel. After talking with her, Wendell advised Hawkins as to their conversation, and the two officers determined that the stories \u201cdidn\u2019t match.\u201d Officer Wade, who had also spoken with Medleys passenger, then approached Trooper Hawkins\u2019s patrol car and advised that he was \u201cgoing to run a K-9 on the veMcle.\u201d Medleys female passenger \u201cbecame very excited, very nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">As Officer Wade graded the dog around the Pontiac, the dog alerted near a rear door. Based upon the alert, Officer Wade looked inside the car and found, behind the driver\u2019s seat, a black, semi-transparent plastic bag containing a cereal box. Inside the box, he found \u201capproximately 250 grams of what [he] believed to be ... cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>At that point, Trooper Hawkins handcuffed Medley and left him alone in his patrol car. Special Agent Wendell handcuffed the passenger and read her the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Wendell then, in conjunction with Officer Wade, questioned the passenger again about \u201cher trip up north.\u201d The passenger stated: Medley promised her $200 for taking him to New York; she noticed Medley had about $2,500 in a roll of money during the trip; she left the car to go to the bathroom when they arrived in New York, while Medley was talking with \u201ca bunch of people\u201d; she and Medley then \u201crode around for awhile,\u201d but eventually drove back to the same place; she left the car again and bought a \u201cjuice and some gum\u201d; they then \u201cleft and came straight back\u201d to Virginia; she noticed the cereal box when they were driving through Delaware, and Medley told her \u201chis people gave it to him and not to worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">After speaking with Medley\u2019s passenger, Special Agent Wendell went to Trooper Hawkins\u2019s vehicle and read Medley his <em>Miranda </em>rights. When he asked Medley if he understood those rights, Medley replied that he did. Special Agent Wendell then asked Medley if he wished to waive his rights and talk with him.. Medley responded that \u201che would talk to [Special Agent Wendell], but he didn\u2019t want to waive his rights.\u201d Special Agent Wendell testified that the following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">For several minutes I continued to talk to Mr. Medley saying I read him his Miranda rights. I asked him which rights he wished \u2014 that he wanted to invoke, and he said he wanted all of his rights. I told him that I cannot talk to him because of the third right \u2014 you have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have a lawyer with \u2014 excuse me \u2014 with you during questioning; and at that time he stated, I want all my rights, but I still want to talk to you. I again explained to him, I cannot talk to you \u2014 and I overemphasized that I cannot talk to him at all without having his waiver of rights; and he said, I don\u2019t want, to waive anything on this. I want this sheet to remain the same \u2014 and this would be the sheet that I marked yes and then no \u2014 but I will talk to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Special Agent Wendell testified that he then asked another officer, Sergeant Clark, to join him. Both officers \u201ctried to explain over and over again to him that if he wishes to enact his Miranda rights, [they could not] talk to him.\u201d Medley responded that he understood his rights and said he \u201cdid not want to waive his rights, but ... would talk to [them].\u201d The officers then told Medley that if he wanted to speak with them, he would have to initiate the conversation. They then walked away from the patrol car and joined the other officers in searching the Pontiac.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">A few moments later, Trooper Hawkins returned to his vehicle and read Medley his <em>Miranda </em>rights once again. Medley \u201cwasn\u2019t talking at that point,\u201d and \u201che wouldn\u2019t say that he understood his rights.\u201d When Trooper Hawkins asked Medley if he wanted to waive his rights, Medley \u201c[went] as far as acknowledging his understanding; but he would not say, I waive my rights.\u201d Trooper Hawkins then \u201cdetermined, unless [Medley] approached [him] and wanted to talk to [him] again, [he] wasn\u2019t going to have any more conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The record is silent as to what occurred immediately thereafter. However, within approximately thirty minutes after Special Agent Wendell had begun searching the Pontiac, Trooper Hawkins came to him and said, \u201c[Medley] wants to talk to you.\u201d During the suppression hearing, Special Agent Wendell testified that the following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">I then proceeded back to the vehicle and asked Mr. Medley, Do you want to talk to me? He said, Yes, I want to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">I again explained to him, if you\u2019re not willing to waive your rights, I cannot talk to you. He said, I \u2014 quote and unquote \u2014 Mr. Medley stated that he could talk to me because she had nothing to do with the investigation. I then explained to Mr. Medley,. I don\u2019t want to talk to you unless you\u2019re willing to waive your rights; and he said, I\u2019ll talk to you. I just don\u2019t want anything to be used against me. I\u2019ll talk to you off record, and I told him that he cannot talk to me off the record because he invoked his rights. Again, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>consistently told me that he wanted to talk to me; and, therefore, I began talking to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Special Agent Wendell further testified that Medley responded to his \u201cquestioning\u201d and said that his passenger knew nothing, that he was being paid $1,500 for taking \u201cthe item\u201d to Norfolk, that another car was following them to Norfolk, and that he was to deliver the item to the occupants of the other car in Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Medley, a convicted felon, testified that he told all the officers he did not want to waive his rights and denied telling them he wanted to talk to them. He testified that when he told them he would not make a statement, he gave them his lawyer\u2019s business card. Medley claimed one of the officers ripped it while talking to him. He testified that Trooper Hawkins \u201ckept asking questions\u201d and talked for thirty to forty minutes about waiving his rights. Medley denied making any statements to Special Agent Wendell about going to New York or making a delivery to the people in a car following him.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The trial judge denied Medley\u2019s motion to suppress, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">I think he had a right to stop him, and ... if you believe his testimony, he didn\u2019t make any statements. So there is nothing to be suppressed. If you believe the officers\u2019 testimony, he didn\u2019t waive his rights; but he initiated the conversation. So I would overrule the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Medley subsequently entered \u201cconditional\u201d pleas of guilty to the charges, purportedly based upon <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We begin by recognizing the well-settled maxim that on an appeal of a ruling on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them,\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc), </em>but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case, <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We next note that in the appellant\u2019s brief Medley filed before the panel, the issue Medley presented is whether, \u201c[t]he trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from the vehicle and appellant\u2019s incriminating statement, as the same were seized in violation of the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d However, in an apparent violation of Rule 5A:20(e), Medley\u2019s panel brief contained no argument or authority suggesting any Fourth Amendment violation. We thus, have no basis to consider the application of the Fourth Amendment further. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e) (\u201cThe opening brief of appellant shall contain ... [t]he principles of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Medley asserted during oral argument that the police conduct at issue here, violated his \u201cright not to incriminate himself as secured by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d Specifically, Medley has contended on appeal (at least implicitly) that police violated his right to remain silent, as well as his right to counsel under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Assuming, without here deciding, that Medley\u2019s broad and unfocused question presented was sufficient to preserve both arguments, we find that the evidence below established police did not violate Medley\u2019s \u201cright not to incriminate himself as secured by the Fifth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d Therefore, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We first address Medley\u2019s argument that police violated his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. An issue of whether an accused \u201cclearly requested an attorney during a custodial interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 326, 568 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2002) (plurality opinion). \u201c \u2018[T]he determination of what [the accused] actually said is a question of fact that we review only for clear error.... Whether those words are sufficient to invoke the right to counsel is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 327, 568 S.E.2d at 698 (quoting <em>United States v. Uribe-Galindo, </em>990 F.2d 522, 523 (10th Cir.1993) (other citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In the appellate brief Medley filed before the panel, Medley cited <em>only Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), as authority in support of his position that police violated his rights \u201cunder the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d In <em>Edwards </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966)], the Court determined that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 prohibition against compelled self-incrimination required that custodial interrogation be preceded by advice to the putative defendant that he has the right to remain silent and also the right to the presence of an attorney. 384 U.S., at 479, 86 S.Ct., at 1630. The Court also indicated the procedures to be followed subsequent to the warnings. If the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u201cthe interrogation must cease.\u201d If he requests counsel, \u201cthe interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 474, 86 S.Ct., at 1627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">451 U.S. at 481-82, 101 S.Ct. at 1883.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">In order to \u201cprevent police from badgering a defendant into waiving his previously asserted <em>Miranda </em>rights\u201d and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cprotect the suspect\u2019s \u2018desire to deal with the police only-through counsel,\u2019 \u201d the United States Supreme Court established the <em>\u201cEdwards </em>rule\u201d as a \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis for the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel.\u201d <em>See Davis [v. United </em>States], 512 U.S. [452] at 458, 114 S.Ct. [2350] at 2355 [129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994)]; <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2208, 2209, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); <em>Michigan v. Harvey, </em>494 U.S. 344, 350, 110 S.Ct. 1176, 1180, 108 L.Ed.2d 293 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Quinn v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 702, 710-11, 492 S.E.2d 470, 474-75 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Specifically, <em>Edwards </em>extended the principles set forth in <em>Miranda </em>\u201cto subsequent interrogation, holding that, \u2018... an accused, ..., having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Gregory, </em>263 Va. 134, 146-47, 557 S.E.2d 715, 722 (2002) (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1885). Thus, \u201c[t]he prophylaxis of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards provides the right to have counsel </em>present during interrogation as an additional safeguard in the exercise of the right against self-incrimination\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 557 S.E.2d at 722 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">However, \u201c[w]hether the <em>Edwards </em>rule renders a statement inadmissible is determined by a three-part inquiry.\u201d <em>Quinn, </em>25 Va.App. at 712, 492 S.E.2d at 475. The first part of that inquiry calls for a determination of whether \u201c \u2018the accused <em>actually </em>invoked his right to counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tipton v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 832, 834, 447 S.E.2d 539, 540 (1994)) (emphasis added). The evidence in the case at bar does not satisfy that first portion of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The United States Supreme Court has \u201cruled that the test for determining whether the accused invoked the right to counsel is an objective one.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 602, 605, 518 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1999) (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>U.S. at 457-59, 114 S.Ct. at 2354-55). Thus, a court \u201cmust determine whether the accused \u2018articulate[d] his desire to have counsel present <em>sufficiently clearly </em>that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355); <em>see also Gregory, </em>263 Va. at 147, 557 S.E.2d at 723 (\u201cThe <em>Edwards </em>rule does not apply unless the prior interrogation was custodial and during that custodial interrogation, the suspect clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Here it is clear, as the trial court found, that Medley indicated to police he did not wish to waive his \u201crights.\u201d Nevertheless, contrary to Medley\u2019s assertions, such a general refusal to waive his rights, standing alone, is hardly sufficient to convey to police a clear and unequivocal request for counsel. As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Davis, </em>\u201c[invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u2018requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u2019 \u201d 512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355 (quoting <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S.Ct. at 2209).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">[T]he suspect must unambiguously request counsel. As we have observed, \u201ca statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>[469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 494, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984)] (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).... Although a suspect need not \u201cspeak with the discrimination of an Oxford don,\u201d ... he must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement <em>to be a request for an attorney. </em>If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, <em>Edwards </em>does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect. <em>See Moran v. Burbine, </em>[475 U.S. 412, 433 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1147 n. 4, 89 L.Ed.2d 410] (1986) (\u201cThe interrogation must cease until an attorney is present <em>only </em>if the individual states that he wants an attorney\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In explanation of the underlying rationale, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">In considering how a suspect must invoke the right to counsel, we must consider the other side of the <em>Miranda </em>equation: the need for effective law enforcement. Although the courts ensure compliance with the <em>Miranda </em>requirements through the exclusionary rule, it is police officers who must actually decide whether ... they can question a suspect. The <em>Edwards </em>rule \u2014 questioning must cease if the suspect asks for a lawyer \u2014 provides a bright line that can be applied by officers in the real world of investigation and interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information. But if we were to require questioning to cease if a suspect makes a statement that might be a request for an attorney, this clarity and ease of application would be lost. Police officers would be forced to make difficult judgment calls about whether the suspect in fact wants a lawyer even though he has not said so, with the threat of suppression if they guess wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">No clear request for an attorney can reasonably be found in Medley\u2019s broad statements pertaining to his \u201crights.\u201d <em>See Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 252-53, 397 S.E.2d 385, 395-96 (1990) (\u201cWe share the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s preference for \u2018bright-line\u2019 rules for the guidance of those who must conduct and evaluate custodial interrogations. In further explication ... we hold that the <em>Edwards </em>rule is invoked, and that custodial interrogation must cease, when the accused, having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and having begun to respond to the questions of the authorities, \u2018has <em>clearly </em>asserted his right to counsel\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485, 101 S.Ct. at 1885) (emphasis in original)). To the contrary, the most that one could reasonably glean from Medley\u2019s statements is that he did not wish to speak generally about the drugs found in the car. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Smith, </em>751 F.2d 96, 101 (2d Cir.1984) (noting that where an accused \u201cdid not expressly ask for a lawyer,\u201d but indicated he did not wish to waive \u201cthese rights,\u201d after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>him, a court will assume \u201cthat all that he did was to assert his right to remain silent\u201d); <em>see also Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484, 101 S.Ct. at 1884 (noting a distinction between an invocation of the right to remain silent and the right to counsel stating, \u201cadditional safeguards are necessary when the accused <em>asks for </em>counsel\u201d (emphasis added)). For these reasons, an <em>Edwards </em>analysis is not appropriate under the circumstances at issue in this case. It is thus clear that police did not violate Medley\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Turning to Medley\u2019s claim that police violated his <em>Miranda </em>right to silence, we note first <em>Miranda </em>recognized that if a suspect \u201cindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627. As previously noted, our standard of review requires us to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the application of the protections afforded by <em>Miranda </em>to the historical facts as found by the trial court. <em>Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 611, 450 S.E.2d 124, 132 (1994) (\u201cWhether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. Subsidiary factual questions, however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Correll v. Thompson, </em>63 F.3d 1279, 1290 (4th Cir.1995). Thus, the issue of whether Medley waived his rights under <em>Miranda </em>is a mixed question of law and fact, and while we are bound by the facts and reasonable inferences that flow from those facts as they relate to Medley\u2019s words and conduct, we are not bound by the legal conclusion of the trial court that Medley \u201cdidn\u2019t waive his rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Assuming without here deciding that Medley\u2019s statements and conduct were initially sufficient to equate to a clear and unambiguous assertion of his right to remain silent, we find that the factual circumstances as found by the trial court plainly reveal that, subsequently, when Medley reinitiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>contact with Special Agent Wendell and insisted on giving a statement relating to his passenger\u2019s involvement with the drugs, by his own actions, he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Indeed, it is well settled that even if invoked, the <em>Miranda </em>right to silence can \u201cbe waived by the suspect if the waiver is made knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth </em>266 Va. 423, 432, 587 S.E.2d 532, 540 (2003). In fact, in <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S.Ct. 321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975), the United States Supreme Court expressly acknowledged that \u201ca blanket prohibition against the taking of voluntary statements or a permanent immunity from further interrogation, <em>regardless of the circumstances, </em>would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, while</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[a]n express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, [it] is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case. As was unequivocally said in <em>Miranda, </em>mere silence is not enough. That does not mean that the defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights. The courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s burden is great; <em>but in at least some </em>cases <em>waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1757, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Here, it is clear that police were initially confused as to whether Medley wished to invoke his right to silence. Indeed, after being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Medley told Special Agent Wendell that he \u201cwould talk to [him], but that he didn\u2019t want to waive his rights.\u201d Special Agent Wendell then explained to Medley that he could not continue to talk to him, \u201cbecause of the third right \u2014 you have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions.\u201d Medley responded, \u201cI want all my rights, but I still want to talk to you.\u201d Medley stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to waive anything on this,\u201d but again stated, \u201cI will talk to you.\u201d After several attempts to explain the <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley, Medley continued to claim that he \u201cdid not want to waive his rights, but ... would talk to [police].\u201d In light of this, police consistently informed Medley that they could not continue to talk with him because they understood that he had invoked his rights under <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">However, approximately thirty minutes after Special Agent Wendell left Medley to wait in the patrol car, Trooper Hawkins approached Wendell and stated, \u201c[Medley] wants to talk to you.\u201d Special Agent Wendell testified that he went to the patrol car and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">again explained to [Medley], if you\u2019re not willing to waive your rights, I cannot talk to you. He said, I \u2014 quote and unquote \u2014 Mr. Medley stated that he could talk to me because she had nothing to do with the investigation. I then explained to Medley, I don\u2019t want to talk to you unless you\u2019re willing to waive your rights; and he said, I\u2019ll talk to you. I just don\u2019t want anything to be used against me. I\u2019ll talk to you off record, and I told him that he cannot talk to me off the record because he invoked his rights. Again, he <em>consistently told me that he wanted to talk to me; </em>and, therefore, I began talking to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">(Emphasis added). This course of conduct clearly and reasonably indicated to Special Agent Wendell that Medley understood his right to remain silent, understood the fact that \u201che [had] invoked his rights,\u201d but wished to waive his previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>invoked right to remain silent and speak to police about his passenger\u2019s involvement with his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Nevertheless, as indicated above, we recognize that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">The inquiry into whether an individual waived effectuation of the rights conveyed in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings has two distinct dimensions. <em>[Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 482, 101 S.Ct. at 1883]. First, the relinquishment of the right \u201cmust have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.\u201d <em>[Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421, 106 S.Ct. at 1141]. Second, \u201cthe waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\"><em>United States v. Cristobal, </em>293 F.3d 134,139-40 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">As to the first prong of the analysis \u2014 the voluntariness of Medley\u2019s ultimate waiver \u2014 the United States Supreme Court has held \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained after [a] person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 326. \u201cA statement procured in violation of <em>Mosley </em>is presumed to have been obtained by an involuntary waiver of Fifth Amendment rights and, therefore, it is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 88, 428 S.E.2d 16, 21 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The question of \u201c[w]hether a person\u2019s decision to remain silent has been \u2018scrupulously honored\u2019 requires an independent examination of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis question is one of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review; however, the subsidiary factual findings of the [trial] court are entitled to a presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>Correll, </em>63 F.3d at 1290 (citing <em>Miller v.

Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 549, 551, 413 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In so reviewing this issue, we must keep in mind that the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Davis, </em>advised that \u201cwhen a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether [the suspect] actually wants\u201d to invoke a specified right. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. When viewed properly \u2014 in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the party prevailing below \u2014 the record establishes that the \u201cgood police practice\u201d described in <em>Davis, </em>is all that took place here. Indeed, from the beginning of their interaction with Medley, the officers here reasonably believed, based upon Medley\u2019s course of conduct, that he was confused or ambivalent about whether to invoke his right to remain silent. Moreover, once Medley decided to invoke that right, the officers reasonably believed that he was confused or ambivalent about whether to waive the right. In fact, credible evidence in the record suggests that it was <em>only </em>because of Medley\u2019s consistently equivocal and contradictory conduct that police inquired further of Medley to determine whether he understood his rights and/or whether he intended to waive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Under these circumstances, we find no reason to conclude that the officers failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d Medley\u2019s right to remain silent. Indeed, there was \u201cnothing coercive or deceitful\u201d in the officers\u2019 conduct toward Medley \u2014 particularly given Medley\u2019s consistently contradictory statements. <em>See Land v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 229, 176 S.E.2d 586, 590 (1970). Furthermore, as his dialog with police officers makes clear, there is no question that Medley was aware of the nature of his right to remain silent and the potential consequences of abandoning that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Thus, by consistently reasserting his intent to communicate with police about the involvement of his passenger, and by ultimately doing so \u2014 despite the numerous warnings given to him by the officers involved \u2014 we find that the officers here reasonably believed, based upon the totality of Medley\u2019s conduct, that he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily chose to waive any previously invoked right to remain silent. <em>See Connecticut v. Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 529, 107 S.Ct. 828, 832, 93 L.Ed.2d 920 (1987) <em>(\u201cMiranda </em>gives the defendant a right to choose between speech and silence, and [the defendant] chose to speak.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Medley\u2019s motion to suppress on these grounds,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we thus, affirm his convictions on this basis as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. The Commonwealth conceded during oral argument that Medley entered his pleas of guilty upon the condition that he maintain the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Thus, we assume without here deciding, that Medley properly preserved this appeal \u2014 despite the fact that the trial court\u2019s final order makes no mention of a conditional guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"><em>. </em>In light of this holding, we do not address the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative theory that any error on the part of the trial court was harmless, given the magnitude of the remaining evidence against Medley, as weU as his pleas of guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b83-7\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">with whom ELDER, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">When a defendant files a motion to suppress a statement and alleges a <em>Miranda </em>violation, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Tague v. Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 470, 100 S.Ct. 652, 653, 62 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980) (per curiam) (citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)). The evidence in this case is demonstrable that Earing Bethel Medley did not waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the Commonwealth failed in its burden to prove he did. Indeed, when, as in this case, a trial judge finds that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t waive his rights,\u201d we are bound by that finding of historical fact unless it is \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or \u201cwithout evidence to support [it].\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc). <em>See also Chawla v. BurgerBusters, Inc., </em>255 Va. 616, 622-23, 499 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1998) (defining waiver); <em>Stewart v.

I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Medley unambiguously invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights when police began interrogating him. Even after repeated police attempts, Medley refused to waive those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The evidence proved that Medley was in custody in a police officer\u2019s vehicle and in handcuffs when Special Agent Wendell began interrogating him. After Special Agent Wendell read <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley, he asked Medley if he understood those rights. Medley said he did. When Special Agent Wendell asked Medley if he wished to waive those rights and talk with him, Medley responded that \u201che would talk to [Special Agent Wendell], but he didn\u2019t want to waive his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Although the record does not contain the precise language ... [used to convey] the <em>Miranda </em>rights, those rights typically are worded to inform an accused as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">MIRANDA WARNING</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">1. You have the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">3. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you are being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you, without cost, before any questioning, if you desire one.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\"><em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 602, 606, 518 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1999) <em>(en banc). See also Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 576, 578, 423 S.E.2d 160, 161 (1992). When Special Agent Wendell continued to talk to Medley and \u201casked him which rights ... he wanted to invoke,\u201d Medley \u201csaid he wanted all of his rights.\u201d Given this context in which the officer had just advised Medley of these four specific rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>nothing is ambiguous about Medley\u2019s response. He invoked each of the four rights as itemized.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Rather than accepting Medley\u2019s invocation of his \u201crights\u201d and ceasing the interrogation, Special Agent Wendell continued to interrogate Medley. He testified that the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">For several minutes I continued to talk to Mr. Medley saying I read him his Miranda rights. I asked him which rights he wished \u2014 that he wanted to invoke, and he said he wanted all of his rights. I told him that I cannot talk to him because of the third right \u2014 you have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have a lawyer with \u2014 excuse me \u2014 with you during questioning; and at that time he stated, I want all my rights, but I still want to talk to you. I again explained to him, I cannot talk to you \u2014 and I overemphasized that I cannot talk to him at all without having his waiver of rights; and he said, I don\u2019t want to waive anything on this. I want this sheet to remain the same \u2014 and this would be the sheet that I marked yes and then no \u2014 but I will talk to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">I acknowledge the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cgood practice suggests that the police should attempt to clarify ambiguous statements,\u201d <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 266, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1995) (citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 460-61, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994)), however, the facts in this case show that the encounters between Medley and the police went beyond mere clarification. Medley\u2019s statement that \u201che wanted all of his rights\u201d was not ambiguous. Indeed, Special Agent Wendell specifically acknowledged at trial that he understood Medley invoked his right to an attorney and did not want to talk without a lawyer. Although he knew Medley had not waived his rights, he continued his efforts to elicit a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">To assist in obtaining a waiver, Special Agent Wendell asked Sergeant Clark to join him and talk to Medley. He described their extensive efforts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>At that particular point in time after minutes and numerous times trying to explain about I cannot talk to him if he does not -wish to waive them, I brought Sergeant Clark in. Sergeant Clark and I both tried to explain over and over again to him that if he wishes to enact his Miranda rights, I cannot talk to him; and at that time Sergeant Clark also advised him of that. From that standpoint, Sergeant Clark and I closed the door \u2014 I closed the door myself; and Sergeant Clark advised him that if he wants to talk to us, he\u2019s going to have to initiate the conversation for us to continue to talk to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Sergeant Clark confirmed that, after he joined Special Agent Wendell and again explained the <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley, Medley responded that he understood his rights and said he \u201cdid not want to waive his rights, but ... would talk to us.\u201d Sergeant Clark testified that after trying three more times, he told Medley that Medley would have to initiate the conversation otherwise they would not talk to him anymore. Special Agent Wendell and Sergeant Clark then left Medley alone in the vehicle. At that point, both officers knew that Medley refused to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Special Agent Wendell joined the other officers who were searching the passenger\u2019s automobile, and he told Trooper Hawkins that Medley \u201cdidn\u2019t give a statement.\u201d Nevertheless, after only a momentary cessation, Trooper Hawkins entered the vehicle and renewed the attempt to get a statement. Trooper Hawkins, the third officer to violate Medley\u2019s election to terminate questioning, began by repeating for at least the third time, the <em>Miranda </em>rights as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you\u2019re being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning if you wish one; and then I always go into the waiver. Do you understand each of these rights I\u2019ve explained to you? And having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now? He would never go into with me\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Q: Don\u2019t paraphrase or describe. Tell me exactly what he said to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A: I don\u2019t know verbatim how he responded to that; but I know it was to the point that he did not want to talk to me at that point, so I cut my conversation off then.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Q: You understood then that Mr. Medley did not waive his Miranda rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">A: With me, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Trooper Hawkins farther explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">I sat back with Mr. Medley for a little while after his Miranda warnings were read to him. Special Agent Wendell had read them, and I had read them again, and he wasn\u2019t talking at that point when I was with him. He just said that everything \u2014 when I read them to him, he would say \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t say that he understood his rights. He wouldn\u2019t go that far with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">When I talked to him, he \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 when I asked him the question about will you waive your rights, he would never say I waive my rights. He would go as far as acknowledging his understanding; but he would not say, I waive my rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">He testified that he then \u201cdetermined, unless [Medley] approached [him] and wanted to talk to [him] again, [he] wasn\u2019t going to have any more conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Special Agent Wendell testified that, within a half an hour of his departure from seeking a statement from Medley, Trooper Hawkins came to him and said, \u201che wants to talk to you.\u201d The record contains no testimony from Trooper Hawkins about the circumstances which gave rise to the conversation with Medley and which led Trooper Hawkins to seek out Special Agent Wendell. The record clearly establishes, however, that when Special Agent Wendell returned to the vehicle to re-interrogate Medley, less than a half hour had lapsed from his initial efforts. Thus, during a half-hour period Medley had been given at least three sets of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and subjected to interrogation by Trooper Hawkins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Sergeant Clark, and twice by Special Agent Wendell. At no time did Medley say he was waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Indeed, Medley said at all times and on each reading of his <em>Miranda </em>rights that he would not waive his rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Special Agent Wendell testified that the following occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">I then proceeded back to the vehicle and asked Mr. Medley, Do you want to talk to me? He said, Yes, I want to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">I again explained to him, if you\u2019re not willing to waive your rights, I cannot talk to you. He said, I \u2014 quote and unquote \u2014 Mr. Medley stated that he could talk to me because [the passenger] had nothing to do with the investigation. I then explained to Mr. Medley, I don\u2019t want to talk to you unless you\u2019re willing to waive your rights; and he said, I\u2019ll talk to you. I just don\u2019t want anything to be used against me. I\u2019ll talk to you off record, and I told him that he cannot talk to me off the record because he invoked his rights. Again, he consistently told me that he wanted to talk to me; and, therefore, I began talking to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Denying Medley\u2019s motion to suppress his statements, the trial judge made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">I think [the officers] had a right to stop him, and ... if you believe [Medley\u2019s] testimony, he didn\u2019t make any statements. So there is nothing to be suppressed. If you believe the officer\u2019s testimony, he didn\u2019t waive his rights; but he initiated the conversation. So I would overrule the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">I would hold that the Commonwealth failed to prove Medley waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. I would further hold that the conduct of the officers violated both Medley\u2019s right to remain silent and his right to have the questioning ceased until he had consulted an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The majority is correct that Medley never specifically mentioned his \u201cright to counsel.\u201d Special Agent Wendell did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>testify, however, that he told Medley he could \u201cnot talk to him because of the third right \u2014 you have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have a lawyer with ... you during questioning.\u201d Special Agent Wendell also testified that Medley responded to that comment by saying, \u201cI want all my rights.\u201d Therefore, Special Agent Wendell, who was the first officer to read <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley, was aware that Medley did not want to waive his right to talk to his attorney before being interrogated. In view of this circumstance, Special Agent Wendell and any other reasonably trained officer certainly \u201c Vould understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDaniel, </em>30 Va.App. at 605, 518 S.E.2d at 853 (citation omitted). The record further reflects that after Sergeant Clark and Trooper Hawkins read <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley, Special Agent Wendell returned to the vehicle and again questioned Medley. He was fully aware of Medley\u2019s earlier refusal to waive his right to an attorney, and he initiated the interrogation with full knowledge that the other two officers had conversed with Medley and were unsuccessful in their attempts to obtain Medley\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">The prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates ... [that] the waiver [of the right] is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. <em>If ... he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioning. </em>Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him. The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444-45, 86 S.Ct. at 1612 (emphasis added). The violation in this case is patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The trial judge\u2019s assertion that Medley \u201cinitiated the conversation\u201d ignores the evidence which shows that the police failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d Medley\u2019s request to remain silent and his repeated assertion that \u201che wanted all his rights.\u201d Noting that <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), has been misapprehended, the Supreme Court of the United States explained its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">We did not there hold that the \u201cinitiation\u201d of a conversation by a defendant such as respondent would amount to a waiver of a previously invoked right to counsel; we held that after the right to counsel had been asserted by an accused, further interrogation of the accused should not take place \u201cunless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d 451 U.S., at 485, 101 S.Ct., at 1885. This was in effect a prophylactic rule, designed to protect an accused in police custody from being badgered by police officers in the manner in which the defendant in <em>Edwards </em>was....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">But even if a conversation taking place after the accused has \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel,\u201d is initiated by the accused, where reinterrogation follows, the burden remains upon the prosecution to show that subsequent events indicated a waiver of the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during the interrogation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">Thus, the ... Court of Appeals was wrong in thinking that an \u201cinitiation\u201d of a conversation or discussion by an accused not only satisfied the <em>Edwards </em>rule, but <em>ex proprio vigore </em>sufficed to show a waiver of the previously asserted right to counsel. The inquiries are separate, and clarity of application is not gained by melding them together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\"><em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1044-45, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 2834-35, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Medley argued on brief, as he did at trial, that the trial judge must determine: \u201cFirst ... whether the accused unequivocally invoked his right to counsel. Second, ... whether the accused rather than the authorities initiated further discussions____Third, if the accused did initiate further discussions ...[,] whether the accused knowingly and intelligently waived the previously invoked right to counsel.\u201d He argues, and the Supreme Court has held, the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination protects an accused as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cOnce [Miranda] warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his <em>Fifth Amendment </em>privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.\u201d 384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. at 1627-28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">* * <em>* </em>* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">A reasonable and faithful interpretation of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion must rest on the intention of the Court in that case to adopt \u201cfully effective means ... to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored____\u201d 384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630. The critical safeguard identified in the passage at issue is a person\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1628. Through the exercise of his option to terminate questioning he can control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person\u2019s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\"><em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 100-04, 96 S.Ct. 321, 325-26, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The evidence clearly establishes that the officers made repeated efforts to elicit a waiver after Medley said he understood his rights and did not want to waive any of them. In addition, no evidence proved that Medley initiated contact, communication, or exchange with Sergeant Clark or Trooper Hawkins. Special Agent Wendell brought Sergeant Clark to question Medley even after Medley said he would not waive his rights. Trooper Hawkins testified that he initiated his exchange with Medley after Special Agent Wendell said Medley \u201cdidn\u2019t give a statement.\u201d Indeed, all of the officers testified that Medley communicated to them that he did not wish to waive his rights. Each officer who questioned him within that half-hour period also knew Medley previously had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thus, the record clearly established that Medley\u2019s right to not be further questioned was not \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 326. This pattern of repeating <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Medley and then questioning him about his intent represents a \u201ccontinuation of custodial interrogation after a momentary cessation,\u201d which the Supreme Court has recognized as conduct that \u201cwould clearly frustrate the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>by allowing repeated rounds of questioning to undermine the will of the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 102, 96 S.Ct. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Although the evidence does not prove Medley initiated the conversation with the officers, even if he had the Supreme Court has held that such an initiation does not act as a waiver. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. at 1044-45, 103 S.Ct. at 2834-35. The trial judge was in error when he assumed that it did because <em>Bradshaw </em>requires a two-pronged analysis. Once the trial judge found that Medley initiated conversation, he then was required to determine if Medley knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. There was no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Moreover, even if Medley implicitly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights by talking with police, demonstrating such an \u201cimplied waiver\u201d is a much harder standard for the Commonwealth to meet. An implied waiver requires a <em>\u201cclear and unmistakable proof </em>of the intention to waive such right, for the essence of waiver is voluntary choice.\u201d <em>Chawla, </em>255 Va. at 623, 499 S.E.2d at 833 (emphasis added). This higher standard to show an implied waiver is in keeping with the <em>Edwards </em>prophylactic function: to keep police from badgering a suspect once he has invoked his rights. As the United States Supreme Court has emphasized, once an accused has \u201c \u2018expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the authorities\u2019 insistence to make a statement without counsel\u2019s presence may properly be viewed with skepticism.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 681, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2098, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988) (quoting <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 110, n. 2, 96 S.Ct. at 329, n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Finding a confession inadmissible, the Supreme Court recently reiterated the explanation it gave in <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cthat the \u201cvoluntariness doctrine ... encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from making a free and rational choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 2607, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 464-65, 86 S.Ct. at 1622-23). The Court noted that \u201cit would be absurd to think that mere recitation of the [warning] litany suffices to satisfy <em>Miranda </em>in every conceivable circumstance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2610, and the Court warned against approving a \u201cpolice strategy adapted to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2612. As the Court noted in <em>Seibert, </em>some officers are now trained \u201cto continue questioning after the suspect invokes his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2609 n. 2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">This training is reflected in the reported cases involving deliberate questioning after invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See, e.g., California Attorneys for Criminal Justice v. Butts, </em>195 F.3d 1039, 1042-1044 (C.A.9 2000); <em>Henry v. Kernan, </em>197 F.3d 1021, 1026 (C.A.9 1999); <em>People v. Neal, </em>31 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>63, 68, 1 Cal.Rptr.3d 650, 72 P.3d 280, 282 (2003); <em>People v. Peevy, </em>17 Cal.4th 1184, 1189, 73 Cal.Rptr.2d 865, 953 P.2d 1212, 1215 (1998). Scholars have noted the growing trend of such practices. <em>See, e.g., </em>Leo, Questioning the Relevance of <em>Miranda </em>in the Twenty-First Century, 99 Mich. L.Rev. 1000, 1010 (2001); Weisselberg, In the Stationhouse After <em>Dickerson, </em>99 Mich. L. Rev. 1121, 1123-1154 (2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">This case presents just another example of an interrogation strategy designed to undermine <em>Miranda. </em>Simply put, the officers in this case sought by their repeated approaches to undermine Medley\u2019s resolve not to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights after he declared that \u201che wanted all of his rights.\u201d Within less than a half hour, three officers \u201cpersisted in repeated efforts to wear down [Medley\u2019s] resistance and make him change his mind.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 105-06, 96 S.Ct. at 327. In view of Medley\u2019s express intention to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege, the statement taken from him after officers questioned him on four occasions within a half hour \u201ccannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474, 86 S.Ct. at 1628. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning in <em>Miranda </em>\u201cthat \u2018illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing ... by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure,\u2019 \u201d 384 U.S. at 459, 86 S.Ct. at 1620 (quoting <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886)), I would hold that the persistent questioning on four occasions within a half hour by officers who read <em>Miranda </em>rights to Medley on at least three of those occasions demonstrated that Medley\u2019s refusal to waive his rights was not \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress Medley\u2019s statements and I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
