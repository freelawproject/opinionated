He contends he is innocent of rape, of which he was convicted in the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach on June 8,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">According to Joshua, the evidence proving his innocence is a certificate of analysis, dated June 5, 1998, stating that \u201cleft and right neck swabs\u201d taken from the victim \u201cmay be suitable for DNA analysis.\u201d Joshua contends he learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>on December 20, 2002, during proceedings pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.1 to have the swabs tested, the swabs had been destroyed in December of 1999. Joshua asserts DNA testing of the now nonexistent swabs would prove his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">To be entitled to a writ of actual innocence pursuant to Chapter 19.3 of Title 19.2, the petitioner must assert the existence of evidence, previously unknown or unavailable to him, that proves \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A). \u201cEvidence is \u2018[sjomething (including testimony, documents and tangible objects) that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged <em>fact____In re Rhodes, </em>44 Va.App. 14, 15, 602 S.E.2d 408, 409 (2004) (citation omitted). Joshua\u2019s discovery of the destruction of the untested swabs does not constitute evidence proving his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Moreover, Joshua\u2019s claim for relief involves only the unavailability of DNA testing for physical evidence taken from the victim. \u201cHuman biological evidence may not be used as the sole basis for seeking relief\u2019 under Chapter 19.3 of Title 19.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Accordingly, Joshua is not entitled to the writ and his petition is summarily dismissed.
