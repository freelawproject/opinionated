The cocaine was found when appellant was searched while in jail for a trespassing offense. On appeal, appellant contends this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Hicks v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 49, 548 S.E.2d 249 (2001) <em>(en banc), aff'd in part and vacated in part, </em>264 Va. 48, 563 S.E.2d 674 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>539 U.S. 113, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003), although later rejected by the United States Supreme Court, was binding at the time of his arrest for trespassing on Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA) property. Thus, he contends, his arrest was unconstitutional and tainted the discovery of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>cocaine because, if not for the unconstitutional arrest, the cocaine would not have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We hold appellant\u2019s arrest for trespassing after having been forbidden to do so was neither unconstitutional nor illegal under the facts of this case. The United States Supreme Court ultimately reversed the determination that the RRHA policy was unconstitutional, and that reversal applied retroactively to validate appellant\u2019s arrest. Thus, the discovery of cocaine pursuant to that arrest was not tainted by any illegality, and the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">At a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the challenged action did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989). On appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as reasonable suspicion and probable cause to the particular facts of the case. <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">THE VARIOUS APPELLATE DECISIONS IN <em>HICKS</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfK\"><em>Hicks </em>involved a defendant who was arrested for trespassing on the streets of Whitcomb Court, \u201ca housing development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>in the City of Richmond for low income residents.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>264 Va. at 51, 563 S.E.2d at 676. Whitcomb Court was owned and operated by the RRHA, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. <em>Id. </em>In what the Virginia Supreme Court described as \u201can effort to eradicate illegal drug activity in Whitcomb Court,\u201d the Richmond City Council \u201cenacted an ordinance that \u2018closed [the streets of Whitcomb Court] to public use and travel and abandoned [them] as streets of the City of Richmond.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>RRHA, \u201cin its capacity as owner of the private streets\u201d in Whitcomb Court, authorized Richmond police officers to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cserve notice, either orally or in writing to any person who is found on [RRHA] property when such person is not a resident, employee, or such person cannot demonstrate a legitimate business or social purpose for being on the premises. Such notice shall forbid the person from returning to the property. Finally, [RRHA] authorizes Richmond Police Department officers to arrest any person for trespassing after such person, having been duly notified, either stays upon or returns to [RRHA] property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 52, 563 S.E.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On April 14, 1998, defendant Hicks received written notice that he was \u201cnot to trespass\u201d at Whitcomb Court or any other RRHA property and that he would be \u201csubject to arrest\u201d if \u201cseen or caught on the premises\u201d in the future. <em>Id. </em>On January 20, 1999, Hicks was again seen at Whitcomb Court and was issued a summons for trespassing. <em>Id. </em>Hicks was convicted for that offense and noted his appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">By <em>en banc </em>decision issued July 3, 2001, we held that RRHA\u2019s \u201cprivatization effort unconstitutionally infringe[d] upon a citizen\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to lawfully be present in a public place.\u201d 36 Va.App. at 63, 548 S.E.2d at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">By decision issued June 7, 2002, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed in part, holding the RRHA \u201ctrespass policy [was unconstitutionally] overbroad\u201d and that Hicks had standing to \u201cassert this issue in this criminal prosecution.\u201d 264 Va. at 60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>563 S.E.2d at 681. It vacated the portion of our opinion concluding that the RRHA\u2019s private streets were a public forum and \u201creserve[d] consideration of this issue for another day.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">By decision rendered June 16, 2003, the United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded, concluding Hicks failed to show that the RRHA policy, \u201ctaken as a whole,\u201d was \u201csubstantially overbroad judged in relation to its plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d 539 U.S. at 122, 123 S.Ct. at 2198.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">On remand, the Virginia Supreme Court rejected Hicks\u2019s additional claim that RRHA\u2019s trespassing policy was unconstitutionally vague. <em>Commonwealth v. Hicks, </em>267 Va. 573, 596 S.E.2d 74 (2004). It noted that, based on Hicks\u2019s receipt of RRHA\u2019s barment letter and his prior conviction for two other charges of trespassing on RRHA property in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119, RRHA\u2019s \u201ctrespass policy could not have been any clearer\u201d \u201cas to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 596 S.E.2d at 78. Thus, the policy at issue in <em>Hicks </em>remains constitutional to the extent it was challenged therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">IMPACT OF THIS COURT\u2019S DECISION IN <em>HICKS </em>ON APPELLANT\u2019S ARREST</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Appellant contends that, despite the ultimate outcome of Hicks\u2019s appeal, the officer who arrested him in May 2002 was bound by this Court\u2019s <em>en banc </em>declaration in <em>Hicks </em>that the RRHA trespassing policy was unconstitutional \u2014 which declaration was rendered on July 3, 2001, over nine months before appellant\u2019s arrest for trespassing, and not overturned until June 16, 2003, over a year after appellant\u2019s arrest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u201cAs a rule, judicial decisions apply \u2018retroactively.\u2019 \u201d <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 642, 104 S.Ct. 1338, 1341, 79 L.Ed.2d 579 (1984). When a decision of the United States Supreme Court \u201c[does] nothing more than apply settled precedent to different factual situations\u201d or concludes \u201cthat a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>court lacked authority to convict a criminal defendant in the first place,\u201d the ruling applies \u201c \u2018retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 324 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 713-14 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 562, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 2594, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982)). Even where a decision announces a \u201cnew rule\u201d of law, that decision \u201capplies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review\u201d in state and federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 107 S.Ct. at 716. \u201cAs to convictions that are already final, ... [new] <em>substantive </em>rules generally apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522-23, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). Only \u201c[n]ew rules of <em>procedure ... </em>generally do not apply retroactively\u201d to cases no longer pending in state or federal court. <em>Id. </em>at-, 124 S.Ct. at 2523 (discussing \u201cextremely narrow\u201d class of cases in which procedural rules may be challenged retroactively on collateral review) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">As discussed above, the United States Supreme Court ultimately reversed the determination by the Commonwealth\u2019s appellate courts that the RRHA trespassing policy was unconstitutional. <em>See Hicks, </em>539 U.S. at 122, 123 S.Ct. at 2198. Settled legal principles provide that the United States Constitution, not a state court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of it, is controlling. <em>See, e.g., Herrera v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 490, 494, 483 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1997) (in context of determining whether to apply retroactively a \u201cnew rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions,\u201d adopting \u201c\u2018Blackstonian view[ ] that judges ... find the law1 ***5 \u201d rather than \u201c \u2018make the law5 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018[\u00bfjudicial declaration of law is merely a statement of what the law has always been\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cash v. Califano, </em>621 F.2d 626, 628 (4th Cir.1980))). Here, the United States Supreme Court, as the final arbiter of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Constitution, held on June 16, 2003, that the RRHA policy at issue in <em>Hicks </em>was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Because appellant\u2019s case was still pending in the trial court at that time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the policy is controlling, regardless of whether the Court rendered its decision before or after appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied this principle in an analogous context in <em>United States v. Estrada, </em>733 F.2d 683 (1984). There, the defendant disputed the admissibility of items found pursuant to a search warrant issued based on information from a confidential informant. <em>Id. </em>at 684. Until 1983, a review of the sufficiency of a search warrant affidavit that relied on a confidential informant was judged under the \u201crigid\u201d \u201ctwo-pronged [Aguilar-Spinelli] test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1983, however, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), that the sufficiency of such an affidavit \u201cdepends [instead] on the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estrada, </em>733 F.2d at 684 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332). As a result, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gates </em>limited or narrowed application of the exclusionary rule in this context by adopting a rule that upheld the sufficiency of a greater number of search warrants. <em>Id. </em>at 684-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In giving what it termed \u201cretroactiv[e]\u201d application to <em>Gates, </em>the Court of Appeals reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">We have never denied retroactive application to a new decision that <em>limits </em>the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule. We have held, for example, that the warrantless automobile container search rule[, which permits police with a legal basis for searching a car to open and search any closed containers found therein,] announced in <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982), applies retroactively. <em>United States v. Johns, </em>707 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>These cases indicate that decisions limiting the exclusionary rule are fully retroactive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">No other result makes sense. The purpose of refusing to apply retroactively a new decision enforcing the exclusionary rule is to avoid penalizing police conduct when the police reasonably relied on existing judicial precedent. When a court determines that a particular police practice does <em>not </em>violate the Constitution, there is no reason not to apply that decision retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em>Johns, </em>707 F.2d at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">A participant in illegal activities cannot legitimately expect to order his affairs in reliance on prior judicial interpretations of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Similarly, the administration of justice is benefited by giving retroactive application to a new decision limiting the exclusionary rule. The costs of that rule are justified by its deterrent effect on illegal police conduct. When a subsequent decision holds the police conduct is reasonable, the rationale for exclusion disappears. <em>Johns, </em>707 F.2d at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>Estrada, </em>733 F.2d at 685 (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 514 A.2d 337, 339-41 (1986) (discussing retroactivity principles and application in context of <em>Gates </em>and noting, as court in <em>Estrada </em>did, that \u201cit cannot be argued that the defendant ordered his conduct in justifiable reliance on [the prior] decision [at issue]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">In appellant\u2019s case, like in <em>Estrada, </em>the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hicks </em>upholding the RRHA trespass policy amounted to a limitation on the exclusionary rule \u2014 because an arrest for trespassing under the RRHA policy was constitutional, the exclusionary rule did not apply. Here, like in <em>Estrada, </em>giving retroactive effect to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hicks </em>is proper. Thus, the existence of a warrant charging appellant with trespassing after having been warned not to do so provided a valid basis for his custodial arrest and supports the admission of the cocaine found in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>search of appellant following that valid arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We hold appellant\u2019s arrest for trespassing after having been forbidden to do so was neither unconstitutional nor illegal under the facts of this case. The United States Supreme Court ultimately reversed the determination that the RRHA policy was unconstitutional, and that reversal applied retroactively to validate appellant\u2019s arrest. Thus, the discovery of cocaine pursuant to that arrest was not tainted by any illegality, and the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was not error. For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\">. The Court described a \"final\u201d conviction as one \"in which a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708, 712 n. 6, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">.
