On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously (1) denied his pretrial motion for a continuance; (2) granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to preclude him from offering evidence relevant to an insanity defense; and (3) denied his post-trial motion for a mental evaluation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold the trial court\u2019s exclusion of all evidence related to appellant\u2019s sanity was error, and we reverse and remand for a new trial without reaching appellant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">On March 29, 2002, appellant stabbed and killed Mark Hulo and fled the scene of the murder. On the afternoon of March 30, State Trooper K.W. Spencer spotted appellant walking backwards on Interstate 95. Appellant was wearing a white for coat, no shirt, red tights, and yellow shorts. Believing appellant might be the perpetrator in Hulo\u2019s murder, Trooper Spencer called for backup and took appellant into custody. While Trooper Spencer was attempting to subdue appellant, appellant hit him \u201cseveral times in the chest and face area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Appellant was arrested for the instant offenses and taken to the Southside Regional Jail. His court-appointed attorney moved for a psychiatric evaluation to determine both whether he was sane at the time of the offense and whether he was competent to assist in his own defense. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>appointed William D. Brock, a licensed clinical psychologist, to evaluate appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Dr. Brock indicated appellant reported \u201crather heavy abuse of cocaine, alcohol, and marijuana, as well as occasional use of crack cocaine.\u201d Dr. Brock concluded appellant \u201c[met] the minimum criteria to be considered competent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On the issue of appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense, Dr. Brock opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\"><em>By all indications, [appellant] was, indeed, experiencing symptoms of a psychosis at the time of the offenses for which he currently stands charged. </em>He was diagnosed and briefly treated for such symptoms [while living in Louisiana] several months prior [to] the offense and apparently, against medical advice, discontinued the antipsychotic medication. Without benefit of the Haldol which had been prescribed, [appellant] also returned to using large amounts of cocaine, a substance that appears likely to have been the cause of his psychotic symptoms to begin with and which likely exacerbated his symptoms....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\"><em>While the evidence would suggest that [appellant] seems to meet the threshold criteria for an insanity defense, several factors are contraindicative of a viable insanity defense. </em>First, [appellant\u2019s] psychotic symptoms appear to have either been the result of or ... exacerbated by (most likely the former), his voluntary and excessive use of cocaine. An altered mental status resultant from voluntary ingestion of illegal substances does not qualify as grounds for an insanity defense. Second, while most likely psychotic at the time of the offense, [appellant] made significant efforts to not be identified or get caught.... All these efforts indicate that [appellant], despite his psychotic symptoms, knew that his actions were wrong and punishable under the law. Thus, while experiencing a probable drug-induced psychosis at the time of the offense, his understanding of right and wrong was not diminished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">Given these conclusions, it is the opinion of this examiner that while there may be some basis for mitigation at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>time of sentencing based on mental health issues, there is not a significant case for raising an insanity defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">(Emphasis added). Appellant subsequently asserted his intent to argue he was insane when he committed the charged crimes, and the Commonwealth filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On the date scheduled for trial, appellant moved for a continuance, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been unable timely to consult with a \u201cDr. Skinner,\u201d a mental health professional about whom appellant had told his attorney. Appellant\u2019s attorney made contact with Joseph Skinner, a licensed clinical social worker (L.C.S.W.), at the end of the previous day. He confirmed that Joseph Skinner had seen appellant on multiple occasions. He also obtained \u201cthe notes from the jail where [Joseph Skinner] discuss[es] [appellant\u2019s] mental problems.\u201d Those notes were marked filed by the court during the argument on the continuance motion. The notes documented Skinner\u2019s treatment of appellant, the efforts of other medical personnel to adjust appellant\u2019s medication, and appellant\u2019s efforts to cope with his mental disorder. They also documented Skinner\u2019s conclusion that appellant \u201chas a religious preoccupation [with] visual and auditory hallucinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">After appellant\u2019s counsel introduced Skinner\u2019s notes into evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel made apparently conflicting statements about the substance of Skinner\u2019s expected testimony. According to the transcript of the motion hearing, counsel stated first that Skinner \u201cadvised me that his opinion of my client\u2019s mental ability was <em>entirely of that of </em>[sic] the expert who had been appointed in this ease[, Dr. Brock].\u201d (Emphasis added). However, on the same page of the transcript, counsel argued, \u201cI now have a social worker who is <em>differing severely </em>from Dr. Brock\u2019s evaluation. And I would ask for a continuance to be able to investigate the matter further.\u201d (Emphasis added). Counsel subsequently argued about \u201cthe <em>absolute divergence </em>of the two opinions\u201d of Dr. Brock and Mr. Skinner. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Appellant said that, under the Virginia Code, Skinner, as a licensed clinical social worker, was not authorized \u201cto render expert opinion on legal [inaudible] under the Virginia Code.\u201d However, he proffered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">[Mr.] Skinner advised me that he could render a professional opinion, and I did fax him a copy of the rules, that his opinion would be that at the time of the incident [appellant] believed that God\u2019s law superseded man\u2019s law, and therefore what he did was not wrong. And, that would be his testimony if he was allowed to give an opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The trial court said, \u201cBut, you have no established authority that would permit him to testify to an opinion regarding [appellant\u2019s] sanity at the time of the offense.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">That\u2019s correct. However, it would seem that considering the amount of time that Dr. Brock spent with [appellant], which was fairly short compared to the time [Mr.] Skinner spent with [appellant] which was fairly extensive, that it would be a situation where the absolute divergence of the two opinions would be a situation where possibly another evaluation should be done in which Dr. Brock would be given [Mr.] Skinner\u2019s notes. Or, maybe another person entirely appointed to do a second evaluation based upon this evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s continuance motion and proceeded to consider the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to preclude appellant from presenting an insanity defense. Appellant proffered the testimony of various lay witnesses who would give factual testimony about appellant\u2019s mental status (1) before he left Louisiana for Virginia, where he committed the instant offenses, and (2) after he was incarcerated in Virginia for those offenses. Appellant\u2019s former roommate in Louisiana, Troy Whidbee, was prepared to testify that before appellant left for Virginia, he said he believed \u201cGod needed soldiers\u201d and that \u201csomeone was out to get him.\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother, who also lived in Louisiana, was prepared to testify that, prior to appellant\u2019s arrival in Virginia, he had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>two traffic citations for driving at a high rate of speed with his lights off. She was also prepared to testify that appellant reported \u201chearing voices,\u201d both before he came to Virginia and after he was incarcerated, and that he said he believed \u201cGod and the devil were fighting over his soul.\u201d Correctional Officer Arithea Hicks was prepared to testify, and in fact did so at sentencing, that appellant began to tell her \u201ca few times a week,\u201d \u201cearly on in his incarceration,\u201d that he was hearing voices. Hicks said appellant \u201cwould stop [complaining about the voices] for awhile and not need any help and then it would start again.\u201d Appellant made similar reports to at least one other correctional officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Appellant argued that Skinner\u2019s testimony would include appellant\u2019s reports</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">that he had been hearing the voices of what he believed to be God, both before and after the incident and at times when he was not taking drugs. And, obviously he had not been taking [illegal] drugs while he was at the jail. That [Skinner] believed [appellant] had a type of psychosis that was a religious obsession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel also argued Dr. Brock\u2019s opinion supported his position to the extent Dr. Brock opined appellant was in fact suffering from psychosis, although he opined it was induced by appellant\u2019s voluntary ingestion of legal and illegal drugs and, thus, did not qualify as legal insanity. Counsel argued further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">I believe here, Your Honor, because of that [aspect of Dr. Brock\u2019s opinion,] if the defense can produce evidence that shows that [appellant] was having the same symptoms, that he was having directly prior to the incident, that [he] was hearing voices and indeed he was having those symptoms while he was not under the influence of drugs, i.e. prior to the event being testified to by his family members, more importantly after the event when he was incarcerated without having access to drugs, both by the guards and more importantly by Dr. Skinner.... Obviously, Dr. Skinner, as the court has ruled[,] is not qualified to give an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>opinion. However, I don\u2019t think I would characterize him as a true lay witness either. Obviously, someone off the street is not exactly the same as a doctor who is well versed in mental problems and diagnosis of [Axis] T and that type of thing. Dr. Skinner is simply someone who has not been trained for forensic evaluations. He doesn\u2019t make the decisions of insanity. But, ... he is talking to [appellant] ... [a]nd I think that significantly distinguishes this case from the <em>[McCullough </em>] case in which those kinds of facts were not present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">... [Considering that ... the defense of insanity ... is an essential key issue in this case and we\u2019re trying a man for first degree murder and it would seem that to preclude even the admission of the evidence, to preclude that from the jury instructions severely prejudices [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Commonwealth argued that the only expert testimony was Dr. Brock\u2019s opinion that appellant was legally sane at the time of the offenses and that the lay witness testimony was of only marginal relevance because it did not involve appellant\u2019s mental status at the time of the offense. It also argued that appellant\u2019s claim that his behavior before he came to Virginia indicated he suffered from psychosis even when he was not ingesting illegal drugs was flawed because appellant told Dr. Brock he had been ingesting cocaine and various other drugs regularly for at least 30 days prior to the instant offense. As a result, it argued, appellant presented insufficient evidence to \u201cjump over the hurdle of the voluntary intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling \u201cthat the introduction of the proffered testimony would not rise to the level of that which would warrant admissibility on the issue of insanity at the time of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Appellant then entered guilty pleas conditioned on his right to appeal the court\u2019s rulings on various pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">At appellant\u2019s sentencing, Skinner testified that appellant, who was 28 at the time of his arrest, reported he was \u201cprobably\u201d in his \u201cearly twenties or late teens\u201d \u201cwhen he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>started to hear the voices and to feel different.\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother testified he began behaving strangely \u201caround the last part of '98,\u201d when he was 24 years old. The trial court noted appellant\u2019s statement in the presentence report that he did not start using cocaine until 2000 or 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Correctional Officer David Allen testified that on May 19, 2003, when appellant had been in custody for seven weeks, he removed his clothing except for his tennis shoes and refused requests to clothe himself. He destroyed the television and cable box, \u201cwrapped his arms,\u201d and \u201carmed himself with shards of glass from the t.v.\u201d He damaged the doors and walls and threatened the staff before medical personnel arrived to \u201ctalk to him.\u201d Other evidence established that appellant reported visual and auditory hallucinations during this period of time and that he was subsequently hospitalized and medicated, after which he reported an improvement in his psychiatric symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The court subsequently sentenced appellant to five years for the assault and battery of a law enforcement officer and life for the murder conviction. Appellant then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE OF INSANITY IN GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Appellant contends the trial court erroneously granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to preclude him from offering evidence relevant to an insanity defense. Upon review of the proffered evidence, we agree that exclusion of evidence of appellant\u2019s sanity was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">\u201c[IJnsanity is an affirmative defense that the defendant must establish\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Shifflett v.

Under this rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cit must be clearly proven that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring [sic] under such a defect of reason, from <em>disease of the mind, </em>as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\"><em>Price, </em>228 Va. at 457-58, 323 S.E.2d at 109 (quoting <em>M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, </em>10 Cl. &amp; F. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718, 722-23 (1843) (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court of Virginia has explained the application of both facets of the test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKF\">\u201cThe first portion of M\u2019Naghten relates to an accused who is psychotic to an extreme degree. It assumes an accused who, because of mental disease, did not know the nature and quality of his act; he simply did not know what he was doing. For example, in crushing the skull of a human being with an iron bar, he believed that he was smashing a glass jar. The latter portion of M\u2019Naghten relates to an accused who knew the nature and quality of his act. He knew what he was doing; he knew that he was crushing the skull of a human being with an iron bar. However, because of mental disease, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.

Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 573, 351 S.E.2d 919, 925 (1987)) (holding lay witness could not describe defendant\u2019s actions as \u201cparanoid\u201d because such a description might suggest to the jury that defendant had been diagnosed as \u201cparanoid\u201d). Thus, \u201c[a]lthough sanity or insanity may be established by lay witnesses, it is generally recognized that it is advisable to adduce expert testimony to better resolve such a complex problem.\u201d <em>Shifflett, </em>221 Va. at 769, 274 S.E.2d at 311. Applying these principles in <em>McCulloch v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 769, 514 S.E.2d 797 (1999), we upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of lay testimony \u2014 \u201ctestimony of lay witnesses who observed [McCulloch\u2019s] behavior, demeanor, and actions\u201d \u2014 on the issue of sanity because <em>\u201cno medical evidence </em>supporting an insanity defense was introduced, and the lay testimony defendant proffered was insufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for an insanity defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775, 514 S.E.2d at 800 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, appellant conceded that Joseph Skinner \u2014 a licensed clinical social worker \u2014 lacked \u201ctrain[ing] for forensic evaluations,\u201d \u201cdoesn\u2019t make the decisions of insanity,\u201d and thus, could not offer an opinion as to whether appellant was legally insane at the time of the instant offenses. However, counsel noted the opinion of Dr. William Brock \u2014 the licensed clinical psychologist appointed by the court expressly for the purpose of evaluating, <em>inter alia, </em>appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense \u2014 that appellant \u201cseems to meet the threshold criteria for an insanity defense\u201d because he was \u201cmost likely psychotic\u201d at the time of the killing. Although Dr. Brock opined that the psychosis \u201cmost likely\u201d resulted from \u201c[appellant\u2019s] voluntary excessive use of cocaine,\u201d which would not have supported an insanity defense, <em>see, e.g., Herbin, </em>28 Va.App. at 184, 503 S.E.2d at 231 (holding temporary mental defect caused by voluntary ingestion of drugs, whether or not pursuant to an addiction, is insufficient to establish insanity but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>long-term and severe drug abuse may cause mental defect or disease that can serve as basis for insanity defense), Dr. Brock conceded that appellant\u2019s cocaine ingestion could merely have exacerbated an underlying mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Appellant argued that Skinner, although not an expert on the issue of sanity, nevertheless had significant training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders and, thus, would testify as more than a mere lay witness. Appellant had provided Skinner with \u201ca copy of the rules,\u201d and Skinner indicated, based on his review of the rules, that he could provide a \u201cprofessional opinion.\u201d Appellant had reported to Skinner \u201cthat he had been hearing the voices of what he believed to be God, both before and after the incident and at times when he was not taking drugs.\u201d Skinner \u201cbelieved [appellant] had a type of psychosis that was a religious obsession\u201d and that \u201cat the time of the incident [appellant] believed that God\u2019s law superseded man\u2019s law, and therefore [that] what he did was not wrong.\u201d The court had before it notes of Skinner\u2019s treatment of appellant at the jail from April through November 2002. Those notes detailed appellant\u2019s repeated reports of hearing voices, including the voices of God and the devil, and supported counsel\u2019s proffer regarding Skinner\u2019s expected testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The trial court concluded that Skinner\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s mental condition \u201cwould not rise to the level of that which would warrant admissibility on the issue of insanity at the time of the offense,\u201d holding in essence that the testimony would not be relevant because he could not render an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>on the issue of sanity. Appellant conceded in the trial court that Skinner was not qualified to render an opinion on the issue of sanity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude the trial court did not err in preventing Skinner from testifying to his opinion that appellant was legally insane or did not know the difference between right and wrong when he committed the charged offenses. Nevertheless, we hold the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the remainder of Skinner\u2019s proffered testimony, along \"with the additional proffered lay testimony, to the extent such testimony could have established a non-drug-induced cause of appellant\u2019s psychosis, and other relevant evidence bearing on the issue of appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 governs the appointment of a qualified mental health expert or experts to evaluate the sanity of a defendant who establishes \u201cprobable cause to believe that the defendant\u2019s sanity will be a significant factor in his defense and that the defendant is financially unable to pay for expert assistance.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A). That code section provides that any expert so appointed \u201cshall be (a) a psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, or an individual with a doctorate degree in clinical psychology who has successfully completed [certain approved] forensic evaluation training ... and (ii)[is] qualified by specialized training and experience to perform forensic evaluations.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1 (governing appointment of mental health expert for defendant \u201ccharged with or convicted of capital murder,\u201d containing same requirements for appointment as Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5). A defendant who \u201cintends (i) to put in issue his sanity at the time of the crime charged and (ii) to present testimony of an expert to support his claim on this issue at trial ... shall give notice in writing to the attorney for the Commonwealth.... \u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-168. The Supreme Court has held that where an accused gives notice of such intent, the trial court \u201cha[s] the inherent power to require [the accused] to be examined [on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Commonwealth] ... in order that his examiners might report their opinions as to his sanity at the time of his alleged crimes and <em>testify </em>to such opinion [before the jury] if called by the Commonwealth as rebuttal witnesses.\u201d <em>Shifflett, </em>221 Va. at 769, 274 S.E.2d at 311 (emphasis added).

Scala, </em>128 Misc.2d 831, 491 N.Y.S.2d 555, 562-63 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1985) (upholding admissibility, in cases involving insanity defense, of <em>relevant </em>testimony from neurologists and other \u201cnonpsychiatric physicians\u201d as well as <em>\u201cproperly qualified licensed </em>nonphysician mental health professionals\u201d such as <em>licensed </em>clinical social workers (emphasis added)). Here, assuming Skinner\u2019s testimony would have been insufficient on its own to prove insanity, when coupled with Dr. Brock\u2019s testimony and the additional lay testimony, it would have allowed appellant to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Dr. Brock opined that, \u201c[b]y all indications, [appellant] was, indeed, experiencing symptoms of a psychosis at the time of the offenses\u201d and was \u201cmost likely psychotic\u201d at that time. As a result, Dr. Brock wrote \u201cthat [appellant] seems to meet the threshold criteria for an insanity defense.\u201d Dr. Brock concluded appellant\u2019s psychosis resulted from the voluntary ingestion of illegal drugs, which he said would have disqualified appellant from asserting an insanity defense, but he conceded appellant\u2019s cocaine ingestion could merely have exacerbated an underlying mental disorder. Appellant was entitled to offer evidence that his psychosis resulted from an underlying mental disorder rather than his voluntary ingestion of illegal drugs. Such evidence was highly relevant and, if believed by the fact finder, would have permitted the fact finder to reject the conflicting portion of Dr. Brock\u2019s opinion and to reach an independent conclusion on the ultimate issue of appellant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant attempted to offer such testimony through Mr. Skinner. While Skinner was not able, based on appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>concession, to testify as to the ultimate issue of insanity, his proffered testimony provided a basis to disregard Dr. Brock\u2019s legal conclusion that appellant\u2019s voluntary drug use precluded an insanity defense. Evidence admitted at the sentencing hearing confirmed that Skinner had both training as a licensed clinical social worker and experience as the director of an outpatient mental health services organization for a period of twenty-five years. Skinner met appellant within two weeks of the instant offenses and counseled him in jail on a regular basis for the six months preceding the date scheduled for trial; the notes from those counseling sessions were admitted into evidence and were available to the court when it made its ruling. Skinner could not testify, based on appellant\u2019s concession, that appellant was insane when he committed the offense or that he did not know the difference between right and wrong at that time. However, Skinner should have been permitted to testify about any relevant symptoms that he observed and that appellant reported while Skinner was treating appellant during his incarceration, including appellant\u2019s ongoing reports that he heard the voices of God and others, as well as other issues within Skinner\u2019s area of competence not touching on the ultimate issue of sanity. Other proffered evidence, including the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother, would have supported a finding that appellant began hearing voices before he became a heavy user of cocaine. This evidence, taken as a whole, if believed by the trier of fact, would have negated Dr. Brock\u2019s opinion that appellant\u2019s psychosis did not qualify him for an insanity defense because it resulted from the voluntary ingestion of illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Because appellant proffered relevant evidence that, if believed by the trier of fact, would have permitted the fact finder to infer he was legally insane at the time of killing, we hold the trial court committed reversible error in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to exclude all evidence related to appellant\u2019s mental condition and sanity at the time of the offense. Despite Skinner\u2019s inability to testify that appellant was \u201cinsane\u201d or believed \u201cwhat he did was not wrong,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>testimony outlined above was highly probative of the issue of appellant\u2019s sanity, and its exclusion was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE AND POST-TRIAL MOTION FOR DETERMINATION OF SANITY</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance and for a post-trial determination of sanity. Because we reverse and remand based on the trial court\u2019s erroneous exclusion of evidence pertaining to appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense, we do not reach these other issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court\u2019s exclusion of all evidence related to appellant\u2019s sanity was error, and we reverse and remand for a new trial without reaching appellant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\">. In granting appellant\u2019s petition for appeal on these issues, we also directed the parties to address \"the impact on appeal\u201d of appellant\u2019s entry, with the trial court\u2019s and the Commonwealth\u2019s consent, of a conditional plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>under Code \u00a7 19.2-254. The Commonwealth adheres to the position it took at trial that a proper interpretation of the guilty plea statute permits entry of a conditional plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>We hold that this concession has become the law of the case, binding on appeal, and that we need not consider this issue on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. We note that what may be relevant to a trial court's threshold determination of whether an accused is entitled to present an insanity defense may be different from what will be admissible at trial to prove or disprove that defense. <em>Cf. Pritchett v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 182, 187, 557 S.E.2d 205, 208 (2002) (holding error to exclude proffered expert testimony that defendant was mentally retarded and that his mental retardation rendered him susceptible to suggestive police interrogation resulting in confession \u201cso long as the expert does not opine on the truth of the statement at issue\" because \"such testimony [would] improperly invade[ ] the province of the jury to determine the reliability of a witness\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">. We assume without deciding, for purposes of this appeal only, that his concession was an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-5\">. Generally, neither lay nor expert witnesses are permitted to give testimony on an ultimate issue in a criminal case because allowing such testimony would \"invade the province of the jury.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Strawderman v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 855, 859-60, 108 S.E.2d 376, 379-80 (1959); <em>see also </em>1993 Va. Acts, ch. 909 (codified at \u00a7 8.01-401.3 (partially abrogating rule in civil cases, as to testimony about purely factual rather than legal matters, and leaving intact \"the exceptions to the 'ultimate fact in issue\u2019 rule recognized in the Commonwealth prior to enactment of this section\u201d)). However, as discussed in the text, the Supreme Court has allowed expert testimony on the precise issue of whether a defendant was \"legally sane\u201d or \"legally insane\u201d at the time of the charged offense. <em>See Shifflett, </em>221 Va. at 769, 274 S.E.2d at 311. Commentator Charles Friend has observed that \"opinion [testimony] has been received on questions of, <em>inter alia, </em>mental condition, ... based upon the practical difficulty of conveying such information to the jury in any other form.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 17-3(a), at 643 (6th ed.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b489-11\">BUMGARDNER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AoC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">I dissent because I conclude the trial court did not err in granting the motion <em>in limine </em>that excluded the proffered evidence of insanity. The trial court limited the exclusion to the guilt phase, and the defendant did present the evidence at the sentencing phase. The evidence that the defendant proffered did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>defense of insanity. Had the defendant pled not guilty and proceeded to trial on this evidence, he would not have been entitled to instructions on the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">The defendant proffered the opinion of his expert, Dr. William D. Brock, that the defendant did not meet the criteria necessary for an insanity defense. The Commonwealth and the defense agreed that was his opinion. The defendant proffered testimony from a licensed clinical social worker, Joseph W. Skinner. The defendant conceded at trial and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>appeal that Skinner was not an expert qualified to give an opinion about legal insanity in a criminal case. The defendant proffered other lay testimony about the defendant\u2019s conduct before and after the killing. Skinner and the other lay witnesses testified the defendant said he heard God speaking to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>McCulloch v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 769, 514 S.E.2d 797 (1999), the defendant\u2019s expert evidence showed the defendant was sane. That evidence was not offered, but the defendant sought to prove insanity through lay testimony about observed behavior, demeanor, and actions. This Court upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the lay testimony because it was insufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for insanity. <em>Id. </em>at 775, 514 S.E.2d at 800. The facts of that case are similar to those in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In this ease, the expert evidence concluded the defendant was sane. The lay testimony recited observed incidents of bizarre behavior and conduct. That testimony, on its own, was insufficient to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of insanity. As in <em>McCulloch, </em>it did not establish a mental disease or defect. The defendant did not change the result by offering the expert\u2019s opinion in this case. Lay testimony might refute the factual basis of the expert\u2019s opinion that the defendant was not insane, but that lay testimony still did not prove the existence of a mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The evidence in this case failed to raise an issue of insanity. The only witness qualified to state an opinion concluded the defendant did not meet the criteria for criminal insanity. The other witnesses could only recite observed behavior. \u201cWhile lay witnesses may testify to the attitude and demeanor of the defendant, \u2018lay witnesses cannot express an opinion as to the existence of a particular mental disease or condition.\u2019 <em>Mullis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 573, 351 S.E.2d 919, 925 (1987) (citing <em>Phillips v. Stewart, </em>207 Va. 214, 220, 148 S.E.2d 784, 789 (1966)).\u201d <em>Herbin v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 173, 183, 503 S.E.2d 226, 231 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>While claiming to accept the fact that Skinner was not qualified to give an opinion, the defendant elevates his testimony to that of an expert. In his brief the defendant states, \u201cJoseph Skinner, while not qualified to give a forensic opinion as to legal insanity in a criminal case, would have provided his opinion as to the rationale behind the Defendant\u2019s actions due to his belief that he was acting on orders from God.\u201d He argues that Skinner provides an opinion as to the rationale behind the defendant\u2019s action. However, Skinner\u2019s testimony was only admissible as a lay witness who could recite facts observed on issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The majority accepts the defendant\u2019s approach and permits a witness, who concedes he is not qualified to give an opinion, to do just that. If the defense is to refute its own opinion evidence from a qualified expert, the majority must treat Skinner as having the qualifications of an expert. Unless Skinner\u2019s testimony is treated as a qualified opinion, the defendant has no evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease. To overcome the insufficiency of the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence, the majority raises the licensed clinical social worker to the new status of \u201cquasi expert\u201d; in fact, it elevates his statements to the degree that they overrule the opinion of the one witness qualified to state an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The defendant maintains he would have been entitled to instructions on the insanity defense based on the evidence proffered. No qualified witness testified that the defendant labored under a defect of reason from a disease of the mind so that he did not know the nature and consequences of his act, or if he did know, that his act was wrong. <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 452, 458, 323 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1984). The only qualified testimony stated the opposite. To grant insanity instructions on the basis of the evidence proffered by the defendant would be to cast the jury onto a sea of speculation. The recital of this defendant\u2019s behavior did not provide a basis for a jury to conclude the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder or disease that caused him to be unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>distinguish right from wrong. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
