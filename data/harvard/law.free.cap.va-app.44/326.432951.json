Appellant contends that the trial court erred in compelling her to submit to the examination and evaluation without making the necessary finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H) that she was incapable of making an informed decision regarding her health. We agree and reverse that portion of the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Appellant is a fifty-one-year-old woman suffering from morbid obesity and depression. She had been disabled for some three years when she moved with her husband to Virginia. She had been bedridden for more than two years. The Buchanan County Department of Social Services (DSS) became involved with appellant in November 2002 after determining she was in need of adult protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Folio-wing a fire in the house in which appellant and her husband resided, DSS obtained an emergency court order on December 3, 2003, committing appellant involuntarily to Heritage Hall, a nursing home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 9, 2003, the trial court extended the temporary order for an additional five days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On December 15, 2003, DSS filed a Petition for Treatment and Detention pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21 seeking a court order authorizing placement of appellant in a nursing home to provide her with care and treatment. DSS asserted that appellant was incapable of making informed health care decisions because of her depression and was incapable of properly caring for herself. DSS also asserted that appellant had been uncooperative while she was a patient at Heritage Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On December 22, 2003, the trial court received evidence <em>ore terms </em>on the petition. Caroline Thompson Schleifer, a licensed professional counselor, testified as to the results of a psychosocial evaluation of appellant she conducted on December 5, 2003 at Heritage Hall. Based on her evaluation of appellant, she opined that appellant understood the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the evaluation and provided pertinent information regarding her medical history. Appellant informed Schleifer of her history of depression and of treatment she received prior to moving to Virginia. Schleifer noted that appellant expressed suicidal thoughts and feelings of \u201chelplessness and hopelessness\u201d as a result of her deteriorating health and financial circumstances. Although she testified that appellant suffered \u201cfrom depression brought on by major life stressors,\u201d Schleifer opined that appellant\u2019s depression did not impair her ability to make informed decisions concerning her health. She advised the trial court that appellant needed additional evaluation at a more comprehensive medical center; that Heritage Hall was not meeting all of appellant\u2019s medical needs; and that \u201c[appellant] may be a good candidate for going to the University of Virginia and having a complete orthopedic and diagnostic work up with regard to [her medical condition].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">After hearing the evidence, the trial court found \u201cthat despite her depression, appellant is capable of making informed health care decisions.\u201d It ordered her released to her husband\u2019s care from the nursing home, where she had been confined pursuant to the emergency protective order. Nevertheless, relying on Schleifer\u2019s recommendation of the need for further evaluation and her opinion that Heritage Hall could not meet appellant\u2019s needs, the trial court ordered appellant to undergo a comprehensive examination and evaluation to address her depression and obesity and that DSS schedule an appointment at the University of Virginia Medical Center for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in ordering her, over her objection, to undergo a comprehensive medical examination and evaluation at the University of Virginia Medical Center. She argues that because the trial court found that she was capable of making informed health care decisions, it lacked authority pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21 to order her to undergo the medical examination and evaluation. Stated differently, she contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>court failed to make the necessary finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H) to require her to undergo the examination without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In general, a mentally competent adult has the right to refuse medical treatment. <em>See Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 262, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 2843, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990) (recognizing the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of the right to refuse medical treatment) (citing <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts, </em>197 U.S. 11, 24-30, 25 S.Ct. 358, 360-63, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905) (balancing an individual\u2019s liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine against the State\u2019s interest in preventing disease)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cNo right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\"><em>United States v. Charters, </em>829 F.2d 479, 490-91 (4th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, </em>141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L.Ed. 734 (1891)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, this fundamental liberty interest must be balanced with the State\u2019s interests in protecting persons who cannot make informed health decisions, either because they are incapable of making such decisions or incapable of communicating such decisions. <em>Cruzan, </em>497 U.S. at 262, 110 S.Ct. at 2843.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In enacting Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21, \u201c[t]he General Assembly provided for involuntary medical treatment in very limited circumstances, where such treatment is determined to be in the best interests of a person <em>who is unable to give an informed consent </em>to treatment.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>39 Va.App. 728, 732, 576 S.E.2d 770, 771-72 (2003) (emphasis added). \u201cCode \u00a7 37.1-134.21 describes the procedures to be followed and the findings a court is to make prior to authorizing such treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(A) provides that the court may order [t]he provision, withholding or withdrawal of a specific treatment or course of treatment for a mental or physical disorder, if it finds upon clear and convincing evidence that (i) the person is either incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf or is incapable of communicating such a decision due to a physical or mental disorder and (ii) the proposed action is in the best interest of the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H) requires the trial court to make specific findings as to an individual\u2019s capability to make informed health decisions before it can compel medical treatment without that person\u2019s consent. Before ordering an individual to undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation, the trial court must determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">1. That there is no legally authorized person available to give consent [for her];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">2. That [appellant] is incapable either of making an informed decision regarding a specific treatment or course of treatment or is physically or mentally incapable of communicating such a decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">3. That [appellant] is unlikely to become capable of making an informed decision or of communicating an informed decision with the time required for decision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">4. That the proposed course of treatment is in the best interest of [appellant]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">In terms of making informed health care decisions under Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21, we make no distinction between a medical evaluation or examination<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the one hand, and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>treatment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the other, both of which may involve intrusive procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The trial court denied DSS\u2019s petition to detain appellant for further treatment at Heritage Hall, and ordered her to be released from that nursing home to her husband\u2019s care, but then ordered her to undergo a comprehensive examination and evaluation at the University of Virginia Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s order for involuntary medical care entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21, \u201c \u2018we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mullins, </em>39 Va.App. at 732, 576 S.E.2d at 772 (quoting <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">After hearing the evidence, the trial court concluded that a comprehensive medical examination and evaluation at the University of Virginia Medical Center was in appellant\u2019s best interest, explaining that she had \u201cto lose weight to get better.\u201d It further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">[A]s part of the treatment order the Court is going to order that you go to the University of Virginia for this comprehensive examination. If it takes a day, fine; if it\u2019s [sic] take a week, fine; if it takes a month, f\u00edne. I want this comprehensive evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">While the trial court\u2019s determination of the need for a comprehensive medical examination is well founded, it is not enough that the examination be in appellant\u2019s best interests. Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21(H) specifically provides that the trial court must find \u201c[t]hat the person who is the subject of the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>is incapable either of making an informed decision regarding a specific treatment or course of treatment or is physically or mentally incapable of communicating such a decision.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, the trial court explicitly found that \u201cdespite her depression, [appellant was] capable of making informed health care decisions____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">DSS concedes on brief that the trial court failed to make the required finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.2(H). It contends, however, that the trial court had authority to order appellant to undergo the comprehensive medical examination under its general equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We find no authority for the proposition advanced by DSS. The authority of the trial court to order medical treatment is defined by the statute, not by the broader principles of equity. \u201cThe rule is well established in Virginia that when the legislature has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme that encompasses a matter that was not formerly within the purview of the common law, a court, when exercising the jurisdiction conferred under that statutory scheme, may not proceed in derogation of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Willis v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 82, 455 S.E.2d 274, 278 (1995) (citing <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 398, 192 S.E.2d 794, 798 (1972)). To grant courts such authority under general equity powers would eviscerate the narrowly drawn statutory scheme balancing the Commonwealth\u2019s interests in protecting its citizens with the individual\u2019s constitutionally protected liberty interest against compelled medical procedures. Absent a finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-134.21 that appellant was incapable of making an informed health care decision or communicating that decision, the trial court lacked authority, over her objection, to order her confined for an indefinite period to undergo a comprehensive health examination and evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We conclude from the record before us that the judgment of the trial court ordering appellant to undergo a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>medical examination and evaluation was plainly wrong and not supported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. We, therefore, reverse and vacate that portion of the judgment of the trial court dated March 1, 2004 ordering appellant to \u201cattend the comprehensive evaluation at the University of Virginia Medical Center scheduled by DSS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-14\">.

That portion of the judgment of the trial cotut is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">.
