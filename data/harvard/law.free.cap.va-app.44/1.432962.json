Haskins challenges his convictions for possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A) and for possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Finding the evidence sufficient to support these convictions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 972, 124 S.Ct. 444, 157 L.Ed.2d 322 (2003). \u201cOn appeal this court must \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and <em>all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 132, 137, 82 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1954)) (emphasis added by Parks).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On October 24, 2002, Officers Kevin Hiner and Wayne Skinner of the Richmond Police Department responded to a call regarding a \u201cmissile thrown through a window into an occupied dwelling\u201d in Richmond. When the officers arrived on the scene shortly after midnight, the victim informed them that \u201can unknown black male, wearing a camouflage jacket and dark jeans, threw a very large piece of wood\u201d through his living room window. The officers began searching the surrounding neighborhood for the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On a porch of a nearby house, Officer Skinner found Has-kins dressed in a camouflage jacket and dark jeans. The porch was \u201cwell lit\u201d by porch lights and streetlights. Haskins was \u201csitting on a bench by himself on the left side of the porch,\u201d while two other men sat on the opposite side of the porch. That particular block was known by the officers to be a \u201chigh drug trafficking area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Officer Skinner asked Haskins to accompany him to the victim\u2019s house. Haskins agreed. Putting his hands by his sides, Haskins stood up from the bench. Officer Hiner \u201cnoticed immediately as [Haskins] walked away from the bench in plain sight was a plastic bag containing two off-white substances I recognized to be crack cocaine.\u201d The clear plastic bag had \u201ca very large\u201d loose knot that \u201callowed for opening and easy access into the bag.\u201d Officer Hiner testified the bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>was \u201cdirectly underneath [Haskins] where he was sitting on the bench, on the bench itself.\u201d During later questioning, Haskins admitted to prior drug use but disclaimed any present use of cocaine or heroin. He did not elaborate on what specific drugs he previously used.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Before being frisked, Haskins admitted he had a weapon. The officers recovered a \u201c40 caliber Glock\u201d handgun concealed \u201cinside of his waistband.\u201d They also found currency in all four pockets of Haskins\u2019s pants, totaling $217, and a cell phone. When asked about the money, Haskins admitted he was unemployed but gave no information as to the source of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At trial, Haskins moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s case. After the trial court overruled the motion, Haskins testified in his own defense. He claimed he did not put the bag of cocaine underneath him, did not know he was sitting on it, and was surprised to learn it was there. He admitted making the remark to the officer about his prior drug use, but said he was referring only to marijuana. Haskins denied that the officer found money in all four pockets. He carried money only in two pockets, he testified. As to the source of the money, Haskins said he received most of it from his mother. His mother took the stand and added that the money she gave him was supposed to be used to pay her automobile insurance premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At the close of the evidence, Haskins renewed his motion to strike. Finding Officer Skinner\u2019s testimony credible, the trial court found Haskins guilty of simple possession of cocaine under Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A) and dismissed the possession with intent to distribute charge alleged in the indictment. The court also found Haskins guilty of possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In his appellate oral argument, Haskins\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI am not for one instance suggesting to the Court that there wasn\u2019t facts that the court could base its decision on.\u201d \u201cFacts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>sufficient?,\u201d he continued, \u201cI would agree with that, but there are addendums to that law.\u201d In circumstantial evidence cases, he reasoned, \u201cif there are two equally reasonable explanations for what happened, then the court not should, but must, accept that explanation.\u201d As he explained his position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">I would respectfully disagree with the Court in terms of what the standard is. The standard indeed is, is there evidence to support it. Don\u2019t dispute that there\u2019s evidence to support it. But there\u2019s more to it than that. They must ... exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Accordingly, I agree that there are facts sufficient to find him guilty. But I would respectfully disagree with the court\u2019s rejecting two alternate hypotheses of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Haskins\u2019s argument, in our opinion, cannot be reconciled with settled principles of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We address first Haskins\u2019s concession that the facts are \u201csufficient to find him guilty.\u201d While the admission could be accepted at face value, we think it more prudent to pass independent judgment on it before addressing his caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">A conviction for simple possession under Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A) requires that the defendant have actual or constructive possession of the drugs. This can be shown by \u201cacts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which tend to show that the accused was aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 735, 594 S.E.2d 305, 311 (2004) (internal brackets and citation omitted); <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 260, 584 S.E.2d 444, 449 (2003) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cTo resolve the issue, the Court must consider the totality of the circumstances established by the evidence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>42 Va.App. at 735, 594 S.E.2d at 311. To be sure, in drug cases no less than any other, it \u201cis axiomatic that any fact that can be proved by direct evidence may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Etherton v. Doe, </em>268 Va. 209, 212-13, 597 S.E.2d 87, 89 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The circumstances of this case support Haskins\u2019s conviction. Haskins sat <em>directly on </em>a bag of crack cocaine \u2014 not near it, or in the same car in which it was found, or with a group of friends who had it. He sat on the bench alone, at midnight, in a \u201chigh drug trafficking area.\u201d The bag had a \u201cvery large\u201d knot, tied loose enough to allow easy access. No one else was on the bench with Haskins. The bench was \u201cwell lit\u201d by porch and streetlights. When confronted by the officer, Haskins \u201cput his hands down ... by his sides when he got up off of the bench.\u201d The moment Haskins stood up the officer \u201cimmediately\u201d saw the clear plastic bag and recognized the two off-white items inside to be crack cocaine. Haskins admitted to the officer he had used drugs in the past, though at trial Haskins limited this statement to marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The trial judge, sitting as factfinder, found the circumstances of this case proved Haskins knowingly and intentionally possessed the bag of cocaine. Either he put it there or someone else did. In either scenario, he knowingly concealed the cocaine as he sat on it. Given the totality of the circumstances, the court found implausible Haskins\u2019s claim of being oblivious to the bag of drugs underneath the seat of his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">On appeal, we can reverse this factual finding only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence\u201d to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Under this standard, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Myers v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 113, 118, 596 S.E.2d 536, 538 (2004) (citation omitted and emphasis in original). It asks instead whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>This understanding of the standard of review, which serves as a restatement of due process principles,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ensures that we remain faithful to our duty not to \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact,\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (citation omitted), \u201ceven were our opinion to differ,\u201d <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Applying the governing standard of review, we accept Has-kins\u2019s concession that \u201cthere are facts sufficient to find him guilty.\u201d Though conceding the sufficiency of the evidence as a general matter, however, Haskins does not concede his guilt. In circumstantial evidence cases, he argues, an \u201caddendum\u201d to the general sufficiency standard recognizes that the evidence must exclude every \u201creasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d We agree with Haskins that this venerable principle exists, but disagree with his understanding of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">To begin with, the reasonable-hypothesis principle is not a discrete rule unto itself. \u201cThe statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 258, 584 S.E.2d at 447-48 (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785). Thus, the principle \u201cdoes not add to the burden of proof placed upon the Commonwealth in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It merely \u201creiterates the standard applicable to every criminal case.\u201d <em>Pease v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 360, 573 S.E.2d 272, 280 (2002) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), aff<em>'d, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003) <em>(per curiam </em>order adopting reasoning of the Court of Appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Whether the hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u201cquestion of fact,\u201d <em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 277, 597 S.E.2d 242, 249 (2004) (citation omitted), subject to deferential appellate review, <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 259, 584 S.E.2d at 448. \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded. What weight should be given evidence is a matter for the [factfinder] to decide.\u201d <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 462, 467, 138 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1964); <em>see </em>also <em>Lyons v. City of Petersburg, </em>221 Va. 10, 13, 266 S.E.2d 880, 881 (1980) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence is sufficient to convict if it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. This occurs when the <em>trier of facts </em>has an abiding conviction of the guilt of the accused.\u201d (emphasis added)). By finding the defendant guilty, therefore, the factfinder \u201chas found by a process of elimination that the evidence does not contain a reasonable theory of innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Kemble, </em>197 F.2d 316, 320 (3d Cir.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Even so, Haskins replies, a factfinder cannot \u201carbitrarily\u201d choose, as between two equally plausible interpretations, one that incriminates the defendant. <em>Dixon v. Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 798, 803, 173 S.E. 521, 523 (1934). We certainly concur. But this axiomatic proposition has meaning only after the factfinder \u201cresolves all conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Feigley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 717, 724, 432 S.E.2d 520, 525 (1993). If, after doing so, the evidence of guilt or innocence remains anywhere near equipoise \u2014 that is, the facts are \u201cequally susceptible to two or more constructions\u201d \u2014 then reasonable doubt exists as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>But where the factfinder has rejected the hypothesis as <em>unreasonable, </em>that determination cannot be overturned as arbitrary unless no rational factfinder would have come to that conclusion. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 764, 772, 71 S.E.2d 73, 77 (1952) (observing that the <em>Dixon </em>principle does not apply if the exculpatory explanation is \u201cuntenable under all the facts and circumstances of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In this case, the trial court had to resolve several evidentiary conflicts. On the question whether Haskins knew he was sitting on a bag of cocaine, two incriminating facts stood out: the \u201cvery large\u201d knot in the bag (giving rise to the inference that Haskins would have felt it) and the fact that the bag was in plain view on a well-lit porch (supporting the inference that Haskins, assuming he did not hide the bag there himself, would have seen it before sitting down on it). Militating against these incriminating facts and inferences was Haskins\u2019s testimony that he knew nothing about the cocaine. As for the \u201cvery large\u201d knot, Haskins\u2019s counsel added, it was loose and perhaps not something that could be felt easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">On the question whether Haskins knew the bag contained cocaine, the trial court accepted the officer\u2019s testimony that, as soon as Haskins stood up, the officer \u201cimmediately\u201d saw the bag and recognized the two off-white items as crack cocaine. From this it could be inferred that Haskins also could have immediately seen the cocaine had someone else put it there before Haskins sat on it. Haskins\u2019s prior drug use, coupled with his presence at midnight in a \u201chigh drug trafficking area,\u201d supports the inference that he too knew cocaine when he saw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The trial judge did not act irrationally in resolving these evidentiary conflicts. He was entitled to \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Pease, </em>39 Va.App. at 355, 573 S.E.2d at 278 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). He likewise was at liberty to disbelieve Haskins\u2019s self-serving explanation as a mere effort at \u201clying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Duncan, </em>267 Va. 377, 385, 593 S.E.2d 210, 215 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Acting within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>factfinding discretion, the trial judge rationally found beyond a reasonable doubt that Haskins knowingly exercised dominion and control over the bag of cocaine while he sat on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In the end, Haskins\u2019s \u201caddendum\u201d is little more than an invitation for us to interpret the inferences differently than the factfinder, to find all exculpatory inferences reasonable and all inculpatory inferences unreasonable, and to accept as credible the entirety of Haskins\u2019s testimony. Our function, however, is not to preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial. Emphasizing the dissimilarity in the respective roles of the trial and appellate courts, the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">The trial judge\u2019s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge\u2019s efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. In addition, the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much. As the Court has stated in a different context, the trial on the merits should be \u201cthe \u2018main event\u2019 ... rather than a \u2018tryout on the road.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2508, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Because sufficient evidence exists to support Haskins\u2019s conviction for simple possession of cocaine and the companion conviction for simultaneous possession of cocaine and a firearm, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">. <em>See also Myers, </em>43 Va.App. at 118, 596 S.E.2d at 538; <em>Williams, </em>42 Va.App. at 734, 594 S.E.2d at 311; <em>Holmes v.
