ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Gerald Lee Tucek challenges his conviction for violating the sex offender registration requirements of former Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1, a Class 6 felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1 applicable to sexually violent offenses. We affirm his conviction, finding he lacks standing to advance the constitutional claim raised at trial and now asserted on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In 1984, Gerald Lee Tucek was convicted in Tennessee of aggravated rape. He received a 20-year penitentiary sentence. After being released from prison in 1999, Tucek moved to Virginia. Tucek registered as a sex offender with the Virginia State Police. He later failed, however, to reregister periodically as Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 required.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">In 2002, a grand jury indicted Tucek for violating his statutory duty to reregister. Tucek moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against out-of-state sex offenders by treating them differently than in-state sex offenders. After the trial court denied Tueek\u2019s motion, he pled guilty conditioned upon the right to assert his constitutional claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Before their recent revision and recodification at Code \u00a7 9.1-900 <em>et seq., </em>Virginia\u2019s sex-offender registration provisions were codified at former Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsections B and C of \u00a7 19.2-298.1 required every person \u201cconvicted\u201d or \u201cserving a sentence of confinement or under community supervision\u201d on or after July 1, 1997, to register with the Virginia State Police. Subsection D extended this requirement to sex offenders convicted outside Virginia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In addition, all persons convicted of violations under the laws of the United States or any other state substantially similar to an offense for which registration is required shall provide in person to the local law-enforcement agency all necessary information for inclusion in the Registry within ten days of establishing a residence within the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Tucek claims these provisions, when read together, imposed differing registration burdens on in-state and out-of-state sex offenders. Under his interpretation, the statute required instate offenders to register only if convicted or released from confinement or supervision on or after July 1,1997 \u2014 while out-of-state offenders had to register when entering Virginia no matter the date of their conviction or release from confinement or supervision. Because of this disparity, Tucek argues the statute should be declared unconstitutional and his conviction overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">To resolve this appeal, we need not accept or reject Tucek\u2019s reading of the statute. Nor is it necessary to address the putative constitutional rights of out-of-state sex offenders. For even if the disparate treatment Tucek complains of truly existed, he would have no standing to challenge it. As he concedes, Tucek was still serving his sentence for aggravated rape on July 1, 1997, and was not released from prison until 1999. Thus, if the registration requirements for Virginia convicts were applied to him, Tucek would have had exactly the same registration duties. The alleged disparity between in-state and out-of-state sex offenders, as far as Tucek is concerned, is entirely hypothetical. To be sure, he was treated no differently than similarly situated Virginia rapists.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u201cBecause the very \u2018nature of judicial review constrains us. to consider the case that is actually before us,\u2019 \u201d we decline to \u201coffer an advisory opinion on such \u2018hypothetical situations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v.

This principle of judicial self-restraint stems from the general rule that \u201cwhere a statute is constitutional as applied to a litigant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the litigant has no standing to challenge the statute on the ground that it may be unconstitutional, on its face, that is, as applied to a third person in a hypothetical situation.\u201d <em>Esper Bonding Co. v.
