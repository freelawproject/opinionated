Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that his operator\u2019s license was revoked and that he had notice of that revocation as required by Code \u00a7 46.2-391.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to that evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997). On the evening of January 18, 2003, Officer Nick Coalson (Coalson) of the Town of Clarksville Police Department observed appellant driving erratically. Coalson stopped appellant and asked for his license and registration. Appellant responded that he didn\u2019t have an operator\u2019s license and that it was suspended. Coalson arrested appellant for DUI and took him to the Mecklenburg County Sheriffs office to perform the breath test. While Coalson and appellant waited the required twenty-minute observation period, appellant stated to Coalson, \u201cI had too much to drive, I don\u2019t need a license, it\u2019s too much trouble. I made a mistake, I shouldn\u2019t have drove [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of two prior DUI convictions. That evidence included an August 15, 1997 conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, which resulted in a twelve-month suspension of his license, and a November 8, 2000 conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-266, which, because it was appellant\u2019s second offense within the last ten years, resulted in his license being \u201csuspended/revoked\u201d for three years. On both occasions, appellant appeared in person before the gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>al district court and waived his right to an attorney. Also, he signed a DC-210 form for the November 8, 2000 offense, in which he acknowledged: \u201cthat I have been notified that my driver\u2019s license/driving privilege is suspended or revoked for a period of three years effective 12/5/00 as a result of my conviction by this court.... \u201d The form also states \u201cI further understand that, if I am convicted of driving while my driver\u2019s license is suspended or revoked, I may be fined, sentenced to jail or both.\u201d On the back of the warrant, the judge checked the block \u201cDRIVER\u2019S LICENSE suspended\u201d and after it wrote \u201c3 yrs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Appellant objected to the admission of this evidence, contending that the Commonwealth failed to prove he violated Code \u00a7 46.2-391 because the evidence did not show his license was \u201crevoked.\u201d Even if his license was revoked, appellant argued the evidence did not show that he was aware of the revocation. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections and found sufficient evidence to prove both the revocation and appellant\u2019s knowledge of the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Appellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that his operator\u2019s license was revoked rather than suspended. He contends that his statement to Coalson, in which appellant said that he knew his license was suspended, but did not say that he knew his license was revoked, fails to prove, even when read in conjunction with his signature on the DC-210 form, that his license was properly revoked pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391. Rather, at best, it proves only that his license was suspended. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. The Commonwealth submitted evidence appellant had two prior convictions under the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>266.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence established that appellant appeared personally on both occasions and waived his right to be represented by counsel each time. By operation of statute, upon his second conviction, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, appellant\u2019s license was revoked for a period of three years. Code \u00a7 18.2-271(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">If a person (i) is tried on a process alleging a second offense of violating \u00a7 18.2-266 ... within ten years of a first offense for which the person was convicted, ... under \u00a7 18.2-266 ... and (ii) is convicted thereof, such conviction shall of itself operate to deprive the person so convicted of the privilege to drive ... in the Commonwealth for a period of three years from the date of the judgment of conviction and such person shall have his license revoked as provided in subsection A of \u00a7 46.2-391. The court trying such case shall order the surrender of the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license, ... and shall notify such person that his license has been revoked for a period of three years and that the penalty for violating that revocation is as set out in \u00a7 46.2-391____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The general district court completed the back of the warrant on appellant\u2019s second conviction as required, noting his fine, his jail sentence and that his license was suspended for three years. Appellant then signed the DC-210 form that specifically stated \u201cI acknowledge that I have been notified that my driver\u2019s license/driving privilege is suspended or revoked for a period of three years effective 12/5/00 as a result of my conviction by this court----\u201d The form also states \u201cI further understand that, if I am convicted of driving while my driver\u2019s license is suspended or revoked, I may be fined, sentenced to jail or both.\u201d The form was admitted as evidence and complies with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-271 (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Upon his conviction, the general district court sent notice of the conviction to the Department of Motor Vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(DMV).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commissioner of DMV is then required by Code \u00a7 46.2-391 to revoke appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Code \u00a7 46.2-391 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">The Commissioner shall forthwith revoke and not thereafter reissue for three years the driver\u2019s license of any person on receiving a record of the conviction of any person who (i) is adjudged to be a second offender in violation of the provisions of ... \u00a7 18.2-266 (driving under the influence of drugs or intoxicants), if the subsequent violation occurred within 10 years of the prior violation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cIn the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts may presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 856-57, 406 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1991). <em>See also Clements v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 56, 60, 596 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2004) (holding the DMV Commissioner to be a public official subject to the presumption of regularity). There is no evidence that the general district court did not forward notice of the conviction to DMV or that DMV did not revoke appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license as required by Code \u00a7 46.2-391.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Additionally, the terms \u201crevocation\u201d and \u201csuspension\u201d in this context have been used interchangeably both by the legislature and the courts. Code \u00a7 18.2-271 specifically directs the trial court after</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">depriving] the person so convicted of the privilege to drive or operate any motor vehicle, ... in the Commonwealth for a period of three years ... [t]he <em>court </em>trying such case shall order the surrender of the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license, ... and <em>shall notify such person </em>that his license has been <em>revoked </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>for a period of three years and that the penalty for violating that revocation is as set out in \u00a7 46.2-391....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">(Emphasis added). That is precisely what the trial court did, and appellant acknowledged by his signature on the DC-210 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Therefore, because there is credible evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was revoked, that judgment is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Lastly, appellant contends that the evidence failed to prove he knew his driver\u2019s license was revoked rather than suspended and, therefore, he cannot be convicted under Code \u00a7 46.2-391. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 735, 737, 536 S.E.2d 922, 923 (2000) (internal quotations omitted). Each piece of circumstantial evidence is not viewed separately. \u201c\u2018While no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u201ccombined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 425, 410 S.E.2d 662, 669 (1991) (quoting <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, 818 (1979) (quoting <em>Karnes v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 764, 99 S.E. 562, 564 (1919))).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">In the instant case, appellant was present and pled guilty to two prior convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-266. He signed the DC-210 form that both gave him notice that he was unable to operate a motor vehicle for three years and listed the possible penalties for driving after the conviction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-271. There is no dispute that appellant knew he was forbidden to drive. He admitted to the arresting officer that he knew that he was not licensed to drive. The evidence in the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>when considered as a whole, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the Commonwealth sufficiently proved appellant\u2019s license was revoked and appellant had knowledge of that revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. Appellant was also convicted of a fourth offense of driving under the influence pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, but he does not challenge this conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-266 provides in pertinent part: \"It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle ... while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. See Code \u00a7 18.2-273 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">Report of conviction to Department of Motor Vehicles. The clerk of every court of record and the judge of every court not of record shall, within thirty days after final conviction of any person in his court under the provisions of this article, report the fact thereof and the name, post-office address and street address of such person, together with the license plate number on the vehicle operated by such person to the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles who shall preserve a record thereof in his office.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
