Walshaw, of first-degree murder for the strangulation death of Karen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Tegeler, and fixed his sentence at life imprisonment. On appeal, appellant contends that the short form indictment on which he was tried for first-degree murder was deficient because it failed to allege malice and premeditation and that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Finding no error, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On January 23, 2002, appellant killed Karen Paulette Tegeler, his girlfriend of three years. He gave a detailed confession to the police admitting that he killed Tegeler. He described how their relationship had become strained prior to Tegeler\u2019s death, how he suspected her of infidelity and had confronted her about it. He admitted to the police that he had contemplated killing her a month before he actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">On the day appellant killed Tegeler, he found a Valentine\u2019s card addressed to him in Tegeler\u2019s condominium. Inside the card was a handwritten note from Tegeler informing appellant that their relationship was over and that he had to move out of the condominium. Later that evening when Tegeler returned to the condominium from work, the two had sexual relations. Shortly thereafter while Tegeler was napping, appellant stepped outside, smoked a cigarette, and reread the note. He became \u201cpretty upset\u201d and then \u201che just lost it.\u201d He went back into the bedroom, laid beside Tegeler and then, with her head resting on his arm, strangled her until she was dead. Tegeler tried to resist, and the two struggled for five to seven minutes during which time Tegeler fell off the bed. When appellant knew Tegeler was dead, he left to buy some beer. He told the police that he contemplated suicide by throwing himself in front of a train, but there were no trains. He went to a friend\u2019s house and confessed the murder to her. She called the police, who then arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The indictment on which appellant was prosecuted for murder stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">The GRAND JURY ... charges that on or about January 23, 2002, in the aforesaid Judicial Circuit, the accused, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>STEVE FREDERICK WALSHAW did feloniously kill and murder one Karen Paulette Tegeler, in violation of Virginia Code Section 18.2-32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">After the close of all the evidence and during the presentation of the jury instructions to the trial court, appellant objected that \u201c[t]he indictment alleges only manslaughter ...\u201d and \u201cdoes not allege premeditation and or malice,\u201d the elements necessary to convict him of first-degree murder. The trial court overruled his contention that the jury should only be instructed on voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The trial court granted Instruction B-l, which followed the format of I Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal G.33.700 (1998 repl. ed. with 1999 supp.), and rejected Instruction B, an alternative murder instruction offered by appellant. Appellant objected to the portion of Instruction B-l relating to voluntary manslaughter, arguing that it misallocated the burden of proof for voluntary manslaughter and thus erroneously stated the law. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder and fixed his sentence at life imprisonment. The trial court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">A. SHORT FORM MURDER INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\u201cWhen considering on appeal whether an indictment charged a particular offense, we limit our scrutiny to the face of the document.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 192, 198, 497 S.E.2d 908, 910-11 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">At trial, appellant contended that he could not lawfully be convicted of or punished for an offense greater than voluntary manslaughter because the statutory short form murder indictment failed to contain the words \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated\u201d or \u201cwith malice.\u201d He contends that these defects denied him adequate notice of the charge against him as required by the United States Constitution and <em>Ring v. Ari</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>zona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Both the United States and Virginia Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant the right \u201cto be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 109, 115, 267 S.E.2d 134, 139 (1980) (upholding use of Virginia short\u2019s form murder indictment in conviction of first-degree murder and robbery). However, our Supreme Court has held that there is no constitutional or statutory requirement \u201cthat the indictment charge the degree of murder alleged or use the specific statutory language constituting that degree of offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The purpose of an indictment \u201c \u2018is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations against him in order that he can adequately prepare to defend against his accuser.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 193, 198, 578 S.E.2d 803, 806 (2003) (quoting <em>Sims v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 611, 619, 507 S.E.2d 648, 652 (1998)). Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">The indictment or information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement ... describing the offense charged----In describing the offense, ... the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what offense is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Rule 3A:6(a) also requires the indictment to \u201ccite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense____\u201d <em>See also Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 665, 667, 353 S.E.2d 166, 167-68 (1987). \u201c[T]he inference to be drawn from the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:6(a) is clearly that incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>by ... reference of the statute cited in the indictment\u201d provides adequate notice of the charges against the accused. <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 748, 753, 561 S.E.2d 56, 58 (2002). Here, appellant clearly had adequate notice of the offense for which he was to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The indictment on which appellant was tried precisely follows Code \u00a7 19.2-221, providing short form indictments for murder and voluntary manslaughter. \u201cWhile any form of presentment, indictment or information which informs the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him shall be good the [short form indictment] shall be deemed sufficient for murder ____\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-221. The statute \u201cspecifically validates murder indictments which allege only that the defendant \u2018feloniously did kill and murder\u2019 the victim.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>221 Va. at 115, 267 S.E.2d at 138-39; <em>see also Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 257, 421 S.E.2d 821, 843 (1992) (affirming conviction under short form indictment filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-221 for first-degree murder).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxX\">\u201cIf, therefore, any proposition of law can be considered as settled by decision and no longer open to debate\u201d ... then the proposition that the short statutory form of indictment for murder includes the charge of murder in the first degree is now the established law in this Commonwealth....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\"><em>Barber v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 241, 247, 142 S.E.2d 484, 489 (1965) (quoting <em>Hobson v. Youell, </em>177 Va. 906, 912, 15 S.E.2d 76, 78 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Our Supreme Court has consistently held that it is unnecessary to include the words \u201cwillfully, deliberately and premeditatedly\u201d or \u201cmalice\u201d in the indictment to convict a defendant of murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32. <em>Simpson, </em>221 Va. at 115, 267 S.E.2d at 139. <em>See Hartman v. Lee, </em>283 F.3d 190, 199 (4th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1114, 123 S.Ct. 851, 154 L.Ed.2d 789 (2003); <em>Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 257, 421 S.E.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The statutory short form of the indictment fully informed appellant \u201cof the nature and cause of the accusation against him.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-221. The indictment clearly alleges that appellant \u201cdid feloniously kill and murder one Karen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Paulette Tegeler, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32.\u201d It specifically refers to Code \u00a7 18.2-32, which provides that \u201cmurder ... by any willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing ... is murder in the first degree .... All murder other than capital murder and murder in the first degree ... is murder in the second degree.\u201d The clear language of the indictment gave appellant unequivocal notice that he was charged with the first-degree murder of Tegeler, and gave him notice of the elements of the offense necessary for the Commonwealth to prove in order to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Moreover, at appellant\u2019s arraignment on the indictment prior to the beginning of the trial, the trial court informed him that he was charged with murder. In response to the specific inquiry by the trial court of whether he understood the charge for which he was standing trial, appellant stated that he understood the nature of the charge against him. He further stated that he had discussed the charge fully with his attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the trial court asked appellant if he was entering his not guilty plea freely and voluntarily, he answered \u201cI\u2019m entering it on my own accord, freely, yeah. I\u2019m not pleading to first degree.\u201d Based on appellant\u2019s own statements, it is clear that he knew that the charge against him was the first-degree murder of Karen Paulette Tegeler in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Appellant argues, however, that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002); and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), provide that there is a constitutional requirement that all of the elements necessary to prove murder must be specified in the indictment, and failing to do so, the indictment is defective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An examination of <em>Apprendi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and the other decisions relied on by appellant demonstrate that his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the issue before the United States Supreme Court was whether the sentencing judge could impose a sentence in excess of the maximum for the offense of which the defendant had been indicted and convicted under New Jersey law. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant was indicted and convicted of firing a gun into the home of an African-American family that had previously moved into an all-white neighborhood. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469, 120 S.Ct. at 2351. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant pled guilty to three firearms offenses which carried a possible maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 120 S.Ct. at 2352. The plea agreement reserved to the government a right to seek an enhanced punishment on the ground that one of the charges was committed with \u201ca biased purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A different statute permitted the trial judge to sentence a defendant to a separate term of incarceration if the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed the crime with a racial animus. <em>Id. </em>at 469, 120 S.Ct. at 2351. The trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence that aggravating factors existed, and sentenced the defendant to thirty years in prison, ten years longer than the maximum sentence for the offense of which he was convicted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Arguing that <em>Apprendi </em>constitutes a \u201csea change\u201d in the long established precedent upholding Virginia\u2019s short form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>indictment, appellant relies on the following statement from <em>Apprendi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\u201c[UJnder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime <em>must be charged in an indictment, </em>submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment commands the same answer in this case involving a state statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2\"><em>Id. </em>at 476, 120 S.Ct. at 2355 (emphasis added by appellant) (quoting <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. at 1224). However, appellant\u2019s focus on the words \u201cmust be charged in the indictment\u201d does not obscure the meaning of <em>Apprendi. Apprendi </em>implicated two constitutional provisions: the right to a jury trial and the right to compel the state to meet the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 120 S.Ct. at 2355-56. Appellant\u2019s emphasis on the statement that any enhanced sentencing factor \u201cmust be charged in the indictment\u201d in the Court\u2019s several opinions ignores that <em>Jones </em>was a federal prosecution and that Apprendi\u2019s reference to <em>Jones </em>does not reflect <em>Jones\u2019 </em>actual holding. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court concluded that the New Jersey law was an \u201cunacceptable departure from the jury tradition.\u201d It found that under the New Jersey judge sentencing procedure, the sentencing judge could sentence a convicted person to a penalty beyond the maximum authorized for the charge of which he was convicted, based on facts never submitted to a jury and found to exist by the sentencing judge by only a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 120 S.Ct. at 2366.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The indictment on which appellant was convicted by the jury in this case clearly charged first-degree murder. Both appellant and his counsel acknowledged that each was aware of the charge appellant faced. The jury found that each element of the offense charged in the indictment had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, appellant\u2019s sentence was fixed by the jury which had determined his guilt within the statutory range of punishment authorized by Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-32, the crime of which he was specifically charged in the indictment. Unlike Apprendi, appellant did not face an enhanced punishment imposed by a judge beyond the statutory maximum for the crime of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Similarly, the statutory sentencing scheme at issue in <em>Ring </em>is not relevant to Virginia\u2019s short form indictment for murder. In <em>Ring, </em>the United States Supreme Court struck down Arizona\u2019s sentencing scheme in death penalty cases which permitted the trial judge to find aggravating circumstances, not submitted to the jury, as a basis to sentence the defendant to the death penalty. The Court held that the Sixth Amendment mandated that \u201c[cjapital defendants, no less than non-capital defendants, ... are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment.\u201d <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 589, 122 S.Ct. at 2432.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on federal cases in support of his defective indictment argument is also misplaced. In support of his argument, appellant cites <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (prosecution for violating federal drug and firearms laws); and <em>United States v. Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 297 (4th Cir.2003) (prosecution for capital murder for homicides that occurred on federal land). Like <em>Jones, </em>each of these cases was a federal prosecution to which the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment applied,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and are irrelevant to the issue here: whether a <em>state </em>charging document must mechanically list all of the elements of an offense or whether the state may utilize a simplified charging instrument. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Higgs </em>from the Fourth Circuit is particularly inapposite as that Court recently rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the North Carolina short form indictment. <em>Allen v. Lee, </em>366 F.3d 319 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Cir.2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Allen, </em>the Fourth Circuit dismissed an argument similar to that raised by appellant here, concluding that \u201c[a] short-form indictment alleging elements of common law murder is sufficient to inform the defendant of the charge against him, and thus satisfies the requirements of the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324 (citing <em>Hartman, </em>283 F.3d at 192).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Likewise, the North Carolina Supreme Court, facing a similar <em>Apprendi </em>inspired challenge to its short form murder indictment, upheld the North Carolina short form indictment statute. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>357 N.C. 257, 582 S.E.2d 593, 597 (2003) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>do not change the constitutionality of North Carolina\u2019s short form indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We conclude that the short form statutory indictment on which appellant was convicted fully informed him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him as required by the United States and Virginia Constitutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The absence of the words \u201cmalice\u201d and \u201cpremeditation\u201d in the indictment did not render it defective to charge first-degree murder. It was sufficient that it alleged that appellant \u201cmurdered\u201d Tegeler and that it referred to Code \u00a7 18.2-32. Finding no constitutional defect in appellant\u2019s indictment, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">B. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Instruction B-l,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a finding instruction in homicide cases patterned after Virginia Model Jury Instruction G.33.700, and in failing to grant his Instruction B.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201cThe trial judge has broad discretion in giving or denying instructions requested.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) (en <em>banc) </em>(approving a similar finding instruction on first-degree murder which followed the format suggested in Model Jury Instruction G.33.700). \u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (citation omitted). \u201cNo instruction should be given that \u2018incorrectly states the applicable law or which would be confusing or misleading to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 582, 575 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003) (quoting <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 300, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Applying this standard of review, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s granting Instruction B-l and denying appellant\u2019s proffered Instruction B.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Appellant contends that Instruction B-l misstates Virginia law relating to voluntary manslaughter in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was malicious but that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant killed Ms. Tegeler and further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">(1) That the killing was the result of an intentional act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">(2) That the killing was committed while in the sudden heat of passion upon reasonable provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">then you shall find Mr. Walshaw guilty of voluntary manslaughter, but you shall not fix the punishment until you have returned your verdict and heard further instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Relying on <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), appellant contends the trial court erred \u201cby instructing the jury that in order to return a verdict for the lesser included offense of manslaughter, the jury must find that the Commonwealth proved the presence of heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In support of this contention, he argues that Instruction B-l misstates Virginia law by improperly placing the burden of proof of \u201cheat of passion\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth, when the burden should be on the Commonwealth to prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt and to disprove the heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Mullaney </em>for the proposition that Instruction B-l was improper is misplaced. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>that the Court in <em>Mullaney </em>held that the \u201cDue Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the <em>absence </em>of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704, 95 S.Ct. at 1892 (emphasis added). However, Mullaney\u2019s holding was tailored to answer the following question: What must the prosecution prove in order to sustain a charge of <em>murder? </em>In <em>Mullaney, </em>the defendant contended that his conviction for murder should be overturned because the jury was instructed that, under Maine law, \u201cmalice aforethought was to be <em>conclusively </em>implied unless the defendant proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 95 S.Ct. at 1883 (emphasis added). The Court determined that this instruction violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights because it shifted the burden of persuasion on the element of malice \u2014 an element essential to the crime of murder \u2014 to the defendant by requiring the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in the heat of passion. <em>See Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 215-16, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 2329-330, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). Because malice and heat of passion are mutually exclusive elements under Maine law, <em>see Mullaney, </em>421 U.S. at 686-87, 95 S.Ct. at 1883-84, as they are in Virginia, <em>see Hodge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 338, 345, 228 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1976), the Court\u2019s holding requiring the prosecution to prove the absence of heat of passion to sustain a charge of murder was tantamount to requiring the prosecution to prove the presence of malice. <em>See Patterson, </em>432 U.S. at 216, 97 S.Ct. at 2330. Thus, <em>Mullaney </em>teaches that, in order to prove murder in a case in which the issue of heat of passion has been properly raised by the evidence, the prosecution must prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt or, to state it differently, must prove the absence of heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Mullaney, </em>421 U.S. at 703, 95 S.Ct. at 1892; <em>Hodge, </em>217 Va. at 341, 228 S.E.2d at 695. The Commonwealth always has the burden of proving the culpable state of mind, \u201cand <em>this burden never shifts.\u201d Hodge, </em>217 Va. at 342, 228 S.E.2d at 695 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Instruction B-l instructed the jury that it was required to find malice in order to convict of murder. The jury\u2019s finding that malice existed <em>a priori </em>excluded the existence of heat of passion. Moreover, the instruction provided that if the jury found the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was malicious, it was still required to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the evidence proved appellant intentionally killed Tegeler without lawful justification or excuse. The instruction further provided that if the Commonwealth failed to prove the existence of malice beyond a reasonable doubt, then the greatest degree of homicide of which it could convict appellant was voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Even if, as Walshaw argues, Instruction B-l erroneously placed the burden of proving the existence of heat of passion beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth, he suffered no prejudice. At most, Instruction B-l placed on the Commonwealth a burden greater than the law requires, as the Commonwealth was obligated only to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Walshaw intentionally killed Tegeler without lawful justification or excuse in order to obtain a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>86 Va. 466, 473, 10 S.E. 745, 747 (1890). In order to obtain a conviction for murder, the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Walshaw acted with malice, or said differently, to establish the non-existence of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Instruction B-l read as a whole placed the burden of proof on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the homicide offenses. <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 627, 630, 363 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1988). Moreover, when a trial court grants numerous instructions, the jury must \u201cconsider the instructions as a whole and in the light of the evidence applicable to the issues presented.\u201d <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 541, 399 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1991). The trial court gave separate instructions defining malice and the heat of passion, explaining that malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was the difference between murder and manslaughter. An additional instruction clearly stated that \u201c[h]eat of passion excludes malice.\u201d From these instructions and the evidence presented, the jury concluded that appellant did not possess the lower state of culpability of acting in the heat of passion, but found instead that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted maliciously and that his intentional killing of Tegeler was willful, deliberate, and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Viewing the instructions as a whole, \u201cit is inconceivable that the jury could have misunderstood where the ultimate burden of proof rested.\u201d <em>Hodge, </em>217 Va. at 347, 228 S.E.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Instruction B-l did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof of any element of the offense of voluntary manslaughter to appellant, nor did it increase the quantum of proof necessary for the jury to find that he acted in the heat of passion, nor did it violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Instruction B-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his Instruction B. Because we find that Instruction B-l read together with other instructions given fairly explained the elements of the homicide offenses at issue to the jury, we find no error in the trial court refusing appellant\u2019s alternative Instruction B. We recognize that \u201c[e]ach party is entitled to have jury instructions upon vital points in language chosen by it, <em>if the instruction is a correct statement of the law.\u201d Broody v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 281, 291, 429 S.E.2d 468, 474 (1993) (emphasis added). \u201cA trial judge does not abuse his discretion by failing to modify a correct statement of the law on the mere chance that a jury may not follow clearly written instructions. We presume the jury will understand, and will follow their instructions.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 567, 574 S.E.2d at 777 (citing <em>Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. Brown, </em>137 Va. 670, 680, 120 S.E. 269, 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>(1923); <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Appellant\u2019s proffered Instruction B, refused by the trial court, was identical to Instruction B-l with the exception of the following language substituted for the language discussed above in section B.l. Appellant\u2019s proffered Instruction B provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">If you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Walshaw killed Ms. Tegeler, but failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was malicious, then you shall find Mr. Walshaw guilty of voluntary manslaughter, but you shall not fix the punishment until you have returned your verdict and heard further instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Instruction B failed to instruct the jury that for it to convict of voluntary manslaughter, it must find that the killing was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Appellant further argues on appeal that the claimed error in granting Instruction B-l was aggravated by Instructions D, G and K-l. He failed to present this argument regarding the impact of these other instructions on Instruction B-l to the trial court. We will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court. <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998); <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18. Moreover, our review of the record does not reflect any reason to invoke good cause and the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Finally, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s giving of Instruction B-l to the jury was not harmless error. Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Instruction B-l, we need not apply a harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting Instruction B-l and denying appellant\u2019s Instruction B.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">For the above reasons, we conclude that the indictment, in the statutory short form, fully informed appellant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and complies with both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. We also conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Instruction B-l and refusing to grant Instruction B. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\">. \"In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to ... be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

In each of the cases cited by appellant, the accused was convicted of a crime charged in the indictment, and the trial judge determined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sentence to be imposed. The sentencing judge was permitted to find aggravating sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See also Blakely v.

In the federal system and the vast majority of states, the trial judge sentences the convicted person, even in cases where a jury determines guilt. We note that Virginia has since colonial times provided for jury sentencing in cases tried by the jury. <em>See Walker v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 50, 61-62, 486 S.E.2d 126, 132 (1997). In Virginia, neither the jury nor the trial court can sentence a person to a greater punishment than that established by the legislature for the crime of which that person was convicted. <em>See Abdo v.
