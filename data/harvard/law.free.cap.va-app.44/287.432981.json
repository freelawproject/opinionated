For the reasons stated, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">I. NON-COMPETE PAYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Prior to the marriage, the husband owned LDWC, a long distance telephone service. On April 1,1996 the husband sold his interest in LDWC to Telco Communications Group. In exchange for his shares in LDWC, husband received Telco shares and became President of Telco\u2019s Consumer Division with an annual salary of $375,000. As part of the sales agreement, he agreed to a non-compete provision where he would receive one million dollars within one year after his termination of employment with Telco, provided he would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>engage in any competing business. The employment agreement provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">6. <em>Covenants and Confidential Information.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(a) The Executive acknowledges the Company\u2019s reliance on and expectation of the Executive\u2019s continued commitment to performance of his duties and responsibilities during the Term. In light of such reliance and expectation on the part of the Company, during the periods hereafter specified in Section 6(b), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, do or suffer either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">(i) Own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or otherwise with, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm, association or other business entity directly or indirectly engaged in the business or, or otherwise directly or indirectly engage in the business of, marketing or providing telecommunication services within the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(ii) Disclose, divulge, discuss, copy of otherwise use or suffer to be used in any manner ... any confidential or proprietary information relating to the company\u2019s business ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">(b) The applicable periods shall be: as to clause (i) of Section 6(a) so long as the Executive is an employee of the Company and for a period of one year after termination of employment; and as to clause (ii) of Section 6(a), during the term and at any time after the Executive is no longer an employee of the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">As additional consideration for Executive\u2019s non-competition obligation pursuant to Section 6(a)(i) during the one year period after termination of employment for Cause, without Cause, for Permanent Disability, or because of the expiration of the Term, the Company shall make an addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tional payment of $1,000,000 to Executive within ninety (90) days after such termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The parties married April 13, 1996, twelve days after husband executed the agreement. During the marriage, husband upheld his obligation to not compete and in 1997 Telco paid husband one million dollars. The wife argued below that this payment is marital property and that husband \u201ceffectively waived his right to work and receive compensation in his field of expertise\u201d during the term of this non-compete agreement. The husband characterized the payment as separate property, claiming that it was an aspect of his sale of stock to Telco. The trial court agreed with the husband, stating that the money was \u201cin the bank before he was married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Wife contends on appeal that the payment is marital property because \u201cthe $1 million in compensation was in exchange for Mr. Cirrito\u2019s forbearance from competing with his former employer for one year after his employment ceased.\u201d Husband argues that he earned the right to receive payment under the agreement on April 1, 1996, the date he signed the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that the trial court erred in finding the payment was husband\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(l)(i) defines separate property as \u201call property, real and personal, acquired by either party before the marriage.... \u201d Marital property is defined as all other property acquired by each party during the marriage that is not separate property. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The non-compete agreement, contingent upon forbearance of employment, is analogous to a severance package. Severance pay contemplates a salary substitute for future lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>wages. Much like severance pay, the one million dollars replaced lost earnings during the period of time the husband was not working in competition with Telco.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><em>Luczkovich v. Luczkovich, </em>26 Va.App. 702, 496 S.E.2d 157 (1998), in which we discussed the classification of severance pay, is instructive. In <em>Luczkovich </em>the husband contended his severance pay was separate property because he negotiated and received the severance pay two years after the parties separated. While agreeing with husband, we established the criteria for determining whether severance pay is marital or separate property. In reviewing decisions from other states, we concluded \u201c[t]hose decisions provide that the touchstone of the classification is whether the severance pay was intended to compensate the employee for efforts made during the marriage or to replace post-separation earnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708-09, 496 S.E.2d at 160. We also opined that \u201cseverance pay is \u2018a mere expectancy,\u2019 it has no value until the termination of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709, 496 S.E.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Similarly, our analysis here is whether the one million dollars for non-competition was to compensate husband for forbearance made prior to the marriage or to compensate him for efforts made during the marriage. When husband executed the non-compete agreement, the million-dollar payment was a \u201cmere expectancy.\u201d It would only be earned for events that took place during the marriage. The non-compete clause is intended to curtail husband\u2019s ability to earn his livelihood for one year following his termination from employment. This livelihood, had it been earned, would clearly be marital property. Although the agreement was negotiated prior to the marriage, the right to receive payment was contingent upon the husband not engaging in a particular business in the future. While married, husband fulfilled this obligation and Telco paid him the sum of one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Husband claims no effort was required by him to collect his money. He earned it as soon as he signed the contract. We do not agree. Consummation of the contract depended on husband\u2019s conduct during the period following his employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>with Telco. Any decision to breach or not breach the agreement would have been made during that time and during the course of the marriage. Additionally, had he violated the agreement, any income earned as a result of the prohibited employment would have been earned during the marriage and become marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">It is clear that the payment for not competing with Telco is within the definition of marital property since the right to receive the money was acquired during the marriage and is not separate property as defined in Code \u00a7 20-107.3. As to this issue, we remand to the trial court to classify this item as marital property and to determine whether this asset is subject to equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">II. BURDEN OF PROOF \u2014 PERSONAL EFFORTS</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Wife contends the trial court incorrectly determined that Code \u00a7 20-107.3 places the burden on her to prove husband\u2019s efforts were the proximate cause \u201cof the substantial increase in the value of\u2019 his Telco stock. The correct burden of proof, she claims, is on the husband to prove the increase in value of the separate asset was not attributable to marital efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Wife concedes that our decisions in <em>Martin v. Martin, </em>27 Va.App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc), and <em>Gilman v. Gilman, </em>32 Va.App. 104, 526 S.E.2d 763 (2000), establish the correct burden of proof under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Wife argues in her brief that because Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) allows the owning spouse to claim rights to \u201cpassive appreciation\u201d in the value of separate property, the statute therefore places the burden on the owning spouse to prove that the increase in value of the separate property was not attributable to marital efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The trial court relied on <em>Martin </em>in determining the \u201cnon-owning spouse must prove that the personal efforts were significant and resulted in substantial appreciation.\u201d The trial court also cited <em>Gilman </em>while reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>So by the time we have the appellate court talking about those particular parts of 20-107.3, we have the discussion of \u201csignificant efforts,\u201d \u201csubstantial appreciation,\u201d and \u201cproximate cause.\u201d As noted in Defendant\u2019s brief in closing, the use of proximate cause unites the law of personal injury with the law of equitable distribution \u2014 in an ingenious way, I believe \u2014 that is logical and certainly helpful to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhS\">We conclude the trial court properly articulated and applied the correct burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">1. Separate property is (i) all property, real and personal, acquired by either party before the marriage; (ii) all property acquired during the marriage by bequest, devise, descent, survivorship or gift from a spouse other than the other party; (iii) all property acquired during the marriage in exchange for or from the proceeds of sale of separate property, provided that such property acquired during the marriage is maintained as separate property; and (iv) that part of any property classified as separate pursuant to subdivision A 3. Income received from separate property during the marriage is separate property if not attributable to the personal effort of either party. The increase in value of separate property during the marriage is separate property, unless marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases and then only to the extent of the increases in value attributable to such contributions. The personal efforts of either party must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property if any increase in value attributable thereto is to be considered marital property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">The court shall classify property as part marital property and part separate property as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">In the case of income received from separate property during the marriage, such income shall be marital property only to the extent it is attributable to the personal efforts of either party. In the case of the increase in value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>separate property during the marriage, such increase in value shall be marital property only to the extent that marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases, provided that any such personal efforts must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">For purposes of this subdivision, the non-owning spouse shall bear the burden of proving that (i) contributions of marital property or personal effort were made and (ii) the separate property increased in value. Once this burden of proof is met, the owning spouse shall bear the burden of proving that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contributions of marital property or personal effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cPersonal effort\u201d of a party shall be deemed to be labor, effort, inventiveness, physical or intellectual skill, creativity, or managerial, promotional or marketing activity applied directly to the separate property of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In reading these two statutory provisions together, we established a three-tiered burden of proof. First, the owner must prove the property is separate property as defined in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(l). Here, the fact that the Telco stock is separate property is not contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Second, under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a), the non-owning spouse, here the wife, has the burden to prove (i) contributions of marital property or personal efforts were made and (ii) the separate property increased in value. \u201cTo the extent the non-owning spouse claims that the increase in value was attributable to personal efforts, the non-owning spouse must prove that the personal efforts were \u2018significant\u2019 and resulted in \u2018substantial appreciation\u2019 of the owning spouse\u2019s separate property interest. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a).\u201d <em>Martin, </em>27 Va.App. at 751, 501 S.E.2d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Third, \u201conce the non-owning spouse overcomes the presumption of separateness of the increase in value, the burden shifts to the owning spouse to prove that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>marital property or significant personal effort. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Wife\u2019s argument ignores the second tier of proof directed at the non-owning spouse and focuses solely on the third tier. The burden shifts to the owning spouse only after the non-owning spouse proves that the substantial increase in value was caused by significant personal efforts. Here, the trial court correctly assigned the original burden of proof to wife, the non-owning spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Wife further complains that the trial court erred by adding \u201cproximate cause\u201d to the burden of proof requirement so that the non-owning spouse must prove the owning spouse\u2019s efforts were the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of substantial increase in the value of the business. We reject this argument because of the language in <em>Gilman. </em>\u2018While Pettus undoubtedly employed intellectual skill in selecting properties to be purchased, the evidence was insufficient to prove that Pettus contributed \u2018significant\u2019 personal effort that was the proximate cause of \u2018substantial appreciation\u2019 in the value of these assets.\u201d <em>Gilman, </em>32 Va.App. at 121, 526 S.E.2d at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Thus, we conclude the trial court applied the proper burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">III. INCREASE IN VALUE OF SEPARATE PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Since we find that the trial court erred in ordering wife to produce her expert\u2019s reports and in limiting and excluding certain testimony of her experts which would address whether certain increases in the value of separate property resulted from the personal efforts of the husband, we remand for additional evidence the issues of (A) increase in the value of separate property and (B) whether husband\u2019s salary adequately compensated the marital estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>IV. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The trial court initially awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to wife in the amount of $105,000. In doing so, the trial court stated that the contrast between the husband\u2019s ability to pay and wife\u2019s ability to pay \u201ccould not be greater.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[i]n contrast to her financial situation, her husband has millions of dollars.\u201d Husband reminded the court that during discovery the wife repeatedly denied his requests for admission and caused, he argued, the necessity of going to trial and hiring experts. \u201cThey should be held accountable for their evaluation of the strength of their case.\u201d The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">I think when a judge considers attorney\u2019s fees at this point, the considerations are a little different. I mean, I have to consider the equities. And I cannot say that [counsel\u2019s] arguments was [sic] completely frivolous or that it had no merit or that they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to bring it to trial, or that I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to consider fees at this point because they lost so badly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Husband filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that in making an award of attorney\u2019s fees the court must examine (a) the results of the litigation, (b) the alternatives offered to litigation in the form of settlement offers made by each party, and (c) the actions of a party during litigation which increase its costs. He contended that ability to pay should govern the amount of the award only after these threshold criteria have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The trial court conducted a hearing and ruled from the bench. Regarding the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">I have read Mr. Cottrell\u2019s [counsel for husband] brief on that and I think he\u2019s right. So I\u2019m taking back the attorney\u2019s fees, except for the $8,000.00 that\u2019s owed as costs to the vendors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">jf\u00ed <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">[I]t\u2019s fundamentally unfair to take someone who has had to litigate the case to the extent that they did, and then win <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the case to the extent that they did, and then require them also to pay her fees on top of that, that that\u2019s fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">sfc * <em>* </em>sf: Jfi Jj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">In other words, what I think [counsel] said was, ability to pay is not the only factor in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[I]f a wife needs and is entitled to maintenance and support, and the husband has the financial ability to meet these needs, then the trial court should award attorney\u2019s fees to the wife. That\u2019s a really, that\u2019s a conclusion that disregards everything the [counsel for husband] has just said ... if I just took financial ability to pay and her need, then there wouldn\u2019t be [counsel\u2019s] arguments would be absolutely beside the point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Wife argues that because the trial court awarded her spousal support, the court was compelled to also award her attorney\u2019s fees. Husband responds that the mere fact that a wife is entitled to support and the husband has the ability to pay does not obligate the trial court to award her attorney\u2019s fees. We agree with the husband on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The question of whether to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201c \u2018is a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 375, 585 S.E.2d 349, 354 (2003) (quoting <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 199-200, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002)); <em>see also Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987). \u201cGiven the unique equities of each case, our appellate review steers clear of inflexible rules and focuses instead on \u2018reasonableness under all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 375, 585 S.E.2d at 354 (quoting <em>Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 429, 551 S.E.2d 10, 24 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Citing <em>Poliquin v. Poliquin, </em>12 Va.App. 676, 406 S.E.2d 401 (1991), the wife argues that where a spouse needs and is entitled to maintenance and support, and the other spouse has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the financial ability to meets those needs, then the court abuses its discretion in denying an award to the needy spouse. Relying on the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>217 Va. 502, 505, 229 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1976), we noted in <em>Poliquin </em>that \u201c \u2018[w]here ... the trial court finds the wife needs and is entitled to maintenance and support and the husband has the financial ability to meet those needs, its failure to award counsel fees to her is, in our opinion, an abuse of ... discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poliquin, </em>12 Va.App. at 681, 406 S.E.2d at 405 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>217 Va. at 505, 229 S.E.2d at 890) (omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Husband points out that in <em>Artis v. Artis, </em>4 Va.App. 132, 138, 354 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1987), this Court adopted a broader interpretation of <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">We do not believe that the court in <em>Thomas </em>intended to adopt a rule that whenever a wife is granted support, the trial court must automatically award attorney\u2019s fees. An award of attorney\u2019s fees to a party in a divorce suit is a matter for the trial court\u2019s sound discretion after considering the circumstances and equities of the entire case. <em>See Rowand v. Rowand, </em>215 Va. 344, 346-7, 210 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1974). The equities in the <em>Thomas </em>case warranted an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Thus, argues the husband, our opinion in <em>Artis </em>gave the trial court discretion to consider the equities of the entire case and not just the husband\u2019s ability to pay. We agree. We read <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Poliquin </em>to say that the relative financial abilities and support issues should be considered as factors in weighing the equities. However, these factors are not exclusively determinative of whether an award should or should not be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The record reflects that the wife sent a letter to the husband offering settlement in the amount of approximately $3,500,000. The husband countered with an offer to settle in the amount of $1,000,000. Wife declined, and the case was litigated over a period of seven days. The record also shows that on December 5, 2002 husband served forty Requests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Admission on wife. On December 26, 2002 she admitted one request, and denied or could not \u201ctruthfully admit\u201d the remaining thirty-nine requests. Her evasive responses, citing a present lack of information, prompted husband to file a motion to compel. The trial court conducted a hearing on January 24, 2003 and ordered the wife to comply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then instructed the parties to return to court on February 7, 2003 to assure wife\u2019s compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The record contains no evidence that the husband\u2019s conduct compounded the cost of litigation requiring him to reimburse her fees. <em>Cf. Smith v. Smith, </em>43 Va.App. 279, 290, 597 S.E.2d 250, 256 (2004) (\u201cThe award of [attorney\u2019s] fees seems to us particularly appropriate given the effort required to litigate the issue of the marital home.... \u201d); <em>Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 571 S.E.2d 912 (ordering wife to pay a share of husband\u2019s attorneys fees because of her conduct in delaying the case). Finally, husband\u2019s actions did not contribute to wife\u2019s costs to secure access to the justice system. <em>Via v. Via, </em>14 Va.App. 868, 872, 419 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">After reconsidering the issues,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court concluded that the wife\u2019s conduct, in part, precluded her from having her fees paid by the husband.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where the record contains credible evidence in support of the findings made by the court, we may not retry the facts or substitute our view of the facts for those of the trial court. <em>Ferguson v. Stafford County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>14 Va.App. 333, 336, 417 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1992). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Here, the trial court carefully considered the claims involved in the divorce proceedings, as well as the husband\u2019s success at trial, the wife\u2019s refusal of a reasonable offer of settlement, and the wife\u2019s injudicious handling of discovery. The court simply ordered that wife pay her own attorney\u2019s fees. However, since the trial court, in part, denied wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees because husband substantially prevailed below, and we are reversing the trial court on several significant issues, we remand for the trial court to reconsider the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for the previous proceeding and to determine whether additional attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Y. NON-GIFTED PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">During the marriage, the husband purchased four properties with his separate funds and titled each property jointly in both husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s names.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He testified that the purpose for joint titling was for protection against creditors. He said he never intended for wife to have any interest in the property upon a divorce. With regard to the Nantucket property, he denied telling wife the property was her Christmas present. Wife claims that joint titling of the real estate for \u201casset protection\u201d establishes his intent to gift her an interest in that property. Husband claims wife did not meet her burden of proving donative intent and that the real estate remains his separate property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>When separate property is retitled in the joint names of the parties, the retitled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property. However, to the extent the property is retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence and was not a gift, the retitled property shall retain its original classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Here, the only issue is whether the retitling of the properties in question were gifts. If so, the properties are marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A gift is not presumed when existing property is retitled into joint ownership. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g).

Utsch, </em>266 Va. 124, 128, 581 S.E.2d 507, 508 (2003). In order to prove an interspousal gift, the wife must prove the husband\u2019s donative intent and the nature and extent of that intent. <em>Lightburn v. Lightburn, </em>22 Va.App. 612, 617, 472 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1996); <em>Theismann v.

Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the evidence establishes that the husband titled the properties in joint names to protect his personal assets. He testified that he felt it was wise to title the homes in both names to guard against creditor seizure. Although the wife claimed that the properties were gifts to her, the trial court was free to disregard her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>testimony, which it did. The trial judge heard the testimony of the witnesses and observed their demeanor. At the conclusion of the evidence the court found that wife\u2019s testimony was not credible and husband\u2019s was. \u201c \u2018In determining whether credible evidence exists, the appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 195, 480 S.E.2d 792, 795 (1997) (quoting <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Wife cites <em>Dean v. Dean, </em>8 Va.App. 143, 379 S.E.2d 742 (1989), as authority that jointly titling stock in order to take advantage of tax benefits establishes donative intent. In <em>Dean, </em>the issue was whether husband made an <em>inter vivos </em>gift of CSX stock to wife when he conveyed the stock jointly to husband and wife. Husband claimed he merely intended to make wife a \u201cnominal holder\u201d as a convenience and not to transfer ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We upheld the trial court\u2019s finding of donative intent, finding \u201c[t]he registration of the security establishes <em>prima facie </em>that Frederick Dean intended to make an <em>inter vivos </em>gift of the stock to Marilyn Dean at the time he purchased it and registered it in their names.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 379 S.E.2d at 744 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">We find that the evidence supports the finding of the trial court that Frederick Dean intended Mrs. Dean to be more than a \u201cnominal\u201d holder of the stock. In fact, the record clearly establishes his donative intent and the reasons for his making a gift of the stock to his wife. By making a gift they could share a joint tax benefit by deducting the cost of their annual trips to the shareholders\u2019 meetings, and the gift of the stock together with the survivorship rights to Mr. Dean\u2019s interest would give the wife \u201cimmediate liquidity\u201d at his death. Apparently, Mr. Dean would have us hold that a gift of property made in order to take advantage of a tax benefit is ineffectual. The right of the Deans to legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>claim a tax benefit by deducting her expenses exists only if Marilyn Dean owned the stock. Thus, contrary to Frederick Dean\u2019s claim the record establishes the donative intent necessary on his part to have made an <em>inter vivos </em>gift of the stock to Marilyn Dean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 146-47, 379 S.E.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We believe <em>Dean </em>is distinguishable. First, we upheld the trial court\u2019s factual determination of donative intent. A person who claims ownership of property by gift must prove the donative intent of the donor. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 379 S.E.2d at 744. Intent is a question to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See generally Fleming v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 349, 353, 412 S.E.2d 180, 183 (1991). <em>Dean </em>was a standard of review case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Second, <em>Dean </em>is premised on a presumption that no longer exists, i.e., that \u201cregistration of the security establishes <em>prima facie </em>that [husband] intended\u201d a gift to wife. <em>Dean, </em>8 Va.App. at 146, 379 S.E.2d at 744. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g), enacted by the General Assembly in 1991, specifically rejects such a presumption when existing property is retitled into joint ownership. Wife acknowledges in her brief that <em>Dean </em>was decided \u201cbefore the advent of tracing and the dual classification approach under the current statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Appellant also cites <em>Utsch, </em>266 Va. 124, 581 S.E.2d 507, to support her contention that the transfer was a gift. However, <em>Utsch </em>is distinguishable on its facts. Husband, by deed of gift, in consideration of \u201clove and affection\u201d conveyed the marital residence from his sole name to husband and wife, as tenants by the entireties. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 581 S.E.2d at 508. The issue in <em>Utsch </em>was whether this Court erred in ruling that while the deed of gift was unambiguous concerning the intent to retitle the property, \u201c[fit does not necessarily follow, however, that [hjusband intended to convey the property into the marital estate and thus relinquish his separate interest in the property for the purposes of equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 581 S.E.2d at 509. Not relying on the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the deed of gift, this Court considered other evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>determine donative intent. In this context, the Supreme Court of Virginia held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Nowhere in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f) is there a requirement of proof that a gift was intended for a particular purpose. The proof required under the statutory provision is simply that the transfer was a gift. As we have previously held in a case involving a grantor\u2019s intent in a deed, \u201c[i]f [the party] intended the deed to be operative for one purpose, he must be taken to have intended it to be operative for all purposes apparent on its face.\u201d <em>Capozzella v. Capozzella, </em>213 Va. 820, 824, 196 S.E.2d 67, 70 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 128-29, 581 S.E.2d at 509. The Supreme Court found that the deed of gift was unambiguous on its face and that the parol evidence rule barred any other evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent. \u201cThe deed not only shows by clear and convincing evidence the intent to jointly title the marital residence, but it also shows the donative intent of Husband in making the transfer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 581 S.E.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Appellant concludes from <em>Utsch </em>that since husband conveyed the properties jointly, even for the purpose of protecting his assets, the deed is operative for all purposes, including an intent to gift the property to appellant. This argument ignores the basic finding in <em>Utsch </em>that the deed of gift, in itself, shows donative intent and parole evidence cannot be used to contradict the unambiguous terms of the deed of gift. Further, the language in <em>Utsch </em>relied upon by the wife is <em>dicta.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Its inclusion in the <em>Utsch </em>opinion is not necessary to the resolution of the narrow issue in that case, which is only whether or not parole evidence may be admitted to prove intent on a deed of gift \u201cunambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 581 S.E.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that appellant did not meet her burden of proof to show these property transfers were gifts. There is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">VI. RETROACTIVE AWARD \u2014 CHILD SUPPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Wife contends the trial court erred in not making the child support award retroactive to the date of the filing of the original bill of complaint. Wife claims that pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> she was entitled to retroactive support from November 6, 2001. Husband contends that his commitment to \u201cmaintain the financial status quo for the time being\u201d satisfied his child support obligation pending the outcome of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Husband argued below that he should be given a credit for payments made under a \u201cstatus quo\u201d agreement if the trial court made a retroactive award. The trial court, in refusing to order child support retroactively from the date of filing, ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">I think that, generally speaking, the fact that there was a status quo arrangement between these parties whereby \u2014 as I said, generally speaking \u2014 Mr. Cirrito continued to pay the majority of the household expenses \u2014 and of course, the biggest expense, I suppose, is the mortgage \u2014 makes any kind of effort that I would make to retroactively calculate child support kind of \u2014 \u201cridiculous\u201d is a hard word \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult for me to make any real accounting sense and to go back and do that given the amount of money that Mr. Cirrito has paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">To some extent, you know, all of those expenses that maintain the house also, of course, maintain a roof over Tommy\u2019s head, so I\u2019m not going to do that. I think that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>has paid equivalent to a <em>pendente lite </em>order and \u2014 although the parties called it a status quo order \u2014 so my order, then, will become effective \u2014 I think everyone concedes \u2014 June 1st in terms of child support, and as I understand Mr. Cottrell, Mr. Cirrito has paid that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Okay. So I agree that there\u2019s going to be no adjustment on child support. The status quo arrangement has to be meaningful. It has to mean something. And it was what the attorneys worked out. And as I said, I think it has the equivalent effect of a <em>pendente lite </em>order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Thus, the trial court concluded that the voluntary \u201cstatus quo\u201d payments were the equivalent of a <em>pendente lite </em>order, satisfying the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Interestingly, both appellant and appellee argue whether or not the \u201cstatus quo\u201d payments were \u201cnon-conforming payments\u201d under <em>Gallagher v. Gallagher, </em>35 Va.App. 470, 546 S.E.2d 222 (2001).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Husband acknowledges that he had an obligation to pay child support, yet contends that he should receive credit for the voluntary payments he made. He argues that his previous payments (including mortgage, maintenance and taxes on the home) satisfied the requirements of child support since the benefit of such payments ultimately inured to the child. Wife contends those payments, consisting mostly of mortgage payments and related housing expenses, inured to husband\u2019s benefit since the trial court ruled the house was his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>That analysis is of no value to the resolution of this issue. The issue before us is not whether the trial court properly considered credits based on husband\u2019s \u201cstatus quo\u201d payments. As this argument is not part of the questions presented that were designated for appeal, we will not address this issue. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e)-(e); <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 39 n. 4, 542 S.E.2d 785, 789 n. 4 (2001) (finding \u201can issue [was] not expressly stated among the \u2018questions presented,\u2019 ... we, therefore, decline to consider [it] on appeal\u201d). The only issue before us is whether the trial court erred in not making the child support payments retroactive to the date of filing the original bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Code \u00a7 20-108.1 controls the award of child support payments. The General Assembly amended the statute in 1996 to specifically mandate that \u201c[liability for support shall be determined retroactively for the period measured from the date that the proceeding was commenced by the filing of an action with any court.\u201d In its ordinary use, \u201c \u2018shall\u2019 is a word of command, and is the language of command, and is the ordinary, usual, and natural word used in connection with a mandate.\u201d <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 911, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992) (quoting <em>Andrews v. Shepherd, </em>201 Va. 412, 414, 111 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1959)). \u201cShall,\u201d however, does not always impose a mandatory condition. <em>Cook v. Radford Community Hospital, Inc., </em>260 Va. 443, 447, 536 S.E.2d 906, 908 (2000) (citing <em>White v. Morano, </em>249 Va. 27, 32, 452 S.E.2d 856, 859 (1995)). As the Supreme Court of Virginia stated in <em>TM Delmarva Power v. NCP of Virginia, </em>263 Va. 116, 121, 557 S.E.2d 199, 201 (2002),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">while the word \u201cshall\u201d is primarily mandatory in effect, and \u201cmay\u201d is primarily permissive in effect, courts, in endeavoring to arrive at the meaning of written language, whether used in a will, a contract, or a statute, will construe \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d as permissive or mandatory in accordance with the subject matter and context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Here, we are dealing with the support of children. In this context, it is apparent the legislature intended that \u201cshall\u201d be mandatory. This language provides a substantive right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>children. There is no latitude under the statute. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 20-108 (no support order may be retroactively modified, but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification in any court, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding party). Under Code \u00a7 20-108, the legislature gave the trial court the discretion in modifying support during the pendency of the petition. Such is not the case in Code \u00a7 20-108.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The husband further argues that the granting of retroactive support is a windfall and would contravene public policy of voluntary settlements. \u201c[I]t is the responsibility of the legislature, not the judiciary, to formulate public policy, to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests----\u201d <em>Wood v. Bd. of Supervisors of Halifax Cty., </em>236 Va. 104, 115, 372 S.E.2d 611, 618 (1988). We therefore decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We find that the trial court erred in not awarding child support from the date of the commencement of the proceeding. We do not address whether husband is entitled to any credits for his voluntary payments or whether the court can consider these payments as deviation factors under Code \u00a7 20-108.2. We remand for the trial court to enter an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">VII. EXPERT REPORTS</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In December, 2002, the husband issued a Second Request for Admissions to \"wife asking, in part, the wife to admit certain property was husband\u2019s separate property. Husband also issued a corresponding Third Set of Interrogatories directing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">For any of the Second Request for Admissions served simultaneously herewith which you have not admitted, state in detail and particularity your basis and reasons for not admitting each such Request and identify all documents, if any, on which you rely in support of your reasons for not admitting the Request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Wife responded that the information requested was presently unknown to her because to answer would require the assistance of experts who have not yet been identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In January of 2003 husband filed a \u201cMotion to Deem Defendant\u2019s Second Requests for Admissions Admitted or to Compel Complainant\u2019s Unequivocal Response to the Same and to Compel Complainant\u2019s Response to Corresponding Interrogatory.\u201d Husband asked for the following relief:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">1. That the Defendant\u2019s Second Requests for Admissions be deemed admitted or, in the alternative, that the Complainant be compelled to immediately and unequivocally respond to Defendant\u2019s Second Requests for Admissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">2. That the Defendant be awarded his attorneys\u2019 fees and cost expended in this behalf; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">3. That the Defendant be awarded such other and further relief as this Court deems mete and just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">On January 24, 2003 the trial court heard arguments on the motion. The court ordered that wife (1) respond to the Second Request for Admission; (2) provide substantive answers to husband\u2019s Third Set of Interrogatories; and (3) provide husband with wife\u2019s expert\u2019s reports. Wife argued that the motion before the court was only to \u201cupdate\u201d her responses to the Requests for Admissions and Interrogatories and not to turn over her expert reports. Wife endorsed the written order \u201cSeen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The court gave the wife until February 3, 2003 to provide the expert\u2019s reports to husband and continued the matter to February 7, 2003. On February 11, 2003 the court issued an opinion letter stating, in part, that wife had failed to comply with the January 24, 2003 order. Although wife furnished husband with three reports, the court found one report (Tolsdorfs) to be \u201cinsubstantial\u201d and \u201cuninformative\u201d and ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that Tolsdorf would not be allowed to testify at trial. As to the other two experts, the court found that those reports addressed only three of the five issues outlined in the report. As a result, those experts would be limited to testifying to only those three issues discussed in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The trial court said in its opinion letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">In reaching the decision contained in this letter opinion, I am constrained to say that the relief I have granted Mr. Cirrito may be problematic for the reasons I will set forth immediately below. However, I grant this relief on account of the circumstances of this case and the wholesale failure of Mrs. Cirrito, having been furnished multiple continuances, both to comply with discovery and to comply with Judge MacKay\u2019s January 24 order. The two problematic circumstances that trouble me are these. First, neither in early December, 2002, nor in January, 2003, did Mr. Cirrito attempt to compel Mrs. Cirrito to furnish the Rule 4:1 information relating to her experts. However, he did propound requests for admissions, and I conclude that by propounding complimentary discovery requiring Mrs. Cirri-to to furnish the reasons she could not furnish reasons for answering such discovery, he essentially sought the same relief. Second, the February 7 hearing was scheduled for the purpose of determining whether or not Mrs. Cirrito had complied with Judge MacKay\u2019s order. Although such a hearing was discussed in Judge MacKay\u2019s January 24 order, it was not set in that order or otherwise framed by a motion or praecipe filed with the Clerk. However, it is plain that both parties were prepared to address the issue of compliance with the January 24 order; and Mrs. Cirrito\u2019s counsel did not contend that she lacked notice of the hearing or its purpose. That said, Mr. Cottrell did not file a Rule 4:12 motion seeking sanctions beyond his request to have the admissions deemed admitted. This raises a question whether or not this Court was authorized to grant relief \u2014 other than deeming the facts and matters framed by his admission requests \u2014 admitted. I conclude that the relief I have or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>dered is less onerous than deeming the matters admitted. And I have done so, out of caution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The order incorporating the opinion letter was entered February 28, 2003. Wife endorsed the order \u201cSeen and objected to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We find the trial court erred in directing the wife to provide husband with her expert\u2019s reports and imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Wife contends on appeal that the trial court had no authority to direct her to provide husband with her expert\u2019s reports because husband never requested them in discovery. Husband argues that our consideration of this issue is defaulted because wife endorsed the court order \u201cSeen\u201d without objection and agreed during the January 24, 2003 hearing to deliver her reports to him. We conclude that this issue is not barred by Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">After the trial court instructed wife to provide her expert\u2019s reports, counsel remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">There\u2019s nothing on the motion today about me turning over my expert\u2019s reports. I\u2019m saying that the motion before the Court today is for me to update my responses to the requests to admissions and to update the answers to interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The court later commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">Well, he\u2019s not even agreeing to give you the report. I\u2019m trying to cut down on the paperwork. If you got the report on Friday, you want the responses to discovery at the same time?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">The court then inquired of the husband\u2019s counsel, \u201cAnd you think I have the authority to order him to turn over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>report?\u201d Finally, at the February 7, 2003 hearing wife again told the court that there \u201cwas never a motion in this court for us to furnish the names of our experts or to furnish expert reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals. <em>Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991). The purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to allow the trial court to correct in the trial court any error that is called to its attention. <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 514, 404 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1991). Clearly, the wife alerted the court to the issue that turning over the reports was not noticed and was not before the court. Although counsel endorsed the January 24, 2003 order \u201cSeen\u201d without objection, her comments during the hearing and the court\u2019s subsequent responses indicate that the wife took exception to the court\u2019s order directing her to provide husband with her expert\u2019s reports. We find no merit in husband\u2019s contention that wife\u2019s \u201cguarantee\u201d to provide the expert opinions at the close of the hearing was an abandonment of her objection. We hold that the issue was preserved and that we may consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Wife argues on brief that no notice was given to her that this issue would be raised at the January 24, 2003 hearing and the trial court had no authority to order her to turn over her reports because no such motion was before the court. We agree. The motion before the court on that date sought only to compel wife to answer husband\u2019s requests for admissions, and in the alternative, to deem the requests admitted pursuant to Rule 4:11. Husband did not seek to compel responses to interrogatories under Rule 4:12, nor did he seek discovery of wife\u2019s expert\u2019s reports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201cFundamental rules of pleading provide that no court can base its judgment or decree upon a right which has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>been pleaded and claimed.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>2 Va.App. 16, 18, 340 S.E.2d 578, 580 (1986). The purpose in requiring \u201cpleadings is to give notice to the opposing party of the nature and character of the claim, without which the most rudimentary due process safeguards would be denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 340 S.E.2d at 580.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cThe basis of every right of recovery under our system of jurisprudence is a pleading setting forth facts warranting the granting of the relief sought. It is the <em>sine qua non </em>of every judgment or decree. No court can base its decree upon facts not alleged, nor render its judgment upon a right, however meritorious, which has not been pleaded and claimed---- Pleadings are as essential as proof, the one being unavailing without the other. A decree cannot be entered in the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same, and if so entered it is void.... Every litigant is entitled to be told by his adversary in plain and explicit language what is his ground of complaint or defense____ The issues in a case are made by the pleadings, and not by the testimony of witnesses or other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\"><em>Gologanoff v. Gologanoff, </em>6 Va.App. 340, 346, 369 S.E.2d 446, 449 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Because the husband never asserted a request for the reports, we find that the court erred in granting husband relief he never sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The wife further asserts that the trial court improperly imposed sanctions for her failure to provide a complete expert designation, including reports, although no motion to compel nor motion for sanctions was before the court. Again, husband claims that wife did not properly preserve this issue as required by Rule 5A:18. He argues that wife objected to the order for sanctions only to the extent that she believed she had complied with the January 24, 2003 order and not that the motions were not properly docketed. We conclude that wife sufficiently preserved the question for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">It is clear by the court\u2019s opinion letter that the court understood the issue of the propriety of sanctions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>opinion letter sets forth the challenged issue, referring to it as \u201cproblematic,\u201d and the wife preserved it by her general objection to the entry of the February 28, 2003 order. Although counsel failed to include any specific grounds for the objection on the written order, the ruling made by the trial court was narrow enough to make obvious the basis of appellant\u2019s objection. <em>See Mackie v. Hill, </em>16 Va.App. 229, 231, 429 S.E.2d 37, 38 (1993). Accordingly, we hold that Rule 5A:18 was met in this case and that we may consider the merits of appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Rule 4:l(b)(4)(A)(i) sets forth how a party can, through interrogatories, discover whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify. Rule 4:12 addresses sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">1. Upon notice, a party may seek an order compelling discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">2. The court may order compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">3. If the court order compelling discovery is violated, the court \u201cmay make such orders in regard to the failure as are just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Rule 4:ll(a) sets forth sanctions for not complying with requests for admission. The court may order the matter admitted or allow an amended answer to be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">We conclude that the trial court here did not follow established discovery procedure. The trial court acknowledged that husband never asked wife to furnish expert information pursuant to Rule 4:1. The court recognized that the husband did not, in his January 2003 motion, attempt to compel the wife to furnish Rule 4:1 information relating to her experts. The court, however, concluded that the requests for admission, combined with the interrogatories, sought the same information as a Rule 4:1 request for identification of experts and was therefore the equivalent of a Rule 4:1 request. Such was the court\u2019s basis for imposing sanctions when the wife did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>not comply with the order directing her to reveal her expert\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">As a matter of law, husband\u2019s Second Request for Admissions and Third Set of Interrogatories did not authorize him to require wife to identify experts or provide expert reports under Rule 4:1. The interrogatories did not seek to identify experts. They did not attempt to elicit a response concerning experts. Similarly, the requests for admission simply sought classification of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In not following correct procedure, the trial court \u201cshort circuited\u201d the legal process. <em>See Walsh v. Bennett, </em>260 Va. 171, 176, 530 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2000). The husband never asked for the expert reports pursuant to Rule 4:1. The husband never made a motion to compel the reports and never asked for sanctions for wife\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 4:1. The court recognized that husband never filed a Rule 4:12 motion seeking sanctions. Still, the trial court unnecessarily \u201cshort circuited\u201d the legal process by prematurely imposing sanctions and preventing the wife from presenting evidence through her expert witnesses. While we acknowledge the court was attempting to impose sanctions \u201cless onerous\u201d than deeming the Requests for Admissions admitted, the court erred in not following the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We find that the trial court did not properly follow the discovery process. The court erred by limiting the testimony of wife\u2019s expert witnesses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">We find that the trial court did not err in (1) determining that wife had the burden to prove husband\u2019s significant personal efforts were the proximate cause of a substantial increase in the value of certain assets, and (2) finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>jointly titled property was not gifted to wife. We find that the trial court erred in (1) determining a payment to husband pursuant to a non-compete agreement was husband\u2019s separate property, (2) refusing to award child support retroactive to the date the divorce was filed, and (3) ordering -wife to produce expert reports and excluding and limiting certain expert testimony at trial. Accordingly, we remand the issues of child support and the non-compete payment for the trial court to enter orders consistent with this opinion. We remand to the trial court for a determination of attorney\u2019s fees, discovery issues, and the equitable distribution issues discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Husband has requested attorney\u2019s fees for matters relating to this appeal. Upon consideration of the entire record in this case, we deny husband\u2019s request. <em>See O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 479 S.E.2d 98 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part, reversed and remanded, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\">. Husband argues on brief that the issue is moot. He suggests that even if the payment is marital property, there is no evidence showing what became of the proceeds. Husband fails to cite any supporting principles of law or authority. \"Statements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Roberts, </em>41 Va.App. 513, 527, 586 S.E.2d 290, 297 (2003) (citation omitted). Having presented no citations or authority in his brief in support of this argument, husband has waived this argument on appeal and we need not address it. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">. <em>See </em>Section VII of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">.

The wife asserts that the court\u2019s comment that wife \"thought she had a bona fide claim to millions of dollars in this case\" is an explicit finding that she had a right to bring the case to trial. Husband challenges the importance of this statement in light of the decision of the court to reconsider. In any event, because we find that the court made this comment prior to reconsideration of the issue, we need not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. The trial court ruled specifically that the Florida condominium is separate, non-gifted property. Although the husband omits this property in his statement of facts, we consider the Florida condominium as part of the jointly titled property in this discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. Wife also argues public policy disfavors permitting a party to title property jointly to avoid creditors and later claim the spouse has no right to that property. Wife cites no authority for that proposition nor does she develop that argument. Statements unsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not permit appellate consideration. <em>Buchanan v.
