On appeal, Shreve contends the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove that her suspended license was not a \u201cvalid\u201d license as contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-300. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">The record before us includes, in lieu of a transcript, a written statement of facts, made a part of the record pursuant to Rule 5A:8. As set forth in that statement of facts, on September 9, 2002, Police Officer R.B. Dean received a report that Shreve was driving on a suspended license, traveling toward the Town of Stanley. Officer Dean stopped Shreve\u2019s vehicle in Page County. Shreve admitted that she had previously been stopped by the police and knew her license was suspended. Officer Dean charged Shreve with driving on a suspended license, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301. Shreve was subsequently convicted in general district court of driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>without a valid license, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-300. She appealed her conviction to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence consisted of Officer Dean\u2019s testimony and a certified copy of Shreve\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) driving record transcript, which was admitted into evidence. The DMV record reflected that, on March 22, 1999, DMV issued Shreve a driver\u2019s license with an expiration date of November 30, 2002. The record further revealed that, on May 1, 2002, DMV suspended Shreve\u2019s license effective May 16, 2002, for a \u201cnon motor vehicle related\u201d reason and that Shreve accepted notice of the order of suspension on May 6, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Shreve did not appear at trial, nor did her attorney present any evidence on her behalf. The Commonwealth argued that Shreve\u2019s license was \u201cinvalid.\u201d The trial court found Shreve guilty of driving without a valid license, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Thereafter, Shreve filed a motion to set aside her conviction, arguing that a suspension of a driver\u2019s license does not render the license invalid and that her license was valid until its expiration date of November 30, 2002. The trial court denied Shreve\u2019s motion and entered a final judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether Shreve\u2019s action of driving on a suspended license was sufficient, as a matter of law, to prove she was operating a motor vehicle with a license that was not \u201cvalid\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-300.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because this is a question of law involving the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of Code \u00a7 46.2-300, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (noting that, \u201calthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-300 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">No person ... shall drive any motor vehicle on any highway in the Commonwealth until such person has applied for a driver\u2019s license, as provided in this article, satisfactorily passed the examination required by \u00a7 46.2-325, and obtained a driver\u2019s license, <em>nor unless the license is valid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Shreve maintains, on appeal, that the Commonwealth failed to prove that her driver\u2019s license was not \u201cvalid\u201d under Code \u00a7 46.2-300 at the time of the alleged offense on September 9, 2002. She argues that, having obtained her driver\u2019s license by making a lawful application and passing the required examination, her license remained \u201cvalid\u201d until November 30, 2002, its expiration date. The \u201csuspension\u201d of her license, her argument continues, was merely a temporary withdrawal of the privilege to drive and did not, unlike a revocation, require reapplication at the end of the suspension period to be reinstated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, she concludes, notwithstanding the suspension of her privilege to drive, her license was still \u201cvalid\u201d on September 9, 2002, and she could not, therefore, be found guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In support of her argument that, even though it was suspended, her license was still valid under Code \u00a7 46.2-300 because she had obtained it via a lawful application and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>successful examination, Shreve relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Edenton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 413, 417, 316 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1984), that \u201c[t]he gravamen of the misdemeanor [offense of driving without a valid operator\u2019s license] ... is the act of operating a motor vehicle by a driver who has not obtained a valid operator\u2019s license by making a lawful application and passing the required examination.\u201d Shreve\u2019s reliance on that statement is misplaced, however, because the Supreme Court\u2019s inquiry in <em>Edenton </em>was limited to determining whether a defendant indicted for driving after having been adjudged an habitual offender could be convicted instead of driving without a valid operator\u2019s license. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 316 S.E.2d at 737-38. Analyzing a substantially similar statutory predecessor of Code \u00a7 46.2-300, the Court held that a defendant could not be so convicted because driving without a valid license was not a lesser-included offense of driving after having been adjudged an habitual offender. <em>Id. </em>at 417-18, 316 S.E.2d at 738. In reaching that conclusion, the Court focused on the distinctive element of the driving-without-a-valid-license offense \u2014 the act of driving without a valid operator\u2019s license \u2014 rather than on the question of what constituted a \u201cvalid\u201d license. Thus, we conclude that the Supreme Court did not undertake to define the term \u201cvalid operator\u2019s license\u201d in <em>Edenton </em>and, thus, its statement therein regarding the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the driving-without-a-valid-lieense offense does not control the resolution of the inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Turning to the statutory-interpretation issue presented in this case, we are mindful of the following familiar principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">It is one of the fundamental rules of construction of statutes that the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from a view of the whole and every part of the statute taken and compared together, giving to every word and every part of the statute, if possible, its due effect and meaning, and to the words used their ordinary and popular meaning, unless it plainly appears that they were used in some other sense. If the intention of the legislature can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>thus discovered, it is not permissible to add to or subtract from the words used in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918). Additionally, \u201cit is a cardinal principle of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth] ____Such a statute cannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960). Nevertheless, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)). \u201cWe must also assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[i]t would be absurd to conclude that the legislature would say the same thing twice in one statutory provision----The rules of statutory interpretation argue against reading any legislative enactment in a manner that will make a portion of it useless, repetitious, or absurd. On the contrary, it is well established that every act of the legislature should be read so as to give reasonable effect to every word and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-10\"><em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 673, 683, 472 S.E.2d 663, 667-68 (1996), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>24 Va.App. 253, 481 S.E.2d 495 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">These principles support the conclusion that the legislature intended to recognize separate violations of Code \u00a7 46.2-300 for (1) driving after failing to apply for a driver\u2019s license, satisfactorily pass the examination, and obtain the license and (2) driving without a valid license. Code \u00a7 46.2-300 prohibits a person from driving on the highways of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Virginia \u201cuntil\u201d the acts of applying for a license, passing an examination, and obtaining the license are accomplished. In addition, the statute prohibits a person from driving on the highways of Virginia \u201cunless the license is valid.\u201d In drafting the statute, the legislature separated the two prohibitions with a comma followed by the disjunctive word \u201cnor.\u201d We have noted that, pursuant to the rules of grammar, \u201cphrases separated by a comma and [a] disjunctive ... are independent.\u201d <em>Smoot v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 495, 501, 559 S.E.2d 409, 412 (2002). The disjunctive serves to connect the two parts of the sentence but also to keep them separate and independent. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the phrase prohibiting driving without a valid license is separate and independent from the phrase prohibiting driving after failing to apply for a driver\u2019s license, satisfactorily pass the examination, and obtain the license. \u201cEach phrase therefore[] specifies a separate and distinct proscription that may constitute a violation of ... the statute.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 191-92, 578 S.E.2d 97, 100 (2003). Hence, we reject Shreve\u2019s argument that the only ground for convicting her of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-300 required findings that she had not applied for a driver\u2019s license, not satisfactorily passed the examination, and not obtained the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We also reject Shreve\u2019s argument that driving on a \u201csuspended\u201d license did not constitute driving without a \u201cvalid\u201d license. Although Shreve had been issued a driver\u2019s license by DMV with an expiration date of November 30, 2002, on the date of the offense, that license was suspended, meaning that her license or privilege to drive on the highways of the Commonwealth had been \u201ctemporarily withdrawn.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100. Thus, Shreve\u2019s suspended license did not authorize her to operate a motor vehicle on the highway at the time of the offense. <em>Id. </em>Although the Code does not provide a definition of what constitutes a \u201cvalid\u201d license under Code \u00a7 46.2-300, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1586 (8th ed.2004) defines \u201cvalid\u201d as \u201cIllegally sufficient; binding.\u201d <em>See Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) (en banc) (noting that if the Code of Virginia does not provide a statute<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ry definition we may look to the dictionary definition to determine legislative intent). Thus, a driver\u2019s license is not \u201cvalid\u201d under Code \u00a7 46.2-300 unless it is legally sufficient to meet its intended purpose, namely, authorizing the operator of the motor vehicle to drive on the highways of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Because Shreve\u2019s suspended license was not legally sufficient to authorize her to drive a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth on September 9, 2002, her suspended license did not constitute a valid license. To conclude otherwise would yield an absurd result. <em>See Councill v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 610, 614, 560 S.E.2d 472, 473 (2002) (noting that a statute should not be construed in a way which leads to absurd results).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Shreve was guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-300, and we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\">. By order dated March 29, 2004, a three-judge panel of this Court denied Shreve\u2019s petition for appeal with regard to her claim that the trial court lacked authority to convict her of driving without a license in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-300 because that offense did not constitute a lesser-included offense of driving on a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301, the offense charged in the summons. That issue, therefore, is not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">.
