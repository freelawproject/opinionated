Wanting to remain under the care of his Virginia treating physician, Sexton refused to accept the demand of his employer, Apple Construction Corporation, to choose a new physician in Florida. Having failed to convince the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to compel the change of physicians, Apple Construction appeals. We affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to Sexton, the prevailing party before the commission. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003). Sexton sustained back and ankle injuries while at work for Apple Construction in 2001. Sexton applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Pursuant to his award, Sexton began receiving treatment from Dr. Ronald Childs, a Fairfax physician. Dr. Childs performed two back surgeries on Sexton. After the surgeries, Sexton continued to have symptoms of severe pain and ambulation limitations. While still recuperating, Sexton moved to Florida in March 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Apple Construction filed an application with the commission seeking to compel Sexton to choose from a panel of physicians in Florida, claiming that Sexton\u2019s medical condition would suffer if he remained under the care of Dr. Childs. Apple Construction also argued that its responsibility for travel reimbursement and its potential liability exposure for accidents in transit warranted the relief requested. Sexton responded by asserting that his recovery would suffer if he lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the continuity of care provided by Dr. Childs. As for any claim for travel expenses and any potential injury claims occurring during transit, Sexton agreed to waive any such claims so long as he could remain under the care of Dr. Childs. The commission denied Apple Construction\u2019s request, finding the evidence inadequate to warrant a compulsory change in treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">To justify a change in the treating physician, the employer bears the burden of proving that specific circumstances warrant the change. <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Briggs, </em>28 Va.App. 662, 676, 508 S.E.2d 335, 341 (1998). Circumstances may warrant a change if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">inadequate treatment is being rendered; it appears that treatment is needed by a specialist in a particular field and is not being provided; no progress being made in improvement of the employee\u2019s health condition without any adequate explanation; conventional modalities of treatment are not being used; no plan of treatment for long-term disability cases; [or] failure to cooperate with discovery proceedings ordered by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 675, 508 S.E.2d at 341 (quoting <em>Powers v. J.B. Constr. Co., </em>68 O.I.C. 208, 211 (1989)); <em>see also H.J. Holz &amp; Son, Inc. v. Dumas-Thayer, </em>37 Va.App. 645, 657, 561 S.E.2d 6, 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Apple Construction did not attempt to prove any of the circumstances outlined in <em>Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. </em>No testimony or medical reports addressed, much less questioned, the quality of medical care being provided by Dr. Childs or the adequacy of providing such care in the future. Nor did any evidence demonstrate how, if at all, the commute would affect Dr. Childs\u2019s treatment plan. Instead, Apple Construction relied entirely on generalizations contending, for example, that Sexton needed \u201ca local doctor for his own benefit\u201d and would \u201cget better with local treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The commission found these contentions unpersuasive, as do we. Apple Construction\u2019s claim that the closest doctor is the best doctor falls far short of qualifying as an axiom of law. To prevail, Apple Construction was obliged to demonstrate its position with specific facts \u2014 a task of advocacy left undone in this case. As the commission held, \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence that the medical care provided to the claimant by Dr. Childs has been unreasonable or inadequate in any way.\u201d To the contrary, the commission found, \u201cDr. Childs has acquired a unique expertise regarding the claimant\u2019s complicated condition \u2014 which has already necessitated two surgeries performed by Dr. Childs.\u201d By relying on generalizations unsupported by evidentiary proof, Apple Construction failed to carry its burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Apple Construction, however, also contends that Sexton\u2019s waiver of travel expenses and potential liability claims during transit arguably runs afoul of Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A), which precludes contractual releases of statutory benefits except where permitted by statute. Though expressly accepting Sexton\u2019s waiver as an \u201cenforceable agreement,\u201d Apple Construction fears it may not be. The commission erred, Apple Construction argues, in refusing to recognize these risks as sufficient to terminate Sexton\u2019s continuing treatment with Dr. Childs.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We hold these risks to be illusory, thus rendering Apple Construction\u2019s fears unfounded. A stipulation by a claimant, when made before the commission as a condition for seeking other relief and thus subject to the commission\u2019s scrutiny, does not offend Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A). Such a stipulation, in form and substance, serves as a partial compromise of an existing or potential claim. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-701 (authorizing the parties to reach an agreement \u201cin compromise\u201d of a claim). The statutory scheme broadly \u201cencourages the voluntary settlement of claims arising from compensable injuries.\u201d <em>Watts v. P &amp; J Hauling, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 278, 283, 584 S.E.2d 457, 460 (2003); <em>see generally </em>Lawrence J. Pascal, <em>Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 9.02, at 9-1 to 9-5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(3d ed. 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004) (observing that compromise \u201cmaybe in the best interest of the parties\u201d). A stipulation made before the commission, no less than a concession made before a court, is a binding and enforceable obligation. Sexton\u2019s waiver, therefore, protects Apple Construction against any exposure to travel reimbursement costs or to liability claims arising out of the transit to and from his treatment with Dr. Childs.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Satisfied that Apple Construction did not provide adequate grounds justifying a change in Sexton\u2019s treating physician, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
