Newman challenges his 1994 adjudication as an habitual offender, as well as his conviction of driving after having been declared an habitual offender in Culpeper County Circuit Court on April 2,1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Newman argues that he was adjudicated an habitual offender under statutes that were flawed and have since been repealed. According to Newman, because he was unlawfully declared an habitual offender, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to convict him of driving after having been adjudged an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Newman is not eligible for the writ. Code \u00a7 19.2-371.10 permits \u201ca person who was convicted of a felony\u201d to seek a writ of actual innocence in this Court. A proceeding resulting in an habitual offender adjudication is civil in nature and does not produce a felony conviction. <em>See Hoye v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 587, 589, 405 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1991). Thus, Chapter 19.3 affords Newman no basis for relief resulting from his adjudication as an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Newman\u2019s contention of innocence of driving after having been declared an habitual offender rests upon legal argument challenging the validity of the statutes leading to his adjudication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Chapter 19.3 allows review only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>based on previously unknown or unavailable non-biological <em>evidence. </em>Evidence is \u201c[s]omething (including testimony, documents and tangible objects) that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged fact....\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>595 (8th ed.2004). A fact is \u201c[a]n actual or alleged event or circumstance, <em>as distinguished from its legal effect, or interpretation.\u201d Id. </em>at 628 (emphasis supplied). The legal arguments presently advanced by Newman are not \u201cevidence\u201d entitling him to relief under Chapter 19.3. Accordingly, we summarily dismiss Newman\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Because the issues addressed herein are of first impression and potential litigants and members of the bar may benefit from the directives herein, we direct the Clerk to publish this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-13\">.

On appeal of the circuit court\u2019s refusal to vacate its judgment of conviction, this Court denied appellant\u2019s petition for appeal and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>no merit to appellant\u2019s claim the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him. <em>See Newman v.
