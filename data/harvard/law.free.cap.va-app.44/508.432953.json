ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">In this divorce matter, Daren Earl Boedeker (husband) appeals from a ruling of the circuit court holding that Heather Ann Larson (wife) was entitled to a portion of the military \u201ccareer status bonus\u201d (CSB/Redux) husband elected to receive pursuant to 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 322. On appeal, husband contends that the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement and federal law, rather than husband\u2019s initial concession of wife\u2019s entitlement, which he later withdrew, were controlling and that the sums he received were post-separation income in which wife was not entitled to share. He also contends the trial court had no basis on which to determine the amount to which wife was entitled because he had not yet retired. Wife opposes husband\u2019s position and seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>We hold that both federal law and the evidence in this case supported the trial court\u2019s decision that a portion of the Redux bonus was marital property subject to division under the parties\u2019 agreement. We hold further that husband may not object to the amount of the bonus awarded to wife because he agreed to the sum awarded. Thus, we affirm on the merits but deny wife\u2019s request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The parties were married in 1986 and separated in 2002. Husband enlisted in the United States Navy during the parties\u2019 marriage and was on active duty at the time the parties separated. He served in the Navy for thirteen years ten months of the parties\u2019 sixteen-year marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">On October 9, 2002, the parties entered into an agreement to effect, <em>inter alia, </em>their property settlement distribution. In that agreement, the parties represented that each \u201cfully disclosed [his or her] financial status, including ... assets and liabilities of all types and agree[d] that the terms of this Agreement are fair, just, and equitable after consideration of the financial status of the parties.\u201d The agreement provided as follows with respect to the parties\u2019 retirement accounts and post-separation income:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">SECTION 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\n<em>ASSETS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">sj: s|\u00ab s}: <em>ifc </em>sf5</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">D. <em>Additional Retirement Account Provisions. </em>The parties represent that all retirement and pension types of accounts have been disclosed. Each has his/her own IRA account listed solely in his/her name. Wife shall receive a percentage of husband\u2019s retirement pension from the U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Navy based on the following calculation: 166 months/number of months of active duty multiplied by .5.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">**;}:***</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">SECTION 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>FUTURE EARNINGS AND ACQUISITIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">All income, earnings, or other property received or acquired by either party to this Agreement on or after the date of execution of this Agreement shall be the sole and separate property of the receiving or acquiring party. Each party, as of the effective date of this Agreement, does hereby and forever waive, release, and relinquish all right, title, and interest in all such income, earnings and other property except as necessary to collect any sums due hereunder in the event of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">SECTION 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\n<em>DIVORCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">It is agreed and understood that this Agreement finally settles all rights of the parties and the property jointly or individually owned by the parties. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be made a part of a final decree or judgment and such decree o[r] judg[ ]ment shall not conflict with the terms hereof except to the extent disapproved by the court____</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">SECTION 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">\n<em>MODIFICATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">This agreement shall stop and preclude either party from making other or further demands and claims upon the other, not included herein, except that such legal action may be taken by either party as is necessary to enforce or modify the terms and provisions hereof, except that the Property Settlement provision shall not be subject to modification ....</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>On July 2, 2003, wife filed a bill of complaint for divorce and requested that the parties\u2019 separation agreement be confirmed, ratified and merged into the final decree. On October 21, 2003, the court held a hearing at which husband testified he was to receive a $30,000 military bonus, which he referred to as a \u201cRedux bonus.\u201d Husband testified that his receipt of the Redux bonus would reduce the amount of his military retirement when he retired. Based on the parties\u2019 agreement that wife would receive a portion of his military retirement, he said wife should receive a portion of the Redux bonus \u201csince her portion of his pension would be reduced as a result of his taking the Redux.\u201d Husband said that the formula in the parties\u2019 agreement \u201cregarding his military pension would determine ... wife\u2019s share of the Redux bonus.\u201d The parties\u2019 attorneys discussed the amount of wife\u2019s share and determined wife would receive 46% of the Redux bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Husband received the bonus on November 30, 2003. Before husband paid wife the agreed-upon share, he changed his position. At a January 20, 2004 hearing set for entry of the final decree, husband took the position that wife was not entitled to any portion of the bonus, arguing it should be classified as income rather than retirement. Over husband\u2019s objection, the trial court entered the final decree, which provided that the court \u201cdoes hereby ratify, confirm, approve, and incorporate, but not merge, into this decree\u201d the parties\u2019 October 9, 2002 agreement. The printed portion of the decree also provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">ADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED that [husband] shall pay by military allotment to [wife] FORTY-SIX PERCENT (46%) of the gross amount (before taxes) for each of the two annual REDUX installments, with the percentage having been based on the following calculation: 166 months/ 180 months multiplied by .5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">That provision was crossed out and the following language inserted in its place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">ADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED that [husband] shall pay $4899.00 to [wife] by January 30, 2004, said sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>being the first of two payments from [husband\u2019s] REDUX installments; [husband] shall make the second payment of [wife\u2019s] share of REDUX within 30 days of receipt by him of his second installment, said second payment to be forty-six Percent (46%) of the second installment before taxes are deducted and [wife] shall be responsible for the payment of taxes from her share; if [husband] retires before 20 years of service with the U.S. Navy and is required to reimburse any portion of the REDUX, [wife] must reimburse the U.S. Navy her share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The decree also provided that the court \u201ccan reopen this matter any time for entry of Orders necessary to adjust the military retirement benefits of [husband] to comport with the written agreement of the parties.\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney endorsed the final decree \u201cSeen and objected to: court\u2019s decision on Redux issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Husband then obtained new counsel, who filed a motion for rehearing on February 3, 2004. Husband\u2019s new attorney maintained that, despite husband\u2019s earlier concessions, the Redux bonus was post-separation income and that, pursuant to both the parties\u2019 agreement and federal law, wife was not entitled to share in the Redux bonus. He asked the court to vacate the relevant portion of the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Wife\u2019s attorney countered that husband was bound by his earlier concession that his decision to take the Redux bonus would reduce the amount of his future retirement benefits, in which wife was entitled to share. He also argued that husband\u2019s change in position violated the agreement\u2019s implied covenant of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The trial court reserved ruling at that time but noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">The evidence in the first hearing from [husband] was, [wife] was entitled to this [share of the Redux] because it effected [husband\u2019s] eventual retirement benefit____ That was the evidence in this case. So that is what I based my decision on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">We then had another hearing ... about how much she would get.... [Husband\u2019s attorney] and [wife\u2019s attorney] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>... came up with a figure [of] 46 percent.... I didn\u2019t come up with the 46 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">The other issue was ... taxes---- [T]he idea was the government took the money out before [husband] got his check. So we were operating, number one, under the testimony from [husband] that [wife] was entitled to the money, and the second was that taxes have already been paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">By letter opinion of February 10, 2004, and subsequent order, the court denied the motion for rehearing, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">There have been three hearings relative to this issue.... At the October hearing, [husband] testified that his wife was entitled to a portion of the Redux payment since her portion of his pension would be reduced as a result of his taking the Redux. At the January hearing, he changed his position. It is important to note that this was the evidence heard by the Court since that evidence was the basis for the Court\u2019s ruling. At both of these hearings, both parties were represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">At the February hearing (with a court reporter present), there was no evidence taken, but there was a proffer made by [husband] with no objection from [wife]. That proffer consisted of three exhibits \u2014 [husband\u2019s] pay stub, 37 USC Section 322, and 10 USC Section 1408.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">... [Husband\u2019s] motion to reconsider is denied. He testified [wife] was entitled to a portion of the Redux at the first hearing; his change of position and the federal statutes proffered don\u2019t change the evidence. Since he chose to accept the Redux thereby reducing her share of his pension, she is entitled to a portion of this payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Husband filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">Husband contends the court\u2019s decision awarding wife a portion of his Redux bonus was error because it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cdisposable retired pay\u201d under federal law and, thus, was not subject to division by a state court and because it was post-separation income in which wife was not entitled to share pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement. He also contends that the amount of wife\u2019s share of any benefit could not be calculated because he had not yet retired and, thus, the denominator of the marital share formula remained unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We hold that both federal law and the evidence in this case supported the trial court\u2019s decision that a portion of the Redux bonus was marital property subject to division under the parties\u2019 agreement. We hold further that husband may not object to the amount of the bonus awarded to wife because he agreed to the sum awarded. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">FEDERAL LAW AND DIVISION OF MILITARY BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In <em>McCarty v. McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210, 232, 101 S.Ct. 2728, 2741, 69 L.Ed.2d 589 (1981), the United States Supreme Court held that federal law preempted state court division of military retirement pay in community property jurisdictions. \u201cIn response to the <em>McCarty </em>decision, Congress passed the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]1408 (hereinafter \u2018the Act\u2019).\u201d <em>Owen v. Owen, </em>14 Va.App. 623, 626, 419 S.E.2d 267, 269 (1992). \u201cThe major effect of [the Act] is to <em>permit </em>state courts to divide <em>disposable retired or retainer pay </em>in accordance with state law.\u201d Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.04, at 300 (2d ed. 1994) (emphases added). The Act defines \u201cdisposable retired or retainer pay\u201d to include \u201cthe total monthly retired or retainer pay to which a member is entitled ... less amounts which ... are required by law to be deducted ..., including fines and forfeitures ordered by courts-martial, Federal employment taxes, and amounts waived in order to receive [disability] compensation under title 5 or title 38.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(B). The Act makes no mention of the ability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>state courts to divide \u201cbenefits other than disposable retired or retainer pay.\u201d Turner, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.05, at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In 1989, the United States Supreme Court considered the effect of the Act in <em>Mansell v. Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675 (1989). It \u201cinterpreted the Act as granting state courts the power to divide military retirement pay, but specifically held the Act does not grant state courts the power to divide military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits.\u201d <em>Owen, </em>14 Va.App. at 626, 419 S.E.2d at 269. Even after <em>Mansell, </em>\u201cstate courts may still enforce under general contract law a separation agreement which divides preempted benefits.\u201d Turner, <em>supra, </em>at 311 (citing <em>Mansell v. Mansell, </em>217 Cal.App.3d 219, 265 Cal.Rptr. 227 (1989) (on remand from original Supreme Court decision that held veterans\u2019 disability pay could not be divided under equitable distribution or community property principles, dividing disability benefits at issue pursuant to separation agreement), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 806, 111 S.Ct. 237, 112 L.Ed.2d 197 (1990)); <em>see In re Marriage of Stone, </em>274 Mont. 331, 908 P.2d 670, 672-74 (1995); <em>Hoskins v.

White, </em>152 N.C.App. 588, 568 S.E.2d 283, 285 n. 1 (2002) (discussing principle in dicta). <em>Compare Owen, </em>14 Va.App. at 626, 419 S.E.2d at 269 (noting wife <em>\u201cconced[ed] </em>that federal law prohibits former military personnel from assigning military disability pay by property settlement agreement\u201d without analyzing merits of issue (emphasis added)). <em>But see Abernethy v.

Under Code \u00a7 20-109.1, a trial court can enforce the provisions of a separation agreement that have been incorporated into a divorce decree \u201cin the same manner as any provision of such decree.\u201d Finally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">[t]he court shall have the continuing authority and jurisdiction to make any additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce any order entered pursuant to this section, including the authority to ...

However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">what is necessarily implied is as much a part of the instrument as if plainly expressed, and will be enforced as such. If the language of the instrument leaves the meaning of the parties in doubt, the court will take into consideration the occasion which gave rise to it, the obvious design of the parties, and the object to be attained, as well as the language of the instrument itself, and give effect to that construction which will effectuate the real intent and meaning of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\"><em>Va.

It made no mention of husband\u2019s entitlement to any other sort of military benefit or bonus, and it gave no indication that husband would be permitted under the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of the agreement to reduce the amount of the retirement benefit to which wife would be entitled by relinquishing a portion of his military retirement in exchange for some other military benefit to which he alone would be entitled. <em>Cf.

Both federal law establishing the bonus and case law from other jurisdictions considering the proper treatment of other, similar types of military benefit payments support this result.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">37 U.S.C. \u00a7 322, which took effect on October 1,1999, is the statutory mechanism establishing the bonus at issue in this case. That statute defines an optional \u201c15-year career status bonus\u201d (CSB/Redux) for any \u201cmember of a uniformed service serving on active duty who\u201d \u201cfirst became a member on or after August 1, 1986,\u201d and who \u201chas completed 15 years of active duty in the uniformed services (or has received notification ... that the member is about to complete that duty).\u201d 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(b). An eligible member may elect a bonus of $30,000 to be received in one to five installments. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u00a7 322(d). A member who elects to receive the bonus must \u201cexecute[ ] a written agreement ... to remain continuously on active duty until the member has completed 20 years of active-duty service\u201d as defined elsewhere in the United States Code. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 322(a). If the member \u201cfails to complete\u201d the remainder of the \u201c20 years of active-duty service ..., the person shall refund to the United States the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the bonus payment as the uncompleted part of that period of active-duty service bears to the total period of such service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 322(f). Further, a member who elects to receive the CSB/Redux and retires with less than 30 years of service before reaching the age of 62 is entitled to receive retirement pay at a lesser rate than a member who has not elected the CSB/Redux. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409; <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1401a, 1410; <em>see also </em>37 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(e)(2) (requiring that notice to service member of eligibility for CSB/Redux \u201cshall include ... [a]n explanation of the effects under sections 1401a, 1409 and 1410 of title 10 that such an election has on the computation of any retired or retainer pay that the member may become eligible to receive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Here, husband testified that his receipt of the CSB/Redux would reduce his retirement benefit, and the trial court, therefore, was entitled to conclude that he planned to leave active duty \u201cwith less than 30 years of service before reaching the age of 62,\u201d resulting in his receipt of a lesser retirement benefit than the one to which he would otherwise have been entitled. The decree also provides for the possibility of husband\u2019s retiring before completing twenty years of service, at which time 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(f) would require him to \u201crefund to the United States the amount [of the Redux bonus] that bears the same ratio to the amount of the bonus payment as the uncompleted part of that period of active-duty service bears to the total period of such service.\u201d If husband is required to \u201creimburse [the U.S. Navy] any portion of the REDUX,\u201d the decree requires wife, rather than husband, to \u201creimburse the U.S. Navy her share\u201d of that portion. Even if husband elects to remain in the military long enough to receive his full retirement benefit, wife\u2019s receipt of a portion of the CSB/Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dux in addition to her agreed-upon portion of the marital share of husband\u2019s regular retirement will not constitute a windfall. The federal statutory scheme makes clear that the CSB/Redux, which husband was entitled to receive after fifteen years of service, was awarded based on his first twenty years in the military. The parties were married for thirteen years ten months of that period of service, and they apparently calculated wife\u2019s share of the bonus based on that period of time. Thus, both the federal statutory scheme and the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the CSB/Redux installment payments were retirement benefits under the parties\u2019 separation agreement, in which wife was entitled to share pursuant to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We are unaware of any judicial decisions determining whether CSB/Redux benefits are classified as military retirement benefits pursuant to a property settlement agreement or divorce decree effecting an equitable distribution. However, numerous courts have considered the classification of analogous types of military benefits \u2014 referred to as voluntary separation incentives (VSIs) and voluntary lump-sum special separation benefits (SSBs) \u2014 and most have classified them as retirement benefits and divided them as such. <em>See </em>Major Mary J. Bradley, <em>Calling for a Truce on the Military Divorce Battlefield: A Proposal to Amend the USFSPA, </em>168 Mil. L. Rev. 40, 69, 127 (2001) (noting that CSB/Redux is \u201csimilar to retired pay in key aspects\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In 1991, Congress established the VSI and SSB programs \u201cto reduce the size of the armed forces in response to the perceived diminished threat to United States\u2019 interests.... The programs were designed to compensate career-oriented service members who had been denied a career opportunity because of circumstances beyond their control.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of McElroy, </em>905 P.2d 1016, 1018 (Colo.Ct.App.1995). Absent these incentives, the typical service person who opted or was forced to leave the military before completing twenty years of service would be wholly ineligible for retirement benefits. Bradley, <em>supra, </em>at 40 &amp; n. 6; <em>see Marsh v. Wallace, </em>924 S.W.2d 423, 426 (Tex.Ct.App.1996); <em>see also </em>Larry D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>White, <em>Note and Comment: The Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act: How Military Members are at the Mercy of Unrestrained State Courts, </em>9 Roger Williams U.L.Rev. 289, 289-90 (2003) (containing detailed discussion of nature and purpose of military retirement pay). Although differences exist between these types of voluntary separation benefits and \u201ctraditional military retirement[,] ... the similarities far outnumber the differences.\u201d <em>In re Menard, </em>180 Or. App. 181, 42 P.3d 359, 364 (2002). \u201cLike retirement benefits, payments pursuant to [these programs] are based in part on the length of time a person served in the military and his pay grade during his time of service.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>319 S.C. 500, 462 S.E.2d 303, 305 (Ct.App.1995). As a result, most courts addressing the issue have concluded that VSI and SSB payments are \u201cin the nature of retirement pay, compensating [the service member now] for the retirement benefits he would have received in the future.\u201d <em>Marsh, </em>924 S.W.2d at 425. <em>Compare id. </em>(distinguishing from benefits paid for <em>involuntary </em>separation from military because Congress deemed these benefits \u201cnon-earned gratuity to service member to aid readjustment to civilian life, not payment for service previously rendered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The amount of the CSB/Redux, unlike the VSI and SSB payments, is a defined lump sum of $30,000 regardless of one\u2019s rank. Further, unlike the condition required to receive a VSI or SSB \u2014 voluntary departure from the military \u2014 a service member who elects to receive a CSB/Redux must agree to remain in the military to complete twenty years of active duty. Despite these differences, the statutory scheme makes clear that the CSB/Redux, like the VSI and SSB payments, is \u201cin the nature of retirement pay, compensating [the service member now] for\u201d at least a portion of \u201cthe retirement benefits he would have received in the future.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Bradley, <em>supra, </em>at 127 <em>&amp; </em>n. 354 (noting that, unless court classifies VSI and SSB benefits as retired pay or Congress amends Act, \u201ccourt order to divide retired pay as part of a property settlement agreement becomes worthless if the military member elects early retirement\u201d and receives VSI or SSB benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Whether Congress intended for CSB/Redux payments to be classified as disposable retired or retainer pay pursuant to the Act, or indeed whether it even contemplated such an issue, is not controlling, and we need not reach that issue here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement control. The parties indicated in their agreement that they disclosed all \u201cretirement <em>or pension types of accounts\u201d </em>and agreed that wife was entitled to one-half the marital share of \u201chusband\u2019s [military] retirement.\u201d (Emphasis added). Pursuant to that agreement, we hold the trial court properly classified as \u201chusband\u2019s [military] retirement pension\u201d that portion of husband\u2019s CSB/Redux earned while the parties were married. Thus, wife was entitled, pursuant to the agreement, to one-half the marital share of that benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">AMOUNT OF WIFE\u2019S SHARE OF BONUS</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Husband also contends the trial court could not award a portion of the CSB/Redux benefit to wife because the marital share could not be determined prior to his retiring. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The trial court made clear that husband and wife, through their attorneys, agreed upon the amount wife was to receive when husband took the position that she was entitled to a share of it. Assuming without deciding the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement would have prevented wife from receiving a portion of the CSB/Redux until husband actually retired, we hold the trial court was entitled to bind husband to his original agreement regarding the share of the benefit wife was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to receive. The court noted the parties\u2019 attorneys \u201cdiscussed\u201d the percentage of the bonus wife was to receive and \u201ccame up with a figure.\u201d It also noted the division agreed upon took into account that a portion of the $15,000 sum was withheld by the government to satisfy husband\u2019s income tax obligation on the sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u201cHusband will not be permitted to approbate and reprobate, ascribing error to an act by the trial court that comported with his representations.\u201d <em>Asgari v. Asgari, </em>33 Va.App. 393, 403, 533 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2000) (upholding court\u2019s failure to divide particular loan debt repaid by husband where \u201ccounsel advised the court, during the evidentiary hearing, that he was \u2018not asking for any of [that particular loan] back\u2019 \u201d but later changed his position); <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 691, 514 S.E.2d 369, 378 (1999) (holding court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit husband to withdraw from stipulation that parties would themselves determine classification and value of tangible personal property rather than submitting that issue to court).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">On appeal, wife asks us to affirm the lower court\u2019s decision and \u201caward [her] attorneys fees incurred.\u201d At trial, husband conceded that he would be responsible for attorney\u2019s fees for the motion to rehear if he was unsuccessful on that motion. When the trial court denied the motion for rehearing, it awarded wife attorney\u2019s fees for that hearing. Thus, we construe wife\u2019s request as one for an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). In this context, and upon consideration of the record in this case, we hold husband\u2019s position was not so unreasonable as to entitle wife to an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">For these reasons, we hold the CSB/Redux bonus was a retirement benefit under the parties\u2019 agreement in which wife was entitled to share pursuant to that agreement. The court was also entitled to bind husband to his initial position regarding the amount of the benefit to which wife was entitled. However, on this record, we deny wife\u2019s request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. We do not rely on husband\u2019s initial statement that wife was entitled to a portion of the bonus as a basis for concluding the bonus was retirement rather than post-separation income. The trial court also did not rely on this statement. Rather, it concluded husband\u2019s admission that his taking the bonus would reduce his retirement benefit \u2014 and, thus, wife\u2019s share of that benefit \u2014 supported the conclusion that the bonus was properly classified under the agreement as retirement rather than income. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">.
