Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Because Perkins\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal fails to make the required showing, that motion is DENIED. <em>See id. </em>Because Perkins has not met the requirements for obtaining transcripts at the government\u2019s expense, his motion for transcript at government expense is also DENIED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Perkins also argues that the district court erred in denying his request for an expert witness. He argues that he timely requested the district court to appoint an expert witness under Fed. R. Evid. 706 and that, given the complexity of his case, this court should remand the case to the district court for appointment of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Perkins\u2019s request for a medical expert did not meet the requirements under the Federal Rule of Evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid.706. Moreover, it was undisputed that Maria Berger gave Perkins a drug to which Perkins had a known allergy, and, in light of that fact, Perkins has not explained what assistance a medical expert would have had in his case. Consequently, the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an expert was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Pedraza v. Jones, </em>71 F.3d 194, 196-97 n. 5 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Perkins further argues that the district court erred in denying him permission to have three witnesses appear on his behalf. He asserts that a security guard would have testified that he saw Perkins in the shower area, which was unclean, and which, Perkins asserts, could have been the cause of a staph infection from which he now suffers. He also argues that a nurse would have testified that she would have ordered that Perkins be taken to a trauma center for treatment and that an inmate would have testified regarding Perkins\u2019s pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The three proposed fact witnesses were cumulative and unnecessary given that other nurses were slated to testify regarding Perkins\u2019s medical condition and the fact that his suffering after receiving the sulfa drug was undisputed. Consequently, the district court\u2019s denial of Perkins\u2019s request to present these witnesses was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gibbs v. King, </em>779 F.2d 1040, 1047 (5th Cir.1986). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
