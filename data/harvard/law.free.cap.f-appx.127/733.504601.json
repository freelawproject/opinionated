The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulations, that both the notice of appeal and the filing fee must be filed within 30 days of the IJ\u2019s decision for the appeal to be timely, flows rationally from the language of the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.3(a)(l)-(3), 3.8(a) &amp; (c), 3.38(d), \u00a7 240.15 (2003). Accordingly, that interpretation is entitled to due deference. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 675 (5th Cir.2003). The notice of appeal was received by the filing deadline, but because Petitioners did not pay the filing fee until after the expiration of the 30-day period, the BIA did not err in dismissing the appeal as untimely. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Naderpour v. INS, </em>52 F.3d 731 (8th Cir.1995), which addressed regulations different from those applicable to Petitioners\u2019 case, is neither persuasive nor precedential.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Petitioners assert that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of the late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because the meritorious nature of the appeal is clear as set forth herein.\u201d Petitioners do not cite any authority for the BIA to eonstrue their untimely appeal as a motion to reopen. Even if the BIA had the authority to so construe the appeal, Petitioners merely asserted ineffective assistance and did not submit any evidence and made no attempt to meet any of the requirements for a motion to reopen an untimely appeal based on counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. <em>See In re Lozada, </em>19 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
