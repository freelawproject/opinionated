Billingsley, </em>No. CR-98-47 (E.D.N.C. Nov. 15, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-18\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The magistrate judge\u2019s order is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>United States v. Bryson, </em>981 F.2d 720, 723 (4th Cir.1992) (magistrate judge may hear matters in \u00a7 2255 proceedings, but may not decide them absent explicit consent). Moreover, where a dispositive matter is referred to the magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(b) (West Supp.2004), parties must have the opportunity to object, and the district court is required to conduct de novo review of the portions of the recommendation to which objections are made. <em>Bryson, </em>981 F.2d at 723. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-19\">In appeal No. 04-7956, Billingsley appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge to dismiss, without prejudice, his motion for a sentence reduction as an improperly filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. The district court dismissed the action without prejudice to petitioner filing a corrected motion on the proper \u00a7 2255 forms. <em>See United States v. Billingsley, </em>No. CA-04-445 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 1, 2004). Instead of heeding the court\u2019s advice, Billingsley appealed. Because the dismissal order is without prejudice, and Billingsley may file an amended complaint in the district court by submitting it on the proper forms, we conclude that this order is interlocutory and thus, not appealable. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that a dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if \u201cno amendment [to the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case.\u201d) (inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>nal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">No. <em>04-7851 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">No. <em>0447956 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
