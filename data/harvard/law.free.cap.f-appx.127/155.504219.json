She contends that the immigration judge erred in making an adverse credibility finding. Keivani maintains that the immigration judge evinced bias against her, misunderstood her testimony, ignored or discounted documentary evidence, and wrongly found inconsistencies in her testimony and in her written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>statements. We have reviewed the record and the briefs and conclude that Keivani has not established that the record compels that the credibility ruling be overturned. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155,161 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Keivani contends that she has established her eligibility for asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the Convention against Torture. In light of the adverse credibility determination, we need not consider whether Keivani has established an entitlement to such relief. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
