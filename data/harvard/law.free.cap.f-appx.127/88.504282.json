See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">Aaron Anthony Edison appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Department of Health and Human Resources\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Edison\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action; granting the State of West Virginia and Governor Wise\u2019s motion to dismiss; and denying Edison\u2019s motions for general relief. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-19\">On appeal, Edison first assigns error to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u201cThird Renewal Motion for Case to be Awarded to Plaintiff Due to Defendant\u2019s Third Time Failure to Respond to Complaint and Summons in the Thirty Day Time Period Allotted by Law.\u201d We have reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Edison\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-20\">Edison next challenges the district court award of summary judgment to the Department of Health and Human Resources. However, because Edison seeks to overturn final state court judgments against him, the district court lacked jurisdiction over his complaint. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) (stating that the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>abstention doctrine establishes that a district court lacks jurisdiction over a litigant\u2019s challenge to a state court decision, including challenges alleging the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-21\">Edison asks this court to \u201coverturn and/or dismiss this District Court decision to sanction this plaintiff to pay attorney fees in the amount of $960.80.\u201d We lack jurisdiction to review this order because Edison never filed a timely notice of appeal as to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). The district court\u2019s judgment order was entered on the docket on October 6, 2004. Because Edison failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period as to this order, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss, and dismiss Edison\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order awarding the Department of Health and Human Resources reasonable costs and fees. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
