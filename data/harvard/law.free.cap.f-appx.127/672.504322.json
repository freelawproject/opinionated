Arellano sought rescission of a final order of deportation entered in absentia. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1994),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and we deny the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Having reviewed the record and briefs, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen as untimely. The record reveals that Arellano received actual notice of the hearing and did not timely move to reopen in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1105a, 1252b, were repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009 (IIRIRA), effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, these provisions are still applicable under the terms of the transitional rules contained in IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
