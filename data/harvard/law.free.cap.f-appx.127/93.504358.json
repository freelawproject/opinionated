The district court sentenced Eanes under the federal sentencing guidelines to eighty-four months in prison. This sentence included an enhancement for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2002), based on the court\u2019s conclusion at sentencing that while Eanes possessed the firearm he possessed crack cocaine for distribution purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Eanes argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was based on facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He made the same argument in the district court and was overruled based in part upon this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997, 2005 WL 124093 (U.S. Jan. 24, 2005) (No. 04-193). After Eanes\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and held that the federal sentencing guidelines scheme, under which courts were required to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment because of its mandatory nature. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the court); <em>id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>we find that the district court erred in sentencing Eanes. Although Eanes also challenged the district court\u2019s finding that the circumstances of his arrest, including the amount of drugs found, does not support application of the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement, we conclude that it is not necessary to resolve that issue prior to remand. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, at 556, 2005 WL 628224 *17 n. 15 (4th Cir. 2005) (\u201cwe do not hold that in every case involving a <em>Booker </em>issue, this court must first address alleged calculation errors before vacating and remanding for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. \u201d), petition for rehearing filed </em>Mar. 28, 2005. Therefore, although we affirm Eanes\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
