Anderson appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s decision to deny her Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Anderson contends that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by failing to give adequate weight to her treating psychiatrist\u2019s findings. \u201cAlthough the treating physician rule generally requires a court to accord greater weight to the testimony of a treating physician, the rule does not require that the testimony be given controlling weight.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Sullivan, </em>993 F.2d 31, 35 (4th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Thus, \u201cif a physician\u2019s opinion is not supported by clinical evidence or if it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence, it should be accorded significantly less weight.\u201d <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 590 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cUnder such circumstances, the ALJ holds the discretion to give less weight to the testimony of a treating physician in the face of persuasive contrary evidence.\u201d <em>Mastro v. Apfel, </em>270 F.3d 171,178 (4th Cir.2001). After careful review of the record, we conclude that the ALJ properly exercised his discretion in the face of the treating psychiatrist\u2019s unsupported conclusions, <em>Chater, </em>76 F.3d at 590, and persuasive contrary evidence provided by three other doctors, <em>Mastro, </em>270 F.3d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Anderson raises several other claims that she concedes were \u201craised imperfectly below or not at all.\u201d It is well-settled that issues raised for the first time on appeal generally are not considered by this court. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally waived absent exceptional circumstances); <em>Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc. v. Shalala, </em>32 F.3d 67, 70 (4th Cir. 1994) (\u201cit is inappropriate for courts reviewing appeals of agency decisions to consider arguments not raised before the administrative agency involved\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that Anderson has forfeited her remaining claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
