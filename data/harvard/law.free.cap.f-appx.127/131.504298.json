Suazo-Umanzor asserts that his \u201clife was threatened and because the government of El Salvador appears to be unable or unwilling to control the gangs in said country\u201d he is entitled to a grant of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Suazo-Umanzor, who is represented by counsel, does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u2019s\u201d) finding that his claim does not fall within one of the five grounds enumerated in the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish eligibility for asylum. Further, he does not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to establish that he could not relocate to another part of El Salvador to avoid the problems with the gang. Finally, Suazo-Umanzor does not argue that there was error in the denial of his application for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. As such, Suazo-Umanzor has abandoned all of his claims on appeal. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, Suazo-Umanzor petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
