Washington, Louisiana prisoner # 77381, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights action against various prison officials for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">In addition to arguing the merits of his case, Washington argues on appeal that he \u201cmade not one (1), but two (2) attempts to file Administrative Remedies,\u201d both of which were rejected, and that an administrative remedy procedure (ARP) screening officer stated in a memorandum to Washington, \u201cOnce an ARP has been rejected, you have exhausted your Administrative Remedies.\u201d However, in the district court, Washington did not object to, but agreed with, the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir.1996)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">Washington has not shown that he has exhausted his administrative remedies; he does not argue that he appealed the rejection of either ARP or that the second ARP was an appeal of the first, and there is no indication of this in the record. <em>See </em>22 La. Admin. Code, Pt. I, \u00a7 325(G)(1), (2). Furthermore, because the memorandum is not in the record on appeal and was in fact written after the district court entered its decision, this court need not consider it as evidence of an administrative procedural policy, futility, or a waiver of the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999) (appellate court may not consider evidence presented for first time on appeal or facts not before the district court at the time of the district court\u2019s ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in dismissing Washington\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court <em>has </em>determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
