To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence she presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Tjakra fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Tjakra\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Tjakra fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\"> Tjakra also challenges the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Because she failed to raise this claim before the Board, we find that it is now waived. <em>See Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990) (\"[A]n alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board]'s decision.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
