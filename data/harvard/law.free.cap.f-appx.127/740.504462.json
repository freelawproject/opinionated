He argues (1) for the first time on appeal and pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that his sentence is illegal and (2) pursuant to <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), that the district court\u2019s reliance on his co-defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement to ascertain drug quantity violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Wilson has not established plain error with regard to his <em>Blakely </em>claim because he has not established that his sentence, imposed under the mandatory guidelines scheme, affected his substantial rights. The record does not indicate that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under a sentencing scheme in which the guidelines were advisory only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-521 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Wilson\u2019s argument pursuant to <em>Crawford </em>that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at sentencing is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Navarro, </em>169 F.3d 228, 236 (5th Cir.1999), which held that \u201cthere is no Confrontation Clause right at sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
