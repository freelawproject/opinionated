We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004). Moreover, because Goodwin\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), we review the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). Our review of the record convinces us the district court did not abuse its discretion, and Goodwin\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">On appeal, Goodwin contends his sentence is plainly unreasonable because it exceeds the applicable range under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2003), and \u201ca sentence within the Guidelines would have imposed adequate punishment.\u201d However, while the applicable sentencing range is one of the factors to be considered, it is advisory only, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B) (2000); <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 640 \u2014 41, and we find the district court properly considered Goodwin\u2019s need for intensive drug treatment when determining the length of his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2) (2000). Although neither Goodwin nor his counsel requested it in the district court, Goodwin further argues the court \u201cunreasonably did not consider staying within the guidelines and allowing Mr. Goodwin to seek the assistance of a 12-step program offered in virtually every city in this country.\u201d Because Goodwin failed to raise this issue in district court, or to show plain error or a fundamental miscarriage of justice, we find he has waived the issue on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
