The district court sentenced Martinez to sixty months imprisonment. The district court also specified an identical alternative sentence of sixty months pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert, granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-24\">Martinez appealed, challenging the sixteen-level judicial enhancement applied at sentencing, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We conclude that, because the alternative sentence pronounced by the district court was identical to the mandatory sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at that time, any error resulting from the sentence imposed by the district court was harmless. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Accordingly, we affirm Martinez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-30\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
