Richardson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motions seeking reconsideration of the court\u2019s order denying Richardson\u2019s habeas corpus petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69, 374 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Richardson has not made the requisite showing. We therefore deny Richardson a certificate of appealability, deny his motions for appointment of counsel and \u201csummary judgment,\u201d and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-20\">Additionally, we construe Richardson\u2019s notices of appeal and informal briefs on appeal as applications to file a second or successive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Richardson\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Richardson to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
