Mohammed contends that her testimony was credible and corroborated and was therefore sufficient to establish eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [sjhe presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Mohammed fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Nor can Mohammed show that she was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, 378 </em>F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-17\"> Mohammed seeks to argue that the immigration judge erred in denying her Convention Against Torture claim solely on the basis of a negative credibility finding. However, as Mohammed did not raise this issue before the Board, we lack jurisdiction to consider the argument because Mohammed has not exhausted \"all administrative remedies.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005) (No. 04-256).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
