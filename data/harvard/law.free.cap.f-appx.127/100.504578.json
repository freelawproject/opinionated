To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude Sydykov fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We find we lack jurisdiction over Sydykov\u2019s challenges to the immigration judge\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to properly exhaust these claims in his appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
