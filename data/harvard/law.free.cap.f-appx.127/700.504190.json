Williams also challenges the underlying final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">\u201cWe review a denial of a motion to reopen under a \u2018highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her motion to reopen, Williams claimed that she could present new facts demonstrating that she was entitled to adjustment of status to permanent residence. Specifically, she argued that the district court had refused to admit as evidence a waiver to the two-year foreign residency requirement of her visa. The BIA did not reach the merits of Williams\u2019 motion, finding that she was ineligible for discretionary relief because she had remained in the United States after her voluntary departure period had expired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">Williams urges that she should not be penalized for failing to depart within the time allowed by the BIA\u2019s grant of voluntary departure because she was prohibited from doing so due to exceptional circumstances. Prior to the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d were a statutory justification for failing to depart during the specified time period. This justification was eliminated, however, with the passage of the IIRIRA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, because Williams\u2019 depor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>tation proceedings commenced after the effective date of the IIRIRA, the exceptional circumstances justification is not available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Williams also contends that by filing her motion to reopen two days before her voluntary departure period expired, the period was tolled. We find no authority for this proposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, it was not raised before the BIA, and cannot be considered by our court in the first instance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">With respect to her challenge to the BIA\u2019s removal order, we note that Williams did not file her notice of appeal until over three months after the BIA ruled. Because Williams did not file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final removal order, we lack jurisdiction to consider any challenges to that order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The record indicates, however, that the waiver was admitted into evidence by the IJ. Consequently, her motion to reopen could properly have been denied on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b734-26\">. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v.
