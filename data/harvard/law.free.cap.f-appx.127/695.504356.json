Alexander also asks this court to expedite his appeal. The court GRANTS Alexander\u2019s motion to proceed IFP. Because no further briefing is needed to resolve Alexander\u2019s appeal, the court will consider the merits of Alexander\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">Alexander contends that application of Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) 1995 and 1996 program statements and regulations\u2014 which were promulgated after he committed his offense conduct \u2014 to deny him eligibility for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also suggests that the adjustment to his guideline offense level for possession of a firearm violated <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington,</em>-U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">The application of the program statements and regulations to Alexander merely deprived him of an opportunity to take advantage of a discretionary early-release provision. They did not increase the penalty for his offense. As a result, no Ex Post Facto Clause violation occurred. <em>See Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>136 F.3d 1032, 1037-38 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 692-93 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-19\">Regarding his guideline adjustment, Alexander does not seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, nor does he make any argument regarding the savings clause of 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He therefore has made no argument supporting relief under <em>Booker </em>or <em>Blakely </em>in the context of this case. Consequently, the court AFFIRMS the judgment denying Alexander\u2019s petition for habeas relief. Having resolved this matter, the court DENIES Alexander\u2019s motion to expedite his appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
