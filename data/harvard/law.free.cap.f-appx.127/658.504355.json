On December 28, 2004, the district court sentenced Thompson, over her objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to twenty-six months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. The district court also specified an alternative sentence of probation pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-25\">Thompson appealed, challenging her sentence under <em>Blakely. </em>On January 12, 2005, the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applied the reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-28\">Thompson now moves for an expedited remand of her case to the district court to allow implementation of the alternative sentence previously announced by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government opposes both motions; those of Thompson\u2019s code<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fendants who have responded to the motions have no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We conclude that Thompson is entitled to be resentenced under <em>Booker, </em>as the Government concedes. As Thompson raises no other issues on appeal, we affirm her conviction and vacate the sentence imposed by the district court. We grant the motion for remand, having expedited its consideration to the extent practicable given the court\u2019s docket.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On remand, the district court shall reconsider Thompson\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-16\">. Thompson also moves for severance from her codefendants. We previously granted this motion by separate order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-17\">. We decline Thompson\u2019s request to direct the district court to implement the alternative sentence previously announced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
