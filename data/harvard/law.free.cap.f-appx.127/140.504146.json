Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants. The Turners challenge that judgment on appeal. A trial court\u2019s findings respecting negligence, cause, and proximate cause are findings of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Gavagan v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 1016,1019 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The Turners alleged that their boat encountered a large wake from the <em>M/V </em>24 KARAT as it was passing the M/V GENERAL E. LEE. Based on the deposition testimony of the master of the M/V GENERAL E. LEE, Captain Ronald Babin, the district court concluded that the M/V 24 KARAT was not traveling at an unsafe speed nor had it created an unusual wake as it passed the M/V GENERAL E. LEE. The district court also noted the testimony of an expert witness, Arthur Sargeant, that the accident could not have happened as described by the Turners. The Turners have not shown that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that they failed to prove that the M/V 24 KARAT was not operating in a safe and reasonable way at the time of the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">After the trial, the Turners moved to recuse the district court. The Turners contend the district court erred by denying their request. Below, the Turners suggested five reasons for the court to recuse itself. Three of those reasons arise from unrelated investigations that do not create a doubt about the court\u2019s impartiality. The Turners do not suggest how the fourth reason \u2014 that the defense firm hired the court\u2019s law clerk \u2014 casts doubt on the court\u2019s impartiality. The last reason\u2014 that the court has a social relationship with the defense attorney \u2014 is unsupported. The only evidence produced to show bias is the court\u2019s judgment. In light of the evidence supporting the judgment, this showing is insufficient. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 motion to recuse. <em>See Levitt v. University of Texas at El Paso, </em>847 F.2d 221, 226 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
