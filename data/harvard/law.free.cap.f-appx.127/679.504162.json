(\u201cProd-X\u201d) and Nasir M. Khan noted an appeal from the district court\u2019s order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>missing their breach of contract claim and entering judgment in favor of Defendant Capitol Resource Funding, Inc., on its counterclaim for breach of contract. While the appeal was pending, Prod-X filed a petition for relief in bankruptcy. We therefore stayed the appeal from the portion of the district court\u2019s order granting judgment in favor of Capitol Resource on its counterclaim against Prod-X, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) (2000), and affirmed the remainder of the case. <em>See Prod-X Distribs., Inc. v. Capitol Res. Funding, Inc., </em>No. 04-1034 (4th Cir. Oct. 20, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The bankruptcy court has now lifted the automatic stay imposed in Prod-X\u2019s bankruptcy case to allow this court to resolve the appeal as to the judgment entered on Capitol Resource\u2019s counterclaim against Prod-X. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error by the district court in granting judgment in favor of Capitol Resource and against Prod-X on Capitol Resource\u2019s counterclaim. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Prod-X Distribs., Inc. v. Capitol Res. Funding, Inc., </em>No. CA-03-1065-1 (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 26, 2003 &amp; entered Dec. 4, 2003). We have previously granted Capitol Resource\u2019s motion to submit the case on the briefs and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
