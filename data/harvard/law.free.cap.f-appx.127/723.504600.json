Although the district court sustained Gonzalez\u2019s objections to the enhancement of his sentence as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and to the calculation of his criminal history score, Gonzalez argues that the district court erred when it refused to grant a downward departure or sentence Gonzalez to the low end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Gonzalez has failed to adequately brief the issue of whether the district court erred when it declined to grant a downward departure. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). He therefore has failed to show that the district court erred with respect to this issue. Furthermore, to the extent that Gonzalez is arguing that the district court erred when it did not sentence him to the low end of the Guidelines range, this argument lacks merit. Gonzalez does not argue that the district court failed to consider appropriate sentencing factors, that the district court erred when it calculated his Guidelines range, or that his sentence was unreasonable. Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is therefore AFFIRMED. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 517-18 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
