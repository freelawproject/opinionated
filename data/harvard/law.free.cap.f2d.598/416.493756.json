Aerol\u00edneas charges that one of the three appellees, Brown Aviation Services, Inc., breached a contract with Aerol\u00edneas, and that the other two appellees \u2014 Mr. Garland Brown and the Atlas Aircraft Corp. \u2014 defrauded Aerol\u00edneas and conspired with Brown Aviation to defraud Aerol\u00edneas. The contract, according to Aerol\u00edneas, called for it to pay Brown Aviation $123,500 in return for a specified airplane, in good mechanical condition and equipped in a certain way, and several accessories. Aerol\u00edneas says that when the plane was delivered it was defective and that the accessories were not delivered at all; it says that it had to pay $98,000 to put the plane in the condition in which Brown Aviation was supposed to deliver it. In the meantime, Aerol\u00edneas asserts, it had paid Brown Aviation and Garland Brown the $123,500, apparently through a conditional letter of credit. In order to obtain the payment, Aerol\u00edneas claims Brown and Brown Aviation had Atlas Aircraft Corporation falsely appraise the airplane; on the basis of that false appraisal, Aerol\u00edneas says, the $123,500 was paid to Brown Aviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Count I of Aerolineas\u2019s complaint charged Brown Aviation with breach of contract and asked for $98,000 compensatory damages. Summary judgment was not granted on Count I and it is not before us. The district court did grant summary judgment on Counts II and III. Those counts claimed damages against, respectively, Garland Brown and Atlas Aircraft, for both fraud and conspiracy to defraud Aerol\u00edneas. Count II asked for $119,500 compensatory damages against Garland Brown; Count III asked for $120,000 compensatory damages from Atlas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">At the pretrial conference, Aerolineas\u2019s counsel conceded that the damages requested in Counts II and III were excessive. Apparently for this reason alone, the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on those two counts. This was error. Although Aerolineas\u2019s counsel was lamentably confused about the amount of damages his client had sustained, he maintained throughout that Aerol\u00edneas had indeed been wronged and damaged. Under these circumstances the district court should at least have allowed Aerol\u00edneas to amend its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On the record before us <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there are no other justifications for summary judgment. To judge from the depositions and documents in the record, there is a genuine factual dispute about the truth of Aerolineas\u2019s assertions. The appellees argue that Aerolineas\u2019s claim is barred by the judgment rendered in another litigation, in Florida state court; but the district court seemed not to rest its grant of summary judgment on this ground, and the record does not disclose enough about the nature of the Florida proceeding to permit us to decide the question. On remand, the district court will have the full record before it and will be able to obtain other documentary evidence. It may or may not find sufficient reasons for granting summary judgment again. But Aerolineas\u2019s repudiating its <em>ad damnum </em>clause, while still insisting that all the elements of the torts were present, did not justify summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">. In all three counts Aerol\u00edneas also asked for costs and punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. Appellee Atlas Aircraft Corp. complains, in its brief, that Aerol\u00edneas has presented us with an inadequate record. When the appellant asks that less than a complete record be transmitted, he must notify the appellee, who then can place additional material in the record Fed. R.App.P. 10(b). Atlas Aircraft does not allege that it was improperly notified and does not explain why it has failed to supply those items which it says the record lacks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
