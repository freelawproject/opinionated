Summary judgment was granted for IBM on the ground that Newcomer had failed to satisfy the notice requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"Aob\">In 1975, when Newcomer first wrote the Department of Labor, \u00a7 626(d)(1) provided that one could not file a civil action until he had given the Secretary 60 days\u2019 notice, filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred. At no time did he file with the Secretary a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>notice of intent to sue, and the district court granted summary judgment for this reason. The notice of intent to sue is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Newcomer seeks to escape this bar on the basis of <em>Woodford v. Kinney Shoe Corp., </em>369 F.Supp. 911, 914-15 (N.D.Ga., 1973), which holds that the required notice need not be written and that if an employee merely notifies the Department of Labor within the 180-day period that he had been discharged because of age discrimination, he had given sufficient notice of intent to sue. <em>Woodford </em>is inconsistent with <em>Powell, </em>n. 1, <em>supra, </em>in which we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-4\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that her June 16, 1970 letter asking the Secretary to sue in her behalf constituted notice. Notice of a desire that an agency of the federal government commence litigation on one\u2019s behalf simply does not equate with notice of such an individual\u2019s personal intent to commence a private lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">494 F.2d at 485. In none of Newcomer\u2019s letters to the Department of Labor did he ever indicate that intention to file a civil discrimination suit against IBM. <em>See also Thomas v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., </em>574 F.2d 1324, 1330 (CA5, 1978). <em>Woodford </em>has been criticized in other circuits. <em>See Reich v. Dow Badische Co., </em>575 F.2d 363, 368 and cases cited (CA2, 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1006, 99 S.Ct. 621, 58 L.Ed.2d 683 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Newcomer seeks to distinguish <em>Powell </em>because the plaintiff in <em>Powell </em>was expressly informed by the Department of Labor of the notice requirements while in the present case there was a conflicting fact question on this issue. However, it is undisputed that Newcomer was aware of the 180-day notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Second, Newcomer relies upon the 1978 amendments to \u00a7 626(d)(1) as merely clarifying Congress\u2019s intent when it passed the original version of that section. This argument misses the mark because the 1978 amendments concern equitable tolling of the time period for filing notice, not the waiver of the notice itself. Here our concern is not timely filing but total lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">The summary judgment was proper. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">. <em>E. g., Quina </em>v. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., </em>575 F.2d 1115 (CA5, 1978); <em>Powell v. </em>Southwestern Bell <em>Telephone Co., </em>494 F.2d 485 (CA5, 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
