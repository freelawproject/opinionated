This court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>469 F.2d 679 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 908, 93 S.Ct. 1536, 36 L.Ed.2d 197 (1973). In September, 1978, Cantu filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asserting first, that the trial court erred in admitting a co-conspirator\u2019s out-of-court declarations without following the procedures established in <em>United States v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir. 1979) (en banc) and, second, that the statute under which he was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, does not permit the imposition of a special parole term. The district court denied relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In <em>James, </em>we held that the procedures adopted for determining the admissibility of a co-conspirator\u2019s out-of-court declarations were prospective. 590 F.2d at 583. Since Cantu\u2019s trial occurred prior to the decision in <em>James, </em>the district court did not err in failing to anticipate the result in <em>James.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">This court has never specifically addressed the question whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 allows the sentencing judge to impose a special parole term as a part of a defendant\u2019s sentence. We have, however, upheld the imposition of a special parole term under a statute with language very similar to that in \u00a7 846, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963, which forbids conspiracies to import controlled substances. <em>United States v. Dankert, </em>507 F.2d 190 (5th Cir. 1975). \u00a7 963 provides that the crime of conspiring to import controlled substances \u201cis punishable by imprisonment or fine or both [not to] exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.\u201d The <em>Dankert </em>court found that \u00a7 963 permitted the imposition of a special parole term since the punishment for substantive offense of importing controlled substances included a special parole term. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Like the statute at issue in <em>Dankert, </em>\u00a7 863 also provides that the maximum punishment for conspiracy is the same as that established for the substantive offense. The statute prohibiting the substantive offense of possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance and of distribution of a controlled substance permits the imposition of a special parole term. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Thus, under the logic of <em>Dankert, </em>the sentencing judge here did not err in imposing the special parole term. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Burman, </em>584 F.2d 1354, 1357-58 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Jacobson, </em>578 F.2d 863, 867-68 (10th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 932, 99 S.Ct. 324, 58 L.Ed.2d 327 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
