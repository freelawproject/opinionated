Freman, were tried together and convicted on different offenses arising from a scheme to distribute marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-28\">Appellants Delcazal and Freman raise two issues on appeal. First, they argue that the district court erred in allowing the government\u2019s chief witness \u2014 a co-conspirator not indicted by the grand jury \u2014 to testify concerning a marijuana delivery that was <em>allegedly intended originally </em>for Delcazal but was diverted to another buyer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>No objection was made to the testimony at trial and there was no error in its admission. The testimony was evidence of overt acts committed by other conspirators during the life of the conspiracy and as such was admissible. <em>United States v. Elliot, </em>571 F.2d 880, 911 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Perez, </em>489 F.2d 51, 70 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 945, 94 S.Ct. 3067, 41 L.Ed.2d 664 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Second, Decazal and Freman claim error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion for an indefinite continuance to obtain the presence of a witness the defendants had first tried to locate only three days prior to trial. The court denied the motion on the grounds that the defendants had failed to exercise due diligence in attempting to procure the witness. The exercise of due diligence is a prerequisite to the grant of such motions. <em>United States v. Uptain, </em>531 F.2d 1281, 1286 (5th Cir. 1976). A district court\u2019s ruling on such a motion will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>591 F.2d 1105, 1110 (5th Cir. 1979). No abuse of discretion occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The sole issue raised on appeal by the appellant D\u2019Angelo concerns a note sent to the trial judge by the jury after the jury reached its verdict. The note reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-7\">We have had great difficulty deciding and coming to agreement about Frank D\u2019Angelo and have decided as we did only because we believe <em>he </em>knew about the transactions and thus was a conspirator. (Emphasis by the jury)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">After discussing the significance of the note with counsel out of the jury\u2019s presence, the court decided that the note could not impeach the jury\u2019s general verdict of guilty. The jury was brought into the courtroom and polled, and all jurors adhered to the verdict. None of the jurors made any reference to the note or in any other way attempted to qualify or elaborate on the verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">We cannot divine with certainty why the jury sent the note or what it was intended to mean. It is entirely possible that the note means what D\u2019Angelo claims it means: that the jury found D\u2019Angelo guilty only because he <em>knew </em>about the transactions and thus was a conspirator. Willful participation is an essential element of the crime of conspiracy; mere knowledge of a conspiracy does not itself make a person a conspirator. <em>E. g., United States v. Binetti, </em>552 F.2d 1141 (5th Cir. 1977). If the jury convicted D\u2019Angelo on the basis of knowledge alone, it misapplied the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">The possibility that the jury misunderstood or even intentionally misapplied the law, however, does not warrant reversal of the conviction. D\u2019Angelo\u2019s attack on the verdict is an attempt to expose the jury\u2019s collective mental process to judicial scrutiny. There is no claim that the court erred in giving the law to the jury as it did. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>fact the court\u2019s instructions placed heavy emphasis on the necessity \u00f3f a finding of willful participation in the conspiracy. There is no claim that evidence of knowing participation did not exist. Indeed, there could not be such a claim for there was testimony by a government witness of direct dealings with D\u2019Angelo. There is no claim that the jury was corrupted by some extraneous influence, that the verdict was not unanimous, or that the verdict was anything other than a general verdict of guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s attack on the verdict is, as the trial judge characterized it, an attempt to use the jury\u2019s note to probe its process of deliberation and find out how and why the jury reached its verdict. That is the one form of attack on a verdict that has always been forbidden in Anglo-American criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">A jury has an obligation to follow the law as it is given by the trial court, but it is a peculiar facet of the jury institution that once a verdict is rendered, no judicial inquiry is permitted into the jury\u2019s deliberative process to determine if in fact the court\u2019s instructions were properly followed. As the Supreme Court noted long ago, in that limited sense a jury passes both on law and fact, for \u201c \u2018in practice, the verdict of the jury, both upon the law and the fact, is conclusive; because, from the nature of the proceeding, there is no judicial power by which the conclusion of law thus brought upon the record by that verdict can be reversed, set aside, or inquired into.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sparf v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 51, 80, 15 S.Ct. 273, 285, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895) (quoting from <em>Com. v. Anthes, </em>5 Gray 185).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Severe limitations exist on all attempts \u201cto breach the shroud surrounding jury deliberations,\u201d <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>553 F.2d 453, 457 (5th Cir. 1977). The rule of the common law is that a juror may not impeach his verdict. <em>E. g., McDonald v. Pless, </em>238 U.S. 264, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915); <em>United States v. Blackburn, </em>446 F.2d 1089, 1091 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Dickinson v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 630, 632 (5th Cir. 1970). The sanctity of the verdict may be impugned only by evidence of improper external influences on the jury\u2019s decision, e. <em>g., Mattox v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892); <em>Stimack v. Texas, </em>548 F.2d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Howard, </em>506 F.2d 865, 868 (5th Cir. 1975), or by a post-verdict determination that the evidence did not warrant submission to the jury in the first instance. Inquiry into the conscience or compliance of jurors, by contrast, requires inquiry into a matter that essentially inheres in the verdict, <em>Mattox v. United States, supra, </em>146 U.S. at 149, 13 S.Ct. at 53, and is thus strictly forbidden. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number><em>Howard, supra, </em>506 F.2d at 868 n. 3; <em>Miller v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 77, 83 n. 11 (2nd Cir. 1968). With the exception for evidence concerning extraneous influence, the Federal Rules of Evidence bar juror testimony \u201cas to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberation or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing him to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith.\u201d Fed.R. Evid. 606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The necessary consequence of the rule against examination of the jury\u2019s mental process is that convictions must stand despite the presence of plausible suspicion that the jury\u2019s mental process was ill-conceived. In <em>Davis v. United States, </em>47 F.2d 1071 (5th Cir. 1931), for example, a conviction was upheld despite the post-trial testimony of two jurors that the jury had considered the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand in his own defense as evidence of guilt, and that the jurors had not heard the trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury was not to consider or discuss the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Relying on <em>McDonald v. Pless, supra, </em>the court held that the improper argument of jurors within the jury room was not grounds for upsetting a verdict. 47 F.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">\u201c[T]he essential feature of a jury lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen.\u201d <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1906, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). To preserve that essential feature, the law trusts that a jury will understand and follow the law as instructed, and it indulges the jury when apparent gaps in understanding or logic later surface.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A jury, for example, may render logically inconsistent verdicts on different counts of an indictment or as to different co-defendants. It is not the duty of the court \u201cto unravel the ratiocinations of the jury\u2019s collective logic.\u201d <em>Odom v. United States, </em>377 F.2d 853, 857 (5th Cir. 1967). Nor may a court speculate that a verdict may have been the result of compromise, mistake or even carelessness. <em>United States v. Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 279, 64 S.Ct. 134, 135, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943); <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 393-94, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190-91, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932). \u201cJuries may indulge in precisely such motives or vagaries.\u201d <em>United States v. Dotterweich, supra, </em>320 U.S. at 279, 64 S.Ct. at 135. If courts were permitted to retry such verdicts, the result would be that every jury verdict would either become the court\u2019s verdict or would be permitted to stand only by the court\u2019s leave. This would destroy the effectiveness of the jury process which substantial justice demands and the constitution guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">All convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-18\">. All three appellants were indicted along with fourteen other persons for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Decazal and Freman were also indicted on one substantive count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Decazal was additionally charged with three counts of the use of a communication facility to facilitate the distribution of marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). D\u2019Angelo, Decazal and Freman were granted a severance from the other fourteen co-defendants and were tried together before a jury. The jury found the defendants guilty on all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">. Defense counsel present in the courtroom when the judge received the note neither requested nor suggested any procedure different from that followed by the court. Before bringing the jury back into the courtroom, the court heard comments on the note from D\u2019Angelo\u2019s counsel, the counsel for the other defendants, and the prosecutor. After rereading the note aloud several times, the court stated that the jury appeared to be attempting to explain its verdict. Mr. Zibilizh, counsel for Freman, noted that the contents of the note \u201ccould fly in the face of the law\u201d as the judge gave it, stating that \u201cjust because somebody knew of a transaction doesn\u2019t make him a conspirator necessarily.\u201d Following up on Mr. Zibilizh\u2019s comment, the judge agreed that the jury would have to find that D\u2019Angelo Was a willful participant before it could convict him. A dialogue then took place between the judge and Mr. Rodriguez, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s counsel. The judge spoke of the note as the jury\u2019s \u201cmental processes working,\u201d and Mr. Rodriguez agreed, stating that \u201cThere seems to be some doubt or there\u2019s something in the back of their mind.\u201d It was not suggested by D\u2019Angelo\u2019s counsel or any of the other lawyers present that the court declare a mistrial or send the jury back for more deliberation. Nor was there any effort to seek to interrogate the jurors to determine the purpose of the note, a procedure condemned in <em>United States v. Sexton, </em>456 F.2d 961, 965-67 (5th Cir. 1972). <em>See also United States v. Lee, </em>532 F.2d 911, 915 (3rd Cir. 1976). All counsel agreed with the court that the proper course of action was a jury poll. D\u2019Angelo\u2019s counsel did not attempt to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict on the basis of the note until post trial motions were filed for a directed verdict of acquittal or new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">. Because there is no question in this case as to what the jury\u2019s verdict actually was or as to whether or not it was unanimous, it is different in kind from cases in which a jury sends a note to a judge that casts suspicion on whether the verdict is unqualified or unanimous. Such cases usually involve a verdict accompanied by a jury request for leniency. See e. <em>g., Cook v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 966 (5th Cir. 1967); <em>Krullk v. United States, </em>240 F.2d 122 (5th Cir. 1957); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>532 F.2d 911 (3rd Cir. 1976); <em>Thlinket Packing Co. v. United States, </em>236 F. 109 (9th Cir. 1916). Such a request is normally regarded as surplusage. 8A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice j[31.02[3], A request by the jury for clemency does not invalidate the verdict and may be disregarded by the court. <em>Krull v. United States, supra, </em>240 F.2d at 133; <em>United States v. Lee, supra, </em>532 F.2d at 914-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">It is true that in <em>United States v. Cook, supra, </em>a conviction was reversed because of circumstances that included a jury request for leniency. However, in <em>Cook, </em>the jury found a defendant guilty but included an asterisk on the verdict which referred to a footnote requesting \u201cevery degree of leniency possible.\u201d When polled, ten of the jurors responded to the question guilty or not guilty by answering, \u201cGuilty, based on the note at the bottom.\u201d On appeal this court held that the note, coupled with the conditional answers given by the jurors when polled, created doubt as to what the verdict actually was and to whether or not it was unanimous. <em>Cook </em>held that it was error to deny defense counsel\u2019s requests for a second poll, or for further jury deliberations accompanied hy an instruction that the jury had no power to control the sentence once a verdict was returned. <em>Cook </em>has been described as <em>\u201csui generis </em>in federal decisional law.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, supra, </em>532 F.2d at 914. Unlike <em>Cook, </em>in the case at bar neither the note nor the jury poll suggest any irregularity intrinsic to the actual verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">. Professor Moore writes: \u201cThere must come a time when the temptation to analyze and fragment a jury verdict must yield to the perspective that lack of perfection inheres in the jury system.\u201d 8A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1131.-08[1][a],</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
