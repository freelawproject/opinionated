The plaintiff proved a prior judgment in an action brought by him in equity, to enjoin the defendant from using the water of this stream, and to recover the damages caused by the use from 1868 to 1873. In that action it was held that the defendant had no right to take the water of the stream, and it was enjoined from using this water to the plaintiff\u2019s prejudice, and the plaintiff\u2019s damages for the five years were assessed at $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-9\">Plaintiff also proved that, notwithstanding the judgment, defendant continued to use the water. Defendant claimed, and gave evidence tending to show, and the referee found, that the amount of water taken by it made no appreciable difference in the water of the creek, and that plaintiff had sustained no damage.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The following is the <em>mem. </em>of opinion :</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-4\">\u201c The defendant began taking water from the creek about November, 1869. The plaintiff was not permitted to prove that after this date there was less water in the stream during the summer months than before. This was a relevant fact. Its probative force would depend upon a variety of other facts, like the rainfall of the particular season, to be developed upon cross-examination, or by the examination of other witnessess. For this error of the referee the order of the General Term must be sustained and a judgment absolute ordered in favor of the plaintiff, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b678-5\"><em>Daniel H. McMillan </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b678-6\"><em>James Breck Perkins </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam mem.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AWo\">for affirmance of order and for judgment absolute against defendant on stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">All concur, except Bradley and Haight, JJ., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Order affirmed and judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
