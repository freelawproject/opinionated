Specifically, it requires us to determine whether an airport parking lot, neither owned, maintained, or designated for parking by the employer airlines, falls within the former exception and whether the fence, enclosing that lot, which from time to time is climbed by some going to and from work, falls within the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Appellant, Allen Henville, an employee of appellee, Southwest Airlines, Inc., was injured when, upon leaving work, he attempted to climb over a four-foot fence that enclosed the lot, in which he and his wife had parked their car. The entrance to that lot lay a half mile away and was serviced by a shuttle bus. To this interesting mixture of facts, we add that the lot in question was not one of those provided by Southwest for its employees. It was a state-owned lot, officially designated \u201cLot A,\u201d to which his wife had parking privileges, as a state employee, and at which appellant was lawfully parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Following his fall, appellant filed a claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d) against appellee Southwest and its insurer, appellee Reliance National Indemnity, asserting that he had sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. Specifically, he claimed that because the injury occurred between Lot A and his place of employment, it fell within the \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cproximity\u201d exceptions to the going and coming rule and was therefore covered by the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Following a hearing on that claim, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), found that appellant had not sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. It therefore concluded that appellant\u2019s injuries were not compensable under the Act. Thereafter, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In response to that petition, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. At the motions hearing that followed, the circuit court affirmed the order of the Commission and entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, on the ground that, under the \u201cpremises\u201d exception<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cany of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>other exceptionf] to the going and coming rule,\u201d appellant\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment with Southwest. From that order, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The only issue before this Court is whether appellant\u2019s claim falls within the \u201cpremises\u201d exception or the \u201cproximity\u201d exception to the going and coming rule. Because we find appellant\u2019s claim does not fall within either exception, we conclude that appellant\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. Therefore, his injuries are not compensable under the Act. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On June 1, 1999, appellant, Allen Henville, a baggage handler for appellee, Southwest Airlines, Inc., and his wife, a state employee, drove in her car to the Baltimore \u2014 Washington International Airport where they both worked. Southwest is located in Terminal C of that airport and its employees have parking privileges at satellite lots A, B, and C. On that day, however, appellant\u2019s wife parked in Lot A, a restricted \u201cauthorized vehicles only\u201d lot, adjacent to the main terminal of that airport where appellant\u2019s wife, as a state employee, had parking privileges. Lot A, like all of the parking lots and facilities at the airport, is owned by the Maryland Aviation Administration (\u201cMAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Although appellant had no parking privileges at Lot A, his wife, as noted, did. Moreover, appellant was not prohibited from parking at that lot because he was an employee of Southwest Airlines and the vehicle he was driving had the proper sticker affixed to it. In fact, MAA permitted its employees to lend their parking spaces to other airport employees as the need arose. For example, Mr. Keen,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of transportation for the MAA, apparently permitted his secretary to park in his spot when he was away on vacation. And, according to Mr. Keen, another Southwest employee was using her boyfriend\u2019s spot in that lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On June 1, 1999, appellant began his shift at Terminal C, the location of Southwest. At 12:22 a.m. the next day, appellant \u201cpunched out\u201d leaving the lower level of Terminal C through a rear entrance. A co-employee then drove appellant in a Southwest truck around the perimeter of Terminals A, B, and C on airport service roads to Lot A, where his wife had parked earlier. Lot A was enclosed by a four-foot high fence; its main entrance was approximately one-half mile from the terminal of the airport. Rather than walk or take a shuttle to the main entrance of Lot A, appellant attempted to climb over the fence. Unfortunately, as he began his climb, his foot slipped, causing him to fall and fracture his left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Appellant contends his injury falls within the \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cproximity\u201d exceptions to the going and coming rule. Therefore, appellant asserts that his injury did arise out of and occur in the course of his employment and, accordingly, is compensable under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s claim, however, we must first place them in the context of the Act. To do that, we must review the applicable portions of the Act and define the terms of the Act that are relevant to this analysis. The section of the Act that bears directly on appellant\u2019s claim of coverage states that \u201ceach employer of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to: (1) the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee.... \u201d Md. Code (1999 Repl. Vol., 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 9-501(a)(l) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d). The Act defines \u201c[ajccidental personal injury [as]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(1) an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">(2) an injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a third person ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">(3) a disease or infection ... that arises out of and in the course of employment.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Because appellant\u2019s injuries obviously did not result from the \u201cwillful or negligent act of a third person\u201d or \u201ca disease or infection,\u201d his claim falls under L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 101(b)(1). That section requires that for an injury to be compensable, it must occur both \u201caris|ingj out of and in the course of employment.\u201d \u201cThe words \u2018out of and \u2018in the course of employment ... are not synonymous; and both must be satisfied by the claimant.... \u201d <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 590, 212 A.2d 324 (1965); <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. McLaughlin, </em>11 Md.App. 360, 361, n. 1, 274 A.2d 390 (1971); <em>Kletz v. Nuway Distribs., </em>62 Md.App. 158, 162, 488 A.2d 978 (1985). \u201cThe words \u2018out of refer to the cause or origin of the accident, while the phrase \u2018in the course of relates to the time, place and circumstances under which it occurred.\u201d <em>King Waterproofing Co. v. Slovsky, </em>71 Md.App. 247, 251-52, 524 A.2d 1245 (1987)(citing <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 205, 373 A.2d 613 (1977); <em>Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Miller, </em>23 Md.App. 271, 272, 326 A.2d 186 (1974), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Md. 192, 338 A.2d 71 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">As to the appropriate standard of review, we note that the decisions of the Commission are \u201cpresumed to be prima facie coirect....\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-745(b)(1). Nonetheless, we are required to determine whether the Commission \u201c(1) justly considered all of the facts about the accidental personal injury ... ;(2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or (3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-745(c). A Commission ruling may be reversed \u201cupon a finding that its action was based upon an erroneous construction of the law or facts.... \u201d <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 658, 399 A.2d 250 (1979)(cit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ing <em>Maryland Bureau of Mines v. Powers, </em>258 Md. 879, 382, 265 A.2d 860 (1970)). Indeed, \u201c[notwithstanding the deferential treatment of the Commission\u2019s decision, a reviewing court has broad authority and may reverse the Commission\u2019s decision when it is based on an erroneous conception of the law.\u201d <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 533, 709 A.2d 155 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It is well settled that injuries that are sustained by employees going to or coming from work are not covered by the Act unless they fall within a recognized exception. <em>Morris v. Board of Educ., </em>339 Md. 374, 380, 663 A.2d 578 (1995); <em>Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane v. Tornillo, </em>329 Md. 40, 44, 617 A.2d 572 (1993). The reason is that the Act \u201ccontemplates an employee engaged in a service growing out of his employment. An employee who is merely going to or coming from his work is not rendering any such service.. He is therefore exposed to the hazards encountered on such trips, not as an employee, but rather as a member of the general public.\u201d <em>Wiley Mfg. Co., </em>280 Md. at 200, 373 A.2d 613 (citing <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corp., </em>242 Md. 299, 303, 219 A.2d 43 (1966); <em>Rumple v. Henry H. Meyer Co., </em>208 Md. 350, 357, 118 A.2d 486 (1955)). Moreover, \u201cgetting to work is considered to be an employee\u2019s own responsibility and ordinarily does not involve advancing the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>339 Md. at 380, 663 A.2d 578 (citing <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 32, 660 A.2d 423 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Nonetheless, appellant claims that his injuries are compensable under the Act. In support of that claim, he relies on two exceptions to the going and coming rule: the \u201cpremises\u201d exception and the \u201cproximity\u201d exception. The \u201cpremises\u201d exception is usually invoked'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">where the employee is injured while traveling along or across a public road between two portions of his employer\u2019s premises, whether going or coming, or pursuing the actual duties of his employment. A typical application of this exception, according to the Court of Appeals, occurs where injury is sustained by an employee while traveling between a company parking lot and his employer\u2019s plant----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 206, 373 A.2d 613. On the other hand, \u201c \u2018if the parking lot is a purely private one, the principle of passage between two parts of the premises is not available, and an employee crossing a public street to get to the parking lot is not protected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vache, </em>349 Md. at 533, 709 A.2d 155 (quoting <em>Proctor-Silex Corp. v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 482-83, 252 A.2d 800) (quoting 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 15.14 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The reasoning underlying this exception is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Since ... a parking lot owned or maintained by the employer is treated by most courts as part of the premises, the majority rule is that an injury in a public street or other off \u2014 premises place between the plant and the parking lot is in the course of employment, being on a <em>necessary </em>route between the two portions of the premises....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>Vache, </em>349 Md. at 533, 709 A.2d 155 (quoting <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 206-07, 373 A.2d 613) (quoting 1 Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 15.14 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Although appellant\u2019s fall did occur between his place of employment and an employee parking lot, his claim does not fall within the ambit of the \u201cpremises\u201d exception. The parking lot where appellant had parked and was walking to when his injury occurred was neither owned nor maintained by his employer for the benefit of Southwest employees. Indeed, there was no evidence that appellant\u2019s employer even knew he was using that lot instead of the satellite lots that had been provided for the use of Southwest employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Yet, appellant, relying principally on <em>May Department Stores Company v. Harryman, </em>307 Md. 692, 517 A.2d 71 (1986), maintains that the \u201cpremises\u201d exception is applicable to the facts of his case. In <em>May, </em>an employee of a mall department store parked her car in a parking lot provided by the mall. After getting out of her car, she was mugged and injured on the lot. While the parking lot was not owned, controlled, or maintained by the May Department Stores Company, it was provided by the mall for all of the employees and customers of the mail\u2019s tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The <em>May </em>Court began its analysis by quoting the following language from Larson\u2019s, \u00a7 15.42(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">As to parking lots owned by the employer, or maintained by the employer for his employees, the great majority of jurisdictions consider them part of the \u2018premises,\u2019 whether within the main company premises or separated from it. This rule is by no means confined to parking lots owned, controlled, or maintained by the employer. The doctrine has been applied when the lot, although not owned by the employer, was exclusively used, or used with the owner\u2019s special permission, or just used, by the employees of this employer. Thus, if the owner of the building in which the employee works provides a parking lot for the convenience of all his tenants, or if a shopping center parking lot is used by employees of businesses located in the center, the rule is applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 696, 517 A.2d 71 (quoting 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 15.42(a) (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Then, after observing that \u201cmulti-tenanted shopping centers are a special type of working environment,\u201d the Court of Appeals quoted <em>Frishkorn v. Flowers, </em>26 Ohio App.2d 165, 167, 270 N.E.2d 366 (1971), on the absurdity of excluding injuries that occurred on parking lots shared by many businesses from coverage under the \u201cpremises\u201d exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">It would be impractical and illogical to apply this principle to a shopping plaza consisting of multiple independent businesses, each of which would have to be an owner in common with all the other tenants in order to share a nebulous control over its geographical confines and stimulate a joint zone of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">Hi * Hs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">In the instant case <em>[Frishkorn], </em>the parking area was appellant\u2019s <em>normal and customary </em>means to and from his employer\u2019s premises to which such passageway was an indispensable appurtenance. In reality, the employer and the other tenants of the Great Northern Shopping Center, having reciprocal rental rights and privileges, were also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>accorded the common use and access of the parking area. Logically, to that extent, this was tantamount to an essential expansion of their respective premises for the purpose of adequately serving and furthering their business interests. <em>It follows that the appellant-employee, as well as the employees of the other tenants, derived their similar rights and privileges from the shopping center by virtue of a vested, privity in the objectives of their employers. </em>(Citations omitted)(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><em>May Department Stores Company, </em>307 Md. at 697-98, 517 A.2d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Concluding that in such instances the employer\u2019s premises included parking lots not owned or maintained by the employer, the Court found in <em>May </em>that the employee was covered by the Act under the \u201cpremises\u201d exception to the going and coming rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cLike the parking area at a shopping mall,\u201d appellant argues (unconstrained by the conventional rules of grammar), \u201cemployees at the airport are entitled (albeit for a fee) to use the parking facilities,\u201d including Lot A, so long as they have a parking sticker affixed to their vehicle. Rounding out that analogy, appellant points out that although Lot A \u201cis not under the control of the employer,\u201d it is \u201cas in a mall situation, ... under the control of the employer\u2019s landlord \u2014 in this case the Maryland Aviation Authority.\u201d Therefore, appellant implies, the lot in question was part of his employer\u2019s premises and thus his injury fell within the \u201cpremises\u201d exception. While an airport with multiple employers may in the broadest terms bear a superficial resemblance to a shopping mall with multiple tenants, we are unpersuaded that <em>May\u2019s </em>expansion of the \u201cpremises rule\u201d to mall parking lots is applicable to here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In <em>May, </em>the plaintiff parked in a mall parking lot provided for employees and business invitees of the mall. While the parking lot was not owned, controlled, or maintained by the May Department Stores Company, it was a parking lot provided for all of the employees and customers of the shopping mail\u2019s tenants. Indeed, it was the \u201cnormal and customary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>means\u201d by which employees went to and from their employers\u2019 premises and thus the \u201cpassageway was an indispensable appurtenance.\u201d <em>May Department Stores, </em>307 Md. at 697, 517 A.2d 71 (quoting <em>Frishkorn, </em>26 Ohio App.2d at 167, 270 N.E.2d 366). In contrast to <em>May, </em>it was not the \u201cnormal and customary\u201d practice of Southwest employees to use Lot A to go to and from Southwest. Rather, the \u201cnormal and customary\u201d practice of Southwest employees was to park their vehicles in the lots provided for their use \u2014 satellite parking lots A, B or C. As the circuit court explained: \u201cI think that the difference [between <em>May </em>and the instant case] is that the case we have before us, all the parking lots are not open to all the employees of all the stores, which we would call the tenants of the airport in this case. They distinctly made lots restricted. Only certain people can park in certain lots. And this particular lot is one of those restricted lots.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">To find Southwest liable under the Act for an accidental injury at a parking lot not \u201cprovided by\u201d Southwest would be an unwarranted expansion of the \u201cpremises\u201d rule. As noted by this Court in <em>Globe Screen Printing v. Young, </em>138 Md.App. 122, 770 A.2d 1064 (2001), the \u201cpremises exception was created in recognition of the fact that a parking lot <em>provided by </em>an employer for employees is by its very nature an integral part of the premises of that employer\u2019s business----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 770 A.2d 1064 (emphasis added). There, we held that the mere fact that an accidental injury \u201coccurred between [plaintiffs] place of employment and. the employee parking lot, that happenstance [alone] does not bring the facts of this case within the ambit of the premises exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 770 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">We further note that no evidence was adduced nor any claim made that Southwest had any responsibility for or control over Lot A or in the issuance of permits to park there. Indeed, as admitted by appellant in his testimony before the Commission, appellant, by virtue of his employment alone, would not have been able to park in or otherwise gain access to the parking lot. Nor was there any evidence that Southwest knew that its employees parked there. Rather, as noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the parking area provided for Southwest employees was in satellite parking lots A, B or C. For these reasons, we believe appellant failed to satisfy the requirements of the \u201cpremises\u201d exception of the going and coming rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Appellant further contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the facts of the instant case did not fall within the ambit of the \u201cproximity\u201d exception to the going and coming rule. The \u201cproximity\u201d or \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception has \u201ctwo vital components: \u2018[t]he first is the presence of a special hazard at the particular off-premises point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d 613 (citations omitted). A special hazard is a \u201cdanger peculiarly or to an abnormal degree beyond that to which the general public [is] subjected....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 373 A.2d 613 (quoting <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 591, 212 A.2d 324 (1965)). \u201cThe second is the close association of the access route with the premises.... \u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d 613 (quoting 1 Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 15.13 (1972)). In sum, \u201c \u2018[t]he gravamen of [the \u201cproximity\u201d exception] is not that the employee is in close proximity to his place of employment, but rather that by reason of such proximity the employee is subjected to danger peculiarly or to an abnormal degree beyond that to which the general public was subjected....\u2019\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 209, 373 A.2d 613 (quoting <em>Pariser Bakery, </em>239 Md. at 591, 212 A.2d 324). Both components must be satisfied for the \u201cproximity\u201d exception to apply. <em>Vache, </em>349 Md. at 538, 709 A.2d 155 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In <em>Wiley, </em>the Court of Appeals held that injuries sustained by \u201ctwo co-workers while taking a shortcut along a railroad right of way to a company parking lot, located some 790 feet from the entrance to their place of employment, arose \u2018out of and in the course of their employment.... \u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 202, 373 A.2d 613. The two workers were \u201cwalk[ing] up the main line tracks of the Penn Central Railroad in the direction of the north parking lot,\u201d where one of them had parked his car, when they \u201cwere struck from the rear by a northbound train.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 373 A.2d 613. The employees there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201cwere injured while taking a hazardous route \u2014 albeit one which was significantly more dangerous, but not substantially more convenient than an alternative means of egress \u2014 in close proximity to their place of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 373 A.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In holding that the employees were covered by the \u201cproximity\u201d exception despite the existence of a less dangerous route, the <em>Wiley </em>court stressed that the more dangerous route selected by the employees was a route which they and their fellow employees had used for years and that the defendant employer, by failing to take any measures to halt that practice, had impliedly consented to it. Although appellant claimed that other employees had climbed over the fence in question, he did not assert that this practice was common among the employees of Southwest or that it had gone on for years with the implied consent of Southwest. Appellant only testified that \u201ca lot of the guys from United and other airlines jump over [the fence] to go to their cars;\u201d he did not specify that that included employees of Southwest or that Southwest knew or should have known about that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Furthermore, the fence did not pose a special hazard, a \u201c \u2018danger peculiarly or to an abnormal degree beyond that to which the general public [is] subjected....\u2019\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 209, 373 A.2d 613 (quoting <em>Pariser Bakery, </em>239 Md. at 591, 212 A.2d 324). On that point, we find <em>Corcoran v. Fitzgerald Bros., </em>239 Minn. 38, 58 N.W.2d 744 (1953), particularly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In <em>Corcoran, </em>a construction worker was employed by a contractor to assist in. the construction of a new building. To protect the construction equipment at the building site, the contractor erected a ten-foot high fence around the site. At the northeast and southwest corners of that fence, gates were provided for ingress and egress.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">At the close of work one day, the plaintiff found the northeast gate of the fence locked. Rather than walk around to the southwest comer of the fence, the plaintiff attempted to scale the northeast side of the fence \u201cto save himself the walk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>... [of] a distance of about 3/\u00a3 or 4 ordinary blocks.\u201d <em>Corcor-an, </em>58 N.W.2d at 745 (1953). In holding that the plaintiffs accident did not arise out of and in the course of employment the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">It is common knowledge that a ten-foot fence, erected as was the one in this case, is there for the purpose of preventing ingress or egress at the places where it is located. The employer provided a safe means of egress; the employee had used that exit the previous night and knew that it was there. When he unnecessarily chose to climb over the fence to save himself a comparatively short walk, it cannot be said that the injury sustained in so doing arose out of his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">As in <em>Corcoran, </em>it was common knowledge that the four-foot fence surrounding Lot A was for the purpose of restricting ingress and egress into that lot, which, as noted earlier, was restricted to state employees with minor exceptions. <em>Corcor-an, </em>58 N.W.2d at 745. Rather than use a \u201csafe means of egress\u201d \u2014 a one-half mile walk or shuttle ride to the lot\u2019s entrance \u2014 appellant chose to climb over a four-foot high fence surrounding the lot. When he did so, he unnecessarily exposed himself to risks that were of his own making and were neither known of nor approved by his employer. There were risks, as in <em>Corcoran, </em>which did not arise out of his employment. Because the fence did not create a special hazard to those who sensibly observed its purpose, appellant failed to satisfy the first \u201ccomponent\u201d of the \u201cproximity\u201d rule: \u201c \u2018the presence of a special hazard at the particular off-premise point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d 613 (citation omitted). We therefore need not address the second component of the \u201cproximity\u201d rule, \u201cthe close association of the access route with the premises,\u201d other than to observe that appellant was close to his place of employment when injured. We repeat, however, that \u201c \u2018[t]he gravamen of [the \u201cproximity\u201d rule] is not that the employee is in close proximity to his place of employment, but rather that by reason of such proximity the employee is subjected to danger peculiarly or to an abnormal degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>beyond that to which the general public was subjected...\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>280 Md. at 209, 373 A.2d 613 (quoting <em>Pariser Bakery, </em>239 Md. at 591, 212 A.2d 324).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Consequently, we hold that because the \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cproximity\u201d exceptions to the going and- coming rule are not applicable to the facts of this case, appellant\u2019s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">.
