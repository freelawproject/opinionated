The answer to that question is neither as simple nor as predictable as it might appear at first blush.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Our review of relevant law reveals, on the one hand, an Executive Order that imposes a progressive scheme of disciplinary action and appears to prohibit termination for a first offense of this nature, and, on the other, an administrative regulation that mandates automatic termination for such an offense. The relationship between the two lies at the core of this appeal. It is our task to determine which governs appellant\u2019s dismissal and to what effect. In the course of doing so, we hope to clarify the nature of executive orders and their relationship to regulations propounded by state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The employee, whose misadventure gave rise to this case, was Jeffrey Beard. Mr. Beard\u2019s employment as a Drinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Driver Monitor- with appellant was terminated when he was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol by the District Court for Allegany County. Beard appealed that termination to the Secretary of Budget and Management, who referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings. A hearing was then held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Citing Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, containing Maryland\u2019s Substance Abuse Policy for Executive Branch employees, the ALJ ordered, among other things, that Beard\u2019s termination be reversed and that he be reinstated under certain conditions. Following that decision, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. That court, after conducting a hearing, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Appellant then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While this appeal was pending, Mr. Beard passed away. Thereafter, counsel for Mr. Beard filed a motion to substitute the estate of Mr. Beard as appellee. We granted that motion and ordered that Joseph William Beard and Mary W. Owens, personal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey Beard, be substituted as appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant presents three questions for our review. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">I. Did the administrative law judge err in holding that the Substance Abuse Policy, contained in Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, applied to the \u2022 termination of appellee\u2019s state employment as a Drinking Driver Monitor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">II. Did the administrative law judge err in holding that the Substance Abuse Policy prevented the termination of appellee\u2019s employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">III. Did the administrative law judge err by reinstating appellee under certain conditions with back pay rather than remanding the case to the Division of Parole and Probation for disposition?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the ALJ did not eiT in applying the disciplinary provisions of the Substance Abuse Policy to the case <em>sub judice. </em>That policy, promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>by Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, is applicable to an employee of the Executive Branch of State Government who is convicted <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an \u201coff-the-workplace alcohol driving offense.\u201d And it governs the disciplinary actions that may be taken against such an employee for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We further hold that the ALJ correctly concluded that the Substance Abuse Policy prohibited appellant from terminating Beard\u2019s employment for his first conviction of an \u201coff-the-workplace alcohol driving offense.\u201d Finally, we conclude that the ALJ did not exceed his authority by conditionally reinstating Beard with back-pay rather than remanding the matter to the appointing authority,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Division of Parole and Probation, a unit within the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. In 1994, Beard began working as a Drinking Driver Monitor for the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cDPSCS\u201d), Division of Parole and Probation (\u201cDPP\u201d). He was hired as a \u201cMonitor II,\u201d a position that is classified as \u201csensitive\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>that falls within the \u201cskilled and professional services.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a monitor, Beard was responsible for supervising \u201cdrinking driver offenders\u201d assigned to him. His duties included ensuring that offenders complied with the conditions of their probation, making certain that they attended required treatment and counseling programs, and recognizing signs that the offender had resumed drinking so he or she could be placed in a treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Before becoming a monitor, Beard himself had had a history of alcohol abuse. In applying for that position, Beard disclosed that, on four occasions, he either had been either convicted of or had received probation before judgment for driving under the influence of alcohol or driving while intoxicated. That, however, was not a bar to his employment as a monitor. In fact, the Director of the DPP testified before the ALJ that the hiring of past offenders as monitors in the Drinking Driver Monitor Program is \u201cencouraged.\u201d Those with histories of alcohol abuse, the Director stated, are more likely to recognize when an offender has resumed drinking as well as serve as positive role models for the people that they monitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Beard had remained sober for the six years preceding his employment as a monitor. Four years later, however, in August of 1998, Beard experienced a relapse and was hospitalized. Beard reported his relapse to his supervisors at the DPP. No disciplinary action was taken. After being discharged from the hospital, however, Beard relapsed again and between September and November of 1998 drank alcoholic beverages on at least six occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">On the evening of November 8, 1998, after drinking beer at his home in Allegany County, Maryland, Beard drove to a fast food restaurant. While in the \u201cdrive-thru\u201d lane of that restaurant, Beard\u2019s car bumped into the car in front of him. The police were called, and Beard was arrested and charged with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>among other things, driving under the influence of alcohol. On March 18, 1999, Beard appeared before the District Court for Allegany County and pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. The court accepted his plea and convicted him of that offense. Beard was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment. That sentence was suspended, and he was placed on three years of unsupervised probation, and ordered to pay fines and court costs, attend counseling, and serve six months of home detention with permission to go to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Beard reported his arrest to the DPP and was thereafter placed on administrative leave. The DPP then sent a \u201cnotice of termination\u201d to Beard. In that notice, the DPP charged Beard with violating Section II, paragraphs B.1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and B.10,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Section IV, paragraphs H.1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and H.2<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the DPSCS Standards of Conduct Manual, (\u201cDPSCS Manual\u201d) as well as the following provisions of the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d): 17.04.05.04 B(3), 17.04.05.04 B(8), and 17.04.05.04 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>B(15).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the hearing before the ALJ, appellant conceded that the DPSCS Manual contains disciplinary provisions pertaining to alcohol driving offenses that are virtually identical to the schedule of disciplinary measures contained in Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, which appellant now argues was erroneously applied by the ALJ to the case. In addition to listing the charges against Beard, the notice of termination explained why termination was appropriate, stressing Beard\u2019s plea of guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and noting that Beard \u201cconsciously attempted to calculate the amount of alcohol he had consumed and when he would be below the legal limit of intoxication.\u201d It further noted that police found an open container of alcohol in his car at the time of his arrest. It asserted that \u201cBeard\u2019s ability to effectively monitor the behavior of those that he is charged with is seriously questioned given the fact that he has to be similarly monitored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Pursuant to State Personnel and Pensions (\u201cSPP\u201d)(1993, 1997 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 11-110 of the Maryland Code Annotated, Beard appealed his termination to the Secretary of Budget and Management, who referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings, and a hearing was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>before an ALJ. At that hearing, appellant stipulated that \u201cthe Executive Order ... Maryland Substance Abuse Policy 01.01.1991.16 has the effect of law ... [a]nd as such, outweighs any particular agency\u2019s policies.\u201d That stipulation, we note, is contrary to its present position. Following that hearing, the ALJ issued a decision reversing Beard\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In that decision, the ALJ determined that Beard\u2019s \u201cconduct constituted a violation of COMAR 17.04.05.04B(3) and CO-MAR 17.04.05.04B(8) or, in the alternative, the Standards of Conduct contained in the DPSCS Standards of Conduct Manual, Section II, Paragraphs B.l and B.10,\u201d but concluded that termination was not an appropriate disciplinary action. The ALJ reasoned that \u201c[although management can impose disciplinary action against an employee under other, more general, prohibitions against improper conduct ... the measure of that discipline is circumscribed by the specific pronouncements contained in the State of Maryland Substance Abuse Policy.\u201d Under those provisions, he concluded, termination of state service was not an authorized sanction for Beard\u2019s first conviction for an off-the-workplace alcohol driving offense while a state employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Declaring the DPP\u2019s termination of Beard to be \u201ccontrary to applicable State regulations and established agency policy\u201d and thus \u201can abuse of discretion,\u201d the ALJ ordered that Beard be \u201crestored to a duty status as a Monitor II in the Drinking Driver Monitor Program,\u201d that he \u201cbe awarded back pay retroactive from April 1, 1999, up to and including the date of [the] decision,\u201d and that the DPP \u201cimmediately refer [Beard] to the Employee Assistance Program.\u201d As the Substance Abuse Policy requires that \u201c[a]ll employees in the workplace must be capable of performing their duties,\u201d the ALJ also ordered that Beard\u2019s reinstatement \u201cas a Monitor II\u201d was \u201ccondition[ed] upon him being able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the DPP, that he is abstaining from the use of any alcoholic beverages, his current participation in, or recent completion of, a certified alcoholic treatment program, his ongoing participation in Alcoholics Anonymous or another acceptable self-help group, and his compliance with any addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tional recommendations made by the Employee Assistance Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Thereafter, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After a hearing on that petition, the circuit court issued an order affirming the decision of the ALJ. In that order, the circuit court determined that in light of a \u201cstipulation entered on the record before the ALJ ... the Executive Order has the effect of law and outweighs any particular agency\u2019s policies,\u201d the ALJ was \u201ccorrect in holding that termination was not an appropriate disciplinary action under the facts of this case.\u201d The court added that it did \u201cnot believe that the decision not to charge respondent under the Executive Order\u2019s terms relieves the agency of its obligation to abide by clearly applicable limits on its disciplinary authority.\u201d The circuit court concluded that \u201cthe ALJ was not merely substituting his judgment with respect to the appropriate sanction for that of the agency.\u201d \u201cRather,\u201d according to the court, the ALJ was \u201crequiring the agency to comply [ ] with an overriding legal stricture, which the ALJ correctly found to be applicable to the agency\u2019s disciplinary actions.\u201d Dissatisfied with the circuit court\u2019s af-firmance of the ALJ\u2019s decision, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Appellant contends that the ALJ erred as a matter of law in three ways: first, by applying the Substance Abuse Policy, contained in Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, to the case <em>sub juclice; </em>second, by interpreting the provisions of that policy to preclude Beard\u2019s termination; and third, by fashioning sanctions for Beard rather than remanding this case to allow the DPP, Beard\u2019s appointing authority, to assess and impose appropriate sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In addressing these claims, we review \u201cthe decision of the ALJ, not the decision of the trial court.\u201d <em>Abbey v. University of Maryland, </em>126 Md.App. 46, 53, 727 A.2d 406 (1999) (citing <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273. Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974); <em>Consumer Protec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>tion Div. v. Luskin\u2019s, Inc., </em>120 Md.App. 1, 22, 706 A.2d 102 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, Luskin\u2019s, Inc. v. Consumer Protection Div., </em>353 Md. 335, 726 A.2d 702 (1999)). In reviewing that decision, we apply \u201cthe same statutory standards as the Circuit Court.\u201d <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495, 769 A.2d 912 (2001). Accordingly, we may \u201creverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision: (i) is unconstitutional; (ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker; (iii) results from an unlawful procedure;(iv) is affected by any other error of law;(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or (vi) is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d Md.Code Ann. (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-222(h)(3) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). In brief, our role \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Because there is no dispute here as to the substantiality of the evidence, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision only to determine if it is \u201cpremised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d Applying that standard, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not so premised and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We now turn to the three claims advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Appellant contends that the ALJ erred by applying the Substance Abuse Policy to the case <em>sub judice. </em>According to appellant, the ALJ\u2019s decision was based upon a \u201cmisconception\u201d that the Substance Abuse Policy \u201cpreempts any other statute, regulation or policy under which Beard\u2019s conduct may be subject to discipline.\u201d The latter claim is more than a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>curious given that appellant' stipulated before the ALJ that Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, which embodies the Substance Abuse Policy, \u201chas the effect of law ... [a]nd as such, outweighs any particular agency\u2019s policies.\u201d We shall nonetheless address this issue to clarify the nature of Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, its relationship to applicable statutes and CO-MAR regulations, and its effect upon disciplinary actions that may be imposed upon Executive Branch employees who are convicted of \u201coff-the-workplace alcohol driving offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u201c[T]he Governor, as the head of the Executive Branch, has broad powers with respect to Executive Branch State employees .... \u201d <em>Maryland Classified Employees Assoc., v. Schaefer, </em>325 Md. 19, 34, 599 A.2d 91 (1991); <em>see also McCulloch v. Glendening, </em>347 Md. 272, 284, 701 A.2d 99 (1997) (noting the Governor of Maryland \u201chas a significant role in setting policies to govern the management and supervision of State employees\u201d). The Governor\u2019s authority over the Executive Branch and its employees is rooted in, Maryland\u2019s Constitution and statutory law. <em>McCulloch, </em>347 Md. at 284-85, 701 A.2d 99. Article II, \u00a7 9 of the Constitution of Maryland requires the Governor to \u201ctake care that the Laws are faithfully executed,\u201d and Article II, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of Maryland provides in part that \u201c[t]he executive power of the State shall be vested in a Governor.\u201d Md.Code Ann. (1981 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.) of the Const. Article. <em>See also McCulloch, </em>347 Md. at 282-83, 701 A.2d 99 (stating that the Governor\u2019s executive power can be found in two sections of the Maryland Constitution, \u201cnamely, Article II, \u00a7 1 ... and Article II, \u00a7 9\u201d). \u201cEntirely consistent with, and complementary of the Governor\u2019s executive power under Article II, \u00a7 1, the General Assembly has, through enactment of Md.Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-302 of the State Govt. Article, entrusted to the Governor the power to establish personnel policies and to require executive agency heads to carry out those policies.\u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>347 Md. at 284-85, 701 A.2d 99. SG \u00a7 3-302 provides that \u201c[t]he Governor is the head of the Executive Branch of the State government and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall supervise and direct the officers and units in that Branch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In the exercise of that authority, the Governor may issue executive orders. The authority to issue those orders is found in both Maryland\u2019s Constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and statutory law. <em>Lomax v. Warden, </em>120 Md.App. 314, 331, 707 A.2d 395 (1998) (citing Article II, \u00a7 24 of the Maryland Constitution and SG \u00a7 3-401).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Constitutionally authorized executive orders have the force of law, but so may statutorily authorized executive orders, as we noted in <em>Lomax v. Warden, </em>120 Md.App. 314, 333 n. 8, 707 A.2d 395. (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>356 Md. 569, 741 A.2d 476 (1999). There, we observed that executive orders \u201cpromulgated pursuant to Article II, section 24 of the Maryland Constitution have the \u2018force of law\u2019 \u201d as well as statutorily authorized executive orders as long as \u201c[u]pon issuance ..., the Governor [] deliver[s] the original or a certified copy of it to the Secretary of State,\u201d SG \u00a7 3-404(a), and \u201c \u2018as long as they are not inconsistent with existing statutes and are within the scope contemplated by the specific enabling legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax, </em>120 Md.App. at 333 n. 8, 707 A.2d 395. (quoting 64 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 180 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Substance Abuse Policy is set forth in Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, which is printed in COMAR 01.01.1991.16.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Order\u2019s promulgation clause states that it is being issued \u201cby virtue of the authority\u201d vested in the Governor \u201cby the Constitution and laws of Maryland.\u201d The statutory authority for the Order lies within two provisions of the State Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ment Article of the Maryland Code Annotated: SG \u00a7\u00a7 3-302 and 3-401. SG \u00a7 3-302 states that \u201c[t]he Governor is the head of the Executive Branch of State government and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall supervise and direct the officers and units in that Branch.\u201d And SG \u00a7 3 \u2014 401(2) states that executive orders may \u201cadopt[] guidelines, rules of conduct, or rules of procedure for: (i) State employees; (ii) units of the State government; or (iii) persons who are under the jurisdiction of those employees or units or who deal with them.\u201d Because Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 is authorized by statute, specifically SG \u00a7 3-302 and SG \u00a7 3-401(2), and because the Governor delivered it to the Secretary of State as required by SG \u00a7 3-404(a), it has the \u201c \u2018force of law\u2019 \u201d to the extent that it is not \u201c \u2018inconsistent with existing statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax, </em>120.Md.App. at 333 n. 8, 707 A.2d 395 (quoting 64 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 180 (1979)). We therefore now turn to the question of whether the Executive Order is inconsistent with any existing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 became effective on April 1, 1991. After the issuance of that Order, the State Personnel Management System was revised by the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996 (\u201cAct\u201d). <em>See Western Correctional Inst. v. Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. 562, 747 A.2d 697 (2000) (chronicling the history of the Act). That Act, among other things, added several sections to Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. <em>Id. </em>Two of those sections, SPP \u00a7 11-104 and SPP \u00a7 11-105, specifically address employee termination. The former contains various disciplinary actions that may be taken with respect to a state employee. It provides that, \u201cwith prior approval of the head of the principal unit,\u201d an appointing authority may \u201c(i) terminate the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d SPP \u00a7 11-104(7). The latter covers automatic terminations of employment. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">The following actions are causes for automatic termination of employment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">(1) intentional conduct, without justification, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">(i) seriously injures another person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(ii) causes substantial damage to property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">(iii) seriously threatens the safety of the workplace;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">(2) theft of State property of a value greater than $300;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">(3) illegal sale, use, or possession of drugs on the job;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">(4) conviction of a controlled dangerous substance offense by an employee in a designated sensitive classification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">(5) conviction of a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">(6) accepting for personal use any fee, gift, or other valuable thing in connection with or during the course of State employment if given to the employee by any person with the hope or expectation of receiving a favor or better treatment than that accorded to other persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">(7) (i) violation of the Fair Election Practices Act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">(ii) using, threatening, or attempting to use political influence or the influence of any State employee or officer in securing promotion, transfer, leave of absence, or increased pay; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">(8) wantonly careless conduct or unwarrantable excessive force in the treatment or care of an individual who is a client, patient, prisoner, or any other individual who is in the care or custody of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">SPP\u00a7 11-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">While this list of acts warranting automatic termination is lengthy, it does not include a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. In 1997, however, the Secretary of Budget and Management adopted COMAR 17.04.05.04, entitled \u201cDisciplinary Actions Relating to Employee Misconduct.\u201d That Regulation expanded the list of \u201cactions [that] are causes for automatic termination of employment\u201d under SPP \u00a7 11-105.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It now includes, among other things, \u201cconduct that has brought or, if publicized, would bring the State into disrepute\u201d under COMAR 17.04.05.04(B)(3), \u201cconduct involving dishones<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or illegality\u201d under CO-MAR 17.04.05.04(B)(8), and conduct involving \u201canother act, not previously specified, when there is a connection between the employee\u2019s activities and an identifiable detriment to the State.\u201d COMAR 17.04.05.04(B)(15). Appellant charged Beard with all three categories of prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Unlike COMAR 17.04.05.04, which mandates \u201cautomatic termination\u201d for prohibited behavior, Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 prescribes a schedule of progressively severe disciplinary actions for sensitive employees based on the number of convictions they have for off-the-workplace alcohol driving offences. As we shall more fully discuss in part II of this opinion, under that schedule, termination of employment is not an available sanction for a first off-the-workplace alcohol driving offense. Consequently, we must examine the relationship between COMAR 17.04.05.04 and Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 to determine which applies to appellee\u2019s conduct. Our resolution of that question will determine whether the ALJ was correct in concluding that Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 \u201ccircumscribed\u201d the \u201cmeasure of ... discipline\u201d that could be imposed on Beard, by eliminating the option of firing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">As previously discussed, a statutorily authorized executive order, such as the one before us, has the force of law to the extent that it is not inconsistent with any existing statute and is within the scope contemplated by the enabling legislation. But so does an administrative regulation have the force of law, under certain circumstances. Administrative regulations that are \u201clegislative\u201d rather than merely \u201cinterpretive\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have \u201c \u2018statutory force upon going into effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waverly Press, Inc. v. State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>312 Md. 184, 191, 539 A.2d 223 (1988) (quoting <em>Comptroller v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 234, 107 A.2d 93 (1954)). In our view, COMAR 17.04.05.04. is such a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In determining whether an administrative regulation is \u201clegislative,\u201d we consider \u201cwhether it \u2018affects individual rights and obligations\u2019 and whether the agency intended the rule to be legislative as \u2018evidenced by such circumstantial evidence as the formality that attended the making of the law, including rule making procedure and publication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of School Comm\u2019rs. v. James, </em>96 Md.App. 401, 422, 625 A.2d 361 (1993)(quoting Peter Raven Hansen, <em>Regulatory Estoppel: When Agencies Break Their Own \u201cLaws,\u201d </em>64 Tex. Law Rev. 1, 16 (1985)). Because COMAR 17.04.05.04 specifies the conduct for which a state employee is subject to automatic termination, it does \u201caffect individual rights and obligations\u201d and thus meets the first requirement of a \u201clegislative\u201d regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">As to the second requirement \u2014 \u201cwhether the agency intended the rale to be legislative as \u2018evidenced by such circumstantial evidence as the formality that attended the making of the law, including rule making procedure and publication\u2019 \u201d \u2014we note that COMAR 17.04.05.04 was adopted as an emergency provision pursuant to SG \u00a7 10 \u2014 111(b), and was published in both its emergency and permanent forms in the Maryland Register.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, COMAR 17.04.05.04 was adopted pursuant to a specific legislative grant of authority to the Secretary of Budget and Management to \u201cadopt regulations, guidelines, or policies\u201d to \u201ccarry out those provisions of [ ] Division T that are subject to the authority of the Secretary.\u201d SPP \u00a7 4-106(a); <em>see also </em>Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>Ch. 7, \u00a7 7.8 at 36 (1979) (\u201cA legislative rule is the product of an exercise of delegated legislative power to make the law through rules. An interpretive rule is any rule an agency issues without exercising delegated legislative power to make law through rules.\u201d) Consequently, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>COMAR 17.04.05.04 is \u201clegislative\u201d and accordingly has the force of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">We are therefore faced with two competing, if not conflicting, forms of law \u2014 an executive order and a \u201clegislative\u201d administrative regulation \u2014 ostensibly addressing the same issue. To determine which one governs disciplinary actions that may be taken against an Executive Branch employee, covered under the State Personnel Management System, who is convicted of an alcohol driving offense, we turn to two guiding principles of statutory interpretation. The first is that when construing two statutes that involve the same subject matter, a harmonious interpretation of the statutes is \u201cstrongly favor[ed].\u201d <em>Maryland State Police v. Warwick Supply &amp; Equip. Co., </em>330 Md. 474, 483-84, 624 A.2d 1238 (1993); <em>see also Department of Natural Resources v. France, </em>277 Md. 432, 461, 357 A.2d 78 (1976)(stating that \u201c[w]here two statutory provisions are neither irreconcilable nor mutually repugnant, they should be construed in harmony with their respective objects and tenor\u201d) (citations omitted). The second is that where two enactments \u2014 one general, the other specific \u2014 appear to cover the same subject, the specific enactment applies. <em>France, </em>277 Md. at 461-62, 357 A.2d 78. (\u201c Where there is a specific enactment and a general enactment which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Board v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495, 331 A.2d 55 (1975)) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r., </em>302 Md. 248, 268, 487 A.2d 271 (1985)(\u201c[W]here one statutory provision specifically addresses a matter, and another more general statutory provision also may arguably cover the same matter, the specific statutory provision is held to be applicable and the general provision is deemed inapplicable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Applying the first principle that we should seek a harmonious interpretation of the two, we note that although COMAR 17.04.05.04, with its automatic termination provision, was promulgated after Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 and its progressive schedule of discipline, there is no indication in that regulation, or in the statute that authorized it, that it was intended to supersede the disciplinary provisions of Executive Order 01.01.1991.16. Indeed, although they appear, at first blush, to be in conflict they are not necessarily irreconcilable. Indeed, they can be harmonized by application of the second principle \u2014 where a specific enactment and a general enactment appear to cover the same subject, the specific enactment governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">COMAR 17.04.05.04, with its automatic termination provision, applies to all state employees covered by the State Personnel Management System, not just those in the Executive Branch. In fact, it does not specifically list an alcohol driving offense as a prohibited activity and a cause for automatic termination. In contrast, Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 promulgates a disciplinary policy that applies only to state employees of the Executive Branch, and that policy specifically addresses those Executive Branch employees who abuse alcohol and are convicted of off-the-workplace alcohol driving offenses. Therefore, we conclude that the Substance Abuse Policy in Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 governs the disciplining of state employees in the Executive Branch of State Government, who commit alcohol driving offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We now turn to the issue of whether, under the Substance Abuse Policy, Beard\u2019s conduct warranted termination of his employment as a Drinking Driver Monitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe ALJ erred by misinterpreting the provisions of [the Substance Abuse Policy] to prohibit Beard\u2019s termination.\u201d In support of that claim, appellant argues that the Substance Abuse Policy requires, for a first off-the-workplace conviction, a referral to an employee assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tance program and \u201c \u2018any other appropriate disciplinary actions.\u2019 \u201d According to appellant, the \u201cordinary and common meaning\u201d of the phrase \u201c \u2018any other appropriate disciplinary actions\u2019 ... is unquestionably broad enough to include termination.\u201d Appellant concludes that, instead of holding as a matter of law that termination was not an available sanction, the ALJ should have applied our analysis in <em>Curry v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Seros., </em>102 Md.App. 620, 651 A.2d 390 (1994), <em>cert. granted, </em>338 Md. 252, 657 A.2d 1182 (1995), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>340 Md. 175, 665 A.2d 1038 (1995), to determine \u201cwhether termination was appropriate based on the severity of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\u201d Had the ALJ applied the correct analysis, appellant asserts, he would have found that termination was \u201cappropriate\u201d because Beard\u2019s \u201cinability to comply with the state drinking and driving laws compromised his ability to enforce those laws,\u201d and rendered him unable \u201cto perform his job effectively.\u201d We hold, however, that the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the Substance Abuse Policy is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Paragraph C(4) of Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 prescribes disciplinary actions to be taken with respect to a \u201csensitive employee convicted of an off-the-workplace alcohol driving offense,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a non-sensitive employee convicted of any alcohol driving offense.\u201d It directs that such employees shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(a) On the first conviction be referred to an employee assistance program, and in addition, be subject to any other appropriate disciplinary actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(b) On the second conviction, at a minimum, be suspended for at least 5 days, be referred to an employee assistance program, be required to participate successfully in a treatment program, and in addition, be subject to any other appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(c) On the third conviction, be terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>In interpreting these provisions, the ALJ observed that while both first and second convictions render an employee \u201csubject to any other appropriate disciplinary actions,\u201d the words \u201cup to and including termination\u201d are present only for a second conviction. According to the ALJ, there is \u201conly one reasonable interpretation\u201d for this, namely, that \u201c[Germination of State service is not an authorized sanction for a \u2018sensitive employee\u2019 for a first conviction of an off-the-workplace \u2018alcohol driving offense\u2019 under the State of Maryland Substance Abuse Policy.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As noted earlier, Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 is statutorily authorized and \u201c \u2018the equivalent of [a] statute[ ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax, </em>120 Md.App. at 332 n. 8, 707 A.2d 395 (1998) (quoting 64 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 180 (1979)). It is therefore appropriate that, in interpreting that order to determine whether termination was warranted in the instant case, we employ rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">A \u201c\u2018cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren v. State, 352 </em>Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887 (1999)(quoting <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995)). The centrality of that rule is by no means diminished by the fact that here it is the Executive, not the Legislature, whose intention we seek to \u201cascertain and effectuate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u201c \u2018The primary source of legislative intent is ... the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995). \u201cWe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in a forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v.

Furthermore, a statutory provision should not be viewed in isolation. \u201cAll relevant parts ... should be read together and, to the extent possible, construed in harmony.\u201d <em>Curry, </em>102 Md.App. at 628, 651 A.2d 390. Finally, \u201cif the language is clear and unambiguous, there is usually no need to look further.\u201d <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 520, 671 A.2d 495 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The language of Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 is clear and unambiguous. Paragraph B(5) states that all \u201c[e]mployees are prohibited from,\u201d among other things, \u201c[c]ommitting an alcohol driving offense.\u201d \u00b6 B(5)(c). For a \u201csensitive\u201d employee convicted of an \u201coff-the-workplace alcohol driving offense,\u201d the Order sets forth a progressive schedule of disciplinary sanctions that increase in severity -with each new alcohol driving offense that an employee commits. Upon the first conviction for such an offense, the employee shall \u201cbe referred to an employee assistance program, and in addition, be subject to any other appropriate disciplinary actions.\u201d \u00b6 C(4)(a). Upon a second conviction, however, the employee will \u201cbe suspended for at least 5 days, be referred to an employee assistance program, [and] be required to participate successfully in a treatment program.\u201d \u00b6 C(4)(b). The employee will also \u201cbe subject to any other appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, upon a third conviction, the employee shall be terminated from his employment. \u00b6 C(4)(c). Lest any doubt remains of the Executive\u2019s intention to create a schedule of progressive disciplinary measures to correspond with each additional alcohol offense committed, paragraph E of the Executive Order states that \u201c[a]ny employee otherwise in violation of this Executive Order shall be subject to appropriate <em>progressive </em>disciplinary actions <em>up to and including </em>termination.\u201d (emphasis added) To hold that an employee may be terminated for a first off-the-workplace alcohol driving offense contravenes both the language and the purpose of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Moreover, a subsection of a statute should \u201cbe read in conjunction with other subsections ... so that we may give effect to the whole statute and harmonize all of its provisions.\u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675 (1994). For a first conviction, the Executive Order authorizes \u201cany other appropriate disciplinary actions.\u201d For a second conviction, it authorizes \u201cany other appropriate disciplinary actions,\u201d but adds \u201cup to and including termination.\u201d The language \u201cup to an including termination\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cany other appropriate disciplinary actions.\u201d Thus, \u201ctermination\u201d is an \u201cappropriate\u201d disciplinary action for a second conviction. The Order does not, however, list \u201ctermination\u201d as an \u201cappropriate\u201d disciplinary action for a first conviction, and we \u201cmay not insert ... words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. of Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In interpreting a law, we may also look beyond its language. <em>See Chesapeake Amusements, Inc. v. Riddle, </em>363 Md. 16, 29, 766 A.2d 1036 (2001). The Substance Abuse Policy was originally promulgated on April 7, 1989 by Executive Order 01.01.1989.05. <em>Dashiell v. State Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>327 Md. 130, 131, 607 A.2d 1249 (1992). It was promulgated in part to comply with the \u201cfederal Anti Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-707, which requires states that receive federal funds to establish a drug-free workplace, a policy on use of substances, a drug awareness program for employees, and a procedure for self-reporting convictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Paragraph B(7) of Executive Order 01.01.1989.05, which preceded the executive order in question, made it a violation of the Substance Abuse Policy for an employee to be convicted of an \u201coff-the-job drug or alcohol\u201d offense, and Paragraph (B)(ll) directed that a sensitive employee found to be in violation of that Policy \u201cwill be terminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Executive Order 01.01.1991.16, however, expressly rescinded Executive Order 01.01.1989.05. <em>Dashiell, </em>327 Md. at 132 n. 1, 607 A.2d 1249. \u201cThe new order changed the 1989 order by, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>things, removing the automatic termination provision for sensitive employees who are convicted of a first-time, off-duty, alcohol-driving offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In place of the \u201cautomatic termination provision,\u201d the new Order sets forth a progressive schedule of discipline for sensitive employees who have been convicted of off-the-workplace alcohol driving offenses. Thus, the history of the Substance Abuse Policy, as expressed through the successive Executive Orders promulgating it, confirms an Executive goal of progressive discipline rather than termination upon a first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Appellant also contends that the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the Executive Order conflicts with our decision in <em>Curry v. Department of Public Safety and Corr\u2019l Servs., </em>102 Md.App. 620, 628, 651 A.2d 390 (1994), <em>cert. granted, </em>338 Md. 252, 657 A.2d 1182 (1995), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>340 Md. 175, 665 A.2d 1038 (1995). In <em>Curry, </em>two correctional officers employed by the DPSCS were arrested away from the workplace for driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 623, 651 A.2d 390. After both officers were found guilty of that charge and granted probation before judgment, they were suspended for five days without pay. On appeal, the officers contended, among other things, \u201cthat their suspensions ... violate[d] the executive order by imposing the minimum penalties for a second offense [suspension for five days], even though each was a first-time offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 651 A.2d 390. In rejecting that argument, we stated that \u201c[t]here is no indication that the sanctions listed in \u00a7 (4)(a) [of the executive order] comprise an exclusive list of punishments that a state employer may impose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d we noted, \u201cthe last sentence of \u00a7 (4)(a) states that the employee shall be subject to \u2018any other appropriate disciplinary actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The officers also argued that the phrase \u201cany other appropriate disciplinary actions\u201d was so unconstitutionally vague as to violate due process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We found no merit to that argument, and explained that \u201c[t]he term \u2018appropriate\u2019 adequately modifies the types of actions which may be imposed, so as to ensure that an employee will not receive a disproportionate disciplinary sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634, 651 A.2d 390. \u201cA five-day suspension for a first offense,\u201d we concluded, \u201cis not an unduly harsh or disproportionate punishment to impose on an employee in a sensitive classification for an off-duty alcohol-related offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>Curry, </em>however, is factually distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Curry, </em>the penalty imposed was a five day suspension without pay, not termination. A suspension without pay for a first conviction does not contravene the Executive Order\u2019s policy of progressive discipline as termination does. Nor is it at odds with the plain language of the Order as termination is. The Executive Order, as noted earlier, specifically lists termination as a possible penalty for a second conviction, but not for a first. As the ALJ aptly pointed out, there is \u201conly one reasonable interpretation\u201d for this: termination is not an available sanction under the Executive Order for a sensitive employee\u2019s first off-the-workplace alcohol driving offense conviction. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s construction of the Executive Order is not, as appellant asserts, contrary to our interpretation of that Order in <em>Curry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Appellant also contends that because Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 requires that employees must be capable of performing their duties, \u201cBeard\u2019s inability to pei-form his job effectively may properly result in discipline up to an including termination.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Paragraph (B)(2) of the Executive Order states that \u201c[a]ll employees in the workplace must be capable of performing their duties.\u201d The Order, however, does not contain any language that authorizes the termination of an employee for a first offense because that employee could not perform his or her duties. That Beard was a Drinking Driver Monitor who himself was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol does not change this. To affirm Beard\u2019s termination would require that we disregard the plain language of the Order, and that we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Finally, appellant claims that the ALJ \u201cexceeded his authority\u201d by fashioning disciplinary sanctions rather than \u201cremanding the matter to the appointing authority for an assessment of appropriate discipline.\u201d That claim is -without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">SPP \u00a7 11-110 applies to employees in the skilled and professional services who appeal, as appellee did, disciplinary actions to the Secretary of Budget and Management. If the Secretary of Budget and Management refers the appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings, \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d) authorizes an ALJ in that office to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">(i) uphold the disciplinary action; (ii) rescind or modify the disciplinary action taken and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, or benefits; or (iii) order: 1. reinstatement to the position that the employee held at dismissal; 2. full back pay; or 3. both 1 and 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">To carry out the provisions of \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d), the Secretary of Budget and Management adopted COMAR 17.04.05.02(C), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">The Office of Administrative Hearings may not change the discipline imposed by the appointing authority, as modified by the head of the principal unit or Secretary, unless the discipline imposed was clearly an abuse of discretion and clearly unreasonable under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Upon holding that \u201cthe discipline proposed by the DPP\u201d was \u201ccontrary to applicable State regulations and established agency policy\u201d and therefore \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d under COMAR 17.04.05.02(C), the ALJ fashioned sanctions that, in his view, comported with the provisions of the Substance Abuse Policy. Specifically, the ALJ reprimanded Beard and ordered that he be referred to the Employee Assistance Program. The ALJ also ordered that Beard be reinstated as a Monitor II in the Drinking Driver Monitor Program, and that he receive back pay \u201cfrom April 1, 1999 up to and including the date of [the] decision.\u201d The ALJ conditioned Beard\u2019s reinstatement upon his compliance with any recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>mendations made by the Employee Assistance Program and upon his demonstration, \u201cto the satisfaction of the DPP, that he is abstaining from the use of any alcoholic beverages, his current participation in, or recent completion of, a certified alcoholic treatment program\u201d and \u201chis ongoing participation in Alcoholics Anonymous or another acceptable self-help group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the ALJ did not exceed his authority by fashioning sanctions rather than remanding this matter to the DPP. Indeed, the actions of the ALJ were authorized by COMAR 17.04.05.02(C) and \u00a7 ll-110(d). In accordance with COMAR 17.04.05.02(C) the ALJ stated that he was modifying the DPP\u2019s disciplinary action because that action was \u201ccontrary to applicable State regulations and established agency policy\u201d and was therefore \u201can abuse of discretion.\u201d In compliance with \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d)(ii), the ALJ \u201cmodify[ed] the disciplinary action taken,\u201d by ordering that Beard be referred to the Employee Assistance Program and imposing various conditions upon his reinstatement. Finally, in accordance with \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d) (iii) (3), the ALJ ordered that Beard be reinstated with back pay. We conclude therefore that the ALJ acted well within his statutory authority in ordering Beard\u2019s reinstatement with back pay and imposing the sanctions that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">.
