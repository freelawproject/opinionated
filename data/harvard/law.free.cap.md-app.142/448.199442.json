Potts (\u201cHusband\u201d). Wife raises two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">I. Did the lower court err in denying the appellant survivor benefits under the applicable qualified domestic relations order notwithstanding the award to appellant of one-half of the marital portion of appellee\u2019s pension?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">II. Did the lower court err in determining that if the appellee remarries, he may give survivor benefits to his new spouse, even if that action reduces appellant\u2019s share of appellee\u2019s pension?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">We find no error in the court\u2019s decision to deny Wife survivor benefits. To the extent that the trial court held that Husband could reduce Wife\u2019s share of the pension by giving survivor benefits to someone other than Wife, the trial court erred. The value of the pension in this case is to be determined prior to any election of survivor benefits for the benefit of a third party. The cost of such election shall not reduce Wife\u2019s share of the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Husband and Wife were married on May 5,1973. Their two children were emancipated by age when Wife filed for divorce on July 14, 1999. Husband filed a counter-complaint for divorce on August 11, 1999. A hearing was held on June 12-14, 1999, and, on June 28, 2000, the court granted a judgment of absolute divorce. The judgment of absolute divorce contained, among other provisions, an order \u201cthat the husband\u2019s pension is divided on an if, as and when basis, and the 401K is to be divided equally, counsel to ascertain the proper amount.\u201d No mention was made by the court in either the judgment of absolute divorce or by the parties in the transcript of the divorce proceedings provided to us of the need to prepare a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>QDRO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this point, the docket entries reflected that the case was \u201cclosed,\u201d although it was reopened when Husband filed a motion to alter and amend with respect to the court\u2019s ruling on the division of the parties\u2019 personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In addition to the issue raised by Husband\u2019s motion to alter and amend, a problem was developing with respect to a QDRO. Wife\u2019s attorney prepared a proposed QDRO, but Husband balked over language that would require him to elect survivor benefits when he drew his pension and to name Wife as \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d The parties returned to court for a hearing on January 26, 2001. The court issued its opinion on the QDRO on February 5, 2001, amending that opinion on February 12, 2001, to correct the dates of the hearing and the judgment of divorce. The amended opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">This case raises important questions concerning QDROs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">We heard the matter on June 12, 2000 and granted the divorce on June 27, 2000. We awarded one-half of the marital portion of the QDRO to Ms. Potts, which was what she asked for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">There have been many disputes over the QDROs, which now come down to two points. The first one is whether we can award survivor benefits under the regular \u201cQDRO\u201d to Ms. Potts. She never asked for the benefit by name when the divorce was pending, nor was any motion to that effect filed while the divorce was not final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">Her present counsel argues that an award of one-half of the marital portion of the pension is broad enough to cover survivor benefits. In other words, Mr. Potts wants it excluded because she didn\u2019t ask for it, and she wants it included because we didn\u2019t deny it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">At first blush the answer seems easy; if you didn\u2019t ask for it, you don\u2019t get it. However, our research has turned up only one state that has ruled on the matter, namely Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>In <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>905 S.W.2d 760, the Court of Appeals indicated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">We construe Gary\u2019s first point of error to assert that as a matter of law the parties\u2019 intent reflected in the original decree was <em>not </em>to grant Patricia survivor benefits. We disagree with this assertion. Although the original decree did not specifically mention \u201csurvivor benefits\u201d, it did expressly recognize Patricia\u2019s marital rights in the 3-M pension plan, awarded Patricia \u201c45 per cent of the present value of [Gary\u2019s] accrued benefits\u201d, and state that Patricia \u201cmay elect any form of payment of her portion of the available benefits.\u201d n4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of evidence that the 3-M plan treated survivor benefits as being separate and distinct from \u201cretirement benefits\u201d, and in the absence of any evidence of the parties[\u2019] intentions in that regard, we conclude that Gary has not demonstrated as a matter of law that the parties intended for the decree granting Patricia forty-five per cent of Gary\u2019s \u201cretirement benefits\u201d to exclude survivor benefits from that grant. Point of error is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">In Maryland, survivor benefits are not a matter of right but of the discretion of the Court, <em>Matthews v. Matthews, </em>331[336] Md. 241[, 647 A.2d 812]. The Court has discretion in determining the formula to be used, <em>Caldwell v. Caldwell, </em>103 Md.[App.] 452[, 653 A.2d 994], and can determine who pays for the benefit. All of this indicates that survivor benefits are not an automatic tag-along to the division of the pension, but must be the subject of a request. We disagree with the Texas Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">It is little secret that the developing field of QDROs, and like orders is causing much difficulty. A QDRO is asked for, or agreed upon, and the details are not ironed out until the order for divorce is final, and any change is difficult, but not impossible. For this reason we are seriously considering raising the question of survivor benefits sua sponte in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The second issue is whether Mr. Potts can, if he remarries, give survivor benefits to his new wife which will have the effect of reducing his first wife\u2019s share somewhat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">This is an \u201cif, as and when\u201d pension. We do not believe Ms. Potts has any right to a specific number, only a share of the amount of the pensions actually received. Again, the parties are free to contract for this result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Counsel shall submit an appropriate QDRO in line with this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Wife appealed this order on February 28, 2001. On March 12, 2001, the trial court signed and filed the QDRO. Along with the QDRO, it sent a note commenting that \u201cMrs. Potts filed an appeal. This may very well have been premature.\u201d Mrs. Potts then timely appealed the QDRO on April 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Wife\u2019s first argues that the issue of survivor benefits is part of the overall inquiry into pensions. Consequently, she argues, the court erred by stating that survivor benefits \u201care not an automatic tag-along to the division of the pension, but must be the subject of a request.\u201d Husband argues that Wife should have raised this issue in an appeal from the judgment of absolute divorce, which he argues was a final judgment. At oral argument, Wife responded to this argument by encouraging us to hold that a judgment of absolute divorce is not final until the QDRO is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">A. ERISA and QDROs</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">To frame our discussion, we begin by reviewing the applicability of Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1999)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cERISA\u201d), to pensions plans and the importance of QDROs in divorce proceedings in which a pension plan subject to ERISA is an article of marital property. ERISA was first enacted in 1974, and the employee benefit plans covered by ERISA are set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003, which reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in sections 201, 301, and 401 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051, 1081, and 1101],<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this title shall apply to any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">(1) by any employer engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">(2) by any employee organization or organizations representing employees engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">(3) by both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">As previously explained in <em>Jenkins v. Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. 390, 397 n. 3, 685 A.2d 817 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 718, 690 A.2d 524 (1997), \u201cERISA provisions generally prevent the assignment or distribution of the proceeds of an ERISA qualified plan to third parties.\u201d <em>See also Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 30-36, 566 A.2d 767 (1989). With its enactment, Congress stated that ERISA was to \u201csupersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(a). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">The combination of the anti-alienation provision in [the U.S. Labor and Tax Codes] and the preemption provision of ERISA \u00a7 514 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144] eventually raised a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tion, apparently not anticipated by Congress, as to the validity of orders entered in State domestic relations proceedings requiting that pension benefits be paid to a person other than the plan beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 32, 566 A.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In light of these concerns, Congress, in 1984, amended ERISA to relax the anti-alienation provisions so that state courts could enter orders allowing benefits to be paid to someone other than the plan beneficiary. <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 32-34, 566 A.2d 767. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 401, 414.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">A domestic relations order meeting certain qualifications (hence the QDRO moniker) for support or distribution of property may, however, require the allocation of all or part of a plan participant\u2019s benefits to an alternate payee. Use of this ERISA exception allows state trial courts effectively to alter title to otherwise untouchable pension plans without violating federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. at 397 n. 3, 685 A.2d 817. From a practical point of view, a QDRO allows divorcing parties to avoid a lump sum payment and the tax consequences that accompany such a payment. <em>See Freedenburg v. Freedenburg, </em>123 Md.App. 729, 751, 720 A.2d 948 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The QDRO is the required medium to ensure that the alternate payee receives payment under the employee spouse\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>pension plan. The fact that the employee may predecease the non-employee spouse makes the issue of survivorship rights in the pension very important. Pursuant to a divorce, a non-employee spouse may, with a valid QDRO, be named the survivor under a pension plan. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(p)(5) (2000); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(i) (2000). If the court does not order the employee spouse to elect survivor benefits, however, the non-employee spouse will lose rights to them by virtue of the divorce. <em>See </em>Joan M. Krauskopf and Sharon Burgees Seiling, <em>A Pilot Study on Marital Power as an Influence in Division of Pension Benefits at Divorce of Long Term Marriages, </em>1996 J. Disp. Resol. 169, 173 (1996). Resolving the issue of survivorship rights in a pension and incorporating that resolution into the QDRO is especially important when one considers- that, often, the party\u2019s pension is the most valuable item of marital property. <em>See Long v. Long, </em>129 Md.App. 554, 574, 743 A.2d 281 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Notwithstanding their importance, issues and practice surrounding QDROs can give rise to contentious proceedings after a judgment of absolute divorce has been granted, because \u201cERISA does not necessarily require that a QDRO be part of the actual judgment in a case.\u201d <em>Hogle v. Hogle, </em>732 N.E.2d 1278, 1281 (Ind.Ct.App.2000), <em>transfer denied, </em>753 N.E.2d 9 (Ind.2001) (citing <em>In re Marriage of Bruns, </em>535 N.W.2d 157, 162 (Iowa Ct.App.1995)). <em>See also Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 42-43, 566 A.2d 767, and Elizabeth M. Wells, <em>Step One: Draft the QDRO, </em>24 Fam. Adv. 20 (Fall, 2001). Sometimes the delay in drafting the QDRO is simply the desire to postpone dealing with additional issues that may jeopardize an already fragile resolution of issues arising from the dissolution of the marriage. On the other hand, the QDRO is often drafted separately from and/or after a judgment of absolute divorce, because first, \u201cit makes it easier for the Plan Administrator to review an order that does not contain a lot .of provisions relating to other assets. Secondly, many employees do not want to disclose information about a divorce settlement to their employers.\u201d Marcia C. Fidis, <em>Tax Quali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>fied Private Employer Retirement Plans, in </em>Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs) C-01, C-10 (MICPEL, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Whatever the reason, this delay unfortunately creates a false sense of finality and generates questions regarding the appealability of divorce judgments involving pension issues. In the opinion of one commentator, \u201c[djrafting a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) concurrently with the divorce is essential.\u201d Gary Shulman, <em>QDROs </em>\u2014 The <em>Ticking Time Bomb, </em>23 Fam. Adv. 26, 26 (Spring, 2001). We agree that this would appear to be the better practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">B. Final Judgments and QDROs</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In this case, during closing arguments, neither the parties nor the trial court discussed the need for a QDRO, and it is not mentioned in the judgment of absolute divorce. It is obvious, however, that a QDRO is essential to effect the intent of the judgment of absolute divorce, but Husband argues that the judgment of absolute divorce was a final judgment as to survivor benefits and that Wife cannot now reopen the proceedings or appeal with respect to such benefits. Wife urges us to hold that a judgment of absolute divorce is not a final judgment if a necessary QDRO has not been entered. This position might have merit, but we are not writing on a clean slate and the realities of current QDRO practices must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\n<em>1. Was the QDRO Collateral or Integral to the Judgment of Absolute Divorce ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The Court of Appeals has stated that a QDRO can be either collateral to a judgment as an avenue for enforcement or it can be an integral part of the judgment itself. <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 42-43, 566 A.2d 767; <em>Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. at 400 n. 6, 685 A.2d 817.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">The <em>[Rohrbeck </em>] Court recognized that QDRO\u2019s may be collateral to, or an integral part of, a judgment depending on the circumstances. When a judge specifically contemplates the issuance of a QDRO, before allowing a judgment to be finalized, the QDRO is an integral part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>judgment without which there can be no final judgment. Under the rule set forth in <em>Rohrbeck, </em>when the trial judge contemplates any additional non-collateral action before entry of final judgment, there can be no final judgment absent the anticipated action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. at 402, 685 A.2d 817 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">As to a collateral QDRO, we stated in <em>Jenkins </em>that, \u201c[i]n many instances, a QDRO is issued after judgment as an enforcement tool to effectuate the disposition of property under Md. Fam. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-205.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are other circumstances when the need for a QDRO may not be apparent at the time of final judgment.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. at 400, 685 A.2d 817. Despite the foregoing assertions, we have not been directed to any cases in Maryland where the QDRO was held to be collateral to a judgment of absolute divorce as a means for enforcement of an order contained in a judgment of absolute divorce. In cases in which the QDRO has been held to be \u201cintegral\u201d to the judgment of divorce, the court has indicated that the QDRO was required and would be presented to the court. <em>See, e.g., Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 37, 566 A.2d 767 (the court expressly foresaw entry of a QDRO and held the case open until the QDRO was received); <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>135 Md.App. 29, 54, 761 A.2d 949 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>363 Md. 207, 768 A.2d 55 (2001) (the court expressly recognized the need for a QDRO); <em>Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. at 400, 685 A.2d 817 (the court expressly recognized that the judgment was final except for QDRO issues); <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 283, 681 A.2d 568 (1996) (the parties agreed to continuing jurisdiction by the court over QDRO matters); and <em>Heyda v. Heyda, </em>94 Md.App. 91, 94, 96, 615 A.2d 1218 (1992) (the court specifically anticipated that the QDRO would follow the stipulation of division of the pension and the light to survivor benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Notwithstanding that pensions subject to ERISA will require entry of a QDRO<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for the non-employee spouse to receive payments under the pension, even if a QDRO is not specifically ordered by the circuit court, post-judgment QDROs in other cases in which the QDRO is not expressly raised by the trial judge appear to have been treated generally as collateral to the judgment. In this way it is an avenue for enforcement, because without a QDRO, the non-employee spouse would not receive payments under the pension plan. <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 32-34, 566 A.2d 767. Accordingly, we hold that the QDRO in this case was collateral to the judgment of absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\n<em>2. Finality of the Judgment of Absolute Divorce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We foresee problems with holding that the judgment of absolute divorce is not a final judgment in light of the current practice of often presenting QDROs months, sometimes even years, after a marriage has ended. We have found no case, statute, or rule in Maryland or elsewhere that requires a QDRO to be filed within a specific time frame after a judgment of absolute divorce has been entered. Therefore, the timing of the presentation of the QDRO is dependent on the diligence of the parties and their counsel or the assertiveness of the trial court. Delaying the finality of the judgment of absolute divorce creates a potential problem that, if one party drags his or her feet, the other party will be unable to appeal other issues contained in the judgment for absolute divorce, such as alimony and other divisions of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We recognize that potentially two appeals might be filed for every divorce case involving a QDRO, which is not conducive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>to judicial economy, but current QDRO practice leads us to conclude that issues encompassed by the QDRO that have not been decided previously, either expressly or by necessary implication in the judgment of absolute divorce, may be appealed independently of the judgment of absolute divorce.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this case, however, this would not include the \u201cif, as and when\u201d distribution of the pension, which was resolved in the judgment of absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Although Wife timely appealed the QDRO, she did not timely appeal the judgment for absolute divorce. As we shall explain below, the survivor benefits are a form of marital property and, as such, must be brought to the attention of the court for appropriate division. Because the parties\u2019 marital property was divided at the time the judgment of absolute divorce was entered, that judgment was final with respect to the division of the marital property and cannot now be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">C. Survivor Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The decision to award survivor benefits is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Matthews v. Matthews, </em>336 Md. 241, 248, 647 A.2d 812 (1994) (quoting <em>Haydu v. Haydu, </em>591 So.2d 655 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991)); <em>Caldwell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. 452, 459, 653 A.2d 994, <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 166, 661 A.2d 700 (1995) (quoting <em>Pleasant v. Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. 711, 725, 632 A.2d 202 (1993)). It is undisputed that, although Wife could have been named as the surviving spouse under the PEPCO plan, she never specifically asked for those benefits prior to the proposed QDRO. She argues, however, that her request that the court \u201ctransfer at least one-half of the marital portion of [Husband\u2019s] interest in [his] pension\u201d was sufficient to raise the issue of survivor benefits, because survivor benefits are inextricably linked to pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\n<em>1. Are Survivor Benefits Separate Marital Property?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">The Court of Appeals has previously said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">[In Md.Code Ann. (1974, 1980 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-6A-01(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,] \u201cmarital property\u201d is defined as <em>\u201call property, </em>however titled, acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage.\u201d (emphasis supplied). The term property, \u201cwhen considered in a broad sense, is a term of wide and rather comprehensive signification .... It has been stated that the term embraces everything which has exchangeable value or goes to make up a man\u2019s wealth \u2014 every interest or estate which the law regards of sufficient value for judicial recognition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\"><em>Deering v. Deering, </em>292 Md. 115, 125, 437 A.2d 883 (1981) (quoting <em>Diffendall v. Diffendall, </em>239 Md. 32, 36, 209 A.2d 914, 915 (1965)) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">This Court has previously held that \u201cthe right to a survivor annuity is incident to the marital relationship, and that such a right, analogous to the right to the pension benefits themselves, falls within the definition of marital property contained in <em>Deering v. Deering, supra, </em>292 Md. at 125, 437 A.2d 883.\u201d <em>Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. at 725, 632 A.2d 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Although the <em>Matthews </em>Court recognized the holding in <em>Pleasant, </em>336 Md. at 253, 647 A.2d 812, its resolution of that case did not require it to reach that issue. The question in <em>Matthews </em>was whether the circuit court had the power to require that Admiral Matthews maintain his former wife as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>beneficiary under his military Survivor Benefit Plan (\u201cSBP\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The circuit court believed that it could not enter such an order, but the Court of Appeals held that it could pursuant to the federal statute. In its discussion, the <em>Matthews </em>Court touched on the issue of survivor benefits as marital property. <em>Matthews, </em>336 Md. at 253-54, 647 A.2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Court found that \u201ca court order requiring a party to designate a former spouse as a plan beneficiary does not constitute a transfer of property.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>336 Md. at 253, 647 A.2d 812. The Court went on to recognize that \u201cother courts have characterized the SBP as a separate and distinct property interest,\u201d including <em>Pleasant. </em>The Court of Appeals decided, notwithstanding Admiral Matthews\u2019 protestations that \u201cthe SBP is neither property, nor is it an interest in a pension of retirement plan[,]\u201d it was not required to characterize the nature of the SBP. The Court of Appeals did appear to hold, however, that the SBP was either property or a property right, stating that \u201c[i]f it is property, it gets its form of property from the federal statute. If it is a property right, it is one subject to all the conditions of the statute that created it \u2014 one of which is that the state court may order the member to designate a beneficiary.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>336 Md. at 253, 647 A.2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">No matter how the survivor benefit is characterized, either as a property right or as property, all types of property are considered \u201cmarital property\u201d under <em>Deering </em>and FL \u00a7 8-201(e),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which defines marital property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(1) \u201cMarital property\u201d means the property, however titled,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> acquired by 1 or both parties during the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">(2) \u201cMarital property\u201d includes any interest in real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety unless the real property is excluded by valid agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(3) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, \u201cmarital property\u201d does not include property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(i) acquired before the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">(ii) acquired by inheritance or gift from a third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">(iii) excluded by valid agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">(iv) directly traceable to any of these sources. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We revisited the issue of survivor benefits as marital property in <em>Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. at 458-59, 653 A.2d 994, a year after <em>Matthews </em>was decided. Explaining language in <em>Pleasant </em>stating that survivor benefits are \u201canalogous to the right to the pension benefits themselvesf,]\u201d we said, in <em>Caldwell, </em>\u201cthat the \u2018right to a survivor annuity is incident to the marital relationship,\u2019 and thus marital property over which a court has authority.\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. at 458, 653 A.2d 994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>(quoting <em>Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. at 725, 632 A.2d 202). \u201cAnalogous\u201d means \u201csimilar\u201d or a \u201clikeness.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 41 (10th ed.2000). \u201cSimilar, analogous ... means closely resembling each other, similar implies the possibility of being mistaken for each other &lt;all the houses in the development are <em>similar </em>&gt;. Analogous applies to things belonging in essentially different categories but nevertheless having many similarities <em>&lt;analogous </em>political systems&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1090, 632 A.2d 202. Therefore, although survivor benefits are like a pension, they have been treated as marital property in their own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">A number of courts in other states have also found that survivor benefits are marital property separate and apart from the pension plans to which they are attached. <em>Fielitz v. Fielitz, </em>1998 WL 918815 at *2, 1998 Del.Fam. Ct. LEXIS 182 at *4 (Del.Fam.Ct.1998) (\u201cThe Court, however, views survivor annuities as a unique form of marital asset.\u201d) (citing <em>Caldwell, supra); Smithberg v. Illinois Mun. Retirement Fund, </em>192 Ill.2d 291, 302, 248 Ill.Dec. 909, 735 N.E.2d 560, 567 (2000) (the \u201csurvivor benefit ... has been held to be a \u2018distinct property interest\u2019 \u201d); <em>Workman v.

Civ.App. 88, 817 P.2d 1285, 1286 (Okla.Ct.App.1991) (referring to a disability pension and survivor benefits as distinct pieces of marital property); <em>Nemeth v. Nemeth, </em>325 S.C. 480, 488-89, 481 S.E.2d 181, 186 (S.C.Ct.App.1997); <em>Dugan v. Childers, </em>261 Va. 3, 8, 539 S.E.2d 723, 725 (2001) (citing <em>King v.

Smith, </em>190 W.Va. 402, 404, 438 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Wife urges us, as she did the trial court, to follow the Texas court\u2019s decision in <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>905 S.W.2d 760 (Tex.Ct.App.1995). That court specifically required a showing that the survivor benefits were \u201cseparate and distinct from \u2018retirement benef\u00edts[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Harvey, </em>905 S.W.2d at 764. Although this language may imply a presumption that survivor benefits are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>be treated as part of a pension rather than as separate marital property, it is also consistent with the court\u2019s award of \u201c45 per cent of the present value of [Gary\u2019s] accrued benefits\u201d in the 3 M pension plan and the wife\u2019s right to \u201celect any form of payment of her portion of the available benefit.\u201d <em>Harvey, </em>905 S.W.2d at 764. In other words, the trial court\u2019s award expressly included \u201caccrued benefits\u201d in the pension plan and provided for the Wife\u2019s election of payment for such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Other states either expressly treat or otherwise appear to treat survivor benefits as an indivisible part of a spouse\u2019s pension benefits. <em>Landers v. Landers, </em>631 So.2d 1043, 1045 (Ala.Civ.App.1993) (appear to treat them as indivisible, although the court does not explicitly say so); <em>Zito v. Zito, </em>969 P.2d 1144, 1145 (Alaska 1998) (finding that, once the parties agreed to divide the pension, the survivor benefits must also be divided because they are an \u201cintegral part\u201d of the pension); <em>In re Marriage of Payne, </em>897 P.2d 888, 889 (Colo.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cwe also do not view the Survivor Benefit Plan as a separate asset\u201d); and <em>Conaway v. Conaway, </em>899 S.W.2d 574, 576 (Mo.Ct.App.1995) (suggesting, although not explicitly stating, that survivor benefits are merely one part of pensions).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Wife attempts to circumvent <em>Pleasant </em>by arguing that there is no reference to \u201csurvivor benefits\u201d in Md.Code Ann. (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-205(a) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). This provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, after the court determines which property is marital property, and the value of the marital property, the court may transfer ownership of an interest in a pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan from 1 party to either or both parties, grant a monetary award, or both, as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property, whether or not alimony is awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">FL \u00a7 8-205(a). The implication is that the failure to identify survivor benefits as a separate item represents the legislature\u2019s determination that a survivor benefit is part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>enumerated plan or plans involved in the case. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>2. Effect of Survivor Benefits Designation as Separate Marital Assets</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">As separate items of marital property, the party seeking the divorce has the burden to prove their existence and value. <em>Blake v. Blake, </em>341 Md. 326, 345, 670 A.2d 472 (1996) (citing <em>Odunukwe v. Odunukwe, </em>98 Md.App. 273, 282, 633 A.2d 418, 422 (1993) (party claiming a marital interest in specific property bears the burden of proving that the property is \u201cmarital\u201d); <em>Noffsinger v. Noffsinger, </em>95 Md.App. 265, 281, 620 A.2d 415, 422, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 197, 627 A.2d 539 (1993) (party claiming marital property interest must produce evidence as to its identity and value)). The burden was, therefore, on Wife to expressly identify and value the survivor benefits separately from the pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Wife argued in both her brief and at oral argument that the court\u2019s statement that it could not consider survivor benefits if they were not specifically requested somehow translates into an affirmative requirement to list survivor benefits in the divorce complaint. We disagree. The Maryland Rules do not require listing specific marital property in the divorce complaint. Rule 9-203.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The listing of marital property need not be filed until ten days before the scheduled trial date or at a time specified by the court. Rule 9-206(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The parties thus have ample time under the Rules to uncover and list each item of property at issue that needs to be considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Family Court of Delaware has specifically addressed the failure of a party in divorce proceedings to raise the issue of survivor benefits before the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>While Wife requested the entry of a QDRO there was at trial no evidence presented whatsoever with respect to what type of order would be \u201cqualified\u201d under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, what the tax consequences of such an order would be, what, if any, \u201csurvivorship\u201d benefits would inure to Wife, and the consequences to Husband if such benefits were provided to Wife, or any other relevant features of the type of order Wife is seeking. Moreover, Wife did not offer into evidence the actual plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Upon questioning by the Court, counsel was vague in providing the necessary information. It would thus be virtually impossible for this Court to fashion a QDRO on the basis of the clearly inadequate factual and legal record in this case. It is the responsibility of the party seeking a QDRO to furnish a basis for the entry of such an order. <em>Inglis v. Inglis, </em>Del.Supr., No. 177, 1985, 1986 WL 16299, Moore, J. (January 28, 1986). Here, Wife failed to furnish any information along these lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Hay v. Hay, </em>1986 Del.Fam. Ct. LEXIS 205, at *14-15 (Del.Fam.Ct.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In a more recent case, the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that \u201cWife never specifically informed the court that she was seeking survivorship benefits, and that none of the documents filed prior to the decision sought such relief!,]\u201d indicating that the parties need to bring the issue of survivor benefits to the court\u2019s attention. <em>Glenn v. Schlerf, </em>633 A.2d 369, 1993 WL 385030 at *2, 1993 Del. LEXIS 369 at *4 (Del.1993). The court also mentioned that \u201cit is Family Court Judges\u2019 practice to explicitly mention survivorship when it is to be included in a pension partition. Thus, it is reasonable to presume that if a property division order or QDRO does not mention survivorship, it does not cover survivorship.\u201d <em>Id., </em>1993 WL 385030 at *2, 1993 Del. LEXIS 369 at *5-6 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The trial court in this case indicated that it would likely be raising the issue of survivor benefits <em>sua sponte </em>in the future. We commend this practice, but the burden rests on the parties to alert the court to the various articles of marital property at issue in the case and to provide the information necessary to resolve the issues related to such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Because Wife did not bring the survivor benefits to the attention of the court, it could not weigh the various factors that would be required to determine whether to assign her survival benefits and, if it did, how that might affect the marital property award. We have suggested that a survivor annuity may be awarded \u201cin conjunction with an \u2018if, as and when\u2019 payment,\u201d although the court must determine how the \u201cif, as and when\u201d award should be altered, if at all, to account for the costs of the survivor benefit. <em>Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. at 729, 632 A.2d 202. In a subsequent case, we stated that, \u201c[i]n our view, the \u2018if, as and when\u2019 method ... is not appropriate for the payment of a survivor annuity benefit[,]\u201d limiting the \u201cif, as and when\u201d method to the former spouse\u2019s total pension annuity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. at 461, 653 A.2d 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In <em>Caldwell, </em>we put forth two possible methods for determining how the survivor annuity benefit is to be awarded. The first is based on <em>In re Marriage of Blackston, </em>258 Ill.App.3d 401, 196 Ill. Dec. 606, 630 N.E.2d 541 (1994). The Illinois Court of Appeals \u201cdetermined the former spouse\u2019s share of the survivor annuity benefit by multiplying the marital portion of the total pension annuity by 55%, the maximum attributable to the survivor annuity benefit. This, however, limits the former spouse to no more than the marital portion of the survivor annuity benefit.\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. at 461, 653 A.2d 994. The second was to treat the survivor benefit as part of the spousal support obligation and to require it to be maintained as part of that award, as opposed to a separate pension award. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 653 A.2d 994 (citing <em>Matthews, </em>336 Md. at 253-54, 647 A.2d 812).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>We need not decide if there is, much less resolve, any inherent conflict between <em>Caldwell </em>and <em>Pleasant </em>because here Wife did not request and, therefore, was not awarded survivor benefits. We only comment that the varying manner in which a trial court may award survivor benefits requires a degree of inquiry that is better accomplished at the trial level, along with the other marital property considerations, rather than after the fact when the QDRO is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In addition to the forgoing inquiries to be undertaken by a trial court, Husband suggested that his children might be named as survivor beneficiaries on the pension plan. It is unclear from the record whether this is possible, but it is an option Husband might have wished to pursue in light of their daughter Jennifer Potts\u2019 apparent problems.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Assuming Wife was named as the survivor, the trial court would have had to determine which spouse was to bear the financial burden of the election. The survivor benefit must be \u201cpurchased,\u201d so when an employee makes that election, the monthly payments are generally lower than they would be if the employee elected to take payment over the course of his or her own life. This lowered monthly payment reflects the cost of the survivor benefit, and we have recognized that, in divorce cases, one of the parties must pay for this benefit. <em>See Pleasant, 97 </em>Md.App. at 725, 729, 632 A.2d 202; Wells, 24 Fam. Adv. at 25. Thus, when the court orders the non-employee spouse to be named as \u201csurviving spouse,\u201d it must decide which party will pay for the benefit if the parties cannot otherwise agree. Just as Wife argues here that she should not be made to carry the financial burden of Husband\u2019s choices with respect to his pension plan, Husband should be allowed to argue that he not have to carry the burden of Wife\u2019s decisions with respect to that same plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Here, the court was unable to exercise its discretion as to survivor benefits, because it was presented with no information or alternatives when it decided the marital property issues. Because the existence of survivor benefits was not raised and the benefits were not divided prior to entry of the judgment for absolute divorce, that judgment is final as to the division of marital property and the survivor\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Wife\u2019s second argument is that the court erred in allowing Husband to retain the right to elect survivor benefits at the time of his retirement. Wife contends that, if Husband exercises this right, he will unilaterally reduce the value of his pension, thus reducing the amount to which she is entitled pursuant to the judgment of absolute divorce. The court made the following ruling on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">The second issue is whether Mr. Potts can, if he remarries, give survivor benefits to his new wife which will have the effect of reducing his first wife\u2019s share somewhat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">This is an \u201cif, as and when\u201d pension. We do not believe Ms. Potts has any right to a specific number, only a share of the amount of the pensions actually received. Again, the parties are free to contract for this result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In determining the value of pension benefits, the court may proceed in one of three ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201cFirst, the trial court could consider the amount of [the husband\u2019s] contributions to the fund, plus interest, and award [the wife] an appropriate share.... Second, the trial court could attempt to calculate the present value of [the husband\u2019s] retirement benefits when they vest under the plan. Under this approach, the benefits payable in the future would have to be discounted for interest in the future, for mortality ... and for vesting.... The benefits would then have to be calculated with respect to [the husband\u2019s] life expectancy as a retiree. This calculation involves considerable uncertainty, and the amount yielded changes as different assumptions are used with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>mortality, job turn-over, etc.... It has been recognized that this kind of calculation can be very difficult and that, where it becomes too speculative, the trial court should use a different method of valuation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201cUnder either of the above two methods, the trial court would have the discretion to order the payment to [the wife] of her share in either a lump sum or in installments, depending primarily on the other assets and relative financial positions of the parties. The third method, which has been used widely ... is to determine a fixed percentage for [the wife] of any future payments [the husband] receives under the plan, payable to her as, if, and when paid to [the husband]. Under this approach, of course, it is unnecessary to determine the value of the pension fund at all. The court need do no more than determine the appropriate percentage to which the non-employee spouse is entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Deering, </em>292 Md. at 130-31, 437 A.2d 883 (quoting <em>Bloomer v. Bloomer, </em>84 Wis.2d 124, 136, 267 N.W.2d 235, 241 (1978)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The third method, which has been referred to as the \u201cif, as and when\u201d method, recognizes that the value of a pension at the time of a divorce cannot be ascertained with certainty until the employee spouse retires. <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>118 Md.App. 463, 471, 702 A.2d 999 (1997). It allows the non-employee spouse to reap the benefit of an increase in the value of the pension over time, or, conversely, forces both parties to share in any loss of value. <em>Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 367, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984). The formula, referred to as the <em>Bangs </em>formula, calculates the value of the pension to which the non-employee spouse is entitled as the percentage multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months and years of the marriage, the denominator of which is the number of months and years of employment at the time of retirement. <em>Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. at 356, 475 A.2d 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In the present case, the formula that will be used is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>1 X (27 y., 1 mo. of <em>marriage)</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\"><em>2 </em>(unknown y., mo. of employment)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The result of this formula will be applied to the pension to yield a sum representing the value of the pension to the non-employee spouse (\u201cV\u201d). Wife will be paid until she has received the entire sum \u201cV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">At first blush, the argument that Husband can act to unilaterally diminish the amount of the pension,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> thus reducing the amount to which Wife is entitled, does not appear to be valid. This is because, once Husband retires, Wife is entitled to \u201cV,\u201d pursuant to the judgment ordering her to receive 50% of the pension \u201cif, as and when\u201d Husband receives it.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we recognize that when the value of the pension is determined may affect its value. If the value of the pension is determined after the employee spouse makes an election, the overall value of the pension to the non-employee spouse may be adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">We explain, presuming that Husband obtains the full amount of his pension and that he could elect to take survivor benefits. There is a fee for survivor benefits, and, if such benefits are elected, the fee is deducted from the value of the pension, i.e., off the top. If the value of the pension is calculated after Husband makes the election, Wife\u2019s share is decreased by his actions. If the value is determined before Husband makes an election, Wife will obtain her designated share of the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Absent some express determination by the trial judge to the contrary, we believe that it is inherent in the <em>Bangs </em>formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that the valuation of the pension, for purposes of the non-employee spouse\u2019s share, be determined prior to the employee making any elections that would diminish the value. This is because the purpose of the formula is to allow the true value of the designated marital portion of a pension to be ascertained after the fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201cAs we noted in <em>Hoffman v. Hoffman, </em>[93 Md.App. 704, 614 A.2d 988 (1992) ], \u2018the <em>amount </em>of the \u201cas, if and when\u201d payment, however, cannot be determined until [Husband] retires from [CIBA-GEIGY] and the <em>number of years of total employment is known.\u2019 Hoffman, </em>93 Md.App. at 719, 614 A.2d 988 (emphasis added); <em>see also Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. at 367, 475 A.2d 1214.
