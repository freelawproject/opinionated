EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In a paternity and custody case between Kathleen Schroeder (\u201cKathleen\u201d), the appellant, and Roland Broadfoot, Jr. (\u201cRoland\u201d), the appellee, the Circuit Court for Carroll County passed an order directing that the surname of the parties\u2019 child be Broadfoot. Kathleen appealed the order, contending the circuit court\u2019s ruling was an abuse of discretion. We agree with her, and shall vacate the order and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The child at the center of this dispute was born on July 6, 1998, to parents who were not married and were in a relationship that had become strained and unstable well before he was bom. At birth, Kathleen named the child Robert John Schroeder (\u201cRobert\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">On July 10, 1998, Roland filed a Complaint for Blood Testing and Other Relief against Kathleen, in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. He did not acknowledge paternity of Robert, but admitted to the \u201cpossibility\u201d of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Seven days later, Kathleen filed a Complaint to Establish Paternity, Custody, and Child Support against Roland, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, alleging that Roland is Robert\u2019s father. Soon thereafter, blood testing was performed, upon agreement of the parties, and on August 28, 1998, the test results established Roland\u2019s paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Several months later, Roland amended his complaint to seek custody and a change in Robert\u2019s surname, from Schroeder to Broadfoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Ultimately, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County transferred Kathleen\u2019s case against Roland to the Circuit Court for Carroll County, and all of the claims were consolidated in that court. After a period of discovery, the parties resolved their disputes by agreement, except the dispute over Robert\u2019s last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>name. On March 22, 2001, when Robert was <em>22k </em>years old, the circuit court held a hearing on that issue. In addition to the facts we have recited so far, the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Kathleen was 39 years old when the hearing took place. Sixteen years earlier, when she was 23, she had married a man named Brent Schroeder, and had assumed Schroeder as her last name. (Kathleen\u2019s maiden name is Traynor.) During that marriage, Kathleen gave birth to three children, all of whom bear the surname Schroeder. The Schroeders were divorced in 1995, and Kathleen was granted custody of the children. Kathleen chose to keep the surname Schroeder, and has used that name ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In 1997, Kathleen became involved in a relationship with Roland, and soon became pregnant. The relationship was fraught with problems. According to Roland, during the pregnancy, he and Kathleen discussed the last name the child would be given and agreed upon the surname Broadfoot. According to Kathleen, no such discussion took place. To the contrary, she made it clear to Roland that she intended to give the child the surname Schroeder. When Robert was born, Kathleen did not state the name of his father on the birth certif\u00edcate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roland testified that he did not know that Kath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>leen had given Robert the surname Schroeder until Robert was several weeks old.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Since birth, Robert has lived with Kathleen and his three half-siblings, with whom he is close. The half-siblings spend on average two weekends a month -with their father, at his house. When Kathleen transports them to their father\u2019s house for this \u201cexchange,\u201d Robert accompanies her. According to Kathleen, Robert understands that his half-siblings go to their father\u2019s house to spend time with him and understands that his father and their father are two different men. Robert\u2019s half-siblings understand this too. They also know that Kathleen has a maiden name, but does not use it as her last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Robert calls Roland \u201cDaddy\u201d and recognizes him as his father. According to Roland, Robert knows that he is his father, and is not confused about that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Kathleen testified that Robert knows all three of his names, and when asked his name will say, \u201cRobert John Schroeder.\u201d Roland disagreed, testifying that Robert knows his first and middle names, but not his last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Starting soon after Robert\u2019s birth, and until January 1999, Roland had visitation with Robert several times a month. The visits took place at Roland\u2019s mother\u2019s house, where he lives, and in the presence of his mother and sister. From January 1999, until September 16, 1999, these visits occurred every other weekend and on Tuesday evenings.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">On September 16, 1999, Kathleen sought and obtained a domestic violence protective order against Roland. From then until February 2000, Roland\u2019s visits with Robert were supervised, and took place once a week. At that point, Roland began serving a prison sentence for an alcohol-related driving offense. Roland decided it would not be best for Robert to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>attend visitation in prison, and therefore elected not to have visitation. The record does not reveal the length of Roland\u2019s prison term, but discloses that he was on work release.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Robert testified that he has paid child support for Robert from the time of Robert\u2019s birth. He has never been in arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">When asked why he wants Robert to have his last name, Roland gave five reasons. First, Robert \u201cis [his] first son and only child,\u201d and therefore should have his name. Second, children should \u201ccarry\u201d the names of their fathers, not their mothers. Third, as Robert grows up, it will be confusing to him to have to explain why his last name is different from Roland\u2019s last name. Fourth, Robert also will become confused over whether his mother\u2019s ex-husband (Brent Schroeder) is his father. Finally, it is \u201cnot natural\u201d and \u201cnot the honest truth\u201d for Robert to have the last name Schroeder. Roland explained that the last name Schroeder is \u201cBrent Schroeder\u2019s name,\u201d not Kathleen\u2019s name, and is just \u201cthe name she uses, right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Kathleen testified that she wants Robert to use the last name Schroeder so he will feel secure and identify with her and his half-siblings, who constitute the family unit he lives with. She explained that she kept the name Schroeder after her divorce because she wanted her children to identify with her, and she wants the same for Robert. She is fearful that if Robert\u2019s last name is not the same as hers and his half-siblings, others may tease him or leave him out or treat him differently, in a bad way. In Kathleen\u2019s view, it should be left to Robert to decide, when he is older, whether he wants to use the last name Broadfoot, instead of Schroeder; and she will support him in whatever decision he makes. Kathleen wants Robert to continue to have a strong and positive father-son relationship with Roland, and will act in accordance with that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The custody, visitation, and support agreement between the parties was put on the record and ultimately documented in a written order. It gave Kathleen legal and physical custody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Robert with Roland having visitation on a phased-in schedule beginning with supervised visitation in April through June 2001, and increasing to unsupervised visitation, every other weekend and Tuesday nights, in July 2001, and thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">After closing arguments of counsel, the court explained that it was going to hold the matter <em>sub curia </em>and issue a written ruling, but it already had concluded that the mere fact that Roland is Robert\u2019s father and thinks that children should \u201ccarry\u201d their father\u2019s surnames was not reason to give Robert the last name Broadfoot. The court remarked, however, that it \u201cha[d] some concern about whether there is some confusion or would be some confusion in Robert\u2019s mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On April 26, 2001, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order directing that Robert\u2019s surname be \u201cchanged\u201d from Schroeder to Broadfoot. After explaining that the decision about the proper surname for Robert was controlled by the best interests of the child standard, the court commented that, if Kathleen had elected to resume the use of her maiden name after her divorce, it \u201cwould have [had] no difficulty in finding that it would be in Robert\u2019s best interest to keep the name he had been given at birth,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>Kathleen\u2019s maiden name. The court then stated that because Robert knows that Roland is his father, and the two have bonded in a father-son relationship, \u201cit is likely that Robert will be confused as he gets older as to why he bears the surname of someone who is not his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Kathleen noted a timely appeal, presenting the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that it is in Robert\u2019s best interest to have the surname Broadfoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Kathleen contends that there is no factual basis in the evidence for the court\u2019s decision that Robert\u2019s best interests will be served by giving him his father\u2019s surname and therefore the court\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. Specifically, she complains that because the evidence showed without contradiction that Robert is not confused about who his father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>is, or why he does hot use his father\u2019s last name, there was no evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s finding that unless Robert takes his father\u2019s surname he will suffer from confusion in the future. In addition, Kathleen maintains that the court\u2019s revelation that had she resumed the use of her maiden name, it would have found giving her surname to Robert to be in his best interests, and the court\u2019s comment that Robert will be confused in the future as to \u201cwhy he bears the surname of someone who is not his father,\u201d show that the court evaluated the surname Schroeder as if it were not her surname, but merely the surname of her ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Roland responds that the trial court\u2019s ruling was grounded in the evidence, and was based on a proper consideration of factors that, while stated in prior cases about the standard for changing a child\u2019s name the parents once agreed upon, and therefore somewhat different from this case, nevertheless are relevant to both situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Maryland follows the common law of names, that in the absence of a statute to the contrary, a person may take and use any name he wants, so long as his purpose is not fraudulent and the use of the name does not interfere with the rights of others. <em>Stuart v. Board of Supervisors, </em>266 Md. 440, 446, 295 A.2d 223 (1972) (holding that because, at common law, a person may \u201cadopt any name by which he may become known, and by which he may transact business and execute contracts and sue or be sued,\u201d a woman may retain her birth name after marriage merely by consistently and nonfraudulently using it) (citation omitted). <em>See also Romans v. State, </em>178 Md. 588, 597, 16 A.2d 642 (1940) (holding, that a person may be prosecuted under any name he has adopted or assumed). In <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>30 Md.App. 214, 351 A.2d 917 (1976), then-Chief Judge Orth, writing for this Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">The common law recognized that an individual could change the given name, surname, or both, by which the community knew him merely by assuming a new one, with the restriction that the change could not be effected for fraudulent purposes or to interfere with the rights of others. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>common law sprang and was gradually developed out of the groundwork of custom. It was the ancient custom for the son to adopt a surname at will, regardless of that borne by his father, and the practice extended to the given name also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxG\"><em>Id. </em>at 219, 351 A.2d 917 (footnotes omitted) (citing <em>Smith v. United States Casualty Co., </em>197 N.Y. 420, 428, 90 N.E. 947, 950 (1910) (\u201cThe elementary writers are uniform in laying down the rule that at common law a man may change his name at will.\u201d)). The statutes and rules governing change of name \u201care not to be interpreted as the exclusive manner in which a name may be changed, ... but are in furtherance of and confer an official sanction upon a common law prerogative.\u201d <em>Klein v. Klein, </em>36 Md.App. 177, 181, 373 A.2d 86 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The use of surnames originated in France,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was imported to England with the Norman Conquest in 1066, and became an established tradition by virtue of necessity. The sudden growth in population and a dearth of given, or \u201cChristianx,\u201d names resulted in many people having the same name, and provoked the need for a way to distinguish among them. <em>Gubernat v. Deremer, </em>140 N.J. 120, 127, 657 A.2d 856 (1995) (citing Richard H. Thornton, <em>Note, The Controversy Over Children\u2019s Surnames: Familial Autonomy, Equal Protection and the Child\u2019s Best Interests, </em>1979 Utah L.Rev. 303, 305, and G.S. Arnold, <em>Note, Personal Names, </em>15 Yale L.J. 227, 227 (1906)); <em>see also Comment: In the Name of the Father: Wisconsin\u2019s Antiquated Approach to Child Name Changes in Post-Divorce and Paternity Proceedings, </em>83 Marq. L.Rev. 279, 282 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Surnames were derived from a number of sources, the most common being a person\u2019s place of origin, his trade, profession, or craft, his father\u2019s last name, or his most distinctive physical characteristic or personality trait. <em>In re Schiffman, </em>28 Cal.3d 640, 643, 169 Cal.Rptr. 918, 620 P.2d 579 (1980); 83 Marq. L.Rev. at 282-83. The Norman Conquest also introduced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>feudal system to England; that system carried the custom of naming sons after their fathers as a convenience, so \u201c \u2018the feudal lord could thus more easily identify sons of the soldiers most loyal to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gubernat v. Deremer, supra, </em>140 N.J. at 128, 657 A.2d 856 (quoting Beverly S. Seng, <em>Like Father, Like Child: The Rights of Parents in Their Children\u2019s Surnames, </em>70 Va. L.Rev. 1303, 1324 (1984)). Nevertheless, the practice of adopting one\u2019s father\u2019s surname, known as \u201cpatronymics,\u201d did not predominate in the early days of surnames, and many people took their mothers\u2019 surnames:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">Inquiry into the naming practices of Western societies demonstrates that names ordinarily express kinship, but not necessarily paternity. Matronymics, names derived from the maternal line, have been employed in several Western cultures, including modern Spain and medieval England. In England, at least as late as the fourteenth century, both sons and daughters adopted their mother\u2019s surnames, often upon succeeding to their mothers\u2019 estates or in hopes of doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Seng, <em>supra, </em>70 Va. L.Rev. at 1321-22 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The widespread custom of using paternal surnames eventually developed over time as a by-product of primogeniture, and the concomitant secondary status of women in law and society, which were central to the medieval property structure that emerged in the Fourteenth Century. The doctrine of primogeniture, under which the first-born male of parents had the exclusive right to inheritance, elevated the importance of sons taking their fathers\u2019 surnames to ease proof of inheritance rights. Conversely, because under the doctrine of \u201ccover-ture,\u201d all marital property was vested in and controlled by the husband, with the wife being legally disabled and thus lacking the capacity to own property or enter into contracts, wives came to take the surnames of their husbands and their birth surnames lost relevance. 83 Marq. L.Rev. at 283. \u201cAllowing the husband to determine the surname of [a married couple\u2019s] offspring was part of that system, wherein he was the sole legal representative of the marriage, its property, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>children.\u201d <em>In re Schiffman, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at 643, 169 Cal.Rptr. 918, 620 P.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The custom of giving children born out of wedlock their mother\u2019s surnames likewise derived from primogeniture and women\u2019s secondary status in the legal and social systems. An \u201cillegitimate child\u201d was considered a <em>\u201c\u2019films nullius,\u201d </em>that is, a child of no one, who had no inheritance rights or right to support by his father. Lisa Kelly, <em>Divining the Deep and Inscrutable: Toward a Gender-Neutral, Child-Centered Approach to Child Name-Change Proceedings, </em>99 W. Va. L.Rev. 1, 4 (1996). At common law, such a child had no name, and only could establish one by reputation. <em>Gubernat v. Deremer, supra, </em>140 N.J. at 131, 657 A.2d 856. Eventually, the custom developed that such children took their mothers\u2019 names, to distinguish them from their fathers\u2019 \u201clegitimate\u201d children.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The legal, property, and societal underpinnings of the sur-naming customs that arose in England and came to be a part of American society no longer exist. Inheritance laws do not recognize primogeniture, the doctrine of \u201ccoverture\u201d and other impediments to women\u2019s legal rights were abolished by passage of the Married Women\u2019s Property Acts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, in Maryland, equality of rights under the law may not be abridged or denied because of sex, under the State Equal Rights Amendment, Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46. Criminal \u201cbastardy\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cfornication\u201d statutes were repealed and replaced by paternity statutes directed at protecting children\u2019s interests, and affording children born out of wedlock the same legal rights and status as all other children. <em>See Middleton v. Middleton, </em>329 Md. 627, 620 A.2d 1363 (1993) (child bom out of wedlock has the right to support); <em>Halsey v. Autry, </em>293 Md. 53, 441 A.2d 1056 (1982) (same); Chapter 722, Acts of 1963 (repealing \u201cBastardy and Fornication\u201d statutes and adding to the Code a new \u201cPaternity Proceedings\u201d subtitle). The naming customs that were outgrowths of the past have survived, however, as customs tend to do, and the tradition still prevails that children of married parents take their father\u2019s surname. With that historical background in place, we turn to the Maryland case law on the subject of children\u2019s surnames.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In <em>Lassiter-Geers v. Reichenbach, </em>303 Md. 88, 492 A.2d 303 (1985), the Court of Appeals first addressed the question of what standard governs when a court is asked to resolve a dispute between parents over the initial surname for their child. The Court held that \u201cwhen a father and mother of a child fail to agree at birth and continue to disagree upon the surname to be given the child, the question is one to be determined upon the basis of the best interest of the child.\u201d 303 Md. at 90, 492 A.2d 303. In that case, the parents were married, and both used the surname Reichenbach. They separated shortly before learning the wife was pregnant. Upon giving birth, the mother gave the child the surname Lassiter, which was her maiden name. The father was not consulted and did not learn for seven months that the child had not been given the last name Reichenbach.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The parents were divorced when the child was a year old, and the mother resumed the use of the name Lassiter. The father raised the issue of the child\u2019s last name in the divorce proceeding; by agreement, the issue was reserved for future determination. By the time it came up for a hearing, the mother had remarried and was using the last name Lassiter Geers, a hyphenation of her maiden name and her new husband\u2019s surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The trial court ruled that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to have his father\u2019s surname. The court reasoned that because the mother\u2019s maiden name, Lassiter, was not being used by either parent, the child\u2019s use of that name would prompt people to think, in error, that she was born out of wedlock, which could \u201c \u2018lend[ ] itself to the child being put in an embarrassing position,\u2019 \u201d which was not in her best interests. 303 Md. at 96, 492 A.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. It distinguished the case from a \u201cchange-of-name\u201d case, in which the child\u2019s parents agreed upon a surname, which the child used, but one parent later sought to change it. In that situation, a name change only is warranted if it is in the child\u2019s best interests <em>and </em>the moving party shows \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d <em>West v. Wright, </em>263 Md. 297, 299, 283 A.2d 401 (1971). By contrast, in <em>Lassiter-Geers </em>(and the case <em>sub </em>judice) the child\u2019s parents never agreed upon a surname for the child, and the child thus \u201cwas without a surname,\u201d regardless of what he or she was being called. 303 Md. at 93, 492 A.2d 303. The Court held that the inquiry in that situation is \u201cwhat the surname for the child should be,\u201d which is to be answered by determining what surname will serve the child\u2019s best interests. 303 Md. at 95, 492 A.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The Court in <em>Lassiter-Geers </em>concluded that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in finding it would not serve the child\u2019s best interests to have a surname that would cause people to think she was born out of wedlock, when she was not, or to put her in the awkward situation of having to explain her \u201clegitimacy.\u201d In so concluding, the Court assumed, without deciding, that a judicial resolution of the name dispute by application of the customary preference for children to bear their father\u2019s surnames would violate the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment. 303 Md. at 94, 492 A.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">As noted, unlike in a \u201cno initial surname\u201d case, the standard applicable in a \u201cchange of name\u201d case is not merely what is in the child\u2019s best interests, but whether \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d warrant the requested change. In \u201cchange of name\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>cases, the Court of Appeals and this Court have emphasized that, in determining whether extreme circumstances exist, the two most important factors are misconduct by the parent that could make the child\u2019s continued use of that parent\u2019s surname \u201cshameful or disgraceful,\u201d and abandonment by the parent that implies a surrender of his or her natural ties to the child. <em>West v. Wright, supra, </em>263 Md. at 300, 283 A.2d 401 (reversing a trial court\u2019s decision to change the surname of eleven- and twelve-year-old boys from their father\u2019s surname to their remarried mother\u2019s new surname); <em>Lawrence v. Lawrence, </em>74 Md.App. 472, 538 A.2d 779 (1988) (affirming a trial court\u2019s denial of a mother\u2019s petition to change her minor children\u2019s surname from their father\u2019s surname to a hyphenation of the mother\u2019s name and the father\u2019s surname).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In defending the circuit court\u2019s ruling, Roland suggests that just as misconduct and abandonment are the paramount factors for the court to consider in \u201cchange of name\u201d cases, they are of most importance in \u201cno initial surname\u201d cases; and because the evidence in this case established that he did not engage in misconduct so serious as to have shamed or disgraced the name Broadfoot and he did not abandon Robert (and, to the contrary, has been involved in Robert\u2019s life and has supported him from the beginning), the circuit court\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We agree -with Kathleen that, while the court properly recognized that its decision was controlled by the best interests of the child standard, and while the court\u2019s discretion to determine what is in a child\u2019s best interests is broad, the reasons the court gave for its decision in this case reveal that its ruling was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">First, central to the court\u2019s best interests ruling was its factual finding that because Robert knows Roland is his father, and the two have formed a father-son relationship, \u201cit is likely that [Robert] will be confused as he gets older as to why he bears the surname of someone who is not his father,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>Brent Schroeder.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The evidence showed, and the parties agreed, that Robert is not confused over who he is or who is father is. To some extent, in cases such as these, the court must do its best to project into the future and make findings, in the nature of predictions, about the impact having a certain name will have on the child. <em>See Lassiter-Geers, supra, </em>303 Md. 88, 492 A.2d 303. Findings concerning future impact must not be sheer, unfounded speculation, however; they must be reasonably grounded in some evidence about present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Here, the uncontradicted evidence about Robert\u2019s relationship with Roland, and the court\u2019s finding about the relationship, was that Robert and Roland are bonded as father and son. That evidence only could support a reasonable inference <em>against </em>Robert\u2019s becoming confused about his identity, or his father\u2019s identity, as he grows older (particularly given that it was combined with evidence that Robert understands who Brent Schroeder is and that he is not his father). Yet, the court used the evidence of Roland and Robert\u2019s relationship to support the opposite inference, in <em>favor </em>of Robert\u2019s becoming confused, and to reach a finding the evidence would not support. A discretionary decision based on a factual finding that is not grounded in the evidence, and therefore is clearly erroneous, is an abuse of discretion. <em>See North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994) (observing that a ruling that is \u201c \u2018clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court\u2019 \u201d is an abuse of discretion) (quoting <em>Shockley v. Williamson, </em>594 N.E.2d 814, 815 (Ind.App.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Second, the court abused its discretion by running afoul of the common law rule on names in assessing Robert\u2019s best interests. The court found, in essence, that because \u201cSchroeder\u201d is Brent Schroeder\u2019s last name, when Robert gets older, he will wonder why he has Brent Schroeder\u2019s last name instead of Roland\u2019s last name; and his wondering may result in his becoming alienated from Roland.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The problem with this way of thinking, as Kathleen points out, is that it treated her as if she had no surname. In effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the court factored Kathleen\u2019s surname out of the \u201cbest interests\u201d equation. Instead of deciding whether it would be in Robert\u2019s best interests to have his father\u2019s surname or his mother\u2019s surname, the court decided whether it would be in Robert\u2019s best interests to have his father\u2019s surname or Brent Schroeder\u2019s surname. The court confirmed that this was its thought process when it observed that it would have had no trouble finding it best for Robert to be given Kathleen\u2019s maiden name, had she resumed the use of that name upon her divorce. The court was ignoring the fact that \u201cSchroeder\u201d is Kathleen\u2019s surname and not merely her ex-husband\u2019s surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We do not find persuasive Roland\u2019s argument that parental abandonment and serious misconduct disgracing a surname are the paramount factors in assessing the child\u2019s best interests in a \u201cno initial surname\u201d case, as they are in a \u201cchange of name\u201d case, and that the absence of evidence that he abandoned Robert or engaged in serious misconduct therefore supports the circuit court\u2019s decision. Abandonment and serious misconduct disparaging of a name are of paramount importance in \u201cchange of name\u201d cases because they epitomize the sort of exceedingly negative behavior by a parent that will justify changing the child\u2019s surname to a name other than that parent\u2019s surname, when the parents gave the child that parent\u2019s surname at birth. The focus in those cases, given the prevailing standard, is on profoundly bad parental behavior. That is not the focus in \u201cno initial surname\u201d cases, which call for a global best interests analysis. As we shall explain, when parents never have agreed upon their child\u2019s surname, there are a multitude of factors that come to bear in deciding what surname will serve the child\u2019s best interests. While those factors include abandonment and serious misconduct bringing shame to a surname, they are not primary or determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Notwithstanding that parental abandonment or other serious misconduct may have been factors relevant to the court\u2019s decision in this case, the absence of evidence that Robert had engaged in such conduct could not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>circuit court\u2019s ruling. First, with respect to abandonment, the law is cleai' that a child\u2019s parents each owe him a duty of support and care. <em>See Garay v. Overkoltzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 631 A.2d 429 (1993) (holding that parents have common law and statutory duty to support and care for their children); FL \u00a7 5-203(b)(1) and (2). It cannot be said, therefore, that evidence that a parent has <em>not </em>abandoned his child, <em>i.e., </em>that the parent has done what the law requires, is enough to establish that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to bear that parent\u2019s surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Second, reduced to its essence, Roland\u2019s argument is a mere repackaging of the custom of \u201cpatronymics\u201d in the form of a legal presumption. Just as there was no evidence that <em>Roland </em>abandoned Robert or engaged in misconduct serious enough to disparage the name Broadfoot, there was no evidence that <em>Kathleen </em>abandoned Robert or engaged in misconduct disparaging of her name. Thus, Roland\u2019s theory is that when the evidence on these factors is the same for both parents, there should be a tie-breaking preference in favor of the child\u2019s bearing his father\u2019s surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">To be sure, as we have noted, the custom of giving the children of married people their father\u2019s last name is still prevalent. (Also as we have noted, the opposite custom has prevailed when, as here, the parents were not married, a problem in Roland\u2019s argument he has chosen not to address). What parents <em>together </em>may decide to name their children is up to them and is not the issue here. The issue is how must a court go about deciding what surname will serve a child\u2019s best interests when the child\u2019s parents, having equal legal responsibility for and equal rights, including naming rights, respecting the child, cannot agree about the child\u2019s last name. A legal presumption that would operate to create a default circumstance in which, absent evidence of abandonment or serious misconduct by the child\u2019s father, the child\u2019s best interests are deemed to be served by giving him his father\u2019s surname, is a gender-based and gender-biased preference that not only is outdated in the law but also would violate the Maryland Equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Rights Amendment. <em>Cf Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 374 A.2d 900 (1977) (holding that parents are equally responsible for the duty of support and that under the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, in allocating the responsibility of support, courts are not permitted to consider the sex of the parent as a factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Having concluded that the circuit court\u2019s ruling was based on a factual finding not supported by the evidence and on a misapplication of the law, we shall vacate the court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings. We add the following discussion as guidance to the court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Lassiter-Geers, </em>the Court adopted a pure best interests standard for \u201cno initial surname\u201d cases, by which we mean the court decides the issue without either party bearing a burden of proof that would act as a legal tie-breaker, <em>ie., </em>a presumption, in the event the court finds the evidence to be in equal balance. The majority of courts in other states also apply a pure best interests standard in disputes between parents over their children\u2019s initial names. <em>See, e.g., Cohee v. Cohee, </em>210 Neb. 855, 317 N.W.2d 381 (1982); <em>In re Schiffman, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 640, 169 Cal.Rptr. 918, 620 P.2d 579; <em>Brooks v. Willie, </em>117 Misc.2d 640, 458 N.Y.S.2d 860 (Fam.Ct.1983). Some courts have adopted a mixed standard, however, that combines a best interests analysis with a presumption in favor of the name preferred by the custodial parent. The courts that have adopted such a standard premise it on the well-established principle that the child\u2019s custodial parent is presumed to act in his or her best interests in all respects, including in giving the child a name. <em>See, e.g., Gubernat v. Deremer, supra, </em>140 N. J. 120, 657 A.2d 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">It can be argued that when a \u201cno initial surname\u201d dispute arises between parents who never married, especially when paternity was not acknowledged before or at that time of birth, a mixed presumption is more suitable that a pure presumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In many of those situations, the parents will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>not have had a relationship conducive to acting together to select their child\u2019s name. Also, in those situations, from the time of the child\u2019s birth, and until paternity is established, the mother is the child\u2019s only parent in the eyes of the law. Indeed, as we have explained, <em>supra, </em>under HG \u00a7 4-208(a)(6), when a child of an unmarried mother is born, the name of the man the mother states is the child\u2019s father cannot be entered on the child\u2019s birth certificate unless he has signed an affidavit of paternity. This statute does not address naming of the child, but it is implicit that when a child\u2019s parents are not married, the information that must be obtained immediately after the child\u2019s birth for entry on the birth certificate, including the child\u2019s name, will, except in rare circumstances, come from the child\u2019s mother, whose maternity is established by nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On the other hand, adopting a mixed burden of proof favoring the custodial parent when unmarried parents cannot agree on the child\u2019s surname would draw a distinction between children of married and unmarried parents that otherwise has been discarded in the law, and would have the practical effect of incorporating a maternal preference because, maternity being established by nature, custody of an infant almost always is with his mother, except in highly unusual circumstances. When paternity is established, and the father thus is recognized in the law as having the obligations and rights, including the naming right, of parenthood, a custodial preference in naming is apt to create a maternal preference in naming. Moreover, using a mixed standard could lead to custody races to the courthouse and to parents refraining from agreeing upon custody, so as not to lose an advantage, and thus would be detrimental to the interests of the children who have the misfortune to be embroiled in these disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We conclude that in resolving \u201cno initial surname\u201d disputes between unmarried parents, just as in resolving those disputes between parents who are or were married, either at conception or at the time of birth, a pure best interests standard applies. Because the matter is one of equity, however, the doctrine of laches applies. Thus, if a father delays in seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>determination of paternity, or in asserting his objection to the name the mother has selected for the child, the court may conclude that the father has acquiesced in the mother\u2019s naming of the child, and treat his challenge as a request for the child\u2019s name to be changed, to which the \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d standard applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In the case at bar, the evidence presented to the court established that Kathleen took custody of Robert from birth; that paternity had not been established or acknowledged, by affidavit, when Robert was bom; that Kathleen assigned Robert his name, which was entered on his birth certificate, in conformity with the law; and that Roland took prompt legal action to obtain blood testing and then, when paternity was established, to seek the court\u2019s intervention in resolving his and Kathleen\u2019s dispute over Robert\u2019s name. Accordingly, the pure best interests of the child standard, with no presumption or burden of proof, was and is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">A number of cases from around the country have addressed the factors courts should consider, when relevant, in deciding what surname will serve the best interests of the child. The factors are: 1) the child\u2019s reasonable preference, if the child is of the age and maturity to express a meaningful preference; 2) the length of time the child has used any of the surnames being considered; 3) the effect that having one name or the other may have on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s mother-child and father-child relationships; 4) the identification of the child as a part of a family unit; 5) the embarrassment, difficulties, or harassment that may result from the child\u2019s use of a particular surname; 6) misconduct by one of the child\u2019s parents disparaging of that parent\u2019s surname; 7) failure of one of the child\u2019s parents to contribute to the child\u2019s support or to maintain contact with the child; and 8) the degree of community good will or respect associated with a particular surname. <em>See Keegan v. Gudahl, </em>525 N.W.2d 695 (S.D.1994); <em>In re Pizziconi, </em>177 Ariz. 422, 425, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>868 P.2d 1005 (1993); <em>In re Change of Name of Andrews, </em>235 Neb. 170, 454 N.W.2d 488 (1990); <em>Bobo v. Jewell, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 330, 528 N.E.2d 180 (1988); <em>Daves v.

Rogers, </em>868 S.W.2d 283 (Tenn.App.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The circuit court in this case should consider whichever of these factors is pertinent in making its decision in this case. For the court to address some of these factors, it will be necessary for it to hold an evidentiary hearing to receive current information. After weighing the evidence, making findings, and analyzing, by application of the appropriate factors, whether it is best for Robert to have Roland\u2019s surname or Kathleen\u2019s surname, the court still may conclude that it is in Robert\u2019s best interests to be named Broadfoot. Our opinion should not be read to mean otherwise \u2014 or as expressing a view one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">ORDER VACATED.

Roland made that fact known during his testimony, and introduced into evidence Robert's birth certificate, which designates the child\u2019s father as \"not stated.\u201d His testimony suggested that Kathleen\u2019s actions were improper. Under Md.Code (1998 Supp.), \u00a7 4-208(a)(6) of the Health General Article (\"HG\u201d), however, the name of the father may not be entered on the child\u2019s birth certificate unless an affidavit of paternity, as authorized by Md.Code (1998 Supp.) \u00a7 5-1028 of the Family Law Article (\"FL\u201d), has been signed by the mother and by the person to be designated the father on the birth certificate. Moreover, under HG \u00a7 4 \u2014 208(a)(8), \u201d[i]f the father is not named on the certificate of birth, no other information about the father shall be entered' on the certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">HG \u00a7 4-208(a)(4)(i) provides that when an unmarried woman gives birth in an institution (which would include a hospital, <em>see </em>HG \u00a7 4-201(i)), the administrative head of the institution should provide the mother and father an opportunity to sign an affidavit of paternity (or parentage). Roland testified that he saw Robert in the hospital the day he was born. There was no evidence, however, that Roland signed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>affidavit of paternity then, or ever.
