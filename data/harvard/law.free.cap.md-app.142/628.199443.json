The first decision was the denial of Berkshire\u2019s request to stay the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) Final Order requiring it to pay a monetary award to an individual insured, and it is the subject of Appeal No. 1248, September Term, 2000. The second decision affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s Order and is the subject of Appeal No. 1935, September Term, 2000. These appeals were consolidated on the parties\u2019 motion on December 29, 2000. Appellant raises the following two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">I. Appeal No. 1248: Under the separation of powers doctrine and constitutional and statutory tenets of due process, was Berkshire Life entitled to a stay of the Commissioner\u2019s Substituted Conclusions of Law and Final Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d) pending judicial review in the circuit court where the administrative order required only the payment of a monetary award to an individual insured and Berkshire Life agreed to post an adequate cash bond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">II. Appeal No. 1935 Did the circuit court commit reversible error in affirming the Final Order of the Commissioner where the Commissioner ignored the standard of review for a Recommended Decision of an ALJ mandated by the insurance regulations and substituted his determinations for those of the ALJ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">This case involves three different disability policies purchased by Howard F. Rosenstein: Policy No. NC216442 dated February 11, 1976 (the \u201c1976 Policy\u201d), Policy No. NC240959 dated September 12, 1980 (the \u201c1980 Policy\u201d), and Policy No. NC247381 dated November 23, 1981 (the \u201c1981 Policy\u201d). The 1976 policy provided coverage for total disability, which is defined in the policy as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">the complete inability of the Insured to engage in his occupation, except that if indemnity has been paid for 120 months in any period of continuous disability, and this policy provides indemnity in excess of 120 months, then for the remaining duration of that period of continuous disability, the term \u201ctotal disability\u201d shall mean the complete inability of the Insured to engage in any gainful occupation in which he might reasonably be expected to engage, having due regard to his education, training, experience and prior economic status])]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The 1980 policy insured against total disability as well, which is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">your inability to engage in your occupation, except: the terms of this policy may provide that the indemnity payments are to be made beyond the policy anniversary that falls on or most nearly follows your sixty-fifth birthday. In such a case, for benefits that are to be paid for disability after such anniversary, or after disability benefits have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>paid for a period of two years (if this is longer), the term \u201ctotal disability\u201d will have this meaning: your inability to engage in any gainful occupation in which you might reasonably be expected to engage, with due regard to your education, training, experience, and prior economic status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The 1980 policy also contained a supplementary agreement covering residual disability benefits. Residual disability is defined by the policy as \u201c(1) your inability to do one or more of your important daily business or professional duties; or (2) your inability to do these duties for the length of time that they usually require.\u201d The policy further provides that residual disability payments would be made, <em>inter alia, </em>if \u201cyou enter a period of such disability right after the end of a period of total disability.\u201d The 1981 policy covered only total disability as previously defined in the 1980 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Mr. Rosenstein bought the first policy when he was working as a Special Agent in the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Rosenstein went into business for himself in September 1980, and continued to operate his business until the time of his disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Although Mr. Rosenstein is licensed to practice law in Maryland, he has always worked as an investigator specializing in financial and fraud investigations. When he opened his business, Mr. Rosenstein began consulting with private firms in addition to state and local governments in both criminal and private matters. Mr. Rosenstein described some of his work as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">My expertise in financial and fraud investigations has encompassed the reconstruction of complicated factual and financial transactions to determine whether fraud has occurred; locating funds wrongfully taken from financial institutions and businesses; assisting defense counsel in white collar crime prosecutions and investigations; assisting insurance companies in reconstructing financial documents, books and records in order to evaluate their coverage and defense of claims; and assisting attorneys and their clients in the resolution of tax disputes, criminal and civil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>He testified that he often helped obtain successful outcomes for his clients and that he worked on a number of high profile cases, including representing the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund in cases involving Old Court Savings &amp; Loan, Ridgeway Savings &amp; Loan, Community Savings &amp; Loan, and Merritt Commercial Savings &amp; Loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">With Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s success came his involvement in increasingly complex and high profile cases. Between 1991 and 1994, he was working on two demanding cases, one in Rhode Island and one in New Jersey. These cases required frequent travel, adherence to strict deadlines, review of voluminous amounts of material, and supervision of a number of other people. Mr. Rosenstein was under \u201ctremendous pressure.\u201d Nevertheless, he found the work to be \u201ca lot of fun. I was having a great time but it was hard and it took its toll on me so during that period I first started to note small lapses of short term memory, loss of concentration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">After some soul searching, Mr. Rosenstein decided that the job was \u201cjust taking too heavy a toll on me, physically and mentally.\u201d In late 1994, therefore, he decided to cut back on the sprawling complex cases requiring travel in favor of local cases that, although complicated, were not as large in terms of document review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Although Mr. Rosenstein reduced his workload, he continued to notice \u201clittle slippages\u201d in concentration and short term memory during 1995 and 1996. In addition to these problems, in November of 1996, he began suffering from substantial pain in his knees, headaches that were sometimes incapacitating, fatigue, and \u201cconstant indigestion.\u201d Mr. Rosenstein sought the help of Dr. Steven Diener, an internist who diagnosed and began treating him for hypertension, reflux, and a hiatal hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Although he was now being treated, Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s problems grew worse. The pain in his knees did not subside, and he continued to have problems with concentration and memory. He was later diagnosed with sleep apnea, and Dr. Diener suggested that Mr. Rosenstein might also be suffering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>depression. Mr. Rosenstein continued to work until January 1997, when he finished his duties in a white collar defense case. He took no new cases despite being approached to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Notwithstanding his various problems, Mr. Rosenstein believed at that time that he would be returning to work. His health continued to deteriorate, however, and he began seeing a rheumatologist, Dr. Matthew P. Bunyard, and a psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence R. Hyman, in addition to Dr. Diener. In March of 1997, after his \u201cthird, or fourth or fifth visit with Dr. Diener,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein filed a disability claim with Berkshire under all three policies. If he was found to be totally disabled, he would receive payments of $1,000 a month for each policy for a total of $3,000 per month. These benefits would be paid until he reached age 65. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">On his claim form, he listed \u201cMid 1996 to present\u201d as the period of disability. His duties were listed as \u201cexpert in the analysis of complex factual and financial transactions, reconstruction of documentation related to those matters including expert testimony,\u201d and his symptoms were listed as \u201cdementia, headaches, sleep depreviation [sic], stress, hypertension, depression, reading sight deterioration, arthritis.\u201d He stated that he was unable to perform the following job duties: \u201creview numerous documents, large analyses, memory loss, testimony at hearings and trials, meetings involving stress.\u201d Mr. Rosenstein also enclosed a \u201cdescription of occupation\u201d form with the claim form. Dr. Diener submitted an \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement,\u201d which included statements in pre-printed blanks that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled from December 1996 and that he was also partially disabled from December 1996.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In April 1997, Berkshire asked Mr. Rosenstein for copies of his personal and business income tax forms for the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>1992 through 1996, as well as for other financial information. Mr. Rosenstein provided this information to Berkshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On May 14, 1997, Bruce Hodsoll, Berkshire\u2019s Vice President of Claims Management, met with Mr. Rosenstein at Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s home. During that meeting, Mr. Hodsoll offered to settle the claims under all three policies for $36,000, but Mr. Rosenstein declined the offer. Mr. Hodsoll then indicated that, if Mr. Rosenstein did not accept the offer, Berkshire was likely to pay only under the residual disability benefit clause of the 1980 Policy for a total of $3,000. Mr. Hodsoll indicated also that he would review the matter again to determine if it would be possible for Berkshire to increase its offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On July 2, 1997, after receiving no answer or further contact from Mr. Hodsoll, Mr. Rosenstein wrote to James Zelinski, President of Berkshire. Mr. Rosenstein copied his letter to MIA, which responded by opening an investigation. Berkshire responded to the letter by sending Mr. Rosenstein the first of two $1,500 checks as a residual disability benefit under the 1980 policy. It denied the claim for total disability benefits, despite the language in the policy requiring a period of total disability prior to payment of residual disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In early October 1997, Dr. Diener submitted a Progress Report to Berkshire again stating that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled and had been from January 13, 1997. Berkshire again advised Mr. Rosenstein that it believed he was only entitled to a residual disability benefit. Mr. Rosenstein then wrote a letter to Thomas W. Loftus, the Berkshire Claims Consultant assigned to his claim, with a series of questions concerning Berkshire\u2019s denials of his claims as well as Berkshire\u2019s failure to seek additional medical information from Dr. Bunyard. Berkshire responded that \u201cbased on its \u2018evaluation of the medical records\u2019 and Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s failure to prove the required loss of income,\u201d it did not believe that he was entitled to anything more than minimal benefits under the residual disability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On November 13,1997, Mr. Rosenstein filed a Supplemental Disability Claim, again seeking total disability benefits. Berkshire denied this claim. Dr. Hyman wrote to Berkshire on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>December 30, 1997, with information on Mr. Rosensteiris condition and advising that, in his opinion, Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Berkshire referred Mr. Rosensteiris claim file to Laurie Cohen, a Ph.D. psychologist under contract with it. Dr. Cohen reached no conclusion from her review but requested further information. Subsequently, she had contact with Dr. Hyman concerning her questions. Apart from the foregoing, Berkshire took no additional steps, including an independent medical evaluation, to investigate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">During this same period of time, MIA was conducting an investigation. It issued a form determination letter in September 1997 indicating that Berkshire was acting in accordance with the terms of its contract and was therefore not in violation of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Mr. Rosenstein sought reconsideration of this decision by writing a letter to Senator Barbara Mikulski. Senator Mikul-ski forwarded the letter to Governor Parris Glendening, who forwarded it to MIA. MIA subsequently reopened its investigation, and assigned to the case an investigator with special experience in handling disability claims. After this subsequent investigation, the MIA concluded that Berkshire\u2019s refusal to pay total disability benefits based on the \u201cabundance of medical documentation supporting Mr. Rosensteiris disability\u201d was arbitrary and capricious and was in violation of Md.Code Ann. (1997), \u00a7 27-303 of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Berkshire challenged this determination, and the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on March 29-30, 1999. On April 16, 1999, the ALJ issued her Recommended Decision. The ALJ concluded that Berkshire\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">refusal to pay total disability benefits for the period from March 1997 through October 1997 was not in violation of Md.Code Ann., Ins. II, \u00a7 27-303(2) (1997 &amp; Supp.l998).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>further conclude, as a matter of law, that the Licensee\u2019s decision to terminate review of the claim for total disability benefits for the period from November 1997 through July 1998<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of Md.Code Ann., Ins. II \u00a7 27-303(2) (1997 &amp; Supp.1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">MIA filed exceptions to the recommended decision, and on April 17, 2000, the Commissioner issued his Final Order (the \u201cOrder\u201d), which reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">ORDERED, that the Findings of Fact in the Recommended Decision issued in this matter by [the ALJ], is hereby AMENDED IN PART, REJECTED IN PART and AFFIRMED IN PART consistent with this Order; and it is hereby further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">ORDERED, that the refusal of [Berkshire] to pay total disability benefits for the period from January 13, 1997 (the date on which the \u201cwaiting period\u201d commenced) through October 1997 was arbitrary and capricious in violation of [Ins. \u00a7 27-303(2)] and, consequently, that part of the ALJ\u2019s recommended Conclusion of Law be and is hereby REJECTED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">ORDERED, that [Berkshire\u2019s] decision to terminate review of the claim for total disability benefits for the period from November 1997 through July 1998 was arbitrary and capricious in violation of [Ins. \u00a7 27-303(2)] and, consequently, that part of the ALJ\u2019s recommended Conclusion of Law be and is hereby AFFIRMED; and it is hereby further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">ORDERED, that the Recommended Order of the ALJ that the claim for the period from November 1997 to July 1998 be remanded to [Berkshire] for a determination of [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] eligibility for total disability benefits be and is hereby REJECTED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ORDERED, that [Berkshire] pay restitution to [Mr. Ro-senstein], in the amount of benefits for coverage for \u201ctotal disability\u201d provided in each and all of [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] three disability Policies for the period January 13, 1997 (when the \u201cwaiting period\u201d commenced) through July 13, 1998, the cut-off in the MIA\u2019s March 4, 1999 determination letter, less the amount already paid by [Berkshire] to [Mr. Rosenstein] for residual disability benefits[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Berkshire then petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on May 17, 2000. On May 31, 2000, Berkshire filed a Motion for Stay of Administrative Order Pending Judicial Review. The court held a hearing on the motion on July 5, 2000, and denied it the same day. Berkshire appealed this ruling, which is the subject of Appeal No. 1248, September Term 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The circuit court held a hearing on the merits of Berkshire\u2019s petition for judicial review on October' 13, 2000. It affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s Final Order in an oral ruling that same day. The court filed a written order on October 16, 2000. Berkshire also appealed this ruling, which is the subject of Appeal No. 1935, September Term, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">I. Appeal No. 1248, September Term, 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Berkshire\u2019s first argument is that the circuit court abused its discretion by refusing to stay the Commissioner\u2019s order. Berkshire argues that the court\u2019s decision violated both the separation of powers doctrine and its due process rights. Moreover, it argues that, because the court looked at the four factors for entitlement to preliminary injunctive relief and then ordered Berkshire to comply immediately with the Commissioner\u2019s administrative order, its decision amounted to an improper injunction. It also argues that, because the Commissioner\u2019s order was not stayed by operation of law, if Berkshire ignored it, it would risk further penalties. Thus, Berkshire argues, it \u201cwas required to do more to obtain a stay in this administrative case than it would had it been appealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>a court order awarding disability benefits after the trial of a contract action.\u201d MIA argues that the denial of a stay of an administrative order is not an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The parties advised this Court at oral argument that Berkshire had not yet paid Mr. Rosenstein, because its appeal to this Court operated as a stay. Rule 8-422(a) provides that \u201can appellant may stay the enforcement of a civil judgment, other than for injunctive relief, from which an appeal is taken by filing a supersedeas bond.\u201d Berkshire filed a supersedeas bond on August 11, 2000. Thus, the payment to Mr. Rosen-stein has effectively been stayed, rendering this issue moot. Even it if were not moot, we have no jurisdiction over this issue. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">An order by the Insurance Commissioner is not automatically stayed by operation of law when a petition for judicial review is filed. Rather, \u201c[w]hen a petition for judicial review is filed with the appropriate court, the court has jurisdiction over the case and shall determine whether the filing operates as a stay of the order or action from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Ins. \u00a7 2 \u2014 215(f)-<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, in this case Berkshire did not wait for the circuit court to make this decision on its own motion but filed a separate motion to stay. In any event, it is within the court\u2019s discretion to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s order should be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">At the July 5, 2000 hearing on the motion to stay, the court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">THE COURT: I \u2014 as I indicated previously, do not agree [with] the Maryland Insurance Administration\u2019s contention that there is actually a test to determine a stay, I think that a stay is in fact, in the discretion of the Court and while I don\u2019t intend to use the 4 elements of injunctive relief[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>think that it is appropriate to look at them as guides since injunctive relief is somewhat similar to a stay. This is on the Baltimore City\u2019s fast track, which means that this case will be resolved quickly and I\u2019m satisfied that when you weigh the injury to Mr. Rosenstein against the injury to Berkshire that Mr. Rosenstein wins on that point and that the public interest is better served by this case going forward. So therefore, I\u2019m going to deny the request to stay the order of judgment at this time. But I will do whatever I can to get this case in as quickly as possible, but not prematurely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">[BERKSHIRE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Are you going \u2014 I take [it] Mr. Rosenstein has offered to post bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">[BERKSHIRE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We urge the Court to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">THE COURT: Well, it was not my intention, but I\u2019ll hear you if you want me to consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">[BERKSHIRE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I think it\u2019s an offer that\u2019s been made and I think Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t get up here and say that he is financially strapped and unable to survive without payment of this judgment, I think then he should be required to post the bond in the event that \u2014 to protect the insurance company\u2019s interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">THE COURT: Well, as far as this Court is concerned, this is a case between the Maryland Insurance Commission and Berkshire Life Insurance, not Mr. \u2014 I allowed him to enter into this case for the sole purpose of arguing the motion to stay and feel that it is inappropriate. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean that if you win this case, you can\u2019t use the full force of the Court to go after Mr. Rosenstein. But, I\u2019m not going to require him to post a bond. Counsel, thank you very much. I\u2019ll sign an order today to the effect that the motion to stay is denied and granting [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>motion to intervene for the limited purposes of arguing the motion to stay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">It is clear that, although the court used the four preliminary injunction factors as a guide in exercising its discretion, it was not considering injunctive relief. Rather, the court was exercising the discretion provided to it by Ins. \u00a7 2-215(1) by not staying the Commissioner\u2019s order. Such an order is not appealable, as the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azm\">The circuit court\u2019s order of March 18, 1996, simply denying a motion to stay the administrative decision and order, was in no sense an \u201cinjunction\u201d as contended by the [Maryland] Commission [on Human Relations]. It was not a court \u201corder mandating or prohibiting a specified act,\u201d and thus did not amount to an \u201cinjunction\u201d as defined by Maryland law. Although the March 18th denial of the motion for a stay left the earlier administrative decision operative, to the same extent as it was operative when rendered by the Commission, nothing in the <em>court\u2019s </em>order of March 18th required or prohibited any party from doing anything. To whatever extent, if any, immediate action was then required, such requirement resulted entirely from the Commission\u2019s order and not the court\u2019s order. No party could have been held in contempt for violating the March 18th court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">Moreover, we have held \u201cthat a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a ... stay is ordinarily not appealable\u201d as a grant or denial of an injunction, <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. Schro-del, </em>320 Md. 202, 213, 577 A.2d 39, 45 (1990). <em>See, e.g., Highfield Water Co. v. Wash. Co. San., </em>295 Md. 410, 416-417, 456 A.2d 371, 374 (1983) (stay or refusal to stay proceedings in the same matter ordinarily does not constitute the grant or denial of an injunction), and cases there cited; <em>Waters v. Smith, </em>277 Md. 189, 195-197, 352 A.2d 793, 796-798 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\"><em>LOOC, Inc. v. Kohli, </em>347 Md. 258, 265-66, 701 A.2d 92 (1997)(footnote omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The July 5th order denying a stay was not an order granting or denying an injunction, and Berkshire could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>have appealed that order pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-303(3)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">II. Appeal No. 1935, September Term, 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Berkshire next argues that the Commissioner erred in ordering it to pay restitution. Specifically, Berkshire contends that the Commissioner applied the wrong standard of review in the case. It also argues that, in any event, there was sufficient evidence in the record for the Commissioner to adopt the ALJ\u2019s determinations, and that there was insufficient evidence in the record for MIA to be able to carry its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review Used by Commissioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Berkshire first argues that the Commissioner failed to use the appropriate standard of review by failing to review the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision using the substantial evidence test, as Berkshire contends is required by the applicable regulations. Therefore, \u201c[t]he threshold question in this appeal concerns not what standard of review the courts apply, but, rather, what is the standard of review that the final agency decision maker in this case must apply in reviewing the intermediate decision of the intermediate administrative decision of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Kohli v. LOOC, Inc., </em>103 Md.App. 694, 711, 654 A.2d 922 (1995), <em>reversed in part and remanded by </em>347 Md. 258, 701 A.2d 92 (1997). At oral argument, Berkshire suggested that we did not need to reach this issue. We disagree. If the Commissioner used the incorrect standard of review, we would be constrained to reverse the case without reaching the merits of Berkshire\u2019s claims. Thus, we will address this aspect of Berkshire\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\u201cIn Maryland, administrative agencies are authorized to fashion their own rules by virtue of express or implied legislative delegations.\u201d <em>Kohli, </em>103 Md.App. at 711, 654 A.2d 922 (citing <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Carp., </em>274 Md. 211, 218, 334 A.2d 514 (1975)). The Commission\u2019s ability to promulgate its own procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>rules is derived from Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10\u2014206(b) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), Administrative Procedures Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201cAPA\u201d), which states that \u201c[e]ach agency may adopt regulations to govern procedures under this subtitle and practice before the agency in contested cases.\u201d In addition, APA \u00a7 10-205(a) allows agencies to delegate hearings in contested cases to the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">When the OAH hears a contested case, it is directed by statute to \u201cprepare proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, or orders in accordance with the agency\u2019s delegation under \u00a7 10-205.\u201d APA \u00a7 10-220(a). The agency then takes action on the proposed decision within sixty days. APA \u00a7 10-220(c)(1). If the OAH \u201cconducted the hearing and' the agency\u2019s proposed decision includes any changes, modifications, or amendments to the [OAH\u2019s] proposed findings, conclusions, or orders, [its order shall] contain an explanation of the reasons for each change, modification, or amendment.\u201d APA \u00a7 10-220(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\u201cWhen [the agency] delegates the hearing responsibility to an ALJ, the ALJ becomes an extension of [the agency]. Any responsibilities not expressly given the ALJ remain with [the agency] and, unless statutorily proscribed, [the agency] reserves the right to review any aspect of an ALJ decision.\u201d <em>Bragunier v. Masonry Contractors v. Maryland Comm\u2019r of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>111 Md.App. 698, 707, 684 A.2d 6 (1996). MIA has enacted regulations allowing the Commissioner to delegate hearings to the OAH, as it did in this case. COMAR 31.02.02.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">After an ALJ hears a case involving MIA, the ALJ is to submit a proposed decision to the Commissioner containing: \u201c(1) [proposed findings of fact; (2)[p]roposed conclusions of law; and (3)[a] proposed order.\u201d COMAR \u00a7 31.02.02.08(A). The parties may then file exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed order.

Effect of Findings of Fact, Proposed Conclusions of Law, and Proposed Order. In reviewing the administrative law judge\u2019s proposed decision, the Commissioner is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">(1) Bound by the findings of fact that are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(2) Not bound by any legal analysis, proposed conclusions of law, or proposed order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">C. Types of Action by the Commissioner.

Berkshire then points out that the \u201cCommissioner, in his Final Order, expressly ruled that he was not required to employ the substantial evidence test in reviewing the Recommended Decision of the ALJ.\u201d Berkshire argues that this was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">The Commissioner explained why he was not using the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test and how he was evaluating the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">Indeed, to use the APA \u201csubstantial evidence test\u201d in the context of the Commissioner\u2019s review of the ALJ\u2019s factual findings would flout the test\u2019s very purpose. When reviewing an agency\u2019s factual findings, courts defer to \u201cthe expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>agency from which the appeal was taken.\u201d <em>Travers v. Balt. Police Dept., </em>115 Md.App. 395, 421, 693 A.2d 378 (1997). The APA permits an agency, in adjudicating a complaint, to rely on \u201cits experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of evidence.\u201d Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-213(i). Accordingly, in applying the substantial evidence test, the reviewing court does not \u201csubstitute its expertise for that of the agency.\u201d <em>State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 58, 548 A.2d 819 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Commissioner then made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">COMAR 31.02.02.12B should be construed based on the \u201cordinary and common meaning\u201d meaning [sic] of the words \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial.\u201d <em>See Gordon Family Part. v. Gar On Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 137-38, 702 A.2d 753 (1997). For legal purposes, the word \u201ccompetent\u201d means \u201clegally fit or qualified.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary, p. 290 (1984) (\u201cWebster\u2019s at-\u201d). The word \u201cmaterial\u201d means \u201crelevant, or of importance to a case.\u201d Webster\u2019s at 732. The word \u201csubstantial\u201d means either \u201cof considerable importance\u201d or \u201cof considerable amount, <em>i.e. ample. </em>[\u201d] Webster\u2019s at 1155. Because accepting the former definition would improperly make the word \u201cmaterial\u201d surplusage, the later definition best indicates that the word \u201csubstantial\u201d means \u201cample\u201d in this context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Accordingly, the Commissioner is not bound by an ALJ\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence supporting those findings' is legally appropriate, relevant and ample. Because the term \u201csubstantial\u201d is meaningful only when put into the context of the total quantum of evidence adduced at the hearing, the Commissioner will not be bound by an ALJ\u2019s factual findings unless it is supported by substantial evidence in relation to all of the evidence adduced at the hearing. If, then, there is ample evidence supporting both parties and the ALJ has <em>properly </em>considered <em>all </em>of the evidence, the Commissioner will be bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and will not reweigh the facts to come to a different conclusion. As well, so long as <em>\u201ccredibility\u201d </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>synonymous with witness <em>demeanor, </em>and the oral testimony of witnesses is conflicting about a fact to be found, the Commissioner will give special deference to the ALJ\u2019s finding about a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Dept. of Health and Mental Hyg. v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 298-302, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). The Commissioner will not give such special deference, however, when an ALJ mislabels as a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d a legal conclusion or a finding based on the application of law to fact-especially where that law involves insurance. Also, the Commissioner will not give such special deference when an ALJ, under the appearance of evaluating witness \u201ccredibility,\u201d is simply concluding that one party made the more persuasive argument. <em>Id. </em>Finally, when required to fairly evaluate all of the evidence, the Commissioner may always find material and relevant facts additional to those found by the ALJ, if those facts are essentially uncontroverted and, thus, do not expressly conflict with the ALJ\u2019s other factual findings. This is because, if the ALJ\u2019s legal analysis was faulty, then the ALJ would not have known that these additional facts were material. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">This Court has found that if an agency establishes a standard under which it reviews an ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, it must apply that standard. <em>Kohli, </em>103 Md.App. at 711-13, 654 A.2d 922. <em>Kohli </em>involved a decision of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (\u201cMCHR\u201d) reversing an ALJ\u2019s decision. The MCHR regulation in force at the time provided that \u201cthe Appeal Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the administrative law judge\u2019s decision in accordance with the standards as set forth in\u201d APA \u00a7 10-222(g). COMAR \u00a7 14.03.01.019(F)(1) (1994). The pertinent statutory provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">(h) <em>Decision. </em>\u2014 In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">APA \u00a7 10-222(h) (1994). The test set out in \u00a7 10-222(h) is the substantial evidence test. The Court of Appeals has clarified the test in a recent case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u2018 \u201c \u2018whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u2018 \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201c \u2018 \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u201d \u2019 \u201d Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>Marzullo v.

Belotti, </em>130 Md.App. 23, 36-37, 744 A.2d 558 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">This Court held that because \u201cthe Commission has elected to bind its Appeal Board, in cases involving discriminatory employment practices, to those same standards [as used by the courts] in reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision in the instant case,\u201d it was required to use those standards in reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Kohli, </em>103 Md.App. at 713, 654 A.2d 922. This suggests that, if it wishes, an agency may provide a different standard of review of the ALJ\u2019s decision than the test set out in \u00a7 10-222(h). The provisions of \u00a7 10-222(h) are clearly limited to judicial review by circuit courts, and, because the General Assembly did not require the individual agencies to use this standard, we assume it intended to allow administrative agencies to establish their own internal standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We have conducted a review of all of the titles of COMAR to determine the standards of review of ALJ decisions currently in use by the various agencies. A number of agencies have no stated standard of review: the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Comptroller, the Department of Housing and Community Development, the Department of Human Resources, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Licensing and Regulation, the Department of Transportation, the Higher Education Commission, the Human Relations Commission, State Procurement, the Department of Business and Economic Development, Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services, and the Department of Aging. Three agencies have specifically bound themselves to the substantial evidence test set forth in APA \u00a7 10-222 with respect to their review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>factual findings: the Retirement and Pension System, the Department of Public Works, and the State Treasurer\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">In addition to the Maryland Insurance Administration, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d), the Department of Juvenile Justice, and the Department of the Environment all provide for different standards of review for reviewing AL J decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The DHMH regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">A. The Secretary is not bound by the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation even in those cases where no exceptions are filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">B. If no exceptions have been filed and, after reviewing a proposed decision by a hearing examiner, the Secretary concludes that the Secretary is unable to approve that decision as written, the Secretary shall notify all parties and invite argument from the affected parties on the issues the Secretary is reconsidering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">COMAR \u00a7 10.01.03.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The Department of Juvenile Justice has promulgated a very similarly worded regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">A. The Secretary is not bound by an administrative law judge\u2019s recommendation even in cases where exceptions are not filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">B.

We will uphold an agency\u2019s decision so long as it has properly applied its own standard of review. In this case, therefore, we uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision as to how he would review the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We now turn to our own review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, which we, of course, review pursuant to \u00a7 10-222(h) and the standards set forth therein. Our discussion will, however, necessarily contain an evaluation of whether he conducted his review in conformance with COMAR \u00a7 31.02.02.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">\n<em>B.

This standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>review is both narrow and expansive. It is narrow to the extent that reviewing courts, out of deference to agency expertise, are required to affirm an agency\u2019s findings of fact, as well as its application of law to those facts, if reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole. The standard is equally broad to the extent that reviewing courts are under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Ins.

MIA has contended that Berkshire violated Ins. \u00a7 27-303(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">It is an unfair claim settlement practice and a violation of this subtitle for an insurer or nonprofit health service plan to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">(2) refuse to pay a claim for an arbitrary or capricious reason based on all available information;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">If an insurer is found to have engaged in unfair claim settlement practices, it is subject to the following penalties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(a) For violation of \u00a7\u00a7 27-303. \u2014 The Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $2,500 for each violation of \u00a7\u00a7 27-303 of this subtitle or a regulation adopted under \u00a7\u00a7 27-303 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">(c) Restitution.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">(1) On finding a violation of this subtitle, the Commissioner may require an insurer or nonprofit health service plan to make restitution to each claimant who has suffered actual economic damage because of the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">(2) Restitution may not exceed the amount of actual economic damage sustained, subject to the limits of any applicable policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Ins. \u00a7 27-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Berkshire makes numerous charges that the Commissioner adopted erroneous facts and points to a variety of places in his Order. On a fundamental level, however, the major difference between the ALJ\u2019s proposed opinion and the Commissioner\u2019s Order is that the ALJ found that Berkshire did not arbitrarily and capriciously refuse to pay Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim for disability for the period March 1997 through October 1997. At oral argument, Berkshire asked that we reverse the Commissioner with instructions to adopt the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision. Because the proposed decision and the Order differed in the manner referenced above, we will address each difference in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">1. The March 1997 through October 1997 Period</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The most significant difference between the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision and the Commissioner\u2019s Order was the findings and conclusions concerning the period from March 1997 through October 1997. The ALJ found that the \u201capplication filed by [Mr. Rosenstein] for that period requested residual (partial) disability benefits, not total disability benefits.\u201d In April and May of 1997, the ALJ noted, Mr. Rosenstein advised Berkshire that he still took \u201csmall and medium\u201d cases. In addition, the ALJ found the medical evidence available to Berkshire at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>this time to contain \u201cunclear information\u201d and to \u201cconflict with [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] request for partial disability benefits.\u201d Consequently, the ALJ found that Berkshire\u2019s denial of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim for this period of time was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The ALJ did find Berkshire\u2019s decision to terminate review of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim for the period November 1997 through July 1998 to have been arbitrary and capricious. The ALJ based this conclusion on the following factual finding: \u201cOn March 20, 1997, [Mr. Rosenstein] filed a claim with [Berkshire] for partial disability benefits. He reported on the claim form that he had been partially disabled since the middle of 1996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Commissioner rejected this finding of fact, and pointed out errors in law made by the ALJ. Berkshire argues that the Commissioner improperly created a new rule in this case, which resulted in an <em>ex post facto </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>a. Factual Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Finding of Fact No. 11 reads as follows: \u201cOn March 20, 1997, [Mr. Rosenstein] filed a claim with [Berkshire] for partial disability benefits. He reported on the claim form that he had been partially disabled since the middle of 1996.\u201d The Commissioner explained his reason for rejecting this finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a2h-dedup-0\">I find that the ALJ erred in concluding that Mr. Rosen-stein filed an application for \u201cpartial disability benefits\u201d and thus reject Finding of Fact No. 11. Instead, I find that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s March 20, 1997 Disability Claimant\u2019s Statement (the \u201cMarch 20 Statement\u201d) contained claims for <em>both </em>total disability and residual disability benefits. As did the ALJ, I based my finding on the contents of documents filed by (or on behalf of) Mr. Rosenstein with Berkshire rather than relying upon testimony at the hearing which sought, in hindsight, to define Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s intentions. In its Response, Berkshire concurs with this approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">I base my conclusion on three factors. First, I, find as a matter of law that the March 20 Statement form itself is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ambiguous as to be meaningless and unlawfully deceptive in this particular context. The form requests from the insured information about <em>\u201cpartial </em>disability,\u201d a term neither defined nor apparently used <em>anywhere </em>in the policies at issue. In other words, despite being asked by Berkshire to state whether he was \u201cpartially disabled,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein was not provided coverage by Berkshire for \u201cpartial disability\u201d under any of the three policies. Consequently, Berkshire would not provide any benefits to Mr. Rosenstein for being \u201cpartially\u201d disabled. Additionally, and as shall be discussed later, \u201ctotal\u201d rather than \u201cpartial\u201d disability is required even to obtain benefits for \u201cresidual disability\u201d/\u201d Also, I note that Berkshire, in its July 14, 1997 written response to Mr. Rosenstein for a determination, uses only the term \u201cresidual disability\u201d but appropriately does not mention \u201cpartial disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">Second, the ALJ improperly did not consider the entire document. It is true that the March 20 Statement contains a box filled in by Mr. Rosenstein which, under the heading \u201cPeriod of Disability,\u201d states, in pre-printed matter, that \u201cI was totally disabled ... From\u201d and that Mr. Rosenstein filled in the dates \u201cMid 1996 to Present.\u201d It is also true that Mr. Rosenstein did not check the box that stated \u201cI was totally disabled ... From[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">In that same \u201cPeriod Of Disability\u201d box, however, Mr. Rosenstein typed in \u201cNone\u201d in response to the pre-printed question, \u201cIf you have <em>not </em>returned in <em>any capacity </em>to the business listed in Section 1, list here the name and address of any other business where you have performed any duties/\u201d] In a word, Mr. Rosenstein had stated that he was \u201ctotally\u201d rather than \u201cpartially\u201d disabled. Additionally, Mr. Rosenstein had listed all three Policy numbers at the top of the March 20 Statement. If Mr. Rosenstein had intended to file a claim only for residual disability benefits, he would have only referenced the policy number for the 1980 Policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">Third and finally, this finding can only be based on substantial evidence when it is considered along with the \u201cAttending Physician Statement\u201d prepared by Dr. Diener <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>on the same date as the March 20 Application and received by Berkshire within a few days thereafter. As the ALJ found, \u201cDr. Diener reported that Mr. Rosenstein has been partially <em>and </em>totally disabled since December 1996.\u201d Accordingly, and at a minimum, when it received the March 20 Statement and Dr. Diener\u2019s March 20, 1997 \u201cAttending Physician Statement,\u201d Berkshire was on notice that Mr. Bosenstein had filed a claim for benefits based on \u201ctotal disability\u201d under all three (8) Policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">[Emphasis in original; citations to the record omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The Commissioner specifically declined to rely on testimony given at the hearing because the testimony attempted \u201cin hindsight, to define Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s intentions,\u201d which eliminated the need for the credibility assessments the ALJ seemed to have engaged in with respect to Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s conversations with various Berkshire representatives. Rather, the Commissioner looked only to the claim forms filed on March 20, 1997. As the Commissioner pointed out, the claim form listed all three policies. Although none of these policies covered partial disability, Berkshire sent forms covering both total and partial disability without, apparently, sending a cover letter explaining policy coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">It is true that Mr. Rosenstein filled the form out claiming \u201cpartial disability,\u201d but, at the same time, he indicated that he had not returned to work since mid 1996. Moreover, Dr. Diener indicated on the Attending Physician\u2019s Statement that Mr. Rosenstein was \u201ctotally and partially disabled\u201d beginning on March 20, 1997, when he filled in the claim form.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">In addition to the foregoing factors noted by the Commissioner, the ALJ stated that Mr. Rosenstein filed an application for \u201cresidual (partial) disability payments.\u201d Equating \u201cpartial\u201d disability payments with \u201cresidual\u201d disability payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>was, in light of the policies, incorrect. Pursuant to the terms of the 1980 Policy, the only policy covering residual disability, residual disability payments are made after a period of total disability, again defined as a failure to engage in one\u2019s own occupation, has ended. Of course, Mr. Rosenstein filed a claim under all three policies, none of which provides coverage for \u201cpartial disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We conclude that the Commissioner applied the proper standard of review in this instance. He provided ample reasons why the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were unsupported by \u201clegally appropriate, relevant, and ample\u201d evidence. In conducting our own review pursuant to the substantial evidence test, we believe that a reasonable person could, after reviewing the record, easily agree with the Commissioner that Mr. Rosenstein had filed an application for \u201ctotal disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\n<em>b. Conclusion of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The next problem the Commissioner found, which flows from the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Rosenstein filed a claim for partial disability that was then pending from March 1997, through October 1997 was that it misconstrued the law. Specifically, the Commissioner found that the ALJ failed to consider the following factors in determining whether Berkshire acted arbitrarily and capriciously: (1) liberal construction of whether an insured is disabled under the \u201cown occupation\u201d policies at issue in this case, (2) the requirement that Berkshire act in good faith, and (3) the estoppel created by Berkshire\u2019s payment of residual disability benefits under the 1980 Policy despite the language in the policy that required total disability prior to a finding of residual disability. We discuss each of these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\n<em>i. Disability and \u201cOwn Occupation\u201d Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">With respect to the first of the ALJ\u2019s errors, the Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">In Maryland, whether an insured is disabled is construed liberally. To qualify for benefits under \u201cown occupation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>disability insurance policies, such as those at issue here, the insured\u2019s disability \u201cneed only be such as to render him unable to perform the substantial and material acts of his own occupation in the usual or customary way.\u201d <em>Mass. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Rief, </em>227 Md. 324, 328 [, 176 A.2d 777] (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">All three of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s policies contain the language indicative of \u201cown occupation\u201d disability insurance policies. <em>See Rief, </em>227 Md. at 326, 176 A.2d 777 (\u201ctotal disability\u201d defined as \u201cinability to engage in any part of the duties of the Insured\u2019s regular occupation\u201d). <em>See also Radkowsky v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>196 Ariz. 110, 112, 993 P.2d 1074 (1999) (where the insured\u2019s policies provided that \u201cthe insured be unable to perform the substantial and material duties of his \u2018Regular Occupation\u2019 or \u2018your occupation!,]\u2019 \u201d which is defined as \u2018 \u201cyour occupation at the time Total Disability begins\u2019 \u201d or \u2018 \u201cthe occupation ... in which you are regularly engaged at the time you become disabled.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co. v. Adelberg, </em>698 So.2d 828, 829-30 (Fla. 1997) (where policy stated that \u201c!t]otal disability means your inability to engage in your occupation,\u201d but did not define \u201cyour occupation,\u201d the language was held to have \u201cthe meaning that an average buyer of an insurance policy would give to the term.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">As the Commissioner stated, for an insured to collect under an \u201cown occupation\u201d policy, his disability \u201cneed only be such as to render him unable to perform the substantial and material acts of his own occupation in the usual or customary way.\u201d <em>Rief </em>227 Md. at 328, 176 A.2d 777. This is a more nairow standard than disability to engage in \u201cany occupation.\u201d As we are required to do, we defer to the Commissioner\u2019s expertise and the importance of these issues in determining whether an insurance company has acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Consequently, we affirm his decision that the ALJ erred in not taking the more narrow standard into consideration when assessing whether Berkshire acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\n<em>ii. Good Faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Commissioner had the following to say concerning the requirement of insurance companies to act in good faith while reviewing claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">Also, as with all types of contracts, under Maryland law, a condition implied by insurance contracts is that an insurer must \u201cact in good faith when investigating ... or settling claims.\u201d <em>Port East Transfer, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 376, 382, 624 A.2d 520 (1993). As well, good faith \u201crequires of an insurance company frank and open dealings with the assured[.]\u201d <em>President &amp; Dir\u2019s, of the Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Floss, </em>67 Md. 403, 10 A. 139, 143 (1887); <em>Empire State Ins. Co. v. Guerriero, </em>193 Md. 506, 519, 69 A.2d 259 (1949). Because it is \u201cdifficult to state precisely how an insurer must weigh each piece of information concerning how an accident occurred,\u201d the Commissioner has not established minimum requirements for a \u201cgood faith investigation.\u201d <em>Gabler, supra. </em>Nonetheless, pursuant to \u00a7 27-303(2), the Commissioner has held as a matter of law that, in its investigation, <em>\u201can insurer may not arbitrarily or capriciously discard or ignore particular \u201cinformation\u201d favorable to the insured when making a claim determination.\u201d Gabler, supra, </em>(italics in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">In the instant case, I find that Berkshire arbitrarily and capriciously refused to pay Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim for total disability because Berkshire had no lawful principle upon which to base its determination. Additionally, Berkshire either unlawfully ignored \u201call\u201d of the evidence or unlawfully failed to obtain material evidence as a consequence of Berkshire\u2019s failure to investigate Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">It is agreed that, in February 1997, Mr. Rosenstein requested, and Berkshire timely provided, claims forms for the three Policies at issue. Berkshire instructed Mr. Ro-senstein to wait until after his disability had extended beyond the two month waiting period before having his physician complete the \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement.\u201d Since Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s last working day was January 10, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>did not file Ms claim until March 20, 1997, a few more days than was required by the waiting period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">Since that date, Berkshire was on notice to investigate in good faith the nature of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim and to respond \u201cfrankly and openly\u201d to Mr. Rosenstein. Both Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s March 20 Statement and the \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement\u201d referenced \u201ctotal\u201d as well as \u201cpartial\u201d disability. In fact, Dr. Diener\u2019s March 20, 1997 Statement stated that Mr. Rosenstein was \u201ccontinuously totally disabled (unable to work)\u201d from \u201c12/96 through on going.\u201d Especially because Berkshire contended at the hearing that no one can be \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and \u201cpartially disabled\u201d at the same time, Berkshire could not have properly handled this claim if it did not acknowledge, and then investigate, the exact nature and parameters of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Again, we defer to the Commissioner\u2019s expertise in this area, and we affirm his decision that the ALJ erred by failing to consider whether Berkshire acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Hi. Payment of Residual Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Finally, the Commissioner noted that, by paying Mr. Rosen-stein under the residual disability clause of the 1980 Policy without qualification, Berkshire effectively admitted that Mr. Rosenstein was or had been totally disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">Indeed, Berkshire is estopped from denying that it considered Mr. Rosenstein as suffering from a \u201ctotal disability.\u201d On behalf of Berkshire, Mr. Yeager testified unequivocally that, as of July 14, 1997, Berkshire paid \u201cresidual disability benefits\u201d to Mr. Rosenstein with coverage commencing February 15, 1997. Under the terms of the 1980 Policy, Berkshire agreed to pay a residual monthly indemnity if <em>\u201call </em>of these [eight] conditions are met: (1) you [the insured] enter a period of such disability right after the end of a <em>period of total disability; </em>(2) the residual and the total disability <em>both </em>resulted from <em>the same cause </em>or a related cause; [and] (3) the <em>total disability </em>was continuous for the qualification period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Berkshire\u2019s testimony to the contrary makes no sense and, thus, lacks any credibility. Mr. Yeager testified that \u201cit was Berkshire Life\u2019s position that Mr. Rosenstein was <em>never totally disabled </em>[and] that he never established loss of income.\u201d Yet, Berkshire found Mr. Rosenstein eligible for \u201c$3,000\u201d of residual disability benefits because Berkshire \u201cliberally interpreted the [residual disability] rider in order to <em>maximize </em>any benefit that we could make available to Mr. Rosenstein.\u201d Although Mr. Yeager denied that this was a \u201cfavor,\u201d he agreed that it was done \u201cas an <em>exception </em>in order to try to be responsive to Mr. Rosenstein.\u201d Because the policy language makes no provision for such an \u201cexception,\u201d to find that Berkshire paid benefits to Mr. Rosenstein without his having been totally disabled would be tantamount to finding that Berkshire violated its fiduciary duties to its stockholders by paying claims that need not be paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">I also note that, although the MIA will usually abstain from a dispute arising out of conflicting conclusions from licensed medical providers as to whether a complainant is disabled, in this case, all three medical providers who provided reports <em>agreed </em>that Mr. Rosenstein is totally disabled. In other words, there is <em>no </em>medical provider \u2014 and has <em>never </em>been <em>any medical provider to date </em>\u2014 who has formally concluded that Mr. Rosenstein is <em>not </em>\u201ctotally disabled.\u201d Given the evidence before Berkshire and given the Policies\u2019 language, the only logical and sound finding is that Berkshire concluded that Mr. Rosenstein was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as the term was meant within the Policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">Thus, because <em>Berkshire </em>did find Mr. Rosenstein to be totally disabled (as least from February 15, 1997), the remaining question is, by July 1997, whether Berkshire had a lawful basis for concluding that Mr. Rosenstein, although previously totally disabled, had improved by April 1997 such that he could resume some but not all of his \u201cown\u201d work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">I conclude that Berkshire had no proper basis for concluding that Mr. Rosenstein had a residual capacity to work at his \u201cown\u201d occupation. First and foremost, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>terms of the 1980 Policy, by payment of residual disability benefits to Mr. Rosenstein, Berkshire had concluded that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s \u201ctotal disability was continuous for the qualification period\u201d for residual disability. Thus, although Berkshire itself had concluded that Mr. Rosenstein could not work at all from February 15, 1997 through April 15, 1997, Berkshire has adduced no evidence to show why Mr. Rosenstein could work part-time at his \u201cown occupation\u201d thereafter. In other words, there is no medical or rehabilitative evidence of residual (rather than total) disability limitations placed upon Mr. Rosenstein. In fact, as noted above, the medical reports submitted during this period\u2014 and all of the medical reports submitted thereafter in Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s \u201csupplemental\u201d claim \u2014 concluded that Mr. Ro-senstein was totally disabled and \u201cunable to work.\u201d As well, there is no evidence that Berkshire ever <em>analyzed, </em>in any objective or understandable manner, the tax returns and other financial data provided by Mr. Rosenstein on two occasions during April 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">In short, Berkshire has provided only two reasons for treating Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim as one of \u201cresidual\u201d rather than \u201ctotal\u201d disability. The first reason is that Berkshire allegedly relied on its interpretation of the March 20 Statement that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim was <em>only </em>for \u201cpartial\u201d disability. Based on the amended findings of fact and the explanation therefor provided earlier in this Order, I have concluded that Berkshire had no proper or lawful basis for its interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Berkshire\u2019s only other reason for paying Mr. Rosenstein \u201cresidual\u201d rather than \u201ctotal\u201d disability benefits is comments purportedly made to Berkshire by Mr. Rosenstein. For the reasons stated below, I find that this reason was also arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">There are, essentially, two dates at which these statements were made. In one instance, on April 3, 1997, Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s statements were noted in a Berkshire claims log, memorializing a telephone conversation. The contents of that claims log note were summarized by the ALJ in Finding of Fact No. 13. For the reasons noted earlier, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>have accepted as a fact what is noted by the ALJ. I believe, however, that it is important to look at exactly what Berkshire memorialized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">Even in these notes, Berkshire was clearly put on notice that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s business had \u201cgone down\u201d (at least partly) due to \u201chis condition.\u201d Berkshire was also expressly informed that, as of April 1997, Mr. Rosenstein had not worked <em>at all </em>for almost the past three months. In this context, then, it would be unclear whether Mr. Rosenstein meant that he either would take \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cmedium\u201d size <em>cases </em>\u2014 if <em>he could </em>\u2014 or if he could take such cases and was in fact actively seeking work. Support for the former construction is provided by Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s testimony that he was brought up on the admirable basis that \u201cyou worked., as long as you could stand up and breathe.\u201d In similar circumstances involving disability claims investigations, other courts have noted that is improper for an insurer to rely \u201con a casual statement [by the insured] that he was only partially disabled without making appropriate inquiries to determine his real condition.\u201d <em>Ingalls v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Group, </em>561 N.W.2d 273, 283-84 (N.D.Sup.Ct.1997); <em>see also Brown v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>209 Kan. 632, 498 P.2d 26, 33 (1972) (where the court held that the \u201ccircumstances made known to [the insurer] by Dr. Kaufman\u2019s report were of themselves such as to require more than a simple armchair perusal of the report; we believe they required a good-faith effort to secure additional medical information ... rather than passive inaction.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">The other statement as to residual capacity to work purportedly occurred during the meeting of May 14, 1997 between Bruce Hodsoll, Berkshire\u2019s then Vice-President for Claims Management and Mr. Rosenstein at his home. <em>See Amended Finding of Fact No. 14. </em>From Mr. Hodsoll\u2019s own Memorandum to this file, however, it is clear that Mr. Rosenstein made a demand for payment for \u201ctotal disability\u201d benefits under all three policies. As well, and although Mr. Hodsoll believed that Mr. Rosenstein would be unable to prove a loss of income directly related to his alleged disability, Mr. Hodsoll expressly noted that it was Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Rosenstein\u2019s position <em>\u201cthat his lack of business was due to his disability.\u201d </em>While Mr. Hodsoll stated that he believed that Berkshire had no liability for <em>either </em>\u201ctotal\u201d or \u201cresidual\u201d liability benefits, and that Berkshire\u2019s liability \u201cWould be limited to the terms of the contract to [only $3,000],\u201d Mr. Hodsoll nevertheless made a $36,000 settlement offer to Mr. Rosenstein for the surrender of all three (3) Policies. Interestingly, this $36,000 figure represents one year of the cumulative \u201ctotal disability\u201d benefits for all three (3) policies and far exceeds Berkshire\u2019s potential liability under the single 1980 Policy which provided residual disability coverage. Moreover, when Mr. Rosenstein rejected this offer, Mr. Hodsoll agreed to see if there \u201cwas any way in which [Berkshire] might increase its offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We note that the Commissioner appears to base this opinion, in part, on credibility by stating: \u201cBerkshire\u2019s testimony to the contrary makes no sense and, thus, lacks any credibility.\u201d The Commissioner specifically stated that \u201cso long as 4credibility\u2019 is synonymous with witness <em>demeanor, </em>and the oral testimony of witnesses is conflicting about a fact to be found, the Commissioner will give special deference to the ALJ\u2019s finding about a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The witnesses did not conflict on this point, and, indeed, the ALJ made no credibility findings at all concerning Berkshire\u2019s witnesses. The problem the Commissioner had with the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions was the ALJ\u2019s failure to address the dichotomy between the language of the policies and Berkshire\u2019s actions, i.e., the issue of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Commissioner cited case law in support of the proposition that Berkshire was obligated to inquire into the exact nature of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s disability claim. Again, as we have stated above, we defer to the Commissioner\u2019s expertise and affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">c. <em>Ex Post Facto Imposition of Duty Not Imposed by Existing Rules, Regulations, or Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">Berkshire next contends that \u201cthe Final Order re-casts Berkshire Life\u2019s conduct as a violation of a duty imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>law.\u201d Berkshire cites the Commissioner\u2019s remarks that Berkshire did not conduct an independent medical review of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s case as well as the following sentence from the Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">There is also an additional basis for concluding that it was improper for Berkshire to rely on these statements made by Mr. Rosenstein. Because different claims may present different circumstances, we hesitate to prescribe in detail the components for all requisite claim investigation undertaken in good faith. I will hold here, however, that <em>when the primary basis of an insurer\u2019s denial in a first-party claim is based on the alleged statements of an insured made to his or her insurer, then the insurer cannot in good faith rely on those statements until and unless they have been communicated in writing to the insured for verification or emendation. </em>To illustrate, Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s statements here were, by Berkshire\u2019s own admission, material to its decision to treat this claim as one for residual disability rather than for total disability. Yet, not until July 14, 1997 \u2014 and only after Mr. Rosenstein had written a complaint letter to Berkshire\u2019s President and, as well, only after the MIA had requested from Berkshire \u201ca full report on this matter\u201d \u2014 did Berkshire put in writing its position to Mr. Rosenstein. Promptly upon being notified, Mr. Rosen-stein disagreed with Berkshire\u2019s interpretation of his remarks and Mr. Rosenstein has consistently maintained that he was and remains unable to work even \u201csmall and medium\u201d size, local cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">[Italics in original; other emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">As Berkshire points out, there are no provisions in the Insurance Code, the case law, or the regulations that require insurers to obtain medical opinions or forbids them from basing decisions on interviews with the insured prior to granting or denying an insured\u2019s claim for disability. At first blush, the Commissioner\u2019s statement appears to require Berkshire to adhere to a standard of behavior not required by law and which could not have been foreseen. Further review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, however, demonstrates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Commissioner did not \u201cpromulgate\u201d a new rule but instead based his conclusion on the facts of this particular case only. He did so because of Berkshire\u2019s own actions in investigating this claim, including the confusion generated by the claim form, and questions raised as to whether Berkshire was reviewing the claim in good faith. In short, the Commissioner held that, under the circumstances of this particular case and with all the information that it had, Berkshire\u2019s reliance solely on an interview with Mr. Rosenstein in denying his disability claim pursuant to an \u201cown occupation\u201d policy was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The Commissioner essentially found that Berkshire acted arbitrarily and capriciously in relying only on Mr. Hodsoll\u2019s interview with Mr. Rosenstein in denying the claim. This case involves a judgment on the ability of the insured to engage in his own occupation, which is, as the record demonstrated, dependent on cognitive functioning on a high level. Such disability claims are doubtless quite difficult to assess, and we simply remark that Berkshire, confronted with the medical reports submitted by Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s physicians, probably could have saved itself and those involved much time and expense by obtaining an independent medical review of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Even in the absence of an independent medical review, Berkshire has not disputed the reports of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s medical doctors, either at the administrative hearing or on appeal, except to allege their inadequacy to prove disability. Moreover, Berkshire did little during the claim evaluation process to question the medical bases for Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim. Instead, Berkshire claims that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s abilities speak for themselves and that he does not appear to be impaired in any way. Berkshire focuses in particular on Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s testimony on the day of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s performance on one day, or even two days, if we take his conversation with Mr. Hodsoll into account, is hardly sufficient for anyone to definitively conclude that he is not disabled, particularly with respect to his \u201cown occupation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The record is replete with letters from Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s doctors that he is and has been totally disabled. In addition, our review of the record of the hearing uncovered occasions where Mr. Rosenstein was repetitive or appeared to have problems remembering. In any event, the fact that he is very familiar with his policies and testified, on the whole, with little problem does not mean he is capable of engaging in his \u201cown occupation.\u201d This case appears to be far less complicated than the factual and financial transactions that he has traditionally investigated for fraud and other forms of wrongdoing. Consequently, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>2. The ALJ\u2019s Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Berkshire next argues that the Commissioner erred by failing to adopt the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision to remand the case to Berkshire \u201cfor a determination of [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] eligibility for total disability benefits\u201d for the period July 1997 through July 1998. Again, it is the Commissioner\u2019s decision that we review, and he provided the following reasons for rejecting the ALJ\u2019s recommended remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">I reject the ALJ\u2019s recommendation that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim be remanded to Berkshire for it to make a \u201cmedical determination\u201d of whether Mr. Rosenstein was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d as is meant under the terms of the three disability insurance policies at issue. As was discussed previously, <em>Berkshire </em>already made that determination: (a) by paying to Mr. Rosenstein residual disability benefits, for which a finding of \u201ctotal disability\u201d was a condition precedent; and, (b) because <em>all </em>medical evidence in the file to date has supported, and continues to support, a finding of \u201ctotal disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">In its Response, Berkshire critiques the quality of the medical evidence submitted by Mr. Rosenstein. For example, Berkshire contends that Dr. Diener did not support his conclusion of \u201ctotal disability\u201d with \u201cobjective, medically quantifiable symptoms.\u201d Berkshire states that there was \u201cnothing remarkable in [Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s] Woodwork,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>that Dr. Hyman had not \u201cconducted any neuropsychological testing necessary to medically quantify Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s subjective assertions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">Berkshire misses the point. Neither the ALJ nor I have rendered an opinion on the \u201cquality\u201d of the medical evidence. Had Berkshire wanted to challenge Mr. Rosen-stein\u2019s medical evidence, <em>Berkshire </em>could and should have done so. Berkshire, however, failed to do so at all, failed to do so in any timely manner and failed to do so before rendering a determination as to whether Mr. Rosenstein was \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d Moreover, Berkshire could have but failed to have this claim reviewed by Berkshire\u2019s Medical Director. I add that, other than retaining a psychologist such as Dr. Cohen who works solely for insurers, Berkshire has <em>never </em>entered into <em>any </em>contract with medical doctors to review and help adjudicate disability claims. Moreover, according to Mr. Yeager, in his ten years working for the Berkshire Claims Department, he cannot recall even three (3) times where Berkshire has \u201cever gone out to get ... medical expertise to assist in reviewing a claim\u201d(!) Thus, it is unlikely that, but for the MIA\u2019S intervention, Berkshire had any intention of securing an independent medical examination for Mr. Rosenstein or of obtaining a medical review of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s medical records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">Overall, Berkshire\u2019s actions here represent what may be termed as \u201cartful neglect.\u201d Berkshire gives the <em>appearance </em>of investigating a claim in order to render a good faith claims determination. As part of this appearance, Berkshire timely requests financial information from its insured and then timely requests more information from its insured. In direct contrast to this \u201cappearance,\u201d however, Berkshire does not <em>analyze </em>the information at all, much less <em>use an analysis </em>in a cogent and rational way to support a proper claims determination. Similarly, as part of this appearance, Berkshire timely obtains medical information. Although Dr. Diener, an internist, stated in his Attending Physician\u2019s Statement that he had diagnosed \u201cpolyarthritis,\u201d Berkshire did not have this information reviewed by a physician. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Diener subsequently confirmed his diagnosis. After Dr. Hyman provided diagnoses of \u201cmajor depression, hypertension, esophagitis, inflammatory arthritis, hypercholesterole-mia and hiatal hernia,\u201d Berkshire sends the report to be reviewed only by a psychologist (Lori Cohen, Ph.D.) rather than to a psychiatrist or other type of medical practitioner. To her credit, Dr. Cohen\u2019s reports indicate that she did review the pertinent medical records involved. Not surprisingly, however, since a psychologist is generally not competent to render a determination in medical areas, Dr. Cohen makes no conclusions or recommendations but simply asks for ... more information. Finally, but not without import, throughout the entire claim process, Berkshire generally has responded in writing to Mr. Rosenstein only after he has written to Berkshire or to an agency of the government. [Emphasis in original; citations to the record and footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">MIA was the only party who entered medical records into evidence, and all of those medical records contained diagnoses and opinions that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled. Berkshire argues that \u201cthe medical records do not clearly and irrefutably evince that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled.\u201d Even if this is true, \u201cclearly and irrefutably\u201d was not the burden of proof in this case. <em>See Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>136 Md.App. 419, 446, 766 A.2d 169 (2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Commissioner explained that a claimant in a case for unfair claim settlement practices, which in this case was MIA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>has a higher burden than simply a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">We first define the applicable standard which the ALJ failed to state or discuss. Berkshire is charged with refusing to pay Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim for total disability benefits \u201cfor an arbitrary and capricious reason based on all available information.\u201d Ins. Art. \u00a7 27-303(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">The Commissioner has previously construed \u00a7 27-303(2) as requiring a licensee insurer to show that it refused to pay the claim at issue based on: (1) an otherwise lawful principle or standard which the insurer applies across the board to all claimants; and (2) reasonable consideration of \u201call available information.\u201d <em>Gabler v. American Manufacturers, </em>\u201cOrder of Remand\u201d at 6-7, MIA No: 60-7/97 (March 11, 1998). As the Commissioner explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">At the outset, I note that all claimants proceeding under Ins. Art. 27-303(2) (formerly Ins.Code \u00a7 230A(c)(2)) shoulder a heavier burden than what they would labor under in a civil lawsuit. In a civil lawsuit, whether the plaintiff be a first-party claimant alleging breach of contract or a third-party claimant suing the insured for negligence, the plaintiff need only prove her case by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">In contrast, under Ins. Art. \u00a7 27-304, a claimant must prove that the insurer acted based on \u201carbitrary and capricious reasons.\u201d The word \u201carbitrary\u201d means a denial subject to individual judgment or discretion, Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary 121 (1984) and made without adequate determination of principle. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 55 (Abridged 5th Ed.1983). The word \u201ccapricious\u201d is used to describe a refusal to pay a claim based on an unpredictable whim. Webster\u2019s at 227. Thus, under Ins. Art. \u00a7 27-303, an insurer may properly deny a claim if the insurer has an otherwise lawful principle or standard which it applies across the board to all claimants and pursuant to which the insurer has acted reasonably or rationally based on \u201call available information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Although the language used by the Commissioner in the quoted text suggests that he required the claimant to carry a higher burden of proof than a mere preponderance, we do not believe that is the case. We interpret the language of the quoted opinion as acknowledging that it is more difficult to prove that an insurer acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d than that it acted negligently. The claimant must still prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the insurer acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In this case, the fact remains that, particularly from the period of November 1997 through July 1998, MIA, the claimant in this case, provided uncontested medical evidence from three different doctors that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled. Consequently, we agree with the Commissioner that MIA met its burden of proof to show that Mr. Rosenstein was totally disabled, and that Berkshire refused to pay Mr. Rosen-stein\u2019s claim \u201cfor an arbitrary and capricious reason based on all available evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">With respect to the ALJ\u2019s remedy, we agree with the Commissioner that \u201c[i]n recommending that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s claim be remanded to Berkshire for additional \u2018investigation,\u2019 the ALJ was acting beyond her statutory authority.\u201d Ins. \u00a7 27-305 clearly delineates the available remedies for a violation of Ins. \u00a7 27-303, and a remand to the insurance company for further investigation is not listed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">(a) For violation of \u00a7 27-303. \u2014 The Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $2,500 for each violation of \u00a7\u00a7 27-303 of this subtitle or a regulation adopted under \u00a7\u00a7 27-303 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">(c) Restitution. \u2014 (1) On finding a violation of this subtitle, the Commissioner may require an insurer or nonprofit health service plan to make restitution to each claimant who has suffered actual economic damage because of the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(2) Restitution may not exceed the amount of actual economic damage sustained, subject to the limits of any applicable policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Ins. \u00a7 27-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The scope of appellate review is narrow. To quote the circuit court: \u201cAs I said at the outset, I might not have done what the Commissioner did or the Administrative Judge did in the fashion that they did it if I were the person listening to the case. However, that\u2019s not the standard under which I am to review this matter.\u201d We agree and affirm the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">.

We note that the Commissioner\u2019s explanation of the standard of review is similar to the substantial evidence test as set forth above. The Commissioner suggested he would be reviewing the facts through the lens of an insurance expert, which would actually make the standard of review somewhat stricter, since <em>Marzullo </em>requires review from the point of view of the \u201creasonable person.\u2019\u2019 In addition, the Commissioner explicitly stated that he would be reviewing the ALJ's findings in the context of the entire record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">.
