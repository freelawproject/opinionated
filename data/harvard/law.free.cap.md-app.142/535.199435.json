In appealing that conviction, appellant presents a single question for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">Did the trial court err in precluding appellant from calling an expert witness to testify that appellant\u2019s conduct before and after her arrest was consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">We hold that, because it admitted evidence offered by the State detailing appellant\u2019s post-arrest behavior, the trial court abused its discretion in excluding appellant\u2019s expert testimony attributing that behavior to a psychological condition, rather than alcohol. There was no error, however, in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the expert\u2019s testimony seeking to explain appellant\u2019s pre-arrest conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">The facts are largely undisputed. On the evening of July 17, 1999, at around 11:30 p.m., Officer Chad Zirk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Howard County Police Department was on patrol in the Columbia section of Howard County. While waiting at a red light at the intersection of Little Patuxent Parkway and Cedar Lane, the officer observed a red GMC truck heading eastbound on the Parkway. He testified that \u201cafter waiting through a green light [the driver] proceeded through the intersection; when the light was yellow, [she] ... pulled up beside the police cruiser, stopped and asked [him] for directions.\u201d Appellant was the driver. Zirk explained that when she asked him for directions, \u201cher speech seemed to be slurred.\u201d The officer asked appellant to follow him to the nearby hospital parking lot, and appellant complied with his request. In the parking lot, Zirk approached appellant\u2019s vehicle, and observed that appellant\u2019s \u201ceyes were watery, glassy and bloodshot\u201d and that \u201cshe had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on her breath.\u201d When the officer asked what kind of drinks she had consumed, appellant told him she \u201chad some Vodka earlier [in the] day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Officer Zirk then performed field sobriety tests on appellant, including NYSTAGMAS,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for which there are a \u201ctotal of three clues for each [eye].\u201d These \u201cclues\u201d are indicators of intoxication. Zirk observed \u201csix out of six clues\u201d in appellant, meaning that he observed an eye twitch in each of the three movement patterns of the pen on each of two eyes. On cross-examination, Zirk admitted that there were \u201cabout thirty ... reasons for NYSTAGMAS, other than alcohol in the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Officer Zirk also gave appellant a walk and turn test, during which he \u201cask[ed] [appellant] to stand on ... [an] imaginary line, ... placing the right foot in front of the left foot, touching heel to toe. We ask them to stand in this position with their hands down to their side while we explain and demonstrate the rest of the test for them ... to them.\u201d Zirk testified that the walk and turn test has eight clues: losing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>one\u2019s balance during instructions, starting the test before instructions are finished, stopping while walking, failing to touch heel to toe, stepping off the line, using one\u2019s arms for balance, improper turning, and taking the incorrect number of steps. Out of these eight clues, appellant exhibited six.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The third test administered to appellant was the one-leg stand. In this test, ,the subject raises one foot \u201capproximately six inches off the ground, point[s][her] toe level with the pavement, hands down [her side], ... [and] eount[s] out loud ... for a period of thirty seconds.\u201d Officer Zirk testified that appellant got to a count of eight, and then told him that her ankles were \u201cbad.\u201d He testified that appellant said nothing of her injury prior to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">After concluding the three field sobriety tests, Officer Zirk placed appellant under arrest for driving while intoxicated (\u201cDWI\u201d). He then searched her truck, discovering a \u201cfull bottle of whiskey\u201d in the vehicle. Zirk next transported appellant to the police station for processing. He testified that during booking, appellant \u201cwas very loud and obnoxious[,] ... yelling at booking officers and she was very uncooperative[.]\u201d Officer Zirk then went back on duty, but was called back to the station later that night because \u201cappellant had tied her bra around her neck and [the officers] had to transport her to the hospital.\u201d The State rested its case on the testimony of Officer Zirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Appellant called Scott Murchison, her roommate and boyfriend of \u201cfive, six years,\u201d to testify regarding appellant\u2019s bad ankle. Appellant also took the stand in her own defense. She testified that she was currently under psychiatric treatment, and that she sought such treatment because she had \u201clifetime major depression, and ... most prominent, ... post-traumatic stress syndrome.\u201d Appellant related that, although she had taken medication for these afflictions in the past,, at the time of her arrest she \u201cwas feeling better\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t having any of the anxiety and panic attacks like [she] used to have on a very frequent basis,\u201d so she had stopped her medications. According to appellant, at about eight-thirty on the night in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>she was called by a friend, who asked her to pick him up at \u201ca place called \u2018Timbuktu\u2019 ... in Dorsey, Maryland\u201d because he had had \u201cquite a bit to drink.\u201d She was wearing a \u201cMuMu-kind of dress .... and flip-flops. [The flip-flops were] not anything that you\u2019d go out walking or playing in, or anything.\u201d Her account of the night\u2019s events, for the most part, mirrored Officer Zirk\u2019s. Appellant stated that she had consumed a glass of vodka and iced tea at \u201cno later ... than one-thirty in the afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellant testified that when the officer asked her to take the field sobriety tests, she became \u201cvery panicky\u201d because she got nervous around \u201cstrange men.\u201d When asked to describe her reaction, appellant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHa\">you get real lightheaded and, even though you don\u2019t shake on the outside, your insides shake a whole lot, and you get kind of short of breath, and \u2014 you know I didn\u2019t want to show that I was afraid or anything because, in my personal experience, people ... don\u2019t know how to take somebody who suffers panic disorders, so I just kept smiling and laughing and saying, you know, \u201cOh, sure, I\u2019ll do this, I\u2019ll do that,\u201d but I was really scared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Appellant recounted that during the field sobriety tests, because she was \u201capprehensive\u201d about the police officers, she \u201cwas spending more time looking around th[a]n ... really ... listening.\u201d She testified that it was difficult for her to perform the heel-to-toe test because \u201cin those flip-flops, that are a little bit too big for you, if you touch heel-to-toe, you\u2019re going to step on your own toes.... So, ... I just walked regular.\u201d Appellant also said that she informed the officer of her ankle problem prior to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Appellant planned to call Dr. Leonard Hertzberg to testify as an expert psychiatrist. The State, however, filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the doctor\u2019s testimony. In proffering what Dr. Hertzberg would testify, appellant\u2019s attorney explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Dr. Hertzberg examined [appellant] on two occasions, he consulted her records, he read the police report, he dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>cussed with [appellant] certain materials that she provided with regard to her past history. .He concluded from his evaluation of her that she did have certain disorders, psychiatric disorders[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">He would testify that she has certain disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and borderline personality disorders; that these disorders would cause her, in a stressful situation, to react in a certain way, and ... that the pressure of being stopped by the officers, the pressure of her situation at the time, would cause her to react in a certain way, and that this behavior is in keeping with someone who manifests these psychiatric disorders. So, ... I would liken his testimony to an expert testifying that someone was unable to perform the one-leg stand because he had an injured ankle, or that he had problems walking, heel-to-toe, because of balance problems, so that the reason for Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony is that her disorders made her react in certain ways to the events that were happening to her on that occasion. That would be the nature of his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The State\u2019s motion was granted by the court, so Dr. Hertz-berg did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Appellant was convicted by the jury of driving under the influence, and acquitted of driving while intoxicated. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in excluding the expert testimony of Dr. Hertzberg, a psychiatrist, who examined appellant after the incident in question. Appellant proffered that Dr. Hertzberg would testify that appellant, who suffered from PTSD, may have had a panic attack when Officer Zirk began to investigate her for driving while intoxicated. Because she was not allowed to call her psychiatric expert to testify as to how her PTSD may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>influenced her behavior both before and after her arrest, appellant asserts that her case was prejudiced, warranting reversal of her DUI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In ruling Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s expert testimony inadmissible, the trial court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">The expert testimony of Dr. Hertzberg will not take place for several reasons. First of all, because this is a general-intent crime, her psychiatric nature at the time of the arrest and at the time of the alleged [crime] is <em>not </em>an issue. It is a proper issue, perhaps, for mitigation; particularly, because the Defendant is pleading \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and there is no NCR plea offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Now, also I believe to have allowed the doctor to testify, it would be confusing to the Jury, because it does not go to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocen[ce].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Later in the trial, the court offered a third reason for its decision to exclude the doctor\u2019s testimony, stating that \u201cbasically the information [in Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s report] talks about the examination after the date in question, so it doesn\u2019t change my ruling on the initial [m]otion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Md. Rule 5-702, governing the use of expert testimony, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\u201cThe admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ground for reversal.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 659, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Despite its broad discretion, a trial court\u2019s \u201cdecision to admit or reject [expert testimony] is reviewable on appeal and may be reversed if it is founded on an error of law or if the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Cook v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 122, 138, 578 A.2d 283 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 276 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Appellant cites <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988), in support of her argument that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony. In <em>Simmons, </em>the defendant was on trial for second degree murder. Asserting a defense of imperfect self-defense, Simmons sought to have an expert psychiatrist testify to his subjective belief that self-defense was necessary to avoid imminent bodily harm. The defense attorney first proffered that the expert would testify that Simmons did <em>in fact </em>have such a belief at the time of the killing. Second, the defense attorney proffered that the expert would testify \u201cthat Simmons\u2019s asserted subjective belief would be consistent with his psychiatric profile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 542 A.2d 1258. The trial judge excluded all of the expert\u2019s testimony, ruling that the function of the jury would be \u201cusurped\u201d if the expert were allowed to testify. We affirmed. The Court of Appeals granted certiorari, and reversed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">[T]he trial judge excluded the proposed testimony on the grounds that the jury\u2019s function would be usurped if the jury were to hear the psychiatrist testify that in her opinion Simmons acted under an honest belief that self-defense was necessary when he killed the victim. In light of defense counsel\u2019s proffer that the expert would only testify that such a subjective belief would be consistent with Simmons\u2019s psychological profile we find the trial judge\u2019s ruling too broad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 542 A.2d 1258. The Court also recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ado\">[t]he criminal defendant is generally permitted to introduce any evidence relevant to the asserted defense. This will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>evidence which tends to establish or disprove a material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 41, 542 A.2d 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Simmons </em>established two categories of psychiatric expert testimony, one which is inadmissible as a matter of law, and one which is admissible at the discretion of the trial court. The first category of testimony, under which the expert testifies that the defendant was <em>in fact </em>suffering from a specific psychiatric disorder on the date in question, is inadmissible as a matter of law because it usurps the jury\u2019s function and because a psychiatrist \u201ccannot precisely reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 542 A.2d 1258. In the trial court\u2019s discretion, however, an expert may testify as to a defendant\u2019s psychiatric profile, from which the jury might <em>infer </em>that the defendant was suffering from the symptoms of that psychiatric disorder on the date in question. \u201c[T]he proffered [expert] testimony has some relevance in that consistency between the specific subjective belief testified to by [the defendant] and [the defendant\u2019s] psychological profile tends to make it more likely that [the defendant] in fact held that subjective belief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Appellant incorrectly characterizes <em>Simmons </em>as holding that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding expert testimony of defendant\u2019s psychiatric profile. Rather, the Court of Appeals in <em>Simmons </em>explicitly held that the trial court made an error of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">Here the [trial] judge did not purport to exclude the evidence by the exercise of discretion so that no issue of discretion is before us. The judge erroneously ruled, as a matter of law, that the evidence could not, under any circumstances, be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\n<em>Id,.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The State asserts that appellant\u2019s case falls squarely within <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 611 A.2d 581 (1992), a case in which the Court of Appeals held that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding expert testimony. In <em>Hart-less, </em>a defendant on trial for murder sought to introduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>testimony of a psychiatric expert. This expert would have testified that, in his opinion, the defendant did not intend to murder the victim, but instead \u201cpanicked\u201d when the robbery he was engaging in did not go as planned. The trial court excluded this testimony, following <em>Simmons, </em>because it concerned the defendant\u2019s <em>actual </em>intent at the time of the offense. In light of this ruling, the defense proffered that the expert could testify regarding the defendant\u2019s psychological profile. The trial court also disallowed this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected appellant\u2019s argument that <em>Simmons </em>compelled the admission of such \u201cpsychological profile\u201d expert testimony, distinguishing <em>Simmons </em>on grounds that in <em>Simmons, </em>the Court held that the trial court \u201cerred in concluding that psychological profile testimony was not admissible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 611 A.2d 581. In <em>Hartless, </em>such psychological profile testimony was ruled inadmissible when, in exercising its broad discretion, the trial court concluded that the expert testimony as to the defendant\u2019s psychological profile \u201clacked an adequate factual basis and ... bore no relevance to a material, issue in the case.\u201d Id. at 575, 611 A.2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The court\u2019s ruling in this case is distinguishable from Simmons on the same basis. Here, the trial court determined that Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony was inadmissible essentially because it was not relevant to any issue in the ease in that it did not go to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence due to the fact that DWI is a general intent crime. Thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling reflected the use of its discretion in admitting or excluding expert testimony and we must review it on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">' To analyze whether the trial court abused its discretion, we will examine individually each of the trial court\u2019s stated reasons for excluding Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Relevance Of Appellant\u2019s Psychiatric Condition</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The trial court\u2019s first and second stated reasons for excluding Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony were essentially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>same \u2014 that evidence of appellant\u2019s psychiatric nature was irrelevant to a general intent crime such as DWI/DUI.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in basing its ruling on relevance because it denied appellant an opportunity to explain away some of her behavior prior to and after her arrest. Appellant acknowledges that DUI is a general intent crime,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but asserts that here, testimony that appellant was suffering from PTSD at the time of her arrest was aimed at impeding the State\u2019s ability to prove the \u201cintoxication\u201d element of the crime, not the mental state element.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The State urges us to affirm appellant\u2019s conviction, asserting that since drunk driving crimes are general intent crimes, \u201cwhether or not [appellant] was suffering from [PTSD], or some specific intent, at the time she was driving [is] irrelevant .... to the question before the [jury] of whether the statute was in fact violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We agree with appellant that expert testimony establishing that a defendant suffered from PTSD could be used to mount a defense to DWI or DUI where such evidence seeks to explain away objective observations leading to a jury inference of intoxication. While PTSD would not be a defense to the mental state element of such a general intent crime, in certain cases it could be used to counter a jury inference of intoxication based on evidence of the accused\u2019s demeanor prior to and after her arrest. <em>See Gombar v. Pennsylvania, </em>678 A.2d 843, 846 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1996), <em>appeal denied, Pennsylvania v. Jacobs, </em>549 Pa. 705, 700 A.2d 443 (1997)(defendant whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>driver\u2019s license was suspended for failure to take breath test permitted to call expert to testify that she suffered PTSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The crimes of driving while intoxicated and driving under the influence are defined in Maryland Code (1977, 1999 Repl. Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), section 21-902 of the Transportation Article. Both crimes involve two elements, and differ only in the level of the driver\u2019s impairment due to the consumption of alcohol. The jury in this case was instructed as to the elements of the crime charged using Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 4:10, which lists the following elements necessary to convict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">(1) that the defendant drove, operated, moved or was in actual physical control of a vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">(2) at that time, that the defendant was either intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">A person is under the influence of alcohol when the alcohol that [she] has consumed has impaired normal coordination .... Another way of saying this is that the person\u2019s abilities have been reduced or weakened by the consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Although a person is \u201cintoxicated per se\u201d if evidence is presented that his or her blood-alcohol level was above .10 at the time of his or her arrest, intoxication can also be proven by other evidence from which the jury could infer that a defendant was intoxicated, such as evidence of a defendant\u2019s demeanor at the time of the stop. <em>See Brooks v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 123, 128-29, 395 A.2d 1224 (1979). Here, since no blood alcohol content or other chemical test results were admitted, the jury was being asked by the State to infer from other evidence, including demeanor evidence, that appellant was intoxicated. The State\u2019s evidence of intoxication arose solely from the results of the field sobriety tests, the arresting officer\u2019s observations of appellant before and after her arrest, appellant\u2019s admission that she had consumed one glass of vodka earlier that afternoon, and the discovery of a full bottle of whiskey in appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>We believe that the trial court misunderstood the way in which appellant sought to use Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony. As explained by appellant\u2019s attorney in his proffer of Dr. Hertz-berg\u2019s proposed testimony, the doctor\u2019s testimony was aimed at persuading the jury that appellant was suffering from the effects of a PTSD-induced panic attack, rather than the effects of alcohol, at the time of her arrest and afterwards at the police station. Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony was intended to impede the State\u2019s ability to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the \u201cact\u201d element of intoxication, not the mental state element of the crime. While evidence that a defendant is suffering from certain psychiatric disorders is often used to rebut the State\u2019s evidence as to mental state, here it was not sought to be used in that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s report stated the following, under the heading \u201cSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">During the course of being arrested and placed in a cell, Ms. White became increasingly anxious and panic stricken. She had been physically abused during a 3-4 year period during the late 1980\u2019s by her third husband. The incarceration in the cell which included being placed in leg-irons reactivated fears relating to having been physically and sexually abused by her third husband. Ms. White became distraught emotionally and began screaming and yelling for medical assistance for her emotional distress as well as vaginal bleeding.... The level of distress resulted in an attempt to strangle herself with a bra and at that point medical attention was forthcoming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In the report, the doctor diagnosed appellant with several psychiatric disorders, including PTSD.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">As a consequence, Ms. White has developed intense fear, helplessness, and horror. She has become increasingly phobic and avoidant during the past decade....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">Ms. White has experienced significant identity disturbance as well as impulsivity which has included substance abuse as well as numerous suicidal behaviors____[DJuring periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>extreme stress, Ms. White has experienced psychotic symptoms of a paranoid nature....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">[I]n light of the severity of psychiatric diagnoses ... Ms. White had been experiencing significant emotional symptoms at the time of the alleged [crime] and these diagnoses played an integral role in how. she responded to the police officers <em>prior to being arrested </em>as well as her severe reaction <em>while incarcerated. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Thus, the report speaks to appellant\u2019s behavior during two distinct time periods \u2014 before her arrest and after her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">As demonstrated by the representative excerpts above, however, the report does not explain how appellant\u2019s PTSD could have interfered with her inability to do the field tests, nor was a proffer made to that effect. Thus, Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s behavior during that pre-arrest time period was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The report does, however, extensively explain how appellant\u2019s post-arrest treatment at the police <em>station </em>\u2014 i.e., being handcuffed and placed in a locked cell \u2014 could have brought on a PTSD-induced panic attack by acting as a \u201ctrigger\u201d of her post-arrest behavior. At trial, the prosecution was permitted to introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s post-arrest behavior to encourage a jury inference that appellant was intoxicated <em>before </em>her arrest. Because this evidence was admitted, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony seeking to explain away that post-arrest behavior as something unrelated to the effects of alcohol. Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s post-arrest behavior should have been admitted to rebut the State\u2019s evidence of her post-arrest conduct. By excluding this evidence, the trial court effectively denied appellant the opportunity to put on a full defense on a critical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The Timing Of The Doctor\u2019s Examination Of Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">Finally, the trial court justified its exclusion of Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony on the ground that \u201cthe information [in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>his report] talk[ed] about the examination [of appellant] after the date in question[.]\u201d Appellant argues that such forensic examinations are commonplace, and points us to <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 368 A.2d 1005 (1977), in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In <em>Beahm, </em>the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">[A] physician, who examines a patient, not for the purpose of treatment, but in order to qualify as an expert witness, may present his medical conclusions and the information, including the history and subjective symptoms, received from the patient which provide the basis for the conclusions. The conclusions are admissible as substantive evidence. The statements made by the patient, as narrated by the physician, are admissible, with a qualifying charge to the jury, only as an explanation of the basis of the physician\u2019s conclusions and not as proof of the truth of those statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 327, 368 A.2d 1005. In light of <em>Beahm, </em>we agree with appellant that the exclusion of Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony on the ground that his examination of appellant occurred after the incident in question constituted error on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The State posits that the trial court actually excluded the testimony because most of the information in the doctor\u2019s report explained her conduct <em>after </em>the arrest, not before. It was appellant\u2019s behavior <em>before </em>her arrest, the State asserts, that is relevant here. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, however, we do not infer such a meaning. In addition, as we discussed above, the State cannot be heard to complain that the doctor\u2019s report spoke only to appellant\u2019s post-arrest conduct when the State offered evidence of this post-arrest conduct to encourage a jury inference of pre-arrest intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The State offered, and the trial court admitted, evidence of appellant\u2019s post-arrest behavior at the police station to encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>age a jury inference that appellant was intoxicated at the time of her arrest. Dr. Hertzberg\u2019s testimony, as demonstrated by the conclusions in his report, would have explained how appellant\u2019s \u201cincarceration in the cell which included being placed in leg irons [could have] reactivated fears relating to having been physically and sexually abused by her [former] husband.\u201d The trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony, aimed at rebutting the State\u2019s evidence of intoxication, constituted an abuse of its discretion. Exclusion of the testimony because the expert examined appellant <em>after </em>her arrest was also in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.

Although the trial court framed its second reason for exclusion in terms of \"jury confusion,\u201d it is evident that the trial court believed the evidence would be confusing to the jury <em>because </em>the court did not believe the evidence to be relevant to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. Thus, this second reason was based on relevance grounds, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.
