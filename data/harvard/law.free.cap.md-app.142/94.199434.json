The conflicting evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to establish that he committed each of those offenses. Appellant argues, however, that he was unfairly prejudiced by a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and presents a single question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">I. Did the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in violating the rule of <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>[42G U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) 1 so infect appellant\u2019s trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In the early morning hours of September 23, 1998, at 4513 Shamrock Avenue in Baltimore City, appellant shot Omar Ford after Ford punched him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Candace Baxter, who witnessed the shooting, gave testimony that was consistent with the testimony of Mr. Ford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also testified that, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>shooting, she and appellant became romantically involved, and that appellant told her that he was going to testify that he was not in possession of a gun when Ford punched him. About five days after the shooting, Baxter gave a written statement to appellant\u2019s counsel in which she stated that appellant was not in possession of a gun on the occasion at issue. Baxter testified that she gave this statement because she both liked appellant and was scared of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Appellant testified to the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was with Candace Baxter when Mr. Ford confronted the two of them, and asked Baxter \u201cwhat the fuck was going on.\u201d Appellant tried to leave, but Baxter appeared to be afraid and appellant feared for her safety. Ford asked appellant if he liked Baxter, and appellant replied yes. Ford then struck appellant on the left side of his face with enough force to knock appellant to his knees. While he was struggling with Ford, he heard a gunshot and stumbled into a shed in the back yard. The gunshot was fired by Ford. Appellant did not have a gun with him when this incident occurred. After he stumbled into the shed, appellant noticed that the gun was on the ground. Appellant grabbed the gun and, out of fear that Ford was going to harm Baxter, fired one shot in Ford\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The following transpired at this point in appellant\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>MR.

GARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-15\">MR. RUBIN: And what did you do when you got home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">MR. GARNER: I told my mother that I was shot and that I needed to go to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">MR. RUBIN: You thought that you were shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-17\">MR. GARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-18\">MR. RUBIN: And were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-19\">MR. GARNER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-20\">MR.

RUBIN: The very next day after this incident occurred, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">MR. GARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">The following transpired at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s cross-examination:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-15\">THE STATE: Did you ever tell the police where the gun was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">MR. RUBIN: Objection. I move to approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">(Counsel approached the bench and the following ensued.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">MR. RUBIN: I move for a mistrial on the basis of Depuis [sic] v. State. She has absolutely no business asking this defendant whether he ever told the police anything ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-19\">THE STATE: Then I\u2019ll withdraw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-20\">MR. RUBIN: It\u2019s too late. It\u2019s out of the bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-21\">THE COURT: (inaudible) tell me why (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-22\">MR. RUBIN: Your honor she cannot cross examine any defendant about what he did or did not tell the police. Because the defendant in a police setting has an absolute right not to say anything and if he testifies at trial, the State cannot bring up (inaudible) didn\u2019t talk to the police ____It\u2019s absolutely textbook law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-23\">THE STATE: I\u2019ll withdraw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-24\">MR. RUBIN: She can\u2019t withdraw it, it\u2019s out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-25\">THE STATE: He doesn\u2019t have to answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>MR. RUBIN: No it\u2019s not a question (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">THE COURT: (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">MR. RUBIN: Your Honor (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">THE COURT: You made a motion (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(Counsel returned to trial tables and the following ensued.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">THE COURT: Objection motion denied. Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">THE STATE: Thank you Your Honor. I withdraw the question. May I have a moment Your Honor Please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">THE STATE: Thank you. Your Honor I don\u2019t have any further questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">At this point, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed his motion and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">MR. RUBIN: Your honor I think, I think (inaudible) defendant exercises his right to remain silent which he has every right to do. But the State has no business questioning about that. Even if he elects to testify at trial, the fact that he didn\u2019t give a statement to the police is not for the jury to consider. I say that because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s curable. If he had given a statement such as \u201ca\u201d testifying as to \u201cb\u201d that\u2019s one thing but that was meant for only one purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">THE COURT: Excuse me. Answer this question. The question [the prosecutor] asked was \u201cdid you tell the police where you threw the gun\u201d and the defendant never answers. Now tell me why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">MR. RUBIN: The defendant didn\u2019t answer because I objected. But the point is, the question alone number one suggests that the answer is no. I think that\u2019s suggestive by the tone of the question number one. And number two Ms. Driggins knows very well this gentlemen never gave a statement. I mean she has the inherent knowledge knowing whether a defendant gave a statement or not and to put that in the minds of the jury is wrong. Duprey [sic] says it\u2019s wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>THE STATE: Your Honor I will (inaudible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">MR. RUBIN: Well this jury is going under the impression that he either gave no statement at all or he gave a statement different than his testimony. That was elicited by the prosecutor. It had nothing to do with anything I brought up____It puts in front of the jury the [sic] that this defendant either exercised a right to remain silent or gave a statement contrary to what his testimony was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion and the jury ultimately convicted appellant of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and unlawful possession of a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Two of the circuit court\u2019s rulings are before us: (1) the refusal to grant appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial, and (2) the overruling of appellant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s final question. We need not reach the issue of whether the circuit court abused its \"discretion in denying the motion for mistrial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because we are persuaded that it erred in overruling the objection to the question, \u201cDid you ever tell the police ... ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued to the circuit court that the question at issue was improper under <em>Dupree v. State, </em>352 Md. 314, 722 A.2d 52 (1998), and has argued to us that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>question was improper under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, swpra. </em>Those cases, however, involve \u201cpost-arrest, post <em>-Miranda\u201d </em>silence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the defendants, after being arrested for selling marijuana, received their <em>Miranda </em>warnings and chose to remain silent. 426 U.S. at 611-12, 96 S.Ct. at 2242. During their trials, they testified that they had not sold marijuana, but had been \u201cframed.\u201d 426 U.S. at 612-13, 96 S.Ct. at 2242. To impeach the defendants, the prosecutors asked them why they had not relayed this version of events at the time of their arrest. <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 613, 96 S.Ct. at 2243. The United States Supreme Court held that the prosecution may not impeach a defendant with his <em>post-Mira,nda </em>silence because those warnings carry an implicit \u201cassurance that silence will cany no penalty.\u201d 426 U.S. at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In <em>Dupree v. State, </em>352 Md. 314, 722 A.2d 52 (1998), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s use for impeachment purposes of a criminal defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest, after the defendant has been advised of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights, is a violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s, U.S. Const, amend. XIV, guarantee of due process.\u201d 352 Md. at 324, 722 A.2d at 57 (citing <em>Doyle v. Ohio, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2245). The <em>Dupree </em>Court held that such evidence is irrelevant, explaining that \u201c[o]nce the State put before the jury the fact that Dupree had been advised of his rights yet offered no evidence of a subsequent statement by Dupree, the inference of Dupree\u2019s silence, and thus his guilt, lay dangling for the jury to grab hold.\u201d 352 Md. at 333, 722 A.2d at 61. Thus, while proof that the defendant received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is a necessary foundation for the admission of any statement made after the warning, if no statement had been made, the trial court must exclude evidence that the defendant received the warnings. 352 Md. at 332, 722 A.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Although \u201cpost-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>\u201d cases do not control the issue before us, \u201cwe have no difficulty discerning the precise nature of the appellant\u2019s contention.\u201d <em>Sherman v. State, </em>288 Md. 636, 640, 421 A.2d 80, 82 (1980). There is an important distinction between (1) the specific ground of objection (relevancy, unfair prejudice, etc.) and (2) the points and authorities argued in support of the objection. The issue of whether the circuit court erred in overruling a timely objection to the \u201cDid you ever tell the police ... ?\u201d question has been preserved for our review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In <em>Wills v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 669, 573 A.2d 80 (1990), this Court held that the defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence constitutes improper impeachment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">[Ejvidence of an accused\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning, silence for impeachment is inadmissible because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>probative value, if any, of such evidence, is clearly outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">In view of the potential for unfair prejudice to the defendant and the likelihood that an arrestee\u2019s silence is motivated by a reason other than consciousness of guilt, we hold that it is error for the court to admit evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning, silence for impeachment purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">82 Md.App. at 677-78, 573 A.2d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 784 A.2d 1102 (2001), the Court of Appeals noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">through reliance on State evidentiary law, the Court of Special Appeals has provided greater protection for a defendant\u2019s silence than the Supreme Court by asserting that an accused\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning, silence is inadmissible for impeachment because the probative value, if any, of such evidence, is clearly outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. <em>See Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 718 A.2d 211, 220 (1998)(noting that while this Court has not had occasion to address the issue of whether post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning, silence is admissible for impeachment purposes, the Court of Special Appeals has reviewed this issue and held that post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning silence is too ambiguous to be admissible, even as impeachment evidence)(e.g. <em>Key-El v. State, </em>349 Md. 811, 818, 709 A.2d 1305, 1308 (1998)(ex-plaining that Maryland courts have distinguished between post-arrest and pre-arrest silence); <em>Wills v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 669, 674, 573 A.2d 80, 83 (1990), finding error when evidence of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence was admitted for impeachment purposes because the potential for prejudice outweighed the probative value). The Supreme Court concluded that the use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence to impeach did not offend federal due process guarantees; however, the Court commented that states are free to determine, as a matter of state constitutional law or rules of evidence, whether to preclude the admission of this evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>see Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 607, 102 S.Ct. 1309, 1312, 71 L.Ed.2d 490, 494 (1982), which is precisely the action the Court of Special Appeals determined was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1107, n. 8-11, 784 A.2d 1102. Thus, it is of no consequence that the record is silent as to whether appellant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings after he turned himself in. The circuit court erred in overruling the question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Moreover, when law enforcement officers know that a defendant has retained counsel before turning himself or herself in to face criminal charges, they cannot conduct an interrogation without the presence of that attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">As it has been interpreted by the courts, the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits, absent a waiver, the admission of a statement by a criminal defendant when the statement is made (1) outside the presence of legal counsel; (2) in response to interrogation by the State; and (3) after the right to counsel has attached 'with respect to the charge being tried. <em>See generally Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980); <em>Massiah v.

State, </em>354 Md. 132, 192, 729 A.2d 910, 942 (1999). <em>See also Bruno v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 501, 508, 613 A.2d 440, 444 (1992)(quoting <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 176, 106 S.Ct 477, 487, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)) (\u201c \u2018[T]he Sixth Amendment is violated when the State obtains incriminating statements by knowingly circumventing the accused\u2019s right to have counsel present in a confrontation between the accused and a state agent.\u2019 \u201d); <em>People v. Bertolo, </em>65 N.Y.2d 111, 116, 490 N.Y.S.2d 475, 480 N.E.2d 61, 65 (1985)(\u201cwhere the police know that a suspect is represented by counsel on pending charges, or where the police know that charges are pending but fail to make inquiry which would disclose that counsel has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>assigned or retained, any custodial questioning of the suspect by them in counsel\u2019s absence is barred.\u201d); <em>People v.

Thus, the police had no right to question him without obtaining an appropriate waiver of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The record also shows that appellant had not made any statement to a police officer before he turned himself in. Under these circumstances, asking appellant whether he had ever told the police what he had done with the gun clearly exploited his post-arrest silence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The State argues that, because appellant never answered the improper question, the jury was not presented with any evidence of post<em>-Miranda </em>silence. There is no merit in that argument.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Questions alone can impeach. Apart from their mere wording, through voice inflections and other mannerisms of the examiner-things that can not be discerned from the printed record \u2014 they can insinuate; they can suggest; they can accuse; they can create an aura in the courtroom that the trial judge can sense but about which we could not speculate. The most persistent denials, even from articulate adult witnesses, may not suffice to overcome the suspicion they can engender....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\"><em>Elmer v. State, </em>353 Md. 1, 15, 724 A.2d 625, 632 (1999)(quoting <em>Craig v.

Because the circuit court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to that improper question, appellant is entitled to a new trial unless we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that this error was harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">An error is not harmless unless, upon an independent review of the record, a reviewing court is able to declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). The prejudice to a defendant resulting from reference to his silence is often substantial. As the Fifth Circuit observed, \u201cwe would be naive if we failed to recognize that most laymen view an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as a badge of guilt.\u201d <em>Walker v. United States, </em>404 F.2d 900, 903 (5th Cir.1968). Silence at the time of arrest \u201chas a significant potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v.

Mr. Ford testified as follows: He had been dating Candace Baxter for about eight months prior to September 23, 1998, and he telephoned Ms. Baxter around 1:00 a.m. on that date. When no one answered the phone, he decided to walk to Baxter\u2019s home, knocked on the front door, but got no answer. At this point, he walked around back, where he observed Baxter in the company of appellant, whom he had never seen before. He asked whether they were \"messing\u201d with each other. Appellant replied \u201cyes\u201d, while Baxter replied \"no.\u201d He then punched appellant in the face, and the two of them began fighting. While he and appellant were wrestling, he heard a gunshot and saw that appellant had a gun. Ford denied that he was in possession of a gun when he punched appellant. He then ran into Baxter\u2019s house. While fleeing, he heard another gunshot, and was wounded in his lower back. Upon entering Baxter's house, he went to a bedroom, where Baxter's mother told him to lay down while she called an ambulance and the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">. She testified as follows. On September 23, 1998, she resided at 4513 Shamrock Avenue and that Omar Ford was her boyfriend. Shortly after 2:00 a.m. on that date, she received a phone call from appellant, and she invited him to her home. When appellant arrived, the two went to the back of the house and began to \u201ctalk.\u201d At this point, Omar Ford showed up and asked appellant if he liked her. When appellant indicated that he did, Ford punched him in the face. At this point, Ford and appellant began to wrestle. Appellant then pulled out a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and shot Ford. She was running towards her home when she heard a second shot. Baxter never saw Ford with a gun during the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. According to appellant, Baxter telephoned him early on the morning of September 22, 1998, and asked him to come to her house. Appellant went to Baxter\u2019s house, where the two had sex. Appellant then went to work, got off of work between 9 and 9:30 p.m., and went home. Baxter telephoned appellant at approximately 11:00 p.m., after which she came to his house. The two of them went to a friend\u2019s house to watch a movie. At about 1:45 a.m., appellant and Baxter left the friend's house, with appellant going to his home, and Baxter going to hers. Upon arriving home, appellant telephoned Baxter, who told him to come quietly back to her house, so as not to wake up her mother. After going back to her house, appellant and Baxter went to the rear of the residence, where they stayed outside, hugging and kissing. At some point, Ford walked up to where they were.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">.

In <em>Grier v.

Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624 n. 37, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). As a constitutional matter, allowing such evidence \"would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245. As an evidentiary matter, such evidence is also inadmissible. <em>Younie </em>v. <em>State, </em>272 Md. 233, 244, 322 A.2d 211, 217 (1974); <em>Miller v.

Thus, a defendant\u2019s silence at that point carries little or no probative value, and a significant potential for prejudice. <em>United States v.

It is of no consequence that appellant's counsel did not \"move to strike\u201d the improper question and/or request that the circuit court deliver a curative instruction. Error occurred when the circuit court overruled the timely objection to the improper question.
