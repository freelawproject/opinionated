The answer of the defendants alleged that one Lesieur, the owner of a certain lot, and \u201cVirginia Morin, owner of an island in the cove,\u201d were interested in the subject matter of the suit and should be joined as parties defendant. Lesieur might be a proper party, but enough does not appear in this record to show that he is an indispensable party in the sense that no final decree granting relief to the plaintiff can be entered without adversely affecting him. See <em>Dietz </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>287 Mass. 398. The situation, however, is entirely different as to Virginia Morin, for it appears from the master\u2019s report that there was testimony indicating that, before the filing of the bill of complaint, she had acquired an interest in the lot, the ownership of which was involved in the third ground upon which the plaintiff sought relief, and it would seem that the controversy as to the ownership of this lot, which was not an island but was attached to the upland, was really between the plaintiff and her. It may be that the description of her lot as an island in the defendants\u2019 answer led the plaintiff to believe that it was not located in the locus claimed by the plaintiff and that consequently it took no steps to join her as a defendant. The master made no finding relative to her rights in the lot, probably because she was not a party to the suit. A decision on that question is necessary in order that the final decree may be complete and settle the conflicting claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of all parties in the parcel of land which is one of the subject matters of the suit. The rights of Virginia Morin ought not to be decided without affording her an opportunity to appear and to be heard. The defendants do not represent her, and she ought not to be required to depend upon any defence which they might make. The final decree is reversed and the suit is remanded to the Superior Court for the purpose of joining her as a party defendant and for further hearing upon her alleged ownership of the lot in question. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>120 Mass. 524, 529-530. <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Shimmin, </em>122 Mass. 406. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>201 Mass. 214. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>247 Mass. 522. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>280 Mass. 101, 106. <em>Bayer </em>&amp; <em>Mingolla Construction Co.
