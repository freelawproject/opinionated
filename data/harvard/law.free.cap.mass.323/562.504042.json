L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1, seeks a declaration that the Metropolitan Transit Authority by contract has assumed, and is obligated to pay, the plaintiff\u2019s Federal income tax on a \"capital gain\u201d realized by the plaintiff from the sale to the authority of \"its whole assets, property and franchises as a going concern.\u201d The defendants, who are the authority and its five trustees, in their answer seek by way of counterclaim a declaration that the authority has not so assumed, and is not obligated to pay, certain bills of the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers and of the chairman of its board of directors for services in relation to that sale. The case was heard on the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts. The judge found the facts to be as agreed, and reserved and reported the case, without determination, for the consideration of this court. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The plaintiff is a street railway corporation incorporated under St. 1894, c. 548, and until noon on August 29, 1947, it owned a rapid transit system in metropolitan Boston. That system it managed and operated until June 30, 1918. On July 1, 1918, by virtue of its acceptance of Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, the management and operation devolved upon a board of trustees (hereinafter called the public trustees) appointed by the Governor. The amendment of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>statute by St. 1931, c. 333, was also accepted by the plaintiff, and the public trustees continued the management and operation until noon on August 29, 1947.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">The contract of which interpretation is sought is contained in Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, as amended and extended by St. 1931, c. 333, known as the public control act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The act originally provided: \u201cThe acceptance of this act by the Boston Elevated Railway Company shall constitute an agreement upon its part to sell to the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof at any time during the period of public management and operation its whole assets, property and franchises as a going concern upon the assumption by the commonwealth of all its outstanding indebtedness and liabilities and the payment of an amount in cash equal to the amount paid in in cash by its stockholders for stock then outstanding\u201d (Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 16). In the amendment the language respecting the option and the assumption of indebtedness and liabilities is preserved in substantially identical form, but a change was made in the amount of the cash payment. After amendment the act reads: \u201cThe acceptance of this act by the company shall constitute ... an agreement by the company to sell to the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof . . . at any time during the period of public management and operation, its whole assets, property and franchises as a going concern upon the assumption by the commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>or such political subdivision of all its outstanding indebtedness and liabilities, and the payment of an amount in cash equal to any amount paid in in cash for stock hereafter issued and also an amount in cash equal to one hundred and five dollars per share for all common stock at present issued and then still outstanding decreased by one half of any sums hereafter assessed under the provisions of said chapter one hundred and fifty-nine or of this act upon cities and towns served by the company which have not then been repaid to the commonwealth provided however that such decrease shall not reduce the amount payable on account of said common stock below the amount of eighty-five dollars per share\u201d (St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17). Under both of the foregoing sections a sale under the option was to effect a dissolution of the company subject to the general statutory provisions relative to the dissolution of corporations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The authority is \u201ca body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of the commonwealth\u201d created by St. 1947, c. 544, \u00a7 1, which became effective June 19, 1947. Its five trustees are appointed by the Governor (\u00a72). The authority was \u201cauthorized and directed to exercise the option\u201d set forth in St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17, and the trustees were \u201cauthorized and directed\u201d in the name of the authority to notify the plaintiff \u201cthat the authority elects as of a day and time to be specified in .said notice,\u201d but not later than August 30, 1947, \u201cto exercise such option\u201d (\u00a75). Section 5 further provided: \u201cUpon the date and the time specified in such notice to the company, the whole assets, property and franchises of the company as a going concern shall, without further conveyance and by virtue of this act, be and become vested in the authority; and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the <em>then </em>outstanding indebtedness and liabilities of the company shall, without further action and by virtue of this act, be assumed by the authority in accordance with the provisions of said section seventeen. In accordance with the provisions of said section seventeen, there shall thereupon and forthwith <em>thereafter </em>be paid to the company an amount in cash equal to eighty-five dollars per share for all the common stock of the company issued and outstanding\u201d (emphasis supplied). Upon such cash payment, \"all claims of every kind and nature against said authority by the company are by virtue of this act released, and thereafter no suit shall be brought against the authority by the company\u201d (\u00a76).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">By reason of \u00a7 6 and of the italicized words in \u00a7 5, we are told in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, the present suit was brought on July 2, 1947, to enjoin the authority and its trustees from giving notice of the election to exercise the option and from tendering the cash payment, and, in the alternative, for the declaration mentioned at the opening of this opinion. On July 8 a prayer for preliminary injunction was denied after hearing. On the same day the defendant trustees gave notice in writing of the authority\u2019s election to exercise the option \"as of\u201d August 29, 1947, at noon. On August 21 an interlocutory decree, entered by consent, declared that the option had been effectively and validly exercised by the authority as provided in \u00a7 17 of the public control act \u201cwithout modification\u201d by St. 1947, c. 544, and that \"upon the payment and acceptance of the cash purchase price provided in said \u00a7 17, being an amount equal to $85 per share for all the common stock\u201d of the company issued and outstanding as specified in c. 544, \u00a7 5, the authority \"will have assumed and become liable to pay all the outstanding indebtedness and liabilities\u201d of the company as provided in \u00a7 17 \u201cwithout modification\u201d by c. 544. The interlocutory decree further declared that, \"upon the assumption of indebtedness and liabilities\u201d by the authority, the suit should proceed to a final determination of the questions relating to the Federal \"capital gain\u201d tax raised by the prayer for a declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>On August 25 the company\u2019s board of directors voted to accept from the authority the sum of $20,297,490 as the cash payment required by the option. On August 27 the board of directors \u201crequested the public trustees to accrue immediately on the books of the company as a liability the sum of $6,362,870.75 as the estimated Federal income tax to result from the sale of the company\u2019s property to the authority.\u201d This amount was a tentative figure agreed upon by the company and the commissioner of internal revenue to be \u201cset aside out of the cash purchase price, when paid, pending the final determination and assessment of the correct tax in order to avoid a threatened jeopardy assessment.\u201d On August 28 \u201cthe public trustees declined this request on the ground that the tax could not accrue until the sale was consummated and that the liability was not one to be assumed by the authority.\u201d On August 29, 1947, the authority paid, and the company accepted, $20,297,490 as the cash purchase price. On March 15, 1948, the company filed an income tax return for the calendar year 1947 showing a tax of $6,177,796.50 wholly due to the \u201ccapital gain resulting from sale of company August 29, 1947.\u201d See U. S. C. (1946 ed.) Title 26, \u00a7 117 (c) (1), (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">The Commonwealth in making with the company the contract contained in the public control act did not proceed in a sovereign capacity, but put itself in the position of a private citizen. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>237 Mass. 403, 413. <em>Boston Elevated Railway </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>310 Mass. 528, 577. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, </em>312 Mass. 74, 77. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, </em>319 Mass. 642, 653.

The precise question raised by the bill is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>according to the principles for the interpretation of contracts the tax on the \u201ccapital gain\u201d resulting from the sale is embraced within the authority\u2019s assumption of all the company\u2019s \u2018 \u2018 outstanding indebtedness and liabilities. \u201d \u201c Indebtedness\u201d and \u201cliabilities,\u201d like many words in everyday use, are, commonly not of doubtful meaning, and yet their effect will vary according to the subject to which they refer and the circumstances in which they are used.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">Whether \u201cindebtedness\u201d standing alone could here apply to a tax <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> need not be decided because of its use in conjunction with \u201cliabilities.\u201d It is on the latter word that the company relies. \u201cDebt\u201d and \u201cindebtedness\u201d are not synonymous with \u201cliability.\u201d <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>221 Mo.

(N. Y.) 422, 428. \u201cOutstanding indebtedness\u201d has been held to mean \u201cobligations already validly fixed.\u201d <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Arkansas Construction Commission, </em>190 Ark. 775, 780. See <em>Royal </em>v. <em>Sampson County, </em>214 N. C. 259, 261. In <em>Perret </em>v. <em>King, </em>30 La. Ann. 1368, in the purchase of a newspaper the assumption of \u201call the outstanding liabilities\u201d was held not to make the purchaser liable for damages subsequently awarded in a libel suit which was pending at the time of the sale. Both briefs cite <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>343 Mo. 252, 260, where it was said, \u201cA policy, debt, title, liability or the like, is outstanding when it is existing, undischarged and (sometimes) valid. . . . An insurance policy or liability therefore would be outstanding in this State when it is existing and unsatisfied in Missouri.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The scope of the authority\u2019s general undertaking is not to be delineated by isolating words and interpreting them as though they stood alone. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 288. Not only must due weight be accorded to the immediate context, but no part of the contract is to be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The original statute provided that the company should, prior to or at the time of the acceptance of the act, raise $3,000,000 in cash by the issue of preferred stock, $1,000,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to be set aside as a reserve fund, and the balance to be subject to the disposition of the trustees to pay for the cost of additions and improvements (Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 5). The remainder of the act, including the option to purchase (\u00a7 16) quoted above, was to take effect upon its acceptance by the stockholders (\u00a718). The public trustees were authorized to exercise all the rights and powers of the company and its board of directors and, upon behalf of the company, to receive and disburse its income and funds. They were empowered to appoint and remove in their discretion all officers save the board of directors (\u00a7 2). They were required to include in the cost of service certain enumerated items, and dividends at stated rates were to be paid on the common stock and fixed dividends on the preferred (\u00a76). It was a duty of the public trustees to maintain the property \"in goed operating condition and to make such provision for depreciation, obsolescence and rehabilitation, that, upon the expiration of the period of public management and operation, the property shall be in good operating condition\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u00a7 13). Any deficiency of income to meet the cost of service was to be paid from the $1,000,000 reserve fund (\u00a79), and, should that be insufficient, from the treasury of the Commonwealth, in that event to be assessed upon the cities and towns in the area served by the company (\u00a7\u00a7 11, 14). Public management was to continue for ten years (\u00a72) and thereafter until terminated by the Commonwealth (\u00a7 12). The public operation was undertaken by the Commonwealth, \"not as a source of profit, but solely for the general welfare.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>237 Mass. 403, 413. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, </em>312 Mass. 74, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">The main plan of the public control act was retained unaltered in St. 1931, c. 333. In that statute certain changes were made, of which only a few need be mentioned. The period of public management and control was extended to July 1, 1959, and thereafter until terminated by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>monwealth (\u00a71). The rate of dividends on the common stock was reduced from six to five per cent (\u00a7 2). The public trustees were authorized to retire the preferred stock (\u00a74). The provision for change in the cash payment in the event of the exercise of the option (\u00a7 17) has already been quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">We have for guidance the general rule of construction that \u201cwhere ... it is sought to shift the burden of taxatian from the person upon whom it is imposed by statute, the intention of the parties to accomplish that result must clearly appear.\u201d <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp. </em>v. <em>Gale Shoe Manuf. Co. </em>314 Mass. 142, 149. The question has often arisen in this Commonwealth between lessor and lessee. In that relationship it is the \u201cgeneral rule that, where the lease is silent on the subject, the obligation to pay taxes rests upon the lessor. . . . That, however, is not an inflexible principle. It yields to a contrary presumption where overbalancing considerations lead to that result.\u201d <em>Pittsfield &amp; North Adams Railroad </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>260 Mass. 390, 397. For a discussion of many such cases, see <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>310 Mass. 659, where it was said, at page 671, \u201cAn intention to add to the rent in this manner is not lightly to be implied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Here the thing purchased was the company\u2019s \u201cwhole assets, property and franchises as a going concern.\u201d The expression \u201cgoing concern\u201d looms of paramount importance. It makes the continued transaction of ordinary business a fundamental prerequisite. <em>White, Potter &amp; Paige Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Henry B. Pettes Importing Co. </em>30 Fed. 864, 865 (C. C. E. D. Mo. E. D.). <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Burgeson, </em>203 Iowa, 913, 916. <em>Rothery </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>144 Md. 405, 412. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Nebraska State Bank, </em>126 Neb. 168, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">We think that the assumption by the authority was of the \u201coutstanding indebtedness and liabilities\u201d of the company as an operating public transportation system, and consisted of all the liabilities, actual or contingent \u2014 but only those \u2014 which arose during the conduct of the business of that system by the company as a going concern. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>There is involved no elaborate refinement in the definition of \u201coutstanding.\u201d That word, for our purposes, adds-nothing to the connotation of \u201cliabilities\u201d save the precautionary enjoinder, superfluous in the present connection, that the liabilities assumed must be valid, existing, and undischarged at the moment of purchase at noon on August 29, 1947. Once the transaction was closed, the authority owned the transportation system and owed by assumption the liabilities theretofore incurred in its operation, while the company held the cash consideration subject to any tax obligations which its receipt entailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">The \u201ccapital gain\u201d tax was not one of the assumed liabilities, because it was not an incident to the operation by the company of the business of the transportation system, but sprang from and was solely the result of its sale. Until there was a transaction completed by the payment of the cash consideration, there were no taxable gain and no tax liability. <em>Reid Ice Cream Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>59 Fed. (2d) 189, 191 (C. C. A. 2). <em>West Texas Refining &amp; Development Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>68 Fed. (2d) 77, 80 (C. C. A. 10). The \u201cstatute taxes gains from sales, not estimated gains from contracts to sell.\u201d <em>Consolidated Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>84 Fed. (2d) 548, 550 (C. C. A. 5). The notice in writing on July 8 from the trustees to the company, electing to exercise the option \u201cas of\u201d August 29, did not constitute a sale, but created an executory contract to sell. <em>Braintree Water Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Braintree, </em>146 Mass. 482, 486. <em>Cohasset Water Co. </em>v. Cohasset, 321 Mass. 137, 145. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>North Texas Lumber Co. </em>281 U. S. 11, 3. This was not changed by the decree of August 21. Until the payment of the cash consideration on August 29 there still was no more than an executory contract to sell. In the interval possession and title belonged and continued to be in the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sale did not occur until the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of the cash consideration. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Segall, </em>114 Fed. (2d) 706, 709-710 (C. C. A. 6), certiorari denied sub nomine <em>Segall </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>313 U. S. 562. See <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>30 Fed. (2d) 622, 624 (C. C. A. 2); <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>79 Fed. (2d) 14, 15 (C. C. A. 2); <em>Consolidated Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>84 Fed. (2d) 548, 549-550 (C. C. A. 5); <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>98 Fed. (2d) 739, 741 (C. C. A. 7), certiorari denied 305 U. S. 650. That the company\u2019s books were kept, and its tax returns made, on an accrual basis does not affect the result. See <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>North Texas Lumber Co. </em>281 U. S. 11, 13-14. Contrary to the contention of the company, the tax had not technically accrued and was not a liability prior to the assumption of liabilities by the authority. We omit any attempt to undertake a detailed discussion of all the Federal cases cited on the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">On the issue of construction of the contract another consideration carries great weight. \u201cThe general principle has been recognized that \u2018payments made by a third person to discharge an obligation of a taxpayer must be considered as income of the latter if such payments were made in satisfaction of an indebtedness due from such person to the taxpayer.\u2019 <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>304 Mass. 147, 152.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>314 Mass. 375, 378. As a corollary, such a payment of a taxpayer\u2019s Federal income tax is additional income to the taxpayer. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>279 U. S. 716, 729. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>279 U. S. 732. And hence, if a buyer assumes the \u201ccapital gain\u201d tax of the seller, the latter\u2019s taxable gain is commensurately increased. <em>Acme Coal Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>44 Fed. (2d) 95, 100 (Ct. Cl.). See <em>Lash\u2019s Products Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>278 U. S. 175. In the company\u2019s tax return it is stated that all doubtful questions (other than the effect of the assumption by the authority) have been resolved against the taxpayer. Yet in computing the amount of $6,177,796.50, no effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>was given to this principle, which, on the company\u2019s contentions before us, would result in an additional payment by the authority of twenty-five per cent of the tax, or $1,544,449.13. And, theoretically and conceivably, there would be further payments by the authority of what has been described as \u201ca tax upon a tax\u201d ad infinitum, presenting a problem in calculus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, however, <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>279 U. S. 716, 731; <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>286 Mass. 102, 106. Such a result could hardly have been within the contemplation of the parties. It does not seem reasonably to have been intended by the language of their contract. To impose this extraordinary, and perhaps progressive, obligation on the buyer the wording of the agreement should be most explicit, and appropriate phraseology would not have been difficult to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">Our conclusion, which to us seems required by the natural import of the contract, is confirmed by observing the situation forming the background of the legislation comprising the contract. The agreed facts do not contain a concise and explicit statement as to the financial condition of the company and the state of its physical assets on June 30, 1918. It does there appear, however, that the company\u2019s provisions for depreciation had been grossly inadequate. In the preceding six months its operations had shown a deficit of more than half a million dollars. During the period beginning September 30, 1898, and ending June 30, 1918, it had paid dividends on its capital stock in the total amount of $16,433,471, while its net earnings before dividends in the same period were but $16,233,305.32. Its balance sheet and that of the West End Street Railway,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of which it was lessee, are annexed to the statement of agreed facts, and disclose a condition of doubtful financial stability. The stockholders, as this court has said, had \u201can otherwise losing and possibly confiscatory investment.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>231 Mass. 603, 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The company contends that the \"contract must be interpreted in the light of the fact that during the period of public control the Commonwealth and the public trustees had the power to, and by their actions did, fix the amount of the 'gain\u2019 which gave rise to the tax.\u201d It is argued that the \"capital gain\u201d was entirely \"technical\u201d; that the company \"reaped no profit at all\u201d; that it \"sold assets which had cost it $120,000,000 for $106,000,000\u201d; and that the so called \"capital gain\u201d was \u201ca consequence of the operations carried on by the public trustees.\u201d Granting that the public trustees had such power, we do not see how these other considerations, if true, are material to the construction of a contract first entered into in 1918. It seems of no consequence on the issue of interpretation that the public trustees perhaps could have made some other treatment of the matter of depreciation which might have resulted in a smaller tax or even in no tax. It is not questioned that the tax could be lawfully assessed. The right of the public trustees to act as they did is not challenged. It is stated among the agreed facts: \"The allowance charged to cost of service by the public trustees ... for depreciation of property and for obsolescence and losses in respect to property sold, destroyed or abandoned was the amount which the public trustees in the proper exercise of the discretion vested in them . . . deemed necessary and advisable\u201d; and \u201cNo question is raised in this case as to the adequacy or reasonableness of the deductions thus claimed for Federal income tax purposes.\u201d The authority, with much good reason, it seems to us, denies that the assets cost the company $120,000,000, but it would not be profitable, in our opinion, to analyze this subordinate issue in accounting. In the same category are the contentions that during the period of public control the Commonwealth did not reimburse the company for some of the deficits incurred by it, and that the public trustees issued bonds of the company at a discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">Another contention is that the company and its stockholders in accepting the statute of 1931, \u201cwhich included an option to buy <em>all </em>the assets of the company at a stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>lated price per share plus assumption of <em>all </em>liabilities, the company thereby being immediately dissolved,\u201d reasonably must have understood that the stipulated price would be a net figure available for immediate distribution without reduction by the \u201ccapital gain\u201d tax or any other liability except perhaps the nominal expense of making distribution. The argument runs in this fashion. Under the 1918 statute the cash to be paid was to be \u201cequal to the amount paid in in cash by its stockholders for stock then outstanding\u201d (Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 16). This, it is said, fairly meant that the stockholders would get their money back. Under the 1931 statute the cash to be paid w;as to be an amount \u201cequal to any amount paid in in cash for stock hereafter issued and also an amount in cash equal to one hundred and five dollars per share for all common stock at present issued,\u201d subject to decrease by deficits, \u201cprovided however that such decrease shall not reduce the amount payable on account of said common stock\u201d below $85 a share (St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17). This, it is said, in substance meant an amount not less than $85 a share \u201cearmarked for the stockholders as a return of investment,\u201d and there was \u201c set a floor below which it appeared their recovery of investment could not fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUoK\">The cash consideration, as has been noted, was to be paid for the assets of the company, and, moreover, was to be paid to the company and not to the stockholders. An easy way to provide for a net amount to the stockholders would have been for them to sell their stock. It likewise would not have been difficult, where the sale was by the company of its assets, to stipulate that the cash consideration \u201cwas in all events and at every hazard to be a net amount always available without diminution for any cause.\u201d <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Providence Railroad </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>269 Mass. 190, 197. This contention of the company does not convince us that the general rule, which is against shifting the tax burden, is inapplicable. We do not here discover \u201coverbalancing considerations\u201d to which the general rule must yield. The language which the parties saw fit to employ seems to us to show no intent that the cash payment was to be in such added amount as to ensure a net return of $85 on each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>share of stock, and we think it would be a strained construction to hold that it did. See <em>Codman </em>v. <em>American Piano Co. </em>229 Mass. 285, 291; <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Peterborough Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 217, 220-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">Nor are we moved by the provision that a sale under the option \"shall work a dissolution of the company\u201d (St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17, superseding Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 16). The dissolution is not instantaneous and complete, but is expressly subject to the general statutory provisions relative to the dissolution of corporations. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 155, \u00a7 51. The three years thus afforded ordinarily would be ample for the company to dispose of a matter like the \"capital gain\u201d tax and otherwise to settle and close its affairs. There was no assumption of \"accruing taxes,\u201d as in <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Minary, </em>221 Ky. 798. We do not have a case like <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>101 Fed. (2d) 595 (C. C. A. 7), where a corporation sold all its assets <em>for </em>a consideration paid to its stockholders, and a purchaser, who had assumed \"all existing liabilities,\u201d was held liable for a Federal tax on the corporation\u2019s profit arising from the sale, as otherwise the contract of purchase would have been fraudulent. For examples of cases like the <em>Shepard </em>case, see <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Wheeling Mold &amp; Foundry Co. </em>71 Fed. (2d) 749, 751 (C. C. A. 4); <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Kleiber Motor Co. </em>97 Fed. (2d) 557 (C. C. A. 9); <em>Sample Furniture Shops, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>123 Fed. (2d) 90, 92 (C. C. A. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"AsE\">The company argues that \u201cthe result to the company should be the same as if public control had been terminated followed by a sale by the company of its assets at the option price.\u201d We do not accede. This seems to us to be entirely devoid of bearing upon the construction of the contract as made.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">2. The remaining questions are raised by the counterclaim. The public control act provided: \"The stockholders of the company shall, as heretofore, elect a board of directors which shall, however, during the period of public operation, have no control over the management and operation of the street railway system, but its duties shall be confined to maintaining the corporate organization, protecting the interests of the corporation so far as necessary, and tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ing such action from time to time as may be deemed expedient in cases, if any, where the trustees cannot act in its place. . . . Such sum as may be deemed reasonable shall be allowed to the board of directors each year by the trustees to provide for the maintenance of the corporate organization of the company and the performance of such duties as may be necessary by the company and the directors.\u201d Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">\u25a0 The bills in question, for the services of the chairman of the board of directors and for the services and disbursements of two firms of lawyers engaged by the company, arose prior to the closing on August 29. The only issue is whether these obligations represented \u201coutstanding indebtedness and liabilities\u201d within St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17, and St. 1947, c. 544, \u00a7 5. The authority contends that \u201conly outstanding indebtedness and liabilities incurred as an incident to the operation\u201d of the railway system were assumed; that these bills \u201care extraordinary expenses incurred by the board of directors of the company in an effort to force recognition of claims of the company with respect to the price to be paid for the property\u201d; and that this part of the case is governed by <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Falmouth Water Co. </em>180 Mass. 325, 333-334.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">An examination of the bills, however \u2014 and they are all we have before us \u2014 does not show that the services were entirely as contended by the authority. That of the chairman of the board of directors \u201cfor extra services . . . with respect to problems arising in connection with the purchase\u201d on that statement was plainly an assumed liability. The lawyers\u2019 bills covered services respectively described to be \u201cin particular\u201d and \u201cparticularly\u201d with respect to the assumption of the tax, but there were also substantial services regarding the exercise of the option and the sale, including preparation of the pleadings and participation in hearings in this case in the Superior Court. One of the purposes of bringing this suit was to resist certain provisions of St. 1947, c. 544. This action was necessary for \u201cprotecting the interests of the corporation,\u201d and its undertaking was the duty of the board of directors, as it was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>occasion \u201cwhere the trustees cannot act in its place.\u201d By the consent decree this objective was achieved. The company was also entitled to independent representation as to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">This is not a case for remand for further findings to apportion the charges (see <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Simplex Time Recorder Co. </em>316 Mass. 217, 224-225), because we are of the opinion that, under Spec. St. 1918, c. 159, \u00a7 4, even the steps taken up to August 29 to throw the \u201ccapital gain\u201d tax onto the authority were within the duties of the board of directors for \u201cprotecting the interests of the corporation\u201d in a matter as to which the trustees could not act. Hence, the expense so incurred fell within the statutory provision that \u201cSuch sum as may be deemed reasonable shall be allowed to the board of directors each year by the trustees to provide for . . . the performance of such duties as may be necessary by the company and the directors.\u201d No question has been raised as to the reasonableness of the amounts of the bills or as to the apparent absence of any determination of such fact by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">3. A decree is to be entered declaring that the \u201ccapital gain\u201d tax was not assumed by the authority, and that the several bills which are the subject of the counterclaim were assumed. <em>a j j</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>a j j So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-4\"> It is provided in St. 1947, c. 544, \u00a7 2: \u201cAs of the effective date of their qualification under this act, the trustees shaE succeed to the offices of the board of trustees,\u201d that is, the public trustees appointed under the public control act, \u201cand shall act in their stead . . . and thereupon the term of the present board of trastees . . . shall terminate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-5\"> Statute 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 20: \u201cThis act shall be regarded as amendatory of said chapter one hundred and fifty-nine of the Special Acts of nineteen hundred and eighteen, and this act and said chapter shall, for purposes of interpretation and construction, be treated as one act.\u201d These statutes have been considered in numerous opinions of this court. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>231 Mass. 603. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>237 Mass. 403. <em>Chelsea </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>237 Mass. 422. <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>241 Mass. 374, 376. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 523. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 556. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>293 Mass. 589. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 609. <em>Boston Elevated Railway </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>310 Mass. 528. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, </em>312 Mass. 74. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, </em>319 Mass. 642. <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Ele vated Railway, </em>320 Mass. 588, 596-597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> In St. 1931, c. 333, \u00a7 17, this was expressed as follows: \u201cA sale by the company under the foregoing option shall work a dissolution of the company subject to the provisions of sections fifty-one and fifty-two of chapter one hundred and fifty-five of the General Laws.\u201d General Laws (Ter.
