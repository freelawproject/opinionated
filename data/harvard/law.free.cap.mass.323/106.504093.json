The declaration is in one count on an account annexed with a credit and four debit items. The controversy here concerns the item which charged the defendant with the sum of $1,635 due under \u201cHeating contract; work, labor and ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>terials,\u201d on which the judge found for the defendant. The following requests made by the plaintiff for rulings were granted by the judge: \u201c1. The evidence warrants a finding for the plaintiff. 2. The plaintiff did not become an insurer by giving the warranty: \u2018We guarantee to heat the house to 70 degrees at all times.\u2019 ... 3. The evidence does not warrant a finding as to the specific temperature of any room in the house at any specific time on any specific date &amp;emdash; other than as testified to by the plaintiff. 4. The evidence does not warrant a finding that damages of any kind have been sustained by Densmore. 5. The evidence does not warrant a finding that damages in any amount have been sustained by Densmore.\u201d The judge reported to the Appellate Division, stating: \u201cThe plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by the finding for the defendant in the face of the granting of all the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings directed to the item of the \u2018Heating contract\u2019 in the amount of $1,635, I hereby report the same to the Appellate Division for determination.\u201d The plaintiff has appealed from an order of the Appellate Division that the report be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The contract in question was in the form of a written proposal or specification, accepted by the defendant, for the installation by the plaintiff of an oil heating system in the defendant\u2019s house in Gloucester. The proposal stated: \u201cIt is the intent of this specification to cover a complete heating system and have ready for the use of the owner. We guarantee to heat the house to 70\u00b0 at all times. . . . Our terms are as follows $800 when material is delivered, $700 when system is in operation and the balance after system has proved satisfactory.\u201d The judge found that \u201cAll of the work and material called for by the specifications was done and installed by the plaintiff; except as stated in the court\u2019s \u2018rulings and findings\u2019 with regard to the oil tanks and connecting up of the shower. \u2019 \u2019 These \u2018 \u2018 rulings and findings \u2019 \u2019 were that the system when completed by the plaintiff would not heat the house to seventy degrees during cold weather; \u201cthat the house could not be kept reasonably warm after the heating system was installed; . . . that the plaintiff failed to \u2018have basement shower ready for use\u2019 as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>in his letter and that the pipes to the oil tanks have not been properly installed.\u201d In conclusion the judge found \u201cthat the plaintiff has not fully performed his contract with the defendant; that his breaches of the contract are substantial; and that, therefore, he cannot recover on the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Under a declaration with an account annexed the plaintiff could recover money due under a special contract which has been fully performed, or, if he proved substantial performance of the contract with comparatively slight deviations, and with an honest intent on his part to perform, he could recover the contract price, deducting what the heating system as installed \u201cwas worth less to the defendant by reason of such deviations.\u201d <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>112 Mass. 299, 308. <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>204 Mass. 513. <em>Pelatowski </em>v. <em>Black, </em>213 Mass. 428, 430. <em>Searls </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>275 Mass. 403, 407. See <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>266 Mass. 270, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">By granting the plaintiff\u2019s request numbered 2 the judge ruled that the language of the plaintiff\u2019s specification did not amount to an express warranty; but his findings import a ruling that the contract bound the plaintiff to install a heating system capable of heating the house to a temperature of seventy degrees. <em>White </em>v. <em>McLaren, </em>151 Mass. 553. <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>George B. H. Macomber Co. </em>211 Mass. 311, 318. The findings were not inconsistent with the above requested ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">It is the obligation of a judge hearing a case without a jury to adopt correct rules of law for his guidance and to find the facts as guided by such rules. Upon proper requests he must state the rules so adopted by him in order that the right of review thereof may be preserved to the parties in the case. <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. </em>v. <em>William Firth Co. </em>210 Mass. 8, 18, 19. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429, 431. <em>Adamaitis </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>295 Mass. 215, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Where a general finding is inconsistent with a ruling which has been made, the inconsistency may be remedied either by a motion to correct the ruling or by a motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>trial. <em>Duralith Corp. </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>274 Mass. 397, 401. <em>DiLorenzo </em>v. <em>Atlantic National Bank, </em>278 Mass. 321, 323, 324. <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>317 Mass. 485, 492. See <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Michelson, </em>311 Mass. 704, 708; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Warren Institution for Savings, </em>312 Mass. 315; <em>Charles Street Garage Co. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>312 Mass. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">By granting the plaintiff\u2019s requests numbered 4 and 5 the judge ruled that the evidence did not warrant a finding of damage to the defendant \u201cof any kind\u201d or \u201cin any amount.\u201d In view of his subsequent findings he apparently construed the requests as referring to evidence of a definite -kind or amount of damage. The language of the requests is perhaps open to this construction; but if the rulings were inconsistent with the findings and the plaintiff was thereby harmed, he should have employed one of the above methods to remedy the inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
