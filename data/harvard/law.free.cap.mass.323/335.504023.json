The declaration contained the usual allegations of due care upon the part of the plaintiff and damages. The plaintiff appealed from an order sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The declaration contains no averment that written notice of the time, place and cause of the injury was given to the defendant as provided for by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 114, \u00a7 1. Such a notice would be a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action against the defendant town for breach of its statutory duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to keep the public ways reasonably safe and convenient for travellers. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>128 Mass. 387. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Winthrop, 275 </em>Mass. 43. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>313-Mass. 495. The instant action, however, is not brought for breach of this statutory duty but is an action at common law for the negligence of the defendant\u2019s agents and servants in the construction of a sewer or drain. A town is not acting in a governmental capacity in the construction of a sewer but is engaged in a commercial undertaking for its own benefit and profit, and while not hable for negligent defects in the plan of the sewer it is responsible for the negligent construction and maintenance of a sewer. We need not discuss the grounds upon which liability is predicated, as the subject has been recently discussed with a full citation of authorities in <em>Galluzzi </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>309 Mass. 135, and <em>Harvard Furniture Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">\n<em>Order sustaining the .demurrer reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>Order to be entered overruling the demurrer.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
