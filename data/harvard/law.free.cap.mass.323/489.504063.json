She seeks by this bill in equity to reach and apply the proceeds of a motor vehicle liability policy to the satisfaction of the judgment. \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113; c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10). The question for decision is whether the plaintiff was a \u201cguest occupant\u201d as those words are defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended by St. 1935, c. 459, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">The defendant Donnell was a painter and had been hired by the plaintiff\u2019s landlord' to paint the apartment occupied by the plaintiff in colors satisfactory to her. Donnell was instructed to submit a color chart to the plaintiff so that she might select the colors to be used. On March 27, 1947, Donnell requested the plaintiff to go with him in his automobile to a paint store for the purpose of examining a color chart. Donnell told the plaintiff that if she did this he would procure the paint at the same time and it would not be necessary for him to make a special trip for the color chart. Donnell agreed to drive the plaintiff home after the selections were made. The plaintiff consented and went to the paint store with Donnell in his automobile. While being driven home on a public way in Brockton she was injured. At the time of the accident Donnell, whose automobile was registered in this Commonwealth, had a compulsory motor vehicle liability policy issued by the defendant insurance company, which was- in full force and effect. The policy did not provide guest coverage. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration in the action of tort was based on negligence and alleged, in substance, that the plaintiff was a business invitee. Donnell did not contest the case and judgment was entered for the plaintiff by default. The foregoing facts were included in a statement of agreed facts on which the present case was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Ruling that the plaintiff was a \u201cguest occupant\u201d within the definition contained in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended, the judge ordered the bill dismissed. From a final decree entered in pursuance of this order the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Since Donnell\u2019s policy provided only the statutory compulsory coverage, the plaintiff could not prevail if she was a \u201cguest occupant.\u201d <em>Westgate </em>v. <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>309 Mass. 412. Section 34A of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, as amended, defines \u201cguest occupant\u201d as \u201cany person, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>than an employee of the owner or registrant of a motor vehicle or of a person responsible for its operation with the owner\u2019s or registrant\u2019s express or implied consent, being in or upon, entering or leaving the same, except a passenger for hire in the case of a motor vehicle registered as a taxicab or .otherwise for carrying passengers for hire.\u201d We assume, as do the parties, that the plaintiff was riding as a business invitee of Donnell and not as his guest at the time of the accident. See <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Simco Trading Co. Inc. </em>297 Mass. 282, 284. But it does not follow that she was not a \u201cguest occupant \u201d within the foregoing definition. The word \u201cguest\u201d as used in the gross negligence cases is not the equivalent of \u201cguest occupant\u201d in \u00a7 34A, as amended. See <em>Ruel </em>v. <em>Langelier, </em>299 Mass. 240, 243. In other words, one who is not a \u201cguest\u201d in the common law sense may nevertheless be a .\u201cguest occupant\u201d under the statute. <em>Westgate </em>v. <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>309 Mass. 412. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co. </em>312 Mass. 354. Under \u00a7 34A, as amended, any person, with certain exceptions, \u201cbeing in or upon, entering or leaving\u201d a motor vehicle is a \u201cguest occupant.\u201d Plainly the plaintiff does not come within any of the exceptions. The judge, therefore, rightly ruled that she was a \u201cguest occupant.\u201d The suggestion in the plaintiff\u2019s brief that she was an employee requires no discussion. See <em>Muise </em>v. <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>319 Mass. 172; <em>Saragan </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>322 Mass. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
