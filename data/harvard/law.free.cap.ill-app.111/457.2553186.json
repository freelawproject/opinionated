A bill of interpleader was filed in the Circuit Court by a certain association, alleging that there was due from it on a benefit certificate \u00a73,000, which was claimed by James W. Gibson and also by Eva Nielson. The money was by the association paid into court; issues were made up between Gibson and .Nelson. March 3, 1900, on a final hearing, the Circuit Court decreed that $1,813 of the money so paid into court should be paid over to Gibson. From this decree Eva Nielson appealed to this court.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\" pgmap=\"475(51) 476(83)\">The condition of the appeal bond was that Eva Nielson should \u201c pay the amount of the costs, interest and damages rendered and to be rendered against her in case the said decree shall be affirmed.\u201d The decree was affirmed in this court January 26, 1901. Gibson then brought an action before a justice of the peace upon the appeal bond against Henry- Bostrom, the surety in the bond, the principal, Eva Nelson, being dead. G-ibson\u2019s costs in this court were $19.90. Before the justice, when the case was called for trial, Bostrom tendered to Gibson $19.90 and the costs that had accrued up to the time of tender before the justice. Gibson refused to accept the money so tendered and the trial proceeded, resulting in a judgment for plaintiff for $95.40 and costs.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\" pgmap=\"476\">Bostrom took an appeal to the Superior Court. After the judgment, the justice paid over to Gibson the $19.90 paid to him by Bostrom. The trial in the Superior Court resulted in a judgment for plaintiff for $75 and costs, to reverse which Bostrom prosecutes this appeal. .</p> <opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b476-6\" pgmap=\"476\">Mr. Justice Baker</author> <p id=\"AfD\" pgmap=\"476\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b476-7\" pgmap=\"476\">Appellant contends that the withdrawal by Gibson from the justice, of the $19.90 deposited with him by Bostrom, amounted to an accord and satisfaction of the demand sued upon and was a bar to the further prosecution of the suit. In our opinion, this contention cannot be sustained. There was not, nor could there be, any question as to Bostrom\u2019s liability on. the bond for $19.90, the amount of Gibson\u2019s costs on the appeal. The controversy between the parties was as to Bostrom\u2019s liability for any further sum as interest on the sum of $1,813 from the date of the decree to the date of its affirmance, or as damages for the delay in the payment of said sum to Gibson occasioned by the appeal. Bostrom\u2019s liability on th\u00e9 bond to Gibson for $19.90 for costs being ascertained and fixed, the receipt of that sum from Bostrom b)r Gibson could furnish legal satisfaction to that amount only of the sum for which Bostrom was liable to Gibson on the bond.</p> <p id=\"b476-8\" pgmap=\"476(54) 477(25)\">An express agreement, if one had been made by Gibson to accept $19.90 in full satisfaction of Bostrom\u2019s liability on the bond, would be void for want of a consideration to support it.' Hayes v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 125 Ill. 626, 639. Appellant further contends that if the withdrawal of the $19.90 cannot amount to an accord and satisfaction, still the judgment should be reversed upon the ground that there is no evidence, to support it.</p> <p id=\"b477-4\" pgmap=\"477\">By reason of the appeal, Gibson could not receive the $1,813 paid into court until the decree was affirmed, where but for the appeal, it would have been paid to him Avhen the decree was entered. Whether the decree appealed from is to be regarded as a \u201c judgment,\u201d within .the mean-. ing of that term in the statute providing that judgments shall draw interest at five per cent, we do not deem it necessarv to decide. The bond is conditioned for the payment of \u201c interest and damages.\u201d If Bostrom thereby did not bind himself to pay interest, as interest, he did bind himself to pay such damages as Gibson should sustain by reason of the appeal.\u201d Equity will grant relief against a forfeiture only when compensation can be made. Payment of money and interest thereon from the time of the forfeiture is regarded as compensation. Interest is in some cases allowed as an element of damage. Generally it is so allowed on the purchase money in an action for breach of a covenant of warranty, Avhere the title of the warrantor wholly fails; but, in such cases, it is not alloAved Avhen the warrantee has been in possession of the premises and has not accounted nor is accountable for the rents and profits; for the use and occupation are presumed to be equal to the use of the purchase money. 2 Sutherland on Bam., 300.</p> <p id=\"b477-9\" pgmap=\"477\">Green v.
