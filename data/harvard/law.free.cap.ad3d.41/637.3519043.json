However, the Supreme Court correctly determined that Hollywood was entitled to a conditional order of indemnification. The admissible evidence established that Hollywood was not negligent and that the third-party defendant exercised exclusive direction, supervision, and control over the plaintiffs decedent and his work (see <em>Perri v Gilbert Johnson </em>Enters., <em>Ltd., </em>14 AD3d 681, 684-685 [2005]). Prudenti, P.J., Fisher, Dillon and Dickerson, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
