Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6,7, has lived for ten years, which is supported by railroad sleepers, has a chimney built upon the ground, and steps without risers from a door to the ground, is a \u201c tenement \u201d within the meaning of these sections.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">Complaint, -for keeping and maintaining a tenement for the illegal keeping and sale of intoxicating liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-13\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Sheldon, J., there was evidence tending to show that the building was two stories in height and had five rooms, that the defendant had lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>in it for ten years, that it was from seven to ten feet above the ground and rested upon railroad sleepers, which were so arranged in cob-work style as to form six separate supports thereunder, that a chimney rested upon a flat stone lying on the ground, and that there were steps without risers from a door to the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the government had not shown that the building was a \u201c tenement,\u201d within the meaning, of Pub. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, and that there was a variance between the allegation and the evidence.

If she was such owner, the building could not be regarded as a fixture, but would pass by deed as a part of the realty, and was therefore, in the strict sense of the word, a tenement, or something which could be holden by tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Even if personal property, it was occupied by the defendant as a dwelling, and in the modern use of the word was properly described as a tenement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaughey, </em>9 Gray, 296. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clynes, </em>150 Mass. 71. <em>Dashwood </em>v. <em>Ayles, </em>16 Q.
