Before reaching Cambridge Street the southerly line of Brighton Avenue curved away from the northerly line, and the land in question was on the southerly curve. <em>Held, </em>on a petition for a writ of certiorari by the owner of the land to quash the proceedings, that the statute, dealing as it did with half a mile of street, meant to deal with the whole of that street between two definite termini well known to the public, and that \u201c Union Square \u201d was perfectly definite and well known if taken to indicate a part of Cambridge Street limited by the side lines of Cambridge Street extended.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-12\">Two petitions for writs of certiorari to quash the proceedings of the street commissioners of the city of Boston relative to widening and constructing Brighton Avenue, under the provisions of St. 1895, c. 268. The cases were heard on the petitions, the answers, the returns of the street commissioners incorporated therein, and a plan accompanying said returns, of which a copy is given on the foregoing page.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-13\">The cases were, at the request of the petitioners, reported by Barker, J., for the consideration of the full court. If the decision of the court denying the petitions was correct, it was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>affirmed; otherwise such order was to be entered as law and justice might require. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-5\"><em>M. F. Dickinson, Jr., &amp; H. R.

The limits are \u201c from Union Square in said Brighton to the junction of said avenue with Commonwealth Avenue,\u201d and the only question is on the meaning of the words \u201c from Union Square.\u201d That name is applied to the open space at the junction of Brighton Avenue and Cambridge Street, but does not designate a locality with definite boundaries. Before reaching Cambridge Street the southerly line of Brighton Avenue curves away from the northerly line. The petitioners\u2019 land is on this southerly curve, and therefore, as they say, within Union Square, and outside the respondents\u2019 power.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On the whole, we are driven to the opposite view. We think that the act, dealing as it does with half a mile of street, means to deal with the whole of that street between two definite termini, well known to the -public. Union Square is perfectly definite and well known if it be taken to indicate a part' of Cambridge Street limited by the side lines of Cambridge Street extended, but becomes vague and insufficient if we give it any. other meaning. If the words \u201c Cambridge Street \u201d are substituted for Union Square, the petitioners\u2019 land is within the bounds of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\n<em>Petitions dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
