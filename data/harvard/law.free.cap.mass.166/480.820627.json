The alleged damages were occasioned by the drying of a well, from December 19, 1892, to July 25, 1893, during which time pumps were used by the contractors in charge of the construction of the sewer in Marginal Street upon which the petitioner\u2019s premises abutted, in order to keep the sewer trench free from water during construction ; and by the pollution of the water of the well, upon the ground that when the water returned, after July 25, 1893, when the pumping finally ceased, there was a change in the quality of the water, which rendered it less desirable for use in boilers and for other purposes connected with the, business of a foundry, which the petitioner carried on upon the property.
