Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Mason, </em>C.

The discharge in bankruptcy is a defence to the suit upon the judgments. See <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Saunders, ante, </em>92. No reason is shown why the remedy at law is not adequate and complete in the present instance. We express no opinion upon the question whether the plaintiff could maintain a bill for equitable relief if the judgments were such that executions upon them might issue, and if executions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>had been threatened or issued. See <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>121 U. S. 457. The case is remitted to the Superior Court, such decree to be entered in accordance with the opinion as equity may demand. <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
