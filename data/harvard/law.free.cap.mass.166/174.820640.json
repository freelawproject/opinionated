The concluding allegation was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">\u201c Whereas in truth and in fact no part of said intoxicating liquor seized at Stow as aforesaid was the property of said Nelson Anderson, and whereas in truth and in fact no part of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>intoxicating liquor seized at Stow as aforesaid was purchased by him the said Wright for said Anderson, and whereas in truth and in fact said Anderson did not give to said Wright one dollar in money nor any other sum of money for the purpose of purchasing for him the said Anderson one case of lager beer, and whereas in truth and in fact said Anderson did not give to said Wright one dollar in money nor any other sum of money for the purpose of purchasing for him the said Anderson any part of said intoxicating liquor seized at Stow as aforesaid, all of which the said Joseph Wright then and there well knew; but said Wright falsely, knowingly, wilfully, and corruptly did then and there on his oath aforesaid commit wilful and corrupt perjury, by then and there on his oath aforesaid and before said District Court for Central Middlesex, swearing to the falsehoods above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">\u201cAgainst the peace of said Commonwealth, and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">In the Superior Court, before the jury were impanelled, the defendant moved to q\u00faash the indictment for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">\u201c 1. Because it sets forth no offence known to the laws of this Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">\u201c 2. Because said indictment fails in due precision and certainty in the allegations therein set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">\u201c3. Because no good and sufficient assignments are therein set forth or contained, and it does not allege that the defendant was required by law to take an oath according to the statute in such case made and provided. It nowhere sets forth in specific terms, as required by statute, that the alleged offence had been committed in a criminal case or civil suit or other proceedings, or that the testimony given by the defendant was material to the issue to which it is supposed to refer, nor does it sufficiently set forth the subject matter or any part thereof of which alleged statements were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">\u201c 4. It does not allege that the matter sworn to was material, or that the facts set forth as sworn to and upon which the perjury is assigned were sufficient in themselves to establish the materiality. An allegation or presumption that it might have been material is not sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-11\">\u201c 5. Because it does not allege that the District Court of Central Middlesex was lawfully holden at Concord, in the count; of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Middlesex, on the thirteenth day of May, A. D. 1893, or that said court had jurisdiction of the complaint referred to in said indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">Bishop,. J. overruled the motion; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">At the trial, the evidence tended to show that on or about May 1, 1893, a complaint issued from the District Court of Central Middlesex against one Edwin T. McManus, charging him with the illegal sale of intoxicating liquors. At the trial of McManus upon the complaint in the district court, it was shown that during the month of April, 1893, a seizure of liquors had been made upon his premises. The liquors consisted of about two hundred and sixteen bottles filled with lager beer and packed in three barrels, and several quarts of whiskey and rum, the whiskey and rum being in other parts of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">The evidence for the government at the trial of McManus tended to prove that such liquors had been found upon his premises ; and that a conversation had been had by McManus with the officers at the time of the seizure, in which he told them that he expected the boys, referring to a new board of selectmen, would treat him as well as the old board of selectmen had done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">The present defendant appeared at the trial of McManus as claimant of the lager beer seized, and was put upon the stand as a witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">At the present trial, Herbert P. Underwood, a selectman of the town of Stow during the year 1893, testified that he was present at the trial of McManus at Concord, and was a witness; that he was present at the seizure at the house of McManus; that there were seized three barrels containing a large number of bottles of beer, besides a large quantity of whiskey and rum; that McManus said to him, in substance, \u201c I hoped that you boys would treat me as well as the old board have done \u201d; that at the trial of McManus the present defendant testified that he purchased at Waltham the lager beer the day before the seizure, that he had had it sent out to the house of McManus by one George W. Taylor, that before he went to Waltham he had received from certain men living in Maynard one dollar each, and that this beer purchased in Waltham had been purchased for the men who had contributed one dollar each; and that the defendant, when asked, upon cross-examination, to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>names of the persons who had given him one dollar each, gave the names of Stott, Clayton, Walsh, and Anderson. The witness Underwood could not remember distinctly the full names ms given by the defendant, but testified that he thought they were Isaac W. Stott, John W. Church, James H. Clayton, Michael Walsh, and Nelson Anderson. Underwood further testified that the defendant did not claim to have any interest in the liquors other than the lager beer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">John S. Keyes, justice of the District Court of Central Middlesex, testified in substance the same as Underwood, as did also Edward Fearns, a police officer of the town of Maynard. Judge Keyes testified that he presided at the trial in the district court; that he duly administered the oath to the present defendant as a witness; and that, after the latter had hesitatingly given four or five of the names as testified to by Underwood, hesitated still further and then gave the name of Anderson, but was not certain whether Anderson was the correct name or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">Isaac W. Stott, John W. Church, James H. Clayton, and Michael Walsh testified that during the year 1893, and for some time previous to that, they had all lived in Maynard; that they knew the defendant and had known him for some time previously to 1893; that they had never at any time given him a dollar or any other sum of money to purchase beer for them at Waltham or any other place ; and that they had never been interested in any beer that he had ever purchased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">Patrick Campbell, Patrick J. Corners, Julius Leighton, Theodore Woolershide, and said McManus, called as witnesses for the defendant, testified that they were present at the trial of McManus and had heard the present defendant testify; and that he said that he was not certain that the names given by him of the persons who had advanced a dollar each for the purchase of beer were correct, that the names were in a book which he did not have with him, and that he did not know but he might be mistaken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">The defendant testified that neither Clayton, Walsh, Stott, Anderson, nor Church, men whom he knew, had ever given him a dollar for the purchase of beer at Waltham, or at any other place; that when he said that they had done so, it was because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>he was confused as a witness and was physically exhausted from want of sleep, and because he did not have, when testifying, the book containing the names of the persons who had advanced him money; that he had at first refused to'give the names, because he had not his book which contained them; that, after he had given the names, he said he did not feel sure the names given were correct; and that there were nine persons in all, including himself, who had put in a dollar apiece, and for whom the beer was bought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested the judge to rule that there was no evidence sufficient to warrant the jury in finding a verdict of guilty, but the judge refused so to rule; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-7\"><em>H. N. Allin &amp; T. </em>Hillis, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-8\"><em>F. </em>N. <em>Wier, </em>District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-9\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtK\">1. The first objection to the indictment rests entirely on the difficulty arising from the careless insertion of certain words which make the first part of the indictment senseless as it stands. The indictment undertakes, at 'the outset, to set forth the case in which the alleged perjuries were committed, and the words \u201c Joseph Wright, late resident of Maynard, in the county of Middlesex and Commonwealth aforesaid,\u201d and then again the words \u201c with force and arms,\u201d are found in this part of the averments, where they have no relevancy or meaning. This error is obvious enough after it is pointed out, and if the words are rejected the averments are sufficient to show the regularity of the legal proceedings in the course of which the alleged perjuries were committed. Pub. Sts. c. 205, \u00a7 5. The said words may be rejected as meaning less. 1 Bish. Grim. Proc. \u00a7 481 and note, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">2. The objection most relied on is that the indictment does not sufficiently allege the materiality of the facts testified to by the defendant. The indictment clearly avers that it became a material question whether certain intoxicating liquors seized at Stow were the property of McManus, and it then proceeds to aver in detail, in respect to different parcels or cases of the liquors so seized, that the defendant testified that one of said parcels was the property of one Clayton, and was purchased by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>said defendant for said Clayton; and that another of said parcels was the property of one Walsh, and was purchased by said defendant for said Walsh; and so on with respect to other parcels, which the defendant testified were the property of, and were purchased by him for, other persons who were named. The indictment then goes on to aver in detail that no part of the liquors seized was the property of Clayton, or was purchased by the defendant for him, and so on in respect to Walsh and the others. The indictment concludes with a general averment that the defendant committed perjury by swearing to said falsehoods. The defendant objects that it does not sufficiently appear that the testimony of the defendant related to the same time when the liquors were alleged to have belonged to McManus, and that McManus might have bought the liquors from Clayton, Walsh, etc., or they might have bought the liquors from the defendant. It is true that the words \u201c then and there \u201d are not introduced at this point; but, taking all the averments of the detail of circumstances testified to by the defendant, it sufficiently appears that the defendant\u2019s testimony, as charged in the indictment, negatived McManus\u2019s ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">3. The defendant contends that it is not averred that he was \u201c lawfully required to depose the truth in any proceeeding in a course of justice.\u201d Pub. Sts. c. 205, \u00a7 1. But the averment of his being called and sworn as a witness includes this. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>12 Mass. 273, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">4. The defendant contends that it does not appear that the perjury was committed in a criminal case. Pub. Sts. c. 205, \u00a7 5. The description of the subject of the complaint sufficiently shows that it was a criminal case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouvier, </em>164 Mass. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">5. The defendant contends that, according to the true construction of the indictment, the averments of his testimony end with the charge of what he testified in respect to Clayton, and that the final averment that he committed perjury by swearing to \u201c the falsehoods above set forth \u201d includes only the falsehoods as to Anderson. This construction, however, is not warranted. The indictment sufficiently charges perjury in his testimony as to Clayton, Walsh, Anderson, and the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">6. The verdict of guilty was warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\n<em>\u00a1Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
