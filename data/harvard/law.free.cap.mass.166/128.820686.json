Sts. c. 162, - \u00a7 17, cl. 5, that the debtor contracted the debt with an intention not to pay the same; that after the examination of Mason according to law the certificate of arrest was granted, and Mason was arrested on February 27, 1895; that on March 4, 1895, the debtor 'was sworn for examination on his application to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath, and the petitioners filed charges of fraud, as authorized by Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7 49, to which the debtor pleaded not guilty ; that the case was then continued without any examination ; that the debtor, on March 27,1895, filed a second voluntary petition in insolvency in the court of insolvency in said county of Middlesex; that tin: usual proceedings were had; that the aforesaid judgment was unsatisfied and payable at the time of the first publication of the notice of issuing the warrant in said insolvent proceedings; that on October 28, 1895, the court decreed to Mason a discharge in the usual form ; that the petitioners did not prove in the last insolvency proceedings the debt or judgment on account of which Mason was arrested; that on November 1, 1895, the debtor duly pleaded in the case in the Municipal Court his discharge in insolvency; and that thereupon the presiding justice decided that the discharge in insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>vency discharged the debtor from arrest and was a bar to further proceedings in the Municipal Court, and refused to examine the debtor and to permit the debtor to be examined therein, and refused to hear and determine the charges of fraud, and intimated his intention to order the proceedings terminated and the debtor discharged from arrest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-4\"><em>H.

Sts. c. 157, \u00a7 83, in exempting the debtor from arrest after a later discharge. The words of \u00a7 83 are express, that after a discharge in insolvency the debtor is forever exempt from imprisonment in any proceedings on account of a debt or demand provable against his estate. \u201c A debt or demand \u201d means \u201c any debt or demand,\u201d and is of universal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The section applies as well to debts which are not discharged by \u00a7 81 as to those which are discharged, \u2014 for instance, to foreign debts or debts for necessaries. <em>Choteau v. </em>Richardson, 12 Allen, 365. <em>Everett v. </em>Henderson, 150 Mass. 411, 413, 414. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal </em>Court, 164 Mass. 155. It follows that decisions as to the extent of a discharge under \u00a7 81 have no necessary bearing on the extent of the exemption from arrest under \u00a7 84. See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal Court, ante, </em>126. It is settled, we suppose, that the refusal of a discharge not merely adjudicates that the debtor failed to pay fifty per cent of the claims proved, or to get the assent of his creditors, under \u00a7 86, but also exempts claims provable in the proceedings from discharge in later proceedings unless, actually proved in them. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>7 Met. 424. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Hebard, </em>8 Met. 129. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>13 Gray, 203. But such an adjudication determines nothing as to liability to arrest, and these cases merely add an implied exception to those which are expressed in \u00a7 81, whereas in \u00a7 84 there are no exceptions at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">If it were necessary, this case could be decided on narrower ground. The petitioners have taken judgment on their claim since the discharge was refused, and, according to the decisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>when the judgment creditor lives in this State the judgment creates a new debt, with different incidents, and presumably for a different sum, as it probably includes costs, so that it would seem that <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Willard </em>no longer applies. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Wat</em>son, 9 Gray, 211. <em>Wolcott </em>v. Hodge, 15 Gray, 547, 548. <em>Bradford </em>v. Rice, 102 Mass. 472, 473. <em>Light </em>v. Merriam, 132 Mass. 283, 284. <em>Petition dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
