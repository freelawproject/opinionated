INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 12, 2017, Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") revoked Plaintiff Marvin Yovany Cabrera Cabrera's previously approved Form I-360 visa petition for special immigrant juvenile status. USCIS determined that Plaintiff was not eligible for special immigrant juvenile status because he filed his Petition\n   <em>\n    on the day of\n   </em>\n   his 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   birthday, instead of\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   his 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   birthday, as required by the agency's regulations. Plaintiff brings this action challenging the revocation of his I-360 Petition under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint both for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. As to subject matter jurisdiction, Defendants argue that this court lacks the power to review agency decisions revoking I-360 Petitions because such actions are discretionary and specifically excluded by statute from judicial review. As for failure to state a claim, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff has not adduced facts that render it plausible that the agency's action was arbitrary and capricious. Defendants also point out that the court lacks jurisdiction as to Plaintiff's constitutional claims, which must be raised directly with the D.C. Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in part and denies it in part. The court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff's APA claim insofar as he alleges that the revocation of his Petition was arbitrary and capricious because the agency unreasonably delayed in taking such action. The court, however, has jurisdiction to review Plaintiff's challenge to the reasonableness of USCIS's regulations on filing petitions seeking special immigrant juvenile status and the implementation of those regulations. Finally, with respect to Plaintiff's constitutional claims, the court defers to Plaintiff as to whether those claims should be transferred now or later to the D.C. Circuit for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\") allows persons qualifying for Special Immigrant Juvenile (\"SIJ\") status to obtain a residency visa and eventually seek lawful permanent residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(ii). Section 101(a)(27)(J) of the INA defines an SIJ as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (J) an immigrant who is present in the United States-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) who has been declared dependent on a juvenile court located in the United States or whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department\n   of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court located in the United States, and whose reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant's parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (ii) for whom it has been determined in administrative or judicial proceedings that it would not be in the alien's best interest to be returned to the alien's or parent's previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (iii) in whose case the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to the grant of special immigrant juvenile status, except that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (I) no juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine the custody status or placement of an alien in the custody of the Secretary of Health and Human Services unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services specifically consents to such jurisdiction; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (II) no natural parent or prior adoptive parent of any alien provided special immigrant status under this subparagraph shall thereafter, by virtue of such parentage, be accorded any right, privilege, or status under this chapter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J). Essentially, the statute requires that anyone seeking SIJ status must have first been the subject of a local juvenile court order indicating that (1) he is a dependent of that court, (2) that reunification with one or both parents is not viable \"due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis,\" and (3) that return to his home country is not in his best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Satisfying the INA's definition of Special Immigrant Juvenile does not, however, by itself make one eligible for residency status.

Instead, Plaintiff makes two different challenges under the APA, neither of which involves questioning the agency's determination of Plaintiff's age at the time of filing. First, he contests \"defendants' unreasonable filing requirements\" for I-360 applications. Compl. \u00b6 40.

However, Defendants' own rules make such filings impossible.\" Compl. \u00b6 36. Second, Plaintiff avers that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously \"because the time elapsed between approval and revocation was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. He points out that, even though the agency knew he was 21 years of age on the day he filed his I-360 Petition, Defendants initially approved the Petition, only to revoke it 16 months later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As explained below, the court concludes that it has jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's challenge to the agency's \"unreasonable filing requirements,\" but not the agency's \"unreasonable\" delay in revoking the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    1. \"Unreasonable Filing Requirements\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As noted, Defendants rely on section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as barring jurisdiction over USCIS's decision of revocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 4. That provision forecloses review of \"discretionary\" acts of the Secretary of Homeland Security \"the authority for which is specified under\n   <em>\n    this subchapter.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). The referenced \"subchapter\" is Subchapter II of Title 8, Chapter 12, entitled \"Immigration.\" Subchapter II contains nine Parts, covering a range of subjects, including \"Admission Qualifications for Aliens\" (Part II), \"Issuance of Entry Documents\" (Part III), and \"Adjustment and Change of Status\" (Part V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Subchapter II does not, however, contain Congress's delegation of authority to the Secretary to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out his functions under the INA. That congressional delegation is found elsewhere, in Subchapter I. Section 1103(a) charges the Secretary of Homeland Security \"with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens,\" except as otherwise provided by statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Defendants point to no statutory provision that would foreclose the court's jurisdiction to review the applicable regulations and their implementation.

The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review that claim. Section 1155 empowers the Secretary to \"revoke the approval of any petition\" \"\n   <em>\n    at any time.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201155\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Congress therefore placed no time limitation on the Secretary's ability to revoke a previously approved petition. Given the unlimited discretion afforded the Secretary as to the timing of a revocation decision, review of the \"reasonableness\" of the time it took the Secretary to revoke Plaintiff's Petition falls squarely outside the court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the court cannot review the temporal aspect of Plaintiff's APA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), \"by failing to provide evidence that [Plaintiff] was indeed eligible for I-360 SIJ status at the time his petition was filed.\" Defs.' Mot. at 6. Essentially, Defendants' argument hinges on the contention that a \"petitioner must meet all of the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), including the age restriction\" because \"[s]uch requirements are mandatory,\" Defs.'

Put succinctly, Plaintiff alleges that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by affording him no means by which to timely file his Petition on the day before his 21st birthday, when he received the necessary certification from the juvenile court. To bolster that claim, Plaintiff seems to suggest different treatment from similarly situated applicants. He alleges, for instance, that USCIS offers same-day electronic filing for other types of Petitions, but not I-360 Petitions. Compl. \u00b6 47. Such an allegation of disparate treatment makes out a plausible APA claim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents of the Univ. of California v.
