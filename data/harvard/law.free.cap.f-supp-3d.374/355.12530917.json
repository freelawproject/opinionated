Indeed, the allegations in the complaint - which the Consent Judgment requires that we deem to be true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Consent Judgment at 3 - show that Berkey knowingly and recurrently engaged in deceitful activities that resulted in substantial losses to several customers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 12-40. Accordingly, a significant penalty is necessary to punish Berkey and to deter Berkey and others from engaging in similar actions in the future. Many securities enforcement cases have awarded a penalty equal to the amount gained by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sec. &amp; Exch.

Berkey, however, has proferred documents showing that he has a net worth of negative $ 76,335.33,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   United States Security and Exchange Commission Statement of Financial Condition (annexed as Ex. 7 to Berkey Aff.) (\"Statement of Financial Condition\"), at 2, and a negative monthly cash flow, with two children to support,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 8; Berkey Aff. \u00b6 12. He works on a commission basis in sales, Berkey Aff. \u00b6 11, and shows an adjusted gross income of $ 70,303 on his 2017 tax return,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2017 Income Tax Return (annexed as Ex. 1 to Berkey Aff.), and wages of $ 93,238.79 on his 2018 W-2,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2018 W-2 and Earnings Summary (annexed as Ex. 2 to Berkey Aff.). His monthly expenses are not extravagant and include a significant monthly child support payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Financial Condition at 6. Berkey obviously has limited ability to pay a fine. On the other hand, he has a long future potential earning career given his age (44). After considering Berkey's financial condition, as well as all the other factors that show egregious conduct on his part (including his settling prior cases alleging churning for a total of $ 35,500,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stoeling Decl., Exhibit 1), we conclude that a fine in the amount of $ 71,000 is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff's motion (Docket # 42) is granted.
