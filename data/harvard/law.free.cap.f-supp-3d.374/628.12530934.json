The answer turns on the meaning of \"conviction entered\" in \u00a7 402(b) of the Act. Because the Court concludes that conviction entry, in context, corresponds with pronouncement of guilt rather than date of judgment, it finds the \u00a7 402 changes inapplicable in this pre-Act plea scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Timothy Havens pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Title IV of the Act, labeled \"Sentencing Reform,\" did just that.

Because Havens has more than one criminal history point, he fails to qualify for the statutory safety valve under the pre-First Step Act version of \u00a7 3553(f). Given the Act's changes to \u00a7 3553(f)'s requirements, however, Havens objected to the Presentence Investigation Report's failure to apply the new statutory safety valve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE # 31. Consistent with Department of Justice policy, the United States agreed with Havens and argued that the modified safety valve should apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE # 32. Both parties, and the Court, acknowledge that Havens satisfies all qualifications of \u00a7 3553(f) as amended. Thus, the sole issue is whether Congress intended amended \u00a7 3553(f) to extend to defendants adjudged guilty (via plea or verdict) prior to December 21, 2018, though not yet sentenced by First Step Act passage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 402 of the First Step Act, titled and effecting a \"Broadening of Existing Safety Valve,\" provides: \"APPLICABILITY.-The amendments made by this section shall apply only to a conviction entered on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\" \u00a7 402(b), 132 Stat. at 5221.

Ultimately, the Court identified six considerations in finding new-law applicability. Those included thorough review of the Sentencing Reform Act (which required that a sentencing court apply Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing) and the Fair Sentencing Act's emergency Guidelines amendment authorization (showing that Congress knew the Guidelines timing issue and intended to assure concurrent leniency for newly sentenced offenders).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2332-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unlike the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the First Step Act lacks clear or even \"fair implication\" of an intent to apply the more lenient safety valve to those pronounced guilty pre-Act; rather, the language and structure of the First Step Act strongly suggest the opposite conclusion. Within the Sentencing Reform Title of the First Step Act, Congress included three express \"applicability\" provisions. In both \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 403 (the provisions governing \u00a7 841 mandatory minima and \u00a7 924(c) stacking, respectively), Congress used the following language: \"APPLICABILITY TO PENDING CASES.-This section, and the amendments made by this section, shall apply to any offense that was committed before the date of enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of such date of enactment.\" \u00a7\u00a7 401(c) &amp; 403(b), 132 Stat. at 5221, 5222. This describes the precise timeline in Havens's case-offense commission (and Havens's guilty plea) occurred pre-Act, but \"a sentence for the offense ha[d] not been imposed as of\" December 21, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The applicability provision of the new safety valve is dramatically different: \"The amendments ... shall apply only to a conviction entered on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 402(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is counterintuitive-and contrary to statutory interpretation directives-to assume that Congress intended the applicability provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402, and 403 to convey the same meaning despite their very different phrasing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Keeley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519486\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/878/#p882\">\n    910 F.3d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under accepted canons of statutory interpretation, we must interpret statutes as a whole, giving effect to each word and making every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless or superfluous.\").

The Court treated each guilt finding as a \"conviction\" for purposes of the phrase \"second or subsequent conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"In the context of \u00a7 924(c)(1), we think it unambiguous that 'conviction' refers to the finding of guilt by a judge or jury that necessarily precedes the entry of a final judgment of conviction.\"). The First Step Act reversed\n   <em>\n    Deal.\n   </em>\n   The Act now allows the stacked enhancement only as to a \u00a7 924(c)\"violation ... that occurs after a prior conviction under this subsection has become final.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 403(a), 132 Stat. at 5222. Thus, Congress,\n   within the First Step Act, and within the same Title addressing \"Sentencing Reform,\" contemporaneously dealt with the term \"conviction\" in a context that clearly meant only finding of guilt (the jury's verdict, as used in\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   ). Congress fixed\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   by requiring conviction finality. However, in the neighboring \u00a7 402 of the First Step Act, Congress used no like qualifier as to the term \"conviction,\" a term it knew in \u00a7 403 had the meaning used by\n   <em>\n    Deal.\n   </em>\n   This signifies that the word \"conviction,\" without adornment, means guilt finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Equally important is the language Congress\n   <em>\n    omitted\n   </em>\n   in Title IV of the First Step Act. In finding the requisite indicia of Congressional intent in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   Court heavily relied on the 2010 Act's inclusion of Guidelines \"emergency amendment\" authority, \"allowing 'the Commission to incorporate the statutory changes' in the Guidelines while 'minimiz[ing] the lag between any statutory and guideline modifications for cocaine offenders.' \" 132 S.Ct. at 2329 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Against the backdrop of the Sentencing Reform Act's command to apply the Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, the\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   Court viewed this inclusion of emergency amendment authority as an indicator of Congress's intent to broadly apply the 2010 Act's more lenient penalties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2332-33. The First Step Act provides no such emergency amendment authority. Moreover, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 lacked any instruction concerning its applicability, whereas the First Step Act contains the varying applicability provisions previously discussed. The First Step Act's lack of amendment authority-and the presence of its express applicability directives-weigh against finding the \"fair implication\" of Congressional intent that\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   discerned in the Fair Sentencing Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2332.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To date, two district courts have considered this precise issue, and both have reached the same conclusion the Court does here.

Section 3553 regulates \"Imposition of Sentence,\" and \u00a7 3553(f) is the safety valve, which directs (when it applies) how a court shall \"impose a sentence.\" Logically, if \"conviction entered\" means guilt finding, it is no stretch to treat the new safety valve as applying to determine imposition of sentence as to the finding. It is more difficult if \"conviction entered\" means judgment of conviction because the judgment is the result of sentencing, and \u00a7 3553(f) is part of the process of sentencing. Thus, a court would not logically apply a sentencing statute to the judgment itself; the statute would apply to the process of sentencing, which culminates in the judgment. The awkward verbiage is simply another reason the Court has difficulty in thinking Congress clearly meant what the parties advocate. Finally, use of the adverb \"only\" in the key phrase-that the amendments \"shall apply\n    <strong>\n     only\n    </strong>\n    to a conviction entered\" post enactment-linguistically indicates the need for narrower instead of broader application. \u00a7 402(b), 132 Stat. at 5221 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Is this (safety valve extension) different from\n    <em>\n     Dorsey\n    </em>\n    (which involved lowering of the crack-to-powder ratio)? In a sense, the safety valve is not a direct punishment; rather, it is a path to a lower punishment for a given \"offense\" if specific criteria exist. However, if the \u00a7 841 penalty is a \"liability incurred\" at offense commission, then the safety valve extension would, by operation and its repeal of the prior version, \"have the effect to release or extinguish\" a penalty otherwise applicable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n     1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As such, the Court views\n    <em>\n     Dorsey\n    </em>\n    as dictating the proper analysis of when to apply a new statute that ameliorates the penalty for a completed offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     Dorsey\n    </em>\n    also relied in part on disparities a different result would create, and the parties here argued as well that using conviction entry instead of judgment date would work inequities. The Court sees the argument but also notes that any dateline drawn for a statutory change not fully retroactive has winners and losers. Here, Havens entered a valid guilty plea well before the First Step Act came into being. Despite that, he got the benefit of \u00a7 401, avoiding a harsh 20-year minimum. It is true that vagaries in plea timing could create disparity. However, quirks in sentencing timing would yield similar distinctions as to \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 403. Congress picked its language and created the categories. While\n    <em>\n     Dorsey\n    </em>\n    found that disparities, in context, signaled lenient intent, none of the other key\n    <em>\n     Dorsey\n    </em>\n    factors (the statutory silence, Guidelines status, and the emergency amendment authorization) point that way here.
