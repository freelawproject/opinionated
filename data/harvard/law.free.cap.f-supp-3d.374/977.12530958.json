Furthermore, the Court notes that the Ninth Circuit has determined that CPC \u00a7 211 is an indivisible statute, meaning that the Court's inquiry will be confined to the pure categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357665\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/1193/#p1196\">\n    805 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1198 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rendon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183695\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/1077/#p1084\">\n    764 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court agrees with Petitioner that CPC \u00a7 211 is broader than any of the federal robbery statutes because it includes \"mere threats to property, such as 'Give me $ 10 or I'll key your car' or 'Open the cash register or I'll tag your windows.' \"\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049610\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/881/#p892\">\n    541 F.3d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the \"force or fear\" element may be satisfied through threats to property is confirmed by California's model jury instructions, which state: \"\n   <em>\n    Fear\n   </em>\n   , as used here, means fear of (injury to the person himself or herself[,]/ [or] injury to the person's family or property [,]/ [or] immediate injury to someone else present during the incident or to that person's property).]\" Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 1600 (Judicial Conf. of Cal. 2016). Because the federal robbery statutes, at a minimum, require actions that \"would put an ordinary, reasonable person in fear\n   <em>\n    of bodily harm\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selfa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537173\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/749/#p751\">\n    918 F.2d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , CPC \u00a7 211 is not a categorical match because it punishes conduct that is outside the reach of \u00a7\u00a7 2111, 2113 or 2118. As a matter of common sense, threatening to harm one's property would not put an ordinary, reasonable person in fear of bodily harm. Accordingly, the Court finds that CPC \u00a7 211 is not a categorical match for \"robbery\" under the three-strikes law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, the Court compares CPC \u00a7 211 to the definition of \"extortion\" set forth in \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(C) : \"an offense that has as its elements the extraction of anything of value from another person by threatening or placing that person in fear of injury to any person or kidnapping any person.\" Like the federal robbery statutes, the definition of extortion in \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(C) by its plain language also requires putting an individual in fear of bodily harm. Consequently, the reasoning behind the Court's conclusion that CPC \u00a7 211 is broader than the federal robbery statutes is applicable here as well, because \"extortion\" as defined by \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(C) does not encompass threats to property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   CPC \u00a7 211 covers the felonious taking of property by threatening to harm an individual's property, which is not identical to or narrower than \"threatening or placing that person in fear of injury to any person or kidnapping any person.\" Therefore, the\n   Court finds that CPC \u00a7 211 does not categorically match \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(C) definition of extortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Whether\n     <em>\n      Johnson\n     </em>\n     And\n     <em>\n      Dimaya\n     </em>\n     Invalidate The \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)(ii) Residual Clause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because CPC \u00a7 211 does not categorically qualify under the elements clause or any of the enumerated offenses, Petitioner's prior conviction for CPC \u00a7 211 can only qualify as a serious violent felony if it falls under the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   defines \"crime of violence\" to mean\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (b) any other offense that is a felony and that,\n   <em>\n    by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      or property\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphases supplied).

While the broader statutory framework differs slightly, this minor difference does not alter the constitutional analysis. The residual clause in \u00a7 16(b) stands on its own, unmoored from a list of exemplar crimes that might guide an analysis of what sort of crime qualifies under the residual clause. The residual clause in the three-strikes law, by contrast, is preceded by a long list of enumerated offenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F)(i). This distinction does not save the clause. The ACCA's residual clause likewise was preceded by a \"confusing list of exemplar crimes\" in its enumerated-crimes clause, a list that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   noted was \"too varied to provide\" assistance in \"giving the residual clause meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The list of enumerated crimes in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(F)(i) suffers from the same problem as the list in the ACCA - it includes burglary, arson, and extortion; unlike the ACCA's residual clause, it omits use of explosives; and it adds a handful of other crimes, including sexual abuse, aircraft piracy, and firearms possession, among others. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   made note of courts' difficulty in using the ACCA's enumerated crimes to guide interpretation of the residual clause. But in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \"the list of crimes was not the culprit,\" and in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the absence of the list of crimes did not trigger the constitutional problem.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, as the Court made clear, the unconstitutional vagueness in the residual clause in each of those cases \"resided[d] in just 'two' of its features: the ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard,\" the two key flaws that remain whether accompanied by a list of enumerated crimes or not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The inclusion of a greater list of enumerated crimes is not a basis to distinguish the residual clause in the three-strikes law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   control the outcome here.
