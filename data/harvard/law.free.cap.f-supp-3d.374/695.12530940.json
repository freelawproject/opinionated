[Doc. 203]. Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs (\"Defendants\") have filed a response, and Plaintiff has submitted a reply. [Docs. 206, 211]. Also before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time to file a reply, which Defendants do not oppose [doc. 208], and Defendants' motion to strike the evidence submitted with Plaintiff's reply brief [doc. 212]. For the reasons that follow, the motion for extension of time [doc. 208] is granted, to the extent that the Court has considered Plaintiff's reply brief, the motion to strike [doc. 212] is denied as moot, as the Court has not relied on the evidence submitted with Plaintiff's reply brief in formulating this opinion, and the motion for summary judgment [doc. 203] is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff, Shafiqullah Koshani, a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, filed suit against defendants Eric Barton, a citizen of the United States, and Vanquish Worldwide, LLC, alleging that he and Mr. Barton established a joint venture in Afghanistan in 2010. [Doc. 41 at 103]. Plaintiff maintains that the parties named their new business Vanquish Worldwide (\"Vanquish Afghanistan\") and pursued a contract with the United States Army, which was soliciting bids for a project known as \"National Afghan Trucking,\" or \"NAT,\" in Afghanistan. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 4-5]. Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Barton submitted a proposal to the United States in response to the NAT solicitation, but instead of submitting it in Vanquish Afghanistan's name, he submitted the proposal on behalf of a company with a nearly identical name, Vanquish Worldwide, LLC (\"Vanquish United States\")-a company that he allegedly owned in Tennessee-and tabbed Vanquish Afghanistan as a subcontractor that would render services under the contract. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 7]. The United States ultimately awarded the NAT contract to Vanquish United States. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Plaintiff ultimately alleges that he was not paid profits from the NAT contract, and filed suit to recover those lost profits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants respond with several counterclaims. [Doc. 75]. Defendants state that they submitted a proposal for the NAT contract which listed Vanquish United States as the prime contractor and Vanquish Afghanistan as the subcontractor, after their initial subcontractor, United Sadat Transportation and Logistics Company (\"USC\"), partially owned by Plaintiff's brother Farid Koshani, backed out. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25]. After receiving the NAT contract, Vanquish United States allegedly hired Plaintiff's brother Jawid Koshani to serve as Operations Manager under the NAT contract, and Jawid signed a Confidentiality, Non-Disclosure, and Non-Competition Agreement (\"NDA\") with Vanquish United States. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25]. The NDA stated that, during his employment, and for one year after, Jawid would not \"[s]olict, divert, or appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate, directly or by assisting others, any business from any of Vanquish's customers ... for purposes of providing products or services that are competitive with those provided by Vanquish[.]\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants allege that, after the award of the NAT Contract, Plaintiff refused to allow Vanquish Afghanistan to perform trucking missions, and suggested that Defendants use USC as a subcontractor instead. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. After further discussion, Plaintiff ultimately agreed to use Vanquish Afghanistan for NAT trucking missions, and signed several agreements on the matter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27]. However, Defendants state that they later learned that Plaintiff did not truly intend for Vanquish Afghanistan to perform any trucking missions, and every mission was given to USC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   rather than Vanquish Afghanistan. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants allege that at the end of the NAT contract base period, when the United States Army began awarding the first option year, Plaintiff began \"making plans to steal the NAT Contract,\" and recruited his brother Jawid to assist in this scheme. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendants state that Plaintiff created a new Afghan sole proprietorship under a name similar to Vanquish Worldwide that was 100% owned by Plaintiff, registered it with Afghan authorities, and set up a new Afghan bank account for the sole proprietorship. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28]. Defendants allege that Plaintiff and Jawid made false statements to the U.S. Government in an effort to convince officials to issue the NAT contract option year to the sole proprietorship rather than Vanquish United States. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendants state that Plaintiff lied to government officials about his entitlement to the NAT contract option year, as well as stating that Mr. Barton had forged signatures on contracts and lied to contracting officials. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30]. Defendants allege that Plaintiff's efforts were successful when the government suspended payments to Vanquish United States under the NAT contract, and also suspended Vanquish United States from receiving any missions under the NAT contract, beginning in October 2012. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their counterclaims, Defendants allege claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of the duty not to misuse partnership assets, tortious interference with contract, statutory inducement of a breach of contract, and conspiracy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-39]. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment on these counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This Court will first address whether these counterclaims were filed outside the limitations period, and then address whether any tolling doctrines are applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

[Doc. 204 at 1-3]. Plaintiff states that e-mails from September, October, and November of 2012 indicate that Defendants were aware that Plaintiff was communicating with the contracting officer and claiming an ownership in Vanquish United States or the NAT contract, and thus, the counterclaims are untimely. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3]. Defendants assert that the e-mails on which Plaintiff relies do not show that Defendants were aware of their injury and that the Plaintiff was the person who caused the injury, and they did not learn such information until 2015, when documentation was produced as part of an Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (\"ASBCA\") appeal, related to Vanquish United States's suspension under the NAT contract. [Doc. 206 at 4-8]. Plaintiff replies that Defendants do not deny that they were on inquiry notice as to Count 1 in 2011. [Doc. 211 at 3-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Tennessee generally applies a six-year statute of limitations to contract actions. Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 28-3-109(a)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    Benz-Elliott v. Barrett Enterprises, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6877395\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/140/#p152\">\n    456 S.W.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (Tenn. 2015). Tennessee also applies a three-year statute of limitations to tort actions involving injuries to personal or real property. Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 28-3-105. A claim for interference with contract falls under this three-year limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Tigg v.

Suits for conspiracy, whether arising incident to a contract or not, are actions in tort and are governed by the applicable tort statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Harvest Corp v.

Ct. App. 1980). Because the alleged conspiracy relates to the interference with contract claims, a three-year limitations period also applies to the conspiracy claim. The parties do not contest that these are the applicable statutes of limitations for the counterclaims at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under the \"discovery rule,\" a statute of limitations begins to run from the time that \"a plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should have discovered, his injury and the cause thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    City State Bank v.

Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). Thus, in Tennessee, \"a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run not only when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of a claim, but also when the plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he [or she] has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Redwing v.

Here, Plaintiff relies on several e-mails sent by Mr. Barton in late 2012 as evidence that Mr. Barton was aware of the basis for his counterclaims at that time.

[Doc. 75 at 31]. Defendant Barton alleges that he suffered damages from this breach, namely, not receiving his portion of the profits that Vanquish Afghanistan should have earned for performing missions under the NAT contract. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendants state that they were awarded the NAT contract in August 2011. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25]. Defendants further state that \"[s]hortly after award of the NAT contract, Barton traveled to Afghanistan. Upon his arrival, Plaintiff refused to allow [Vanquish Afghanistan] to perform trucking missions[.]\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26]. Defendants allege that, thereafter, Mr. Barton and Mr. Koshani entered into a Profit Sharing Agreement (\"PSA\") and, later, a Partnership Agreement, which incorporated an agreement as to the use of Vanquish Afghanistan as a trucking subcontractor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27]. Defendants allege that only after the PSA and Partnership Agreement were executed did Mr. Barton learn that Mr. Koshani did not truly intend for Vanquish Afghanistan to perform any trucking missions, and instead, gave every trucking mission to USC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's only argument that Count 1 is barred by the statute of limitations is that, based on the language of the counterclaim, this alleged breach occurred \"[s]hortly after award of the NAT contract ... which occurred in August 2011.\" [Doc. 204 at 2]. However, this is a mischaracterization of the allegations in the counter-complaint. The counter-complaint clearly states that, after Defendants first learned that Plaintiff would not allow Vanquish Afghanistan to act as a trucking subcontractor, which was discovered shortly after award of the NAT contract, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into several agreements between themselves on the matter. The counterclaim for breach of contract asserts that Plaintiff later breached these\n   agreements, when he did not allow Vanquish Afghanistan to complete any trucking missions. No time frame for the discovery of this information is mentioned in the counter-complaint, nor is this addressed by any of the parties in their briefings regarding this motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court acknowledges that there may be evidence in the record establishing that Mr. Barton became aware of Mr. Koshani's failure to provide trucking services under the PSA or Partnership Agreement at some point beyond the applicable six-year limitations period. However, because Plaintiff, as the moving party, bears the burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of material fact at the summary judgment stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court will not search for evidence that the Plaintiff has not identified, even if such would support dismissal of the counterclaim. Accordingly, because Plaintiff's only argument that Counterclaim 1 is barred by the statute of limitations is based on an inaccurate summary of the counterclaim, the motion for summary judgment will be denied on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Counterclaims 4 and 5, Defendants allege Plaintiff interfered with the Defendants' NAT contract by providing \"false information to the U.S. Government regarding ownership of Defendant Vanquish, who was the proper party to the NAT Contract, and the circumstances under which the NAT Contract award was made.\" [Doc. 75 at 33-35]. In Claim 7, Defendants allege that Plaintiff conspired with his brother Jawid to make these false statements to the government and interfere with the NAT contract.

Mr. Barton stated: \"I understand you have contacted the contracting officer and other officials in Kabul.\" He further stated \"I have been informed that you are claiming to own Vanquish Worldwide, LLC, the United States company,\" and asked for confirmation of such. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 6, 2012, Mr. Barton e-mailed Major Marian Feist, copying the contracting officer Effie Fragogiannis. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22]. Mr. Barton stated: \"there is something holding up our invoices.\" Mr. Barton then provided an update of matters that had recently occurred with Mr. Koshani. Mr. Barton stated that \"Koshani has requested that I pay him profits from the American business that I own\" and \"has claimed that he is entitled to payments because his name is on the Afghan license.\" Mr. Barton also stated that he was aware that Mr. Koshani had \"emailed your office that he is somehow in charge of my business, owned and operated 100% by me since June of 2007.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On November 13, 2012, Mr. Barton e-mailed Ms. Fragogiannis, requesting a conference call about the suspension, and noting that his company had no performance issues \"minus Shafiq's ability to interfere with our contract.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60]. In another e-mail that same day, which Mr. Barton sent to Ms. Fragogiannis, Mr. Barton stated that Mr. Koshani \"has interfered with our business and our employees.\" He stated that Mr. Koshani's \"claims are false and without merit, but they continue to impact my prime contract.\" Mr. Barton stated that Mr. Koshani had started two other websites using Vanquish United States's logos, pictures, wording, etc. and had obtained numerous licenses\n   with the Vanquish corporate name in different variations. Mr. Barton also noted that Mr. Koshani had \"asked his brothers, both Farid and Jawid, to meet with me in Dubai and demand I put bank accounts in overseas countries and that I sign an agreement listing him as the owner of my business.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Mr. Barton stated that he felt he was being extorted, and concluded that \"[i]t is unbelievable that Shafiq has been able to interfere with my business to the extent he has thus far.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court is convinced that by at least November of 2012, Mr. Barton was aware of \"facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he [or she] has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct,\" as to Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redwing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316211\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/436/#p459\">\n    363 S.W.3d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Mr. Barton specifically alleged that Mr. Koshani was \"interfer[ing] with our contract,\" when e-mailing U.S. military officials in November. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 205-1 at 60]. As to Counterclaim 7, the conspiracy claim, it is also clear that by November 2012 Mr. Barton was aware that Mr. Koshani had involved his brother Jawid to some extent, as Mr. Barton specifically states that Mr. Koshani had asked Jawid to meet Mr. Barton and ask him to sign an agreement listing Mr. Koshani as an owner of Vanquish United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants appear to contest whether these e-mails are sufficient to show that Mr. Barton knew that Mr. Koshani's actions were the cause of the government's suspension of Vanquish United States, however, the context of the October and November e-mails make clear that Mr. Barton was contacting government officials, and providing details about the conflict with Mr. Koshani, because he believed that such conflict was relevant to Vanquish United States' suspension. There is no other reasonable interpretation of Mr. Barton's language in the November e-mail, asserting that Mr. Koshani was interfering with \"our\" contract, which clearly refers to the NAT contract between Defendants and the United States government. Moreover, to the extent that the Defendants assert that they did not learn of \"the content of Mr. Koshani's discussions with the Government; Mr. Koshani's false statements to the Government that Mr. Barton won award of the NAT Contract by fraudulently using the AISA license of VW-A or otherwise; or that Mr. Koshani had asked the Government officials to suspend NAT Contract payments to Vanquish - US,\" which were \"facts that are critical to the viability of Defendants' claims,\" [doc. 206 at 5, n.6], such information was not necessary for the limitations period to begin running. As noted above, \"the discovery rule is not intended to permit a plaintiff to delay filing suit until the discovery of all the facts that affect the merits of his or her claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redwing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316211\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/436/#p459\">\n    363 S.W.3d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because Mr. Barton had information sufficient to alert a reasonable person of the need to investigate the injury in November 2012, the limitations period began to run at that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860727\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/464/599/#p608\">\n    464 S.W.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Defendants had three years from this time to file these claims for interference with contract and conspiracy. However, Defendants waited until August 2017 to raise their interference with contract claims, and July 2018 to raise the conspiracy claim. Both of these dates are well after the three-year statute of limitations expired. Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7 are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Counterclaim 6\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In Counterclaim 6, Defendants allege that Jawid Koshani breached the the NDA that he signed with Vanquish United States, by conspiring with Plaintiff to solicit,\n   divert, or appropriate the NAT contract. [Doc. 75 at 35-36]. Defendants assert that Plaintiff intentionally induced Jawid's breach of the NDA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In arguing that Counterclaim 6 is barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations, Plaintiff lumps Counterclaim 6 with Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7. However, the Court is not convinced that Mr. Barton's knowledge, as exemplified by his September, October, and November 2012 e-mails, was sufficient to establish that a reasonable person would have known of the injury alleged in Counterclaim 6, and thus, been on notice of the need to investigate further. The Court notes that the November 2012 e-mail did indicate that Mr. Barton was aware at that time that Plaintiff had asked both of his brothers, including Jawid, to meet with Mr. Barton and ask him to sign an agreement to list Mr. Koshani as an owner of Vanquish United States. However, it is not clear from the text of the e-mails that Mr. Barton knew of conduct on behalf of Jawid that necessarily rose to the level of a breach of the NDA. Moreover, the parties do not provide any further argument as to this issue, and the Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the Court is unwilling to say that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Counterclaim 6 is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, the motion for summary judgment will be denied as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure provide a plethora of ways that Defendants could have served a complaint upon Plaintiff, even while Plaintiff was residing in a foreign country. Notably, the rule allows service through delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual personally. Given the scenario here, there is no clear reason why Defendants could not have had Mr. Koshani personally served with a summons and complaint. Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendants ever contacted the Afghanistan government to inquire about serving Plaintiff in Afghanistan, nor did the Defendants ever file any requests regarding such in this Court. Instead, Defendants merely waited until Plaintiff had filed suit against them to formulate and file their counterclaims against Plaintiff.

But those allegations are that Plaintiff secretly communicated with government officials, and did not inform Mr. Barton of these communications. There is absolutely no evidence indicating that Plaintiff did not inform Mr. Barton of these communications with a specific intent to prevent Mr. Barton from timely filing a complaint based upon his actions. Defendants position both stretches the doctrine of equitable estoppel too far, and assumes too much from the available facts. Accordingly, the Court finds that equitable estoppel is not applicable, and the applicable statutes of limitations were not tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, the evidence presented shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7 are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, the motion for summary judgment will be granted as to Counterclaims 4, 5, and 7, and those counterclaims will be dismissed. However, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Counterclaims 1 and 6 are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, and the motion for summary judgment will be denied as to those counterclaims on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proximate Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that, as to Counterclaims 2-7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no admissible evidence that his communications and alleged false statements to the government were the proximate cause of the government's suspension of Vanquish United States. [Doc. 204 at 4]. Plaintiff complains extensively that the Defendants sought a trial continuance to obtain discovery from government officials on this issue, but never made any effort to obtain such discovery after receiving the continuance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6]. Defendants respond that there is sufficient evidence that Plaintiff was a cause of the suspension, and the law does not require a showing that he was the only cause. [Doc. 206 at 15-18]. Plaintiff replies that all of Defendants' evidence is hearsay, and therefore, cannot be considered on summary judgment. [Doc. 211 at 7-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The entire argument on this issue is premised on Plaintiff's assertion that, for each of Counterclaims 2-7, Defendants \"must prove (1) that Mr. Koshani's actions were the proximate cause of the Government's October 2012 suspension of Vanquish[.]\" [Doc. 204 at 4]. However, the Court is not convinced that such a showing is required as to Counterclaims 3 or 6. Specifically, Counterclaim 3 is a claim for misuse of partnership assets, in which Defendants allege that Plaintiff used partnership assets to acquire a license for a sole proprietorship, which he allegedly then used to \"try to steal the NAT Contract.\" [Doc. 75 at 33]. Additionally, as discussed above, Counterclaim 6 relates to an allegation that Plaintiff induced his brother Jawid to breach the NDA between Jawid and Vanquish United States by participating in the alleged scheme to steal the NAT contract. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36]. That Plaintiff's actions were the proximate cause of the government's suspension of Vanquish United States is not a required element for either\n   Counterclaim 3 or 6. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment on this ground will be denied as to Counterclaims 3 and 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, Counterclaim 2 alleges that Mr. Koshani breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between himself and Mr. Barton through his actions in which he attempted to \"steal the NAT Contract.\" [Doc. 75 at 32]. Notably, in Tennessee, a claim \"based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not a stand alone claim; rather, it is part of an overall breach of contract claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Cadence Bank, N.A. v. The Alpha Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839161\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/756/#p773\">\n    473 S.W.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although neither party addresses this issue, the Court is disinclined to believe that a showing that Mr. Koshani's actions were the proximate cause of Vanquish United States's suspension is a required element for Counterclaim 2, which is in essence, subsumed by Counterclaim 1. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment on this ground will be denied as to Counterclaim 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Recoverable Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff next contends that, as to Counterclaims 2-7, Defendants have already recovered their alleged damages. [Doc. 204 at 8-10]. Plaintiff states that, through an appeal before the ASBCA, involving Vanquish United States's suspension, a settlement was reached and Defendants recovered the full amount of their claim against the government. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Defendants respond that their ASBCA complaint alleged damages of $ 31,004,528 plus interest and attorneys' fees, and an additional claim of $ 6,296,836.77, which they ultimately settled for $ 30 million, which was less than the total value of the claims. [Doc. 206 at 19]. Plaintiff replies that Defendants' own expert computed the claimed damages as a subcomponent of the $ 30 million received from the government. [Doc. 211 at 10-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As with the argument regarding proximate cause, the entire argument on damages lumps together Counterclaims 2-7 as all claiming damages from Vanquish United States' suspension. However, the Court is not convinced that Counterclaims 2, 3, or 6 are tied to damages from Vanquish United States' suspension. The relevant damages for Counterclaim 3 (misuse of partnership assets) would be the amount of partnership assets allegedly misused by Plaintiff to obtain a license for a sole proprietorship. Additionally, the relevant damages for Counterclaim 6 (statutory liability for inducement of breach of NDA) would potentially include any penalty for breach of the NDA. Finally, the damages from Counterclaim 2 are tied to the damages from Counterclaim 1, as a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not a stand-alone claim in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cadence Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839161\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/756/#p773\">\n    473 S.W.3d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Doc. 204 at 10-12]. Plaintiff states that, under Tennessee law, the law of the state with the \"most significant relationship\" to the tort is the applicable law. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11]. Plaintiff asserts that Afghanistan has the most significant relationship to the tort claims here, but Afghanistan does not recognize a claim for tortious interference with contract. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendants respond that Tennessee law is the applicable law,\n   because Mr. Barton mostly communicated with Plaintiff from Tennessee, Vanquish United States was paid into a Tennessee bank account, and the injury alleged occurred in Tennessee.

R. Civ. P. 44.1.

While Rule 44.1 allows the Court to independently research the foreign law at issue, the plain language of the Rule does not impose a duty on the Court to research foreign law where the parties have provided little to no guidance to the Court, as is the case here. The only evidence of the relevant legal principles under Afghanistan law that Plaintiff has submitted is a brief excerpt of a translated copy of the Commercial Code of the Republic of Afghanistan, produced by Stanford Law School's Afghanistan Legal Education Project. [Doc. 204-1 at 15-22]. Such document alone, without any testimony or citation to provide context, is insufficient. Accordingly, the Court finds that summary judgment is inappropriate for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff relies on this two-page excerpt of the translated\n   Afghanistan Commercial Code as evidence that no claims for interference with contract or conspiracy exist under Afghanistan law. However, Article 56 states \"[a]ny deception and conspiracy in commercial affairs shall be prohibited[.]\" [Doc. 204-1 at 21]. Without any further context, such provision would appear to support claims for interference with contract and conspiracy.
