Hunt Gwyn (\"Judge Gwyn\"), Judge Christopher W. Bragg (\"Judge Bragg\"), J.R. Rowell (\"Rowell\"), and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"; collectively, \"defendants\"), alleging that defendants violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") [D.E. 1]. On July 25, 2018, the EEOC moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim [D.E. 14] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 15]. On August 15, 2018, Crowder responded in opposition [D.E. 18]. On August 22, 2018, the EEOC replied [D.E. 20]. On July 26, 2018, NCAOC, Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and Rowell moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim [D.E. 16] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 17]. On August 16, 2018, Crowder responded in opposition [D.E. 19]. As explained below, the court grants the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 1, 1993, Crowder became a magistrate in Judicial District 20-B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [D.E. 1] \u00b6 11. She served as a magistrate for six consecutive terms from 1993 until 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In 2010, Judge Bragg, who was the Chief District Court Judge of Judicial District 20-B, appointed Crowder as Chief Magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. In 2011, Judge Gwyn became the Chief District Court Judge of Judicial District 20-B and reappointed Crowder as Chief Magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. On December 31, 2016, Crowder's term as Chief Magistrate ended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia's marriage laws were unconstitutional to the extent that the laws \"prevent[ed] same-sex couples from marrying and prohibit[ed] Virginia from recognizing same-sex couples' lawful out-of-state marriages.\"\n   <em>\n    Bostic v.

Federal district courts in North Carolina then applied that holding to North Carolina's marriage laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher-Borne v.

Because North Carolina law empowers magistrates to perform marriages, on October 13 and 14, 2014, NCAOC issued\n   guidance to magistrates concerning these decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014, Gayle Myrick (\"Myrick\") was a magistrate in Union County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. When Myrick received NCAOC's guidance, she felt that compliance would violate her First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Thus, Myrick sought an accommodation from Judge Gwyn, her supervisor, to avoid participation as a magistrate in a same-sex marriage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. When Myrick did not receive any accommodation, she resigned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Myrick then filed a charge with EEOC that alleged that the events leading to her resignation constituted religious discrimination in violation of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. The EEOC determined that the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991 (\"GERA\"), not Title VII, applied to Myrick and, following the procedures in GERA, appointed an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") to adjudicate her claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. After investigation, the ALJ found that Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and NCAOC discriminated against Myrick based on her religion, and the parties eventually resolved the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Crowder testified as part of the ALJ's investigation into Myrick's religious discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Crowder did not believe that her testimony would jeopardize her renomination to a new term as Chief Magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Crowder testified that, in her opinion, the Union County magistrates' office could have accommodated Myrick's request for an accommodation for at least a few months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Crowder alleges that the ALJ relied on Crowder's testimony to find that Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and NCAOC had engaged in religious discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Crowder alleges that her testimony caused Judges Gwyn and Bragg to retaliate against her by not renominating her for a new term as Chief Magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Crowder alleges that, within a few weeks of her testimony, Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and Rowell began to collect information concerning Crowder to justify their decision not to reappoint her to a new term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. For example, on September 30, 2016, Judge Gwyn met with law enforcement officers to gather information concerning Crowder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and Rowell allegedly learned of several complaints against Crowder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-37. Although the alleged conduct described in the complaints predated Crowder's testimony in the Myrick investigation, defendants did not address the complaints before December 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Judge Gwyn, Judge Bragg, and Rowell informed Crowder that Rowell would not renominate her for a new term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. They did not explain the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   During Crowder's time as magistrate, all eligible magistrates who did not resign or retire had been renominated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Thus, Crowder had expected to serve a new term because she was 55-years-old and did not plan to retire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43. A 24-year-old white woman whose mother works with Rowell replaced Crowder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Crowder is African-American.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 15, 2016, as part of the Myrick investigation, Judge Gwyn testified that Myrick, Crowder, and another magistrate came into his office and that either Myrick or the other magistrate stated that \"in Union County there are some parts of those federal laws that we don't follow, quite like they do in other places.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Judge Gwyn was surprised that magistrates under his supervision felt that way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   On September 7, 2016, Judge Gwyn testified that this statement caused him concern over whether the magistrates under\n   his supervision would disregard other controversial areas of federal law, such as the Fourth Amendment's probable cause requirement for search warrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Gwyn also could not remember if Crowder had chastised Myrick for not coming to her before seeking an accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Crowder testified that she did not say that magistrates in Union County do not always follow federal law and that she personally would follow federal law to the best of her abilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Crowder did not remember anyone making that statement during the meeting with Judge Gwyn and also did not remember scolding Myrick for not coming to her before seeking an accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure tests subject-matter jurisdiction, which is the court's \"statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.
