Defendant contends this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction based on the discretionary function exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). For the reasons set forth below, the court DENIES defendant's motion to dismiss in part and GRANTS it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2015, the United States Forest Service (USFS) was overseeing the execution of the 2015 El Dorado County Pile Burn Prescribed Fire Plan (the \"Burn Plan\"), which called for prescribed burns in portions of forest lands in and around South Lake Tahoe. Mot., ECF No. 27-1, at 11\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (the \"Basin\") is one of the forests included in the Burn Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387485\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/637/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One of the prescribed burns in the Basin took place in what USFS called \"Meow 175,\" an area spanning roughly nine acres in South Lake Tahoe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.

Mot. at 15. He suffered second- and third-degree burns when his sled stopped over the remains of Meow 175, which had been covered by a recent snowfall. Opp'n at 14. Plaintiff contends he never saw any of USFS's notifications warning of the burn. Opp'n at 13 (citing Ruffino Dep., ECF No. 28-18, at 45 :22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff brought the instant suit against the United States on November 11, 2016, bringing a single claim and alleging USFS negligently managed the prescribed burn at Meow 175. Compl., ECF No.1, \u00b6\u00b6 6-31. On May 18, 2018, the United States brought the pending motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, alleging that USFS is protected by sovereign immunity under the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. Mot. at 5. Plaintiff opposes, arguing that USFS violated mandatory and specific policies in the Interagency Prescribed Fire Planning and Implementation Guide (\"PMS 484\") by failing to have a qualified employee oversee the Meow 175 burn and failing to perform a public safety risk assessment, and that USFS's failure to warn the public of a concealed hazard is not\n   protected by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Opp'n.

Because the United States moves to dismiss based on the FTCA's \"discretionary function\" exception, the court looks to applicable statutes, regulations or policies to decide whether the United States retained discretion to act.

The government cites a declaration by John Washington, the Forest Prescribed Fire and Fuels Specialist on the Basin unit, who explains that Basin staff \"do not return to on-going prescribed fire project sites to place additional signs or provide additional warnings after a snow storm,\" because \"snowstorms are not uncommon\" in the area and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [r]equiring personnel to return to each project site in patrol status to place additional signs or make other warnings after a snow storm ... would significantly reduce the time fire crews have available to actually conduct prescribed fires and would directly reduce the total number of prescribed fires [Basin] staff are able to complete each season.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Supp'l Washington Decl., ECF No. 29-1, \u00b6 3. In other words, given the time constraints imposed by weather conditions and limited resources, the USFS decided not to post signs following a snowfall, after weighing the number of prescribed fires against public safety risks.
