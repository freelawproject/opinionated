(Compl. (Dkt. No. 1).) Wigington amended his complaint on January 17, 2018 to add as defendants MNAA Board members Bobby Joslin and A. Dexter Samuels (together \"Individual Defendants\"). (Dkt. No. 13.) MNAA answered Wigington's initial complaint and counterclaimed against him on February 1, 2018, alleging breach of fiduciary duty. (Dkt. No. 17.) Following additional amendments, the pleadings now operative are Wigington's second amended complaint (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") (Dkt. No. 34) ), and MNAA's renewed answer and counterclaim, (Answer to Pl.'s Second Am. Compl. and Am. Countercl. (\"Am. Countercl.\") (Dkt. No. 36) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before us are two motions: Individual Defendants' motion to dismiss Wigington's claims as to them, (Dkt. No. 37), and Wigington's motion to dismiss MNAA's amended counterclaim, (Dkt. No. 39). For the reasons below, we deny the Individual Defendants' motion, and grant Wigington's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The factual allegations that follow, all taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss, are drawn from Wigington's second amended complaint and MNAA's corresponding counterclaim.

MNAA policies are shaped by a ten-member Board of Commissioners (\"Board\"), appointed by the mayor of Nashville-Davidson County. (SAC \u00b6 20.) The Board's Management Committee is comprised of the Chair, Vice Chair, and Secretary of the full Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of the filing of the second amended complaint, Defendant Joslin served as the Board's Chair and Defendant Samuels served as Vice Chair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wigington began his work with MNAA in 2011 and served as CEO from July 1, 2012 through October 18, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) On June 7, 2017, Wigington informed the MNAA Management Committee at a publicly noticed meeting that he would require a medical leave of absence to undergo a liver transplant to treat liver cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 33-35.) Wigington informed the full Board of his anticipated leave on June 21, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wigington's medical leave began on July 22, 2017, when he underwent a liver transplant and named an acting President and CEO to serve in the interim, and it extended through September 5, 2017, when he attempted to return to his position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 54-56.) On August 18, 2017, Wigington had written to inform MNAA that a doctor had approved his return to work on September 4, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) On September 1, 2017, Samuels invited Wigington to a meeting of the Management Committee on September 5, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) At this meeting, the Management Committee told Wigington that MNAA had decided to go in a different direction and would be relieving Wigington of his duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) Wigington alleges that this meeting was not publicly noticed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Joslin sent Wigington a letter on September 6, 2017, explaining that Wigington was no longer authorized to act on behalf of MNAA and that his security badge, computer, and email address were deactivated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 18, 2017, the MNAA Management Committee (comprised of the Individual Defendants and Secretary Aubrey \"Trey\" Harwell) voted to recommend that the Board terminate Wigington's employment as CEO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) Upon their recommendation, the Board voted to terminate that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   92.) The Management Committee distributed to Board members and the media a list of \"reported behaviors\" they attributed to Wigington to support his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) Among the allegations were that Wigington failed to disclose the content or amount of incentives provided to an airline to fly out of Nashville, that he was dilatory in appointing key staff positions during a large capital effort and improperly planned for the succession of those staff once they were named, and that he lacked proper financial controls, failed to address major employment and management issues, and failed to properly communicate or deliberately concealed information from the MNAA Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 134, 156, 171, 193, 209.) Wigington alleges that each of these reported behaviors are false, did not motivate MNAA's termination decision, and could not justify that decision. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-101\">\n    \u00b6 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 6, 2017, the Individual Defendants, acting as the Management Committee, voted to recommend to the Board that Wigington's termination be reclassified as \"for cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-04.) The Individual Defendants and another member of the Management Committee described new allegations against Wigington, along with the previously released \"reported behaviors,\" at this meeting and again at a Board meeting on December 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) The new allegations asserted that Wigington did not properly invest $ 200 million from a 2015 bond issue and that he exceeded reimbursements on business travel expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 234, 237.) The Board took up the Management Committee's recommendation and voted to label Wigington's termination as \"for cause\" at the meeting on December 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Wigington maintains that the new allegations did not and could not justify his termination \"for cause,\" and served instead only as pretext for a decision that he alleges is retaliatory and meant to harm his reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 244.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As relevant here, Wigington asserts claims of defamation and false light invasion of privacy against the Individual Defendants, in their individual capacity, stemming from their statements and actions during the Management Committee and Board meetings on October 18, 2017, the Management Committee meeting on December 6, 2017, and the Board meeting on December 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-101\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 330-35,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-4-101\">\n    339-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   MNAA's counterclaims charge Wigington with breach of his fiduciary duty to MNAA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 37.) MNAA alleges that in December 2015, Wigington should have placed proceeds from an approximately $ 200 million MNAA bond issue into interest-bearing investments instead of leaving the decision to a subordinate who kept the money, plus a substantial amount of previously accumulated money, in cash or cash equivalents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-19.) Despite specific advice from MNAA's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), Wigington refused to make a decision to hire consultants or persons with expertise to manage MNAA's assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Wigington did not act when investment advisors tendered proposals to MNAA in December 2015 and December 2016 to invest the money, costing MNAA at least $ 3 million total in lost interest income. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-43.) The CFO also told Wigington of a time-sensitive opportunity in fall 2016 to refinance debt incurred from designing and building a rental car facility, which Wigington decided not to act upon, costing MNAA approximately $ 4.8 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-29.) Through these events, MNAA claims Wigington breached his fiduciary duty by failing to discharge his duties in good faith and with ordinary care, failing to inform himself of important decisions or to rely upon information provided to him by officers or employees of MNAA, and failing to fully disclose the facts of his decisions or non-decisions to the Board.

Wigington alleges that Individual Defendants presented a list of \"reported behaviors\" to the MNAA Board and the press, first to justify his termination, and then, along with additional allegations, to justify his firing \"for cause.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 330-34, 339-43.) Wigington further alleges that the \"reported behaviors\" were false, and that Individual Defendants knew they were false. For example, one of the \"reported behaviors\" was that Wigington failed to disclose the content of negotiations or the amount of incentives provided to British Airways to establish a direct route to London. (SAC \u00b6 112.) Wigington alleges that, on the contrary, he did disclose the negotiations and incentives, and that Individual Defendants were kept continuously informed of both. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-19, 125-27.) Wigington alleges that the allegation publicized by Individual Defendants \"has no basis in fact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-32.) For another example, when the Board decided to classify Wigington's termination \"for cause,\" Wigington alleges that the Management Committee claimed Wigington \"exceeded reimbursements permitted by policy\" on his business travel expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 237.) Wigington alleges he in fact followed MNAA's travel policy and chose only the most cost-effective mode of travel and lodging, and that the Management Committee had never raised business expense issues during any previous discussions or Board meetings or during Wigington's initial termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 240-43.) Wigington claims that this allegation publicized by Individual Defendants \"has no basis in fact\" and was \"merely pretext\" to reclassify his termination as \"for cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 244.)

WIGINGTON'S MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTERCLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Wigington moves to dismiss MNAA's amended counterclaims. (Dkt. No. 39.) He advances several grounds for dismissal, including that the statute of limitations bars MNAA's claims, that MNAA fails to make out a prima facie case of breach of fiduciary duty, and that his decision as to the refinancing of debt from the car rental facility is protected by the business judgment rule. (Counter-Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Counterclaims (\"Wigington Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 40) 5-15.) Wigington also asserts that MNAA's counterclaims should be dismissed because they constitute unlawful retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5.) Because we find that MNAA's counterclaims\n   as pleaded are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, we address only those arguments in the following analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Wigington argues that MNAA's counterclaims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary duty actions under Tennessee law. (Wigington Mem. at 5.) Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 48-18-601 defines the applicable statute of limitations in this case and states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Any action alleging breach of fiduciary duties by directors or officers...must be brought within one (1) year from the date of such breach or violation; provided, that in the event the alleged breach or violation is not discovered nor reasonably should have been discovered within the one-year period, the period of limitation shall be one (1) year from the date such was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. In no event shall any such action be brought more than three (3) years after the date on which the breach or violation occurred, [except for claims of fraudulent concealment, not alleged here]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048-18-601\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 48-18-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MNAA does not dispute that this statute governs the limitations period for its counterclaims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MNAA's Resp. to Wigington's Mot. to Dismiss Countercl. (\"MNAA Resp.\") (Dkt. No. 43) 16.) \"[W]hile a defendant ordinarily has the burden to establish its statute of limitations defense, when the court can ascertain from the complaint that the period for bringing the claim has expired, a plaintiff must affirmatively plead an exception to the limitations statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

The Tennessee statute codifies the discovery rule, \"an equitable exception that tolls the running of the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763501\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/499/520/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763501\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/499/520/#p526\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pero's Steak &amp; Spaghetti House v.

However, to get the benefit of the discovery rule, a plaintiff must plead either that the alleged breach of duty was discovered within the one-year statute of limitations or that the wrongdoing could not reasonably have been discovered within the limitations period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 526.) Since MNAA filed its counterclaims on February 1, 2018, (Dkt. No. 17), MNAA must plead that Wigington's breaches occurred on or after February 1, 2017, or that MNAA did not discover nor could have reasonably discovered Wigington's breaches until after February 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763501\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/499/520/#p526\">\n    499 F. App'x at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Wigington argues that the allegations in MNAA's counterclaims all, on their face, occurred outside the limitations period. (Wigington Mem. at 6.) Wigington further argues that because the counterclaims are facially time-barred, MNAA is responsible for pleading facts that would excuse the delay under Tennessee law, but fails to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; Reply in Supp. of Counter-Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Wigington Reply\") (Dkt. No. 47) 2.) MNAA asserts that Wigington mischaracterizes its counterclaims as discrete events and urges that its counterclaims instead allege an ongoing pattern of continuing violations, such that no cause of action would have accrued until Wigington was relieved of his duties as CEO in July 2017. (MNAA Resp. at 13-14.) MNAA also argues that it is entitled to tolling under the statutory discovery rule and that Wigington's statute of limitations arguments require factual development that counsels against dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   MNAA's counterclaims allege facts that all on their face occur outside of the one-year limitations period. MNAA alleges that, in December 2015, Wigington should have decided how to invest approximately $ 200 million in bond issue proceeds instead of leaving the decision to a subordinate who chose a cash-equivalent investment\n   that yielded lower returns for MNAA. (Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 17-18.) Also in December 2015, and again in December 2016, MNAA alleges Wigington failed to act on a professional financial advisor's tender of financial services to manage MNAA's bond issue and other cash-equivalent assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-24, 40-43.) Finally, MNAA claims that Wigington decided in the fall of 2016 not to pursue an opportunity to refinance debt incurred from the building of the car rental facility at MNAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-29, 44-45.) None of these allegations occur on or after February 1, 2017, the start of the limitations period in this case. Indeed, the only factual allegation in MNAA's counterclaims that occurs within the limitations period is Wigington's date of termination, October 18, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) It is thus apparent that no events forming the basis of MNAA's counterclaims took place within the one-year limitations period for breach of fiduciary duty called for by Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 48-18-601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MNAA argues that Wigington misconstrues MNAA's counterclaims, which should be read as one continuous violation extending through the end of Wigington's active tenure as CEO in July 2017, thus rendering the counterclaims timely or tolling the statute of limitations. (MNAA Resp. at 13-14.) The \"continuing violation\" or \"ongoing violation\" doctrine is most often invoked in discrimination actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n   <em>\n    Sharpe v. Cureton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329316\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/259/#p267\">\n    319 F.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (6th Cir. 2003), although it has been extended to other areas of the law as well.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n, Inc. v.

Ohio 2010) ).) However, we need not decide whether the doctrine applies to fiduciary duty claims, because we find that MNAA has alleged a series of breaches that would make the doctrine inapplicable in any event. Nowhere in its counterclaims does MNAA allege that Wigington's breaches continued until he was removed from his position as CEO. The allegations instead allege a series of discrete decisions or non-decisions that all occur outside the limitations period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 25-29, 40-43.) MNAA itself characterizes Wigington's alleged misconduct as a \"series of inactions,\" a \"pattern of inactions,\" and a \"pattern of breach,\" language that suggests a series of violations instead of one continuing breach. (MNAA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Resp. at 13, 14.) A series of breaches does not constitute a continuing violation.\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p114\">\n    536 U.S. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p114\">\n    122 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2072-73 ;\n   <em>\n    Sharpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329316\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/259/#p267\">\n    319 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Alternatively, MNAA argues that its counterclaims trigger the discovery rule codified in Tennessee's fiduciary duty statute of limitations. Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 48-18-601 (\"[I]n the event the alleged breach or violation is not discovered nor reasonably should have been discovered within the one-year period, the period of limitation shall be one (1) year from the date such was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered.\") (MNAA Resp. at 15-18.) Because Wigington's alleged wrongdoing all occurred outside of the one-year period in MNAA's counterclaims, MNAA must establish why a tolling exception should apply in its pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763501\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/499/520/#p526\">\n    499 F.

(MNAA Resp. at 17.) Before that date, MNAA argues, only Wigington himself knew of his breaches of duty, and he should not be able to impute knowledge of his own breaches to MNAA as a corporate entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MNAA pinpoints one specific allegation to support the argument that MNAA could not have discovered Wigington's misdeeds before his departure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Wigington failed or refused to fully disclose these facts to the Board of Commissioners, thereby breaching his duty to fully disclose the information that properly should have been presented to the Board of Commissioners, thereby breaching his fiduciary duties.

Countercl. \u00b6 46), only says that Wigington did not fully disclose information to the Board, but says nothing about when the Board discovered Wigington's alleged breaches. (Wigington Reply at 5.) Moreover, Wigington asserts that MNAA's counterclaims disclose that another agent of MNAA-the Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\")-had continuous knowledge of Wigington's allegedly dilatory actions, and whose knowledge could indeed be imputed to MNAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Wigington has the better of this argument. MNAA fails to allege facts that support the notion that it did not or could not have discovered Wigington's breaches of duty until after he was relieved as CEO. The one allegation MNAA identifies that suggests the Board did not have full knowledge of Wigington's actions does not say anything about when the Board became aware of actionable facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Countercl. \u00b6 46.) \"Where, as here, defendants have highlighted the apparent untimeliness of the complaint, plaintiffs may not simply rely on the bare assertion that they were unaware of the facts underlying their cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

MNAA's allegations reveal that its CFO both knew of and advised Wigington of the facts surrounding Wigington's alleged failure to invest cash and cash equivalents at all relevant times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wigington Reply at 5 n.1 (citing Am. Countercl.).) The CFO furnished Wigington with quarterly reports that \"described how much money MNAA had sitting in cash or cash equivalents.\" (Am.

The CFO \"specifically advised\" Wigington \"that MNAA did not have executives or managers with sufficient knowledge or skill\" to invest MNAA's cash-on-hand wisely. (Am. Countercl. \u00b6 22.) The CFO informed Wigington in the fall of 2016 of the opportunity to refinance debt on MNAA's rental car facility, and Wigington told the CFO directly to \"hold on\" with the refinancing, eventually instructing the CFO to cease the effort altogether.

The counterclaims thus allege on their face that MNAA's CFO knew facts that would give rise to the claim of breach of fiduciary duty for all alleged wrongdoing, all of which occurred outside the limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, MNAA alleges that another of its agents, \"an employee subordinate\" of Wigington's, necessarily knew of Wigington's alleged failure to select an investment vehicle for MNAA's $ 200 million bond issue because the employee was tasked with making the\n   final call as late as January 2016. (Am. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The knowledge of these agents is imputed to the principal even if not specifically communicated to it.\n   <em>\n    Griffith Motors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9936254\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/319/#p322\">\n    633 S.W.2d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MNAA's counterclaims thus allege that MNAA had contemporaneous constructive knowledge of Wigington's breaches as they happened. \"[A] plaintiff cannot be permitted to wait until he knows all of the injurious effects or consequences of an actionable wrong to delay the accrual of a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Cavalier Metal Corp. v.

App. 1986) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   MNAA argues that resting our decision on statute of limitations grounds is inappropriate because it requires a factual inquiry. (MNAA Resp. at 18.) Although dismissing pleadings as barred by the statute of limitations is generally disfavored, \"sometimes the allegations in the complaint affirmatively show that the claim is time-barred. When that is the case, as it is here, dismissing the claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Cataldo v. U.S. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755565\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/542/#p547\">\n    676 F.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (6th Cir. 2012). We have determined that MNAA's counterclaims affirmatively show that each alleged breach of fiduciary duty occurred prior to the applicable limitations period, and fails to establish a tolling exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We therefore conclude that MNAA's counterclaims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 48-18-601, and we grant Wigington's motion to dismiss. Because it appears MNAA may not simply re-plead its counterclaims by removing its agents from the picture, we do so with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Individual Defendants Joslin and Samuels' motion to dismiss Wigington's claims as to them is denied, (Dkt. No. 37), and Wigington's motion to dismiss MNAA's amended counterclaim is granted with prejudice, (Dkt. No. 39). It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The current motions do not challenge Wigington's claims against MNAA, which allege federal and state discrimination and retaliation claims and state contract claims.
