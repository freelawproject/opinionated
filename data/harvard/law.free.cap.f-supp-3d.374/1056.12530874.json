INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on the parties' motions for summary judgment. Dkt. ## 22, 26. For the reasons below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Concerned about the effect of auctioning technology on their ability to find affordable housing, students at the University of Washington petitioned the Seattle City Council (the \"City Council\") in January 2018. Dkt. # 27, \u00b6 2; Dkt. # 27-1. They called on the City Council to enact legislation banning the use of \"online bidding services\" to set rent prices within its borders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. # 27-2. After considering the matter, the City Council passed Ordinance No. 125551 (the \"ordinance\") in March 2018. Dkt. # 22-1. The ordinance adds Section 7.24.090 to the Seattle Municipal Code, which reads in part: \"Landlords and potential tenants are prohibited from using rental housing bidding platform for real property located in Seattle city limits.\" Dkt. # 22-1 at 6. The ordinance expires automatically after one year unless the City Council exercises its authority under Section 7.24.090.C to extend the prohibition for an additional twelve months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 7.24.090.C permits an extension if Defendant City of Seattle requests more time to complete its study into the potential effects of auctioning technology on the Seattle rental market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Rentberry, Inc. is a startup company that uses bidding technology to assist landlords and potential tenants in facilitating rental transactions. Dkt. # 22-5, \u00b6 2. Rentberry claims that it would open its website to Seattle property listings but for the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Delaney Wysingle owns a rental property in Seattle. Dkt. # 22-4. He began remodeling his rental property in March 2018 and would ultimately like to use Rentberry to find a tenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 23, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a suit against the City of Seattle (the \"City\") for declaratory and injunctive relief. Dkt. # 1. Plaintiffs claim the ordinance violates their right to free speech under the First and\n   Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August, 17, 2018, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. Dkt. # 22. On September 13, 2018, the City filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and a response to Plaintiffs' motion. Dkt. # 26. Plaintiffs filed their response on October 4, 2018 and the City filed their reply on October 18, 2018. Dkt. ## 29, 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

On an issue where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the moving party can prevail merely by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    477 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The City argues in their motion that this case is not justiciable, and, in any event, the ordinance regulates nonexpressive conduct. Dkt. # 26 at 13-19. Plaintiffs claim in their motion that the ordinance cannot survive any First Amendment analysis. Dkt. # 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On a motion for summary judgment, \"a plaintiff must establish that there exists no genuine issue of material fact as to justiciability or the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p329\">\n    525 U.S. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p329\">\n    119 S.Ct. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076553\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/316/#p329\">\n    142 L.Ed.2d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). Accordingly, a plaintiff must support its allegations of injury by affidavit or evidence of specific facts.\n   <em>\n    Snake River Farmers' Ass'n, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513308\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/792/#p795\">\n    9 F.3d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (9th Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs assert that Wysingle suffered a concrete injury to his speech rights, as he is unable to solicit or receive bids for his rental property because of the\n   ordinance. Dkt. # 29 at 2. To show that he has standing to seek an injunction, Wysingle filed a declaration stating that he intended to use Rentberry to advertise his property and would have done so but for the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Plaintiffs also claim that Rentberry has standing because (i) it has a First Amendment interest in disseminating its proprietary software and (ii) it has third-party standing on behalf of its users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In disputing standing, the City contends that Wysingle is not, nor has he ever been, a member of Rentberry; that he did not have a rental house ready to list at the time the Complaint was filed; and that he currently does not have a house ready to list on Rentberry. Dkt. # 26 at 15; Dkt. # 27-8 at 13-14; Dkt. # 31 at 1. Furthermore, because Wysingle rented out his property after the lawsuit was filed, the City argues that any potential claim he has is now moot. Dkt. # 26 at 16-17. As for Rentberry, the City claims that the ordinance only covers landlords and potential tenants, and thus does not cause Rentberry any injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. According to the City, neither plaintiff has standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts, a plaintiff must establish standing, which consists of three elements: (1) injury-in-fact; (2) causation; and (3) redressability.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Because \"[c]onstitutional challenges based on the First Amendment present unique standing considerations,\" plaintiffs may establish injury in fact without first suffering a direct injury from the challenged restriction.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. Candaele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052186\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/775/#p783\">\n    630 F.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (9th Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

These include whether plaintiffs have shown a reasonable likelihood that the government will enforce the challenged law against them; whether plaintiffs have established, with some degree of concrete detail, that they intend to violate the challenged law; and whether the challenged law is applicable to plaintiffs, either by its terms or as interpreted by the government.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052186\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/775/#p783\">\n    630 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   786 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Babbitt v.

The alleged harm was actual and imminent because, despite the cabaret closing, the owner continued to hold all licenses needed to operate and stated unequivocally that he would go back into business if the ordinance were enjoined.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500781\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/996/#p1006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds the facts here distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   . The cabaret owner in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   had been operating a business at the time of ordinance, had recently gone out of business because of the ordinance, and stated unequivocally that he would go back into business if the ordinance were enjoined. By contrast here, at the time of the lawsuit, Wysingle had never used a bidding platform to rent a property and his lone rental property was under renovations with no certain time for completion. Additionally, Wysingle had not created an account on Rentberry or another site that used bidding technology. Dkt. # 30-1 at 8 (\"I haven't used Rentberry, so I don't know how they lay it out.... I'm not a member on the website, so I don't know what the layout is.\"). Under these facts, the Court concludes that Wysingle's claimed injury is not immediate and thus insufficient to seek injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Rentberry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rentberry claims that it has standing in its own right as well as third-party standing on behalf of its users. The Court disagrees because Rentberry has not shown injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both traditional and third-party standing require a plaintiff to show an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sec. of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n    467 U.S. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (explaining that the crucial issue is whether the plaintiff satisfies the \"injury-in-fact\" requirement before asserting the rights of third-party). While third-party standing generally requires some hindrance to a third-party in protecting its own rights, the Supreme Court has expressed a reluctance to strictly adhere to this requirement in the First Amendment context.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court still requires\n   an injury to the purported plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence before the Court to conclude that Rentberry meets this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On its face, the ordinance only applies to landlords and tenants and thus does not regulate Rentberry's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052186\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/775/#p783\">\n    630 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indicating that claims of future harm lack credibility when the challenged speech restriction by its terms is not applicable to the plaintiffs, or the enforcing authority has disavowed the applicability of the challenged law to the plaintiffs). The City's interpretation of the ordinance further confirms its inapplicability to Rentberry. Dkt. # 28, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6. Rentberry explains, however, that its auctioning technology \"cannot be turned off,\" and so it chose not to open its website to the Seattle market. Dkt. # 29 at 12. But again, the ordinance does not restrict Rentberry from operating within the city limits and self-censorship alone does not constitute injury for standing purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laird v. Tatum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782769\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/1/#p13\">\n    408 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782769\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/1/#p13\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782769\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/1/#p13\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (subjective chill is not a substitute for objective harm or threat of future harm). Rentberry's other purported injury-the right to disseminate its propriety software-is likewise not prohibited by the ordinance and is not supported by the facts. Indeed, Rentberry fails to specify by declaration or otherwise any of its business relationships or users impacted by the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Sec. of State of Md.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n    467 U.S. at 950-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211185\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/947/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (third-party standing met where plaintiff identified specific customers impacted by state regulation and the impact of the regulation on the parties' business relationships). Rentberry only declares that \"Seattle is one of the key markets ... since 42% of residents rent their homes.\" Dkt. # 22-5 at 4. The Court finds Rentberry's injury is speculative at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Rentberry makes one last argument in support of standing-that it was specifically targeted by the ordinance and thus it is permitted to seek redress. Dkt. # 29 at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Melendres v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528147\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/990/#p999\">\n    695 F.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999 (9th Cir. 2012) ). However, this argument fails for the reason as the others do: Rentberry must still demonstrate an injury tied to the government regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528147\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/990/#p999\">\n    695 F.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming plaintiffs had standing to bring constitutional claim where government policy targeted them for seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment). For the reasons stated, the Court finds the injury in fact requirement has not been met. Because Rentberry fails to show that it has standing as a matter of law, its claim must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even assuming Plaintiffs had standing, their First Amendment claim would fail. Plaintiffs argue that the ordinance bans protected speech. The relevant provision reads: \"Landlords and potential tenants are prohibited from using rental housing bidding platforms for real property located in Seattle city limits.\" SMC \u00a7 7.24.090.A. Plaintiffs argue the ordinance infringes on their First Amendment right to communicate prices or post advertisements on a \"rent-bidding website.\" Dkt. # 29 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[R]estrictions on protected expression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more generally, on nonexpressive conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Sorrell v.
