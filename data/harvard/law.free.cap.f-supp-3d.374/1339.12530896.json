STAN BAKER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant The National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 47.) Plaintiffs filed a Response in Opposition, (doc. 52), and Defendant filed a Reply, (doc. 54).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this negligence case, brought under Section 905(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, Plaintiffs seek to recover for injuries Mr. Frederick Washington suffered while working on Defendant's vessel as a longshoreman in the Port of Savannah. (Doc. 38.) Defendant argues that the undisputed facts show it did not breach any of the duties it owed Mr. Washington and thus summary judgment is warranted. (Doc. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As the facts show, Mr. Washington narrowly escaped a fatal tragedy on the date in question and suffered injuries stemming from the incident. However, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act does not make the owner of a vessel strictly liable for all injuries occurring on its vessel. While the Court sympathizes with the injuries Mr. Washington suffered, the undisputed facts demonstrate that Defendant is not legally responsible for those injuries. For the reasons set forth more fully below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 47.) The Court\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   the Clerk of Court to enter summary judgment in favor of Defendant and to\n   <strong>\n    CLOSE\n   </strong>\n   this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs initially filed this action, in its original form, in the State Court of Chatham County. (Doc. 1-1.) On December 15, 2016, former Defendant NSCSA (America), Inc. removed the case to this Court. (Doc. 1.) In May of 2017, the parties jointly substituted Defendant The National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia, d/b/a Bahri, (hereinafter Bahri or Defendant) in place of Defendant NSCSA (America), Inc., as Bahri is the correct entity that owned the subject vessel at the time of the incident. (Docs. 12, 13.) Defendant Bahri then filed an unopposed Motion for Joinder of Mini Jolita Washington as a Plaintiff, regarding her potential loss of consortium claim, which the Court granted. (Docs. 28-30.) Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended and Recast Complaint (\"Second Amended Complaint\") alleging negligence and loss of consortium against Defendant Bahri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their action under the Savings to Suitors clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the admiralty jurisdiction statute.

Additionally, although the Second Amended Complaint does not explicitly invoke the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20901\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"the Longshore Act\"), it is undisputed that this action is governed by the Longshore Act, specifically Section 905(b) thereof, since it is premised upon injuries Plaintiff Frederick Washington (\"Mr. Washington\" or \"Plaintiff\") suffered while working on the M/V BAHRI HOFUF, a foreign-flag vessel owned and controlled by Defendant Bahri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 47, 52, 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the day of the incident, August 1, 2016, a loaded trailer uncoupled from the tractor pulling it during discharge, rolled back down an internal ramp of the vessel, and caused Mr. Washington to injure his knee and shoulder as he moved out of the way of the oncoming trailer. (Doc. 52-1, pp. 8-9.) Mr. Washington, a member of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1414 since 2013, was employed as a longshoreman by non-party SSA Stevedores (\"SSA\") that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 52-1, pp. 1-3.) As a longshoreman working for SSA, Mr. Washington assists in the process of loading and discharging cargo from ships that call the Port of Savannah. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bahri engages SSA to carry out the actual loading and discharging of cargo from its vessels when they are in the Port of Savannah. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The vessel at issue here, the BAHRI HOFUF, is a \"Roll-On/Roll-Off\" vessel (\"RO/RO\") that allows cargo to be moved on and off the ship via wheeled\n   conveyances using the vessel's stern ramp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 1, 2016, the BAHRI HOFUF called at the Port of Savannah to load and unload large steel coils, and Mr. Washington was one the of longshoremen hired by SSA to assist with cargo operations that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4.) Mr. Washington worked as a flagman along with two to four others and their \"gang\" header, Joseph Williams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Working alongside Mr. Washington's gang were Robert Manning, a Terberg tractor operator, Charles Hills, a forklift operator, as well as stevedores Daniel Sheppard and Kevin Dotson, who acted as supervisors for SSA during this operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To offload the coils from the BAHRI HOFUF, \"SSA, with input from the shipping line, determined that the coils would be discharged via MAFI trailer using powered equipment to pull [the] loaded MAFI.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2 (quoting Dotson's Deposition, (doc. 36-2, p. 26).) This plan called for \"pulling [the ship's] MAFI trailer with steel coils on top of it using the Terberg [T]ugmaster [tractor] from the ship,\" and was approved by SSA Supervisor Dotson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 36-2, p. 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 40-1, pp. 87-89.) The steel coils were loaded onto the flatbed MAFI trailer and then pulled off the vessel by a Terberg tractor, which was attached to the MAFI trailer by a \"gooseneck\" connector. (Doc. 52-1, pp. 4, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This connection hitch includes a \"lip\" on the Terberg that slides into the MAFI's \"gooseneck tunnel\" and over an internal connecting piece at the end of the tunnel, as well as two brackets, one on each side of the gooseneck lip, that fit into sockets on the sides of the gooseneck tunnel's entryway. (Doc. 47-1, pp. 4-6.) The MAFI trailer and Terberg tractor provided by Defendant Bahri, however, lacked their own safety chains and also lacked mounts to connect any other safety chains.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; doc. 41-3, p. 74;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 36-2, p. 31; doc. 40-1, p. 29.) In addition to the MAFI trailer-Terberg tractor combination provided by Bahri, the cargo operation that day also utilized an SSA-provided TICO truck equipped with a fixed MAFI attachment, rather than a detachable gooseneck, to connect and pull a second MAFI trailer off the vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 52-1, pp. 6-7; doc. 36-2, pp. 40-42.) Because this fixed attachment mechanism is \"all one piece,\" the TICO truck does not utilize safety chains when pulling MAFI trailers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although the BAHRI HOFUF's MAFI trailer and Terberg tractor lacked safety chains, SSA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   policy dictates they be used where available when offloading cargo with this method. (Doc. 36-2, p. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Manning, the driver of the Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer in question, testified that he was trained to \"[a]lways use safety chains\" with this combination of equipment. (Doc. 41-3, p. 74.) Other longshoremen echoed Mr. Manning's statement that safety chains are used with Terberg trucks. (Doc. 36-3, p. 59; doc. 36-7, p. 62.) Furthermore, while OSHA regulations and the MAFI trailer operating manual do not require safety chains, the gooseneck operating manual states that \"rolltrailers\" (such as the MAFI in question) connected with goosenecks \"should [preferably] be equipped with safety hooks beside the coupling mouth for increased safety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 46-1, pp. 87-88, 94, 152.) The manual also expressly warns of the heightened \"[r]isk of unintended uncoupling of rolltrailers\" on slopes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 151.) However, on the day in question, Mr. Manning went ahead and used the BAHRI HOFUF's Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer without safety chains, because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   this particular Terberg didn't even have [any] mountings for anything because, see, they didn't have anything on any side. It didn't have any chains where you can mount [safety chains] and can use them. So I said this thing don't have any-so I thought it was something that was designed that way, you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 41-3, p. 74.) Mr. Manning raised this concern about the lack of safety chains to Supervisor Dotson but \"was informed by the stevedores and everybody else that it's fine to use this [particular] piece of equipment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 21, 41.) Unlike Mr. Manning and Supervisor Dotson, Mr. Washington was not aware that Bahri's Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer lacked safety chains. (Doc. 36-7, pp. 86-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to the incident, Supervisor Dotson did not notice any readily-visible unsafe conditions with regard to the Bahri-owned equipment, but he admitted that he did not undertake any inspection to determine whether the equipment was safe for its intended purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 36-2, pp. 24-25.) Rather, Supervisor Dotson \"assumed\" it was safe since the equipment was familiar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the record is unclear as to precisely when the incident occurred, it is undisputed that during the time in question Mr. Washington was working as a flagman in the bottom hold in the BAHRI HOFUF's bow. (Doc. 52-1, p. 8; doc. 52, p. 2.) In Mr. Washington's flagman gang, headed by Joseph Williams, were two to four other flagmen; their primary responsibility was to \"flag [ ] in\" (with hand signals) the Terberg tractor pulling the empty MAFI trailer and \"line him up, stop him, stage him, put the chocks on the coils[,] ... flag them back out, flag the forklift in, tell them when to stop, how far\n   to come on the trailer, all of that.\" (Doc. 36-7, pp. 54-55, 69-70, 73-74.) The MAFI trailer at issue was loaded with three heavy steel coils and was being pulled by the Terberg tractor driven by Mr. Manning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 76, 84.) This offload method had been successfully used multiple times that day before the subject incident occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 36-2, pp. 35, 38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 40-1, p. 81; doc. 41-3, p. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the last coil was placed onto the MAFI trailer, Mr. Washington signaled to Mr. Manning that he could proceed and Mr. Manning began pulling the loaded MAFI trailer up the vessel's ramp toward the dock. (Doc. 36-7, pp. 80-81.) Mr. Washington remained standing in the same area of the vessel's bow, at the bottom of the ramp, awaiting the next truck and trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 81-82.) Less than two minutes later, for reasons unknown, the just-loaded MAFI trailer uncoupled from the Terberg tractor at the top of the ramp, nearly four stories up, and came crashing back down the ramp toward Mr. Washington in the hold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 80, 82-84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 52-1, pp. 8-9.) The MAFI trailer, carrying sixty tons of cargo, was \"jumping\" down the ramp with sparks flying and \"shaking the whole ship.\" (Doc. 36-7, pp. 87-88.) As the MAFI trailer approached Mr. Washington, he tried to evade its path by stepping out of the way, but the trailer then \"jackknifed\" straight toward him, causing him to turn and flee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 88-89.) Charles Hills, a forklift driver in the area, saw the oncoming trailer and maneuvered his massive forklift in between it, a pole, and Mr. Washington to stop the trailer's momentum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; doc. 36-3, pp. 28, 31-32, 38-39, 62.) Mr. Washington recalls being hit on the side, and almost falling down, before injuring himself as he jumped to safety on pipes located behind Mr. Hills's forklift. (Doc. 36-7, pp. 89-90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 36-3, pp. 33, 41.) Mr. Hills characterized this as a \"life and death situation\" that Mr. Washington got the worst of because he jumped hard and hit his shoulder while, quite literally, running for his life. (Doc. 36-3, pp. 31, 28-29, 61-62.) Immediately after the incident, Mr. Washington told Mr. Hills that his knee was injured, and he was observed walking with a limp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49, 62-63.) At the time, Mr. Washington thought he had sprained his knee and bruised his shoulder. (Doc. 36-7, p. 104.) Thirty days later, on August 30, 2016, he reported his injuries to SSA's safety director. (Doc. 36-1, pp. 6, 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While the precise cause of the uncoupling incident seems to be ultimately unknowable, the evidence shows that safety chains would have more than likely prevented the uncoupled MAFI trailer from crashing back down the BAHRI HOFUF's ramp. Defendant's Port Captain, Poul Mollerup-Madsen, nonetheless points to operational error as the cause. (Doc. 40-1, pp. 36-37.) According to him, if the Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer are correctly connected via the gooseneck hitch and are properly operated, then \"the trailer can absolutely not detach\" because there are two locking mechanisms on the gooseneck-the internal lip and the side brackets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Captain Madsen posits three possible explanations: (1) the MAFI trailer was incorrectly loaded down in the\n   hold causing it to tilt and detach while going up the internal, incline ramp; (2) the MAFI trailer and Terberg tractor were improperly and incompletely attached via the gooseneck; or (3) the MAFI trailer's fifth wheel was not raised high enough as the Terberg tractor pulling it crested the top of the incline ramp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 37-41.) Captain Madsen concluded that the use of safety chains \"maybe\" would have avoided this accident, but he was unsure because he had never before seen a MAFI detachment in his ten years with Bahri. (Doc. 40-1, pp. 19-20, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, Mr. Manning, who had witnessed a MAFI uncouple from a tractor before, testified positively that safety chains would have avoided this incident, (doc. 41-3, pp. 21-22, 29-30, 32-33, 42, 66), as did Mr. Hills, (doc. 36-3, p. 23). Plaintiffs' expert, Mr. Milam, also concluded that safety chains \"would have prevented this incident\" and that best practices dictated the use of safety chains during the at-issue discharging operation. (Doc. 46-1, p. 142.) In addition, Supervisor Dotson, who too had witnessed prior MAFI breakaways, opined that in hindsight he considered the TICO truck with a fixed MAFI attachment to be safer than the Bahri equipment. (Doc. 36-2, pp. 35-36, 42.) Following the incident, in order to finish discharging the steel coils, SSA substituted other conveyance equipment in place of Bahri's safety-chainless tractor and trailer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 36-2, pp. 40-41; doc. 36-3, pp. 46, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment \"shall\" be granted if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Doc. 47-1, pp. 7-18.) Specifically, Bahri contends that the undisputed facts demonstrate that it did not violate the turnover duty, the active control duty, or the duty to intervene when it provided SSA the Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer without safety chains, and that such condition was open and obvious as it relates to the turnover duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 7-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   doc. 54.) Bahri also contends that any fault for the incident falls on the stevedoring company, SSA, as it has the primary responsibility to ensure a safe working environment for offloading operations and Bahri is entitled to rely on its expertise.

(Doc. 52, pp. 10-16.) Plaintiffs proceed as though the open and obvious defense does not apply to the turnover duty of safe condition and argue that it does not defeat their claim for violation of the turnover duty to warn claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As such, Plaintiffs contend Defendant's summary judgment motion should be denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In its Reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails at each turn to point to record evidence sufficient to support its claims and to create a genuine dispute of material fact. (Doc. 54.) Defendant also reiterates its contention that the open and obvious defense applies to both of Plaintiffs' turnover duty claims-warning and safe condition-and bars each in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The fundamental issue in this case is relatively straightforward: Did Defendant violate one or more of the three duties it owed Mr. Washington when it provided offloading equipment without safety chains or mounts to discharge large steel coils from the BAHRI HOFUF?

(Doc. 52, pp. 9-14.) Particularly, Plaintiffs contend that, \"[e]ven with the exercise of ordinary care, without safety chains connecting the equipment, cargo operations\" could not be carried on with reasonable safety, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12), and that issues of fact remain as to whether the of the lack of safety chains was open and obvious, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13). Defendant argues the safety chain issue was open and obvious, which precludes liability as to both the turnover duty of safe condition and the turnover duty to warn. (Doc. 47-1, pp. 9-11; doc. 54, pp. 2-3.) Defendant further avers that it was entitled to rely on the stevedore's expertise in ensuring a safe offloading environment for the longshoremen under its employ. (Doc. 47-1, pp. 8-9, 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Open and Obvious Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court considers whether the open and obvious defense applies to the duty to turn over the ship's equipment in a condition that allows a stevedore to carry out his job obligations with reasonable safety. In support of its contention that this defense applies here, Bahri relies solely on\n   <em>\n    Kirksey v. Tonghai Maritime\n   </em>\n   , a non-controlling case from a sister circuit which extended the open and obvious defense to the duty to turn over a safe ship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5894523\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/388/#p394\">\n    535 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394-95 (5th Cir. 2008). The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that, under the\n   <em>\n    Howlett\n   </em>\n   Court's limitation of the duty to warn to only \"\n   <em>\n    latent\n   </em>\n   \" dangers, \"it makes no sense to say that the vessel is nevertheless liable to the longshoremen for breach of the duty to turnover a safe ship based on an\n   <em>\n    obvious\n   </em>\n   defect against which it had no duty to warn.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39854\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/92/#p98\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While this reasoning has appeal, it sidesteps the clear distinction drawn by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Howlett\n   </em>\n   between the turnover duty of safe condition and its corollary duty to warn. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals aptly expounded upon this distinction: \"After all, the duty to warn is a mere corollary to the turnover duty, not the sole manner of measuring the reasonableness of a shipowner's actions upon turnover.... In other words, failure to warn of a latent hazard is but one way a shipowner may violate its turnover duty[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Oldendorff Carriers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064803\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/454/#p463\">\n    723 F.3d at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). \"[T]he openness and obviousness of a hazard does not absolve the shipowner of its turnover duty of safe condition.... But when a hazard is open and obvious, the shipowner has a diminished turnover duty of safe condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064803\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/454/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064803\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/454/#p463\">\n    at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Motz, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explained, \"a shipowner may be negligent for failing to eliminate an [open and] obvious hazard that it could have eliminated ... when it should have expected that an expert stevedore could not or would not avoid the hazard and conduct cargo operations reasonably safely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kirsch v.

Thus, while the openness and obviousness of a given hazard is not a complete bar or defense to recovery under the turnover duty of safe condition, as it is under the corollary duty to warn, it is a consideration to be taken into account when looking to the\n   <em>\n    circumstances\n   </em>\n   of the alleged negligence and whether the vessel exercised ordinary care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oldendorff Carriers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064803\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/454/#p463\">\n    723 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   463 ;\n   <em>\n    Kirsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517681\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/1026/#p1031\">\n    971 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1030-31 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

To wit, Mr. Manning specifically raised his concerns over the lack of safety chains to Supervisor Dotson, who informed him that using Bahri's Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer without safety chains was permissible. (Doc. 41-3, pp. 21, 41.) SSA had used this equipment of Bahri's \"many times\" in the same manner without incident. (Doc. 36-2, p. 25.) SSA had also regularly, and safely, used Terberg and gooseneck equipment provided by other RO/RO vessels without safety chains. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 32.) Likewise, Bahri's Terberg, gooseneck, and MAFI combination had been utilized in cargo operations for ten years without an uncoupling incident. (Doc. 40-1, pp. 19-20, 41.) On the day in question, SSA had safely used Bahri's equipment to offload much of the steel coil cargo prior to the uncoupling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 81-82; doc. 41-3, p. 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, Supervisor Dotson testified that, while he did not make any specific inspection, (doc. 36-2, p. 24), he determined that Bahri's equipment was fit for its intended use despite not having, or providing for the use of, safety chains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. Are there uses of Terberg and MAFI combinations that can be done safely without the use of safety chains?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Yes. And-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. Did you want to-okay. So in your opinion at the time that the BAHRI HOFUF and its equipment was turned over to SSA to you for use in the discharge of these steel coils using the MAFIs, was it your opinion that the equipment could be used safely in the condition they were tendered to SSA?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. All right. And that's for the intended purpose of discharging these steel coils.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 32.) He testified that he would have rejected the operation had he felt it unsafe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 28.) Furthermore, the contract between SSA and Bahri gave SSA the \"sole discretion\" to use the vessel's cargo handling equipment and prohibited the use of equipment determined to be \"unsuitable\" by SSA. (Doc. 40-1, p. 145.) Under SSA's own policy in place at that time, safety chains were only required to be used in conjunction with MAFI trailers where available, and there was no parallel rule to avoid using equipment that lacked safety chains. (Doc. 36-2, p. 36.) Lastly, neither OSHA regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor the gooseneck manual, nor Bahri's MAFI lease agreement-which spells out certain operational terms-mandates the use of safety chains on this equipment. (Doc. 46-1, pp. 87, 91-94, 99, 149-58, 161-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Against these facts, Plaintiffs point to the testimony of their expert Mr. Milam. (Doc. 52, pp. 11-12.) Mr. Milam opined that Bahri, as the supplier of the at-issue Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer, had a \"general duty\" to provide that equipment in a safe manner. (Doc. 46-1, pp. 101-02.) Mr. Milam also considered it to be \"best practices\" to use safety chains as a \"secondary emergency system to prevent the accidental disconnect\" of a MAFI trailer,\n   especially in light of the incline ramps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 103.) Plaintiffs also contend that safety chains should have been used because trailer uncoupling events are known to have occurred at the Port of Savannah. (Doc. 52, p. 12.) Finally, Plaintiffs argue that because the undisputed facts show there were no safety chains or chain mounts affixed to the equipment provided by Bahri, cargo operations could not have been carried on with reasonable safety, even with the exercise of ordinary care.

Thus, as it relates here, Bahri did not have a general duty of best practices with regard to the turnover of its equipment to SSA, but rather it only had to \"exercise ordinary care under the circumstances\" to furnish the Terberg and MAFI in such a condition that SSA would \"be able by the exercise of ordinary care to carry on cargo operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.\"\n   <em>\n    Howlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39854\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/92/#p98\">\n    512 U.S. at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39854\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/92/#p98\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Looking to all the circumstances of that fateful day, as laid out by the undisputed facts above, the Court finds that, as a matter of law, Bahri did not violate its turnover duty of safe condition when it provided SSA with a Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer that lacked safety chains. \"[A] breach of the turnover duty must occur at the moment of turnover.\"\n   <em>\n    Robie v.

Here, at the moment of turnover, the MAFI and Terberg did not have safety chains (and they remained in this condition up to and through the time of the incident). Given there is no dispute that Bahri's equipment had been safely utilized in the same condition (without safety chains) for a significant amount of time prior to the uncoupling incident,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   equipment was furnished \"in a condition that permit[ted the] stevedore to do its work with reasonable safety.\"\n   <em>\n    M/V Aqua Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539546\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/1575/#p1581\">\n    857 F.2d at 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because this duty is breached, if at all, at the moment Bahri turned over the subject equipment, these undisputed facts show that Bahri did not breach the turnover duty. Whatever operational deficiency caused the MAFI to uncouple, it and the Terberg were otherwise in the same \"condition\" at the moment of the incident as they were at the moment of turnover-without safety chains or mounts. Thus, while safety chains may have prevented the consequences of the uncoupling (that is, the MAFI becoming fully detached from the trailer and rolling back down the ramp toward Mr. Washington), the lack of chains did not render Bahri's equipment inherently incapable of being used with \"reasonable safety\" by SSA and its longshoremen. Stated differently, Defendant turned over its conveyance equipment in such a condition that the longshoremen could unload the vessel with reasonable safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Other circumstances surrounding the incident confirm this conclusion: SSA had safely used Bahri's Terberg and MAFI many times in the past without safety chains; Bahri had safely used this equipment in other ports without safety chains; SSA had safely used Terbergs and goosenecks without safety chains from other RO/RO vessels; Mr. Manning notified Supervisor Dotson before cargo operations began about his concern over the lack of safety chains but was told the equipment was safe to use; SSA approved this equipment's use knowing it lacked safety chains and with full authority to halt operations to substitute other, safety-chained equipment if it so chose; and Captain Madsen had never before had a MAFI uncoupling incident on his vessel. Even if Bahri should have known that MAFIs had uncoupled at the Port of Savannah at least several times before, it was still entitled to rely on SSA's expertise and local experience to safely offload the steel coils.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Texaco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1150738\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/674/447/#p451\">\n    674 F.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (5th Cir. 1982) (\"In discharging [the turnover] duty the ship may rely on the stevedore's performing its task with reasonable care.\"). Furthermore, SSA had complete contractual authority over whether and how to use any equipment provided by Bahri, yet Supervisor Dotson, exercising his expertise, determined the Terberg and MAFI were safe to use even despite knowing that prior uncoupling incidents had occurred at the Port of Savannah. Lastly, Plaintiffs point to no authority which affirmatively requires the use of safety chains on this equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although the Court does not doubt that the use of safety chains may have ultimately avoided this incident, \"it is essential to apprehend that the primary responsibility for the safety of [longshoremen] rests with the stevedoring contractor.\"\n   <em>\n    Gable v.

Bahri owed Mr. Washington a limited duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances in turning over reasonably safe equipment to SSA, a duty which it discharged based on the undisputed facts in this case. As explained above, to visit liability upon a vessel under the turnover duty, it is not enough to point toward a hazardous condition. Plaintiffs must also introduce evidence showing the hazard was such that SSA could not carry out its operations with reasonable safety to persons and property through the exercise of ordinary care. Plaintiffs have failed to do so here.

(Doc. 47-1, pp. 9-11.) Plaintiffs, however, argue that the safety chain issue was not open and obvious, even though Mr. Manning alerted Supervisor Dotson about it, because Mr. Manning believed the lack of chains was by design due to Bahri's equipment also lacking chain mounts. (Doc. 52, pp. 12-13.) The undisputed facts show that the lack of safety chains on Bahri's Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer was a readily-visible condition known to SSA and its longshoreman driver. Plaintiffs essentially admit that the lack of safety chains or mounts was open and obvious: \"It is clear from the evidence in the record that Bahri was aware that the equipment it lent to SSA did not have safety chains.... Moreover, Mr. Manning testified that the equipment did not have mountings or anything on the side for the use of safety chains.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court recognizes that whether a hazard is open and obvious for the purposes of asserting a defense to liability is not as simple as whether the hazard can be seen by those in its vicinity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

In this case,\n   however, the danger posed by not having safety chains-an unintended uncoupling and complete trailer detachment-was also known. In fact, this was the concern motivating Mr. Manning to alert Supervisor Dotson about the lack of chains. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 41-3, p. 21.) Despite being alerted to this concern and knowing of prior incidents where trailers became uncoupled, Supervisor Dotson still felt Bahri's equipment was safe to use, and indeed it was for most of the steel coil discharge: \"All day long it was functioning fine....

Plaintiffs also contend, without citing any evidence, that \"Bahri had substantial control over or was in charge of the instrumentality which caused the injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Defendant points out the lack of support in the record for Plaintiffs' substantial control argument and contends that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   actually undermines Plaintiffs' claim in this regard.

The Fifth Circuit has interpreted the \"obviously improvident\" judgment standard as requiring a situation where \"an expert stevedore ... use[s] an object with a defective condition that is so hazardous that anyone can tell that its continued use creates an unreasonable risk of harm even when the stevedore's expertise is taken into account.\"\n   <em>\n    Greenwood v.

Further, a shipowner has an obligation to intervene only when it becomes aware that the ship's equipment \"poses a danger to the stevedore\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   is also aware that the stevedore is acting unreasonably to protect the longshoremen.\"\n   <em>\n    M/V Aqua Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539546\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/1575/#p1581\">\n    857 F.2d at 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).

(Doc. 52, p. 15.) In support, they cite the factors identified by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Casaceli v. Martech International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   as relevant in determining whether the duty to intervene was triggered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   whether the danger was open and obvious; whether the danger was located within the ship or ship's gear; which party created the danger or used the defective item and was therefore in a better position to correct it; which party owned and controlled the defective item; whether an affirmative act of negligence or acquiescence in the use of the dangerous item occurred; and whether the shipowner assumed any duty with regard to the dangerous item.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"35799\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/774/1322/#p1328\">\n    774 F.2d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1328 (5th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these factors, Plaintiffs reassert their (already rejected) open and obvious argument and argue the following: \"the danger was within Bahri's equipment\"; the danger \"was in existence before the equipment was lent to SSA\"; and \"Bahri owned and controlled the defective equipment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 52, p. 15.) In this instance, each of these contentions argue the same essential point-Bahri's Terberg tractor and MAFI trailer were necessarily defective because they lacked safety chains. Defendant, however, argues that the evidence of record shows Bahri had no notice of any \"obviously improvident\" stevedoring practice related to the use of the tractor and trailer. (Doc. 54, pp. 5-8.) The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although the use of safety chains may have been the safer choice, especially with the benefit of hindsight, based on the facts before the Court, it cannot be said that Bahri was on notice of \"obviously improvident\" use of its equipment by SSA. As the Court detailed in Section I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , SSA safely used Bahri's Terberg and MAFI without safety chains on prior cargo operations, and other stevedoring contractors had used this same equipment without incident. Captain Madsen testified that this incident was the first MAFI uncoupling in his ten years of experience. Moreover, SSA used the equipment to offload much of the steel coil cargo prior to the subject incident. During this time, Bahri was never alerted that any potential complications had arisen concerning its Terberg and MAFI. These circumstances simply do not give rise to a duty to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonds v.

Captain Madsen testified that the Terberg driver had \"been up and down inside the ship, in and out, many times during the first six hours of the operation with no failure.... He ha[d] been down in that hold at least 30 times already with a MAFI successfully ... [a]nd now we're almost finished and, boom, now we have a problem.\" (Doc. 40-1, p. 81.) Captain Madsen continued, \"He ha[d] been in there 30 times, something like that, maybe 25. But he'[d] been in there a lot.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at p. 82.) Consistent with Captain Madsen's testimony, the Terberg driver, Mr. Manning, stated that once the incident happened there were \"only maybe three more trips made after that. There wasn't much freight left down there.... It was about done, you know. It just happened close to the end, you know.\" (Doc. 41-3, p. 35.) Thus, the evidence is clear that SSA safely used Bahri's Terberg and MAFI for the majority of cargo operations that day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a vessel can be liable for failure to warn of an open and obvious hazard in two situations: \"first if avoiding the hazard would be impractical for the longshoremen, or second, if the ship should have known that the longshoremen would confront the hazard.\"\n    <em>\n     Hill v.

The accuracy of this conclusory statement is far from clear based on the unresolvable nature of the uncoupling incident's precise cause. Given that Bahri's equipment had functioned without incident for much of the operation, it cannot be said for certain that no affirmative act of negligence occurred on the last discharge trip. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 40-1, pp. 36-37; doc. 36-2, p. 38.) As such, the Court disregards this assertion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
