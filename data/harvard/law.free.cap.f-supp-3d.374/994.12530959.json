Navarro, Chief Judge\n   Pending before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 86 ), filed by Plaintiff Federal Trade Commission (\"the FTC\"). Defendants OMICS Group Inc. (\"OMICS\"), iMedPub LLC (\"iMedPub\"), Conference Series LLC (\"Conference Series\"), and Srinubabu Gedela (\"Gedela\") (collectively \"Defendants\") filed a Response, (ECF No. 110 ), and the FTC filed a Reply, (ECF No. 115 ). Also, before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 89 ), filed by Defendants. The FTC filed a Response, (ECF No. 97 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendants filed a Reply, (ECF No. 107 ). For the reasons discussed herein, the FTC's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The FTC brings this action pursuant to Section 5(a) of the FTC Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), alleging that Defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive practices with respect to the publication of online academic journals and organization of scientific conferences. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 ). Defendants claim to operate hundreds of online academic journals on a wide variety of topics, including medicine, chemistry, nursing, engineering, and genetics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Ex. 1 to Defs.' MSJ, ECF No. 89-1 ). In order to persuade consumers to submit articles for publication, the FTC alleges that Defendants make numerous misrepresentations regarding the nature and reputation of their journals. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12). The FTC also alleges that Defendants fail to disclose the significant fees associated with their publishing services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Finally, the FTC alleges that Defendants make numerous misrepresentations in connection with the marketing of their scientific conferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The FTC asserts that Defendants OMICS, iMedPub, and Conference Series (collectively \"Corporate Defendants\") have operated as a common enterprise in violating Section 5(a) and therefore are jointly and severally liable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). The FTC further asserts that Gedela has \"formulated, directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of the Corporate Defendants that constitute the common enterprise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on these allegations, the FTC initiated this action against Defendants on August 25, 2016. On September 29, 2017, the Court granted the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction, requiring Defendants to preserve records, provide financial accounting to the FTC, and refrain from engaging in deceptive practices. (Prelim. Inj. Order, ECF No. 46 ). The parties now submit their respective motions for summary judgment on the FTC's unfair and deceptive practices claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Background on Academic Publishing\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1) Traditional Model vs. Open Access\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Academic or scholarly journals are peer-reviewed publications that focus on a\n   particular academic or scientific discipline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 18 to FTC's MSJ, ECF No. 86-18 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These publications are comprised of articles, which typically take the form of \"original research, review articles, commentaries, or clinical case studies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the traditional model, publishers charge libraries and individuals \"user subscription fees\" to gain access to the published material. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). The articles remain accessible to the extent users remain subscribed to the journal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). In contrast, under the newer \"open access\" model, journals make their content available to the public at no cost, subsidizing their operations primarily through author-funded publication fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. 1 to Defs.' MSJ). By removing price and permission barriers, this model increases access to a broader community. (SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6 9); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    2) Peer Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Peer-review\" is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of qualified experts in the same field prior to publishing in a journal. (SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6 12). When an author submits their work for publication, the journal makes an initial determination regarding whether to accept the article for peer review or reject it outright. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If accepted, authors are expected to respond to peer reviewer commentary, implement recommendations, and, if necessary, justify the rejection of any proposed revisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The peer-review process typically takes several months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Prior to publishing, authors are usually required to sign a publication agreement that gives the journal the right to publish the submitted article. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    3) Impact Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the academic publishing industry, a journal's \"impact factor\" is often used as an objective measure of the prestige or relative importance of a journal in its field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). \"Impact factor\" typically measures the average number of scholarly citations that articles receive in a published journal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). A higher impact factor indicates a more reputable journal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Amongst those in the industry, the term is specifically understood to mean the proprietary citation measure calculated and published by Thomson Reuters in its Journal Citation Reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A journal must be indexed by Thomson Reuters in either its Science Citation Index Expanded or its Social Sciences Citation Index to receive an impact factor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    4) Indexing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Aside from impact factors, \"indexing\" also serves as an indicator of a journal's reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-22). The United States National Library of Medicine (\"NLM\") produces and manages three freely accessible bibliographical resources: PubMed, Medline, and PubMed Central. (SJX11 Admissions Nos. 42, 43). Journals must apply for inclusion in Medline and\n   PubMed Central, upon which time an NIH-chartered advisory committee reviews the submission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Due to the selective nature of these indexes, a journal's inclusion is considered indicative of a journal's quality. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Gedela and the Corporate Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1) Corporate Structure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants OMICS, iMedPub, and Conference Series are corporate entities registered in the United States with a principle place of business located in Hyderabad, India. (SJX02 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 6-8); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each entity shares the same principal address at SEZ Unit, Building No. 20, 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Floor, APIIC Layout, HITEC City, Hyderabad, AP 500081. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, each entity at various points has utilized common addresses for their United States locations and business registrations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX12 Att. D at 116, Att. I at 257, Att. K at 367, Att. L at 667, Att. M at 945); (SJX26 Att. J at 284, 290, 296, 299, Att. K at 323, Att. L at 328, Att. M at 338); (Internet Archives at 10, 17, 96, ECF No. 84 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In general, these entities operate as a group with comingled assets. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FTC's MSJ 6:10-7:27, ECF No. 86 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Gedela is the sole owner and founding director of the three Corporate Defendants. (SJX02 Answer \u00b6 9); (SJX03 OMICS Int. Resp. 2); (SJX04 iMedPub Int. Resp. 2); (SJX05 Conference Series Int. Resp. 2); (Defs.' MSJ 5:3-4, ECF No. 89 ). Gedela first began using the fictitious business name \"OMICS Publishing Group\" for his publishing and conference services in 2009. (SJX23 Gedela Dep. 23:1-18, 30:1-25); (Defs.' MSJ 5:3-11). Until at least 2015, Gedela held revenue from the Corporate Defendants in a Citibank account set up in Palo Alto for OMICS Publishing Group. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX23 Gedela Dep. 27:1-30:25). As founding director, Gedela has authority and control over Defendants' conference and publishing practices. (SJX10 Admission Nos. 1-4, 20); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FTC's MSJ 4:26-5:22). Furthermore, Gedela has signatory authority over OMICS and iMedPub's financial accounts. (SJX02 Answer \u00b6 9); (SJX10 Admission No. 22 ). Gedela operates as the main contact for the Corporate Defendants' servicers, including their payment processor. (PX12 Att. P at 1007; Att. O at 997, 999; Att. D at 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2) Defendants' Peer Review Practices\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants advertise throughout their websites and email solicitations that they strictly adhere to standard peer-review practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX11 Admission No. 60 ); (SJX12 Admission Nos. 61-64); (SJX13 at 6-14); (SJX 15 at 4-8, 11-14); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX1 Solicitation Email at 8); (SJX26 Att. Q at 576, 585, 588, 630, 698); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 657). For example, in 2014, Defendants published web pages stating that OMICS had 25,000 experts serving as editorial\n   board members and reviewers, and that \"[a]ll articles submitted for publication are subjected to a blind peer review.\" (SJX15 \u00b6\u00b6 182-186). Over the years, this number has grown to over 50,000 purported experts serving as board members and reviewers for over 700+ \"leading-edge peer reviewed\" journals. (SJX26 Att. Q at 576, 586); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Ex. 1 to Defs.' MSJ). Consistently, Defendants have represented their peer review policies as \"highly appreciated, accepted and adaptable\" to the criteria set forth by agencies such as PubMed. (PX12 Att. L at 773).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In contradiction to these assertions, however, the FTC submits evidence indicating that Defendants' peer review practices are a \"sham.\" (FTC's MSJ 24:4-5). For example, in certain instances, consumers who submitted articles were approved for publication within just several days of submission. (SJX 26 Att. A at 20, 53, 69, 84, 86, 114). In others, consumers reported receiving no comments or proposed revisions from peer reviewers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    at 37, 53, 73, 93, 114, 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The consumers who did receive feedback from reviewers have noted that it was not substantive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53); (PX09 Hoevet Decl. \u00b6 4); (PX10 Davidson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2012, John Bohannon-a scientist and writer for\n   <em>\n    Science\n   </em>\n   magazine-submitted two articles to Defendants' journals with intentionally \"egregious\" scientific flaws. (PX14 Bohannon Decl. \u00b6 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' journals accepted the flawed papers without any substantive comments or review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Similarly, in 2016, a journalist for the Ottawa Citizen submitted an \"unintelligible\" article containing ungrammatical sentences and invented words. (SJX01 Spears Decl. \u00b6 2). Defendants' journal published the article without any edits and without contacting the author prior to publication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). After reviewing these cases, the FTC's expert Joyce Backus concluded that the papers were not subjected to peer review \"as that term is understood in the academic publishing industry.\" (SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to consumer commentary, the FTC also submits statements from multiple of Defendants' journal editors. (FTC's MSJ 25:15-25). In these statements, the editors indicate that they never received any manuscripts to review. (PX01 Woods Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 9); (PX03 Everett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Based on documents received through discovery, the FTC asserts that out of 69,000 published articles, only 49% indicate that some form of review was conducted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FTC's MSJ 26:8-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    3) Defendants' Expert Reviewers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants advertise that their publications are reviewed and edited by as many as 50,000 experts. (SJX26 Att. Q at 576, 586); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Ex. 1 to Defs.' MSJ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this claim, Defendants' websites include hundreds of names, pictures, and biographies of scientists and researchers allegedly serving on editorial boards. (PX12 Att. L at 669-82, 734-37, 808-815). Upon the FTC contacting several listed editors, however, many indicated that they had never agreed to be affiliated with OMICS. (PX02 Grace Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7); (PX08 Howland Decl. \u00b6 7); (PX11 Rusu Decl. \u00b6 11). Furthermore, in some instances, Defendants continued to use the researchers' names even after they requested removal. (PX08 Howland Decl. \u00b6 7); (PX11 Rusu Decl. \u00b6 11); (SJX26 Att. A at 35, 63). More generally, the FTC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   notes that Defendants have only been able to produce a list of 14,598 unique editors and evidence of an agreement to serve as an editor for only 380 individuals. (SJX24 Wilson Decl. \u00b6 3); (SJX26 Freeman Decl. \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    4) Defendants' Use of Impact Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants advertise throughout their websites and solicitation emails that their publications have high \"impact factors.\" (SJX26 Att. Q at 741-768); (PX12 Att. L 657, 691, 762, 766, 768-769, 881-935); (SJX15 Admissions Nos. 196, 197). These advertisements include express representations, such as \"OMICS International journals are among the top high impact factor academic journals which are publishing scholarly articles constantly.\" (SJX26 Att. Q. 820). Defendants admit that their journals do not have Thomson Reuters impact factors. (SJX04 iMedPub Int. Resp. 8); (SJX07 OMICS Int. Resp. 15). Rather, Defendants' impact factors are self-calculated ratios based on the number of citations found through a Google Scholar search. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 770); (SJX14 Admission No. 103 ); (SJX26 Att. P at 467, 763).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants' websites contain inconsistent descriptions of how their impact factors are calculated. In some places, the impact factors are described as based on Journal Citation Reports, which is consistent with the Thomson Reuters Impact Factor. (SJX15 Admissions 198-211). In other places, Defendants describe them as an \"unofficial impact factor\" based on Google Scholar Citations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SJX14 Admission No. 103 ); (Internet Archives at 93, ECF No. 84 ). Although Defendants provide their alternate definition in disclosures, such explanations often appear buried underneath their journal marketing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 881-931); (SJX26 Att. P at 450-467). In some instances, Defendants' websites make the general claim that their journals have \"high impact factors\" without any qualification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 657, 762); (SJX26 Att. Q at 820). Similarly, Defendants have sent solicitation emails referring to their journals' impact factors without qualification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX27 Email at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    5) Defendants' Indexing Representations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants represent that their publications are indexed in reputable indexing services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 643, 657, 694). For example, Defendants repeatedly indicate that their journals are indexed in Medline and PubMed Central. (PX10 Att. D at 16); (SJX26 Att. Q at 589, 820, 916, 923). At various points, Defendants have even utilized PubMed and Medline's logos on their websites. (Internet Archives at 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Despite these representations, Defendants admit that none of their journals are indexed in PubMed Central or Medline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX07 Admission Nos. 13, 14); (SJX08 Admission Nos. 13, 14). Instead, Defendants claim that more than 900 well-respected scientists have\n   <em>\n    recommended\n   </em>\n   OMICS' journals to be published in PubMed central. (Gedela Decl. \u00b6 17, Ex. 1 to Defs.' MSJ). Nonetheless, NLM has explicitly refused to index Defendants' publications due to questionable publishing practices and requested that Defendants cease indicating any affiliation. (SJX18 \u00b6\u00b6 32-36, Att. B at 25, Att. C at 28, Att. D at 31, Att. E at 33-34). Despite NLM's requests, Defendants have continued to indicate their journals' inclusion in Medline and PubMed Central. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX10 Att. D at 16); (SJX26 Att. Q at 589).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    6) Defendants' Publishing Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants frequently send out solicitation emails inviting individuals to submit articles to Defendants' online publications.

In numerous instances, these email solicitations contain no mention of any fees associated with Defendants' publication service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants have continued this practice even after the Court's entry of its preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX01 at 6); (SJX26 Att. A at 65); (SJX27 Att. A at 3-7). Defendants' solicitation emails invite consumers to submit articles for publication by responding directly to the email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, Defendants solicit article submissions through their online portals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX15 at 25-26). In many instances, Defendants' article homepages do not contain clear reference to fees associated with submitting articles. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX12 Att. L at 652-654, 734-738); (SJX26 Att. Q at 631-640). In other instances, Defendants' fee disclosures are contained on secondary webpages but lack specificity. (PX12 Att. K at 375-381). Notably, consumers going to a journal's homepage can submit a manuscript without ever seeing any fee disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. K at 340-341).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Some consumers only learn of Defendants' fees after Defendants have accepted their articles for publication. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 \u00b6 5); (SJX26 Att. A at 20, 26, 33, 45, 59). Furthermore, when consumers contest Defendants' publication fees and ask their articles to be withdrawn, Defendants have ignored the requests and continued demanding payment. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 \u00b6\u00b6 6-8); (PX06 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8); (PX07 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8). In some instances, Defendants only removed the articles after the threat of legal action. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX07 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). In addition to economic harm, this conduct prevents authors from submitting their work to other journals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6 11). The Court notes, however, that at least one consumer has found the publication fees to be clearly disclosed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orser Decl. \u00b6 14, Ex. B to Defs.'

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX16 Gedela Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8); (SJX26 Att. B at 170, 185, 188). Defendants note that they have received \"appreciation and invitation letters for hosting [their] conferences in many major cities.\" (Defs.' MSJ 8:15-16); (Letters, Ex. 3 to Defs.' MTD, ECF No. 31 ). Many of these conferences occur in the United States. (SJX26 \u00b6\u00b6 10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In order to attract consumers, Defendants advertise the attendance and participation of prominent academics and researchers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX05 \u00b6\u00b6 3,5); (PX12 Att. U at 1045); (SJX26 Att. A at 22, 56, 170). The FTC has provided evidence, however, that Defendants advertise the attendance and participation of these individuals without their permission or actual affiliation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX05 \u00b6\u00b6 3,5); (PX12 Att. U at 1045). In numerous instances, individuals have requested unsuccessfully to have their names removed from Defendants' conference advertising materials. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX03 \u00b6\u00b6 6-12); (SJX26 Att. N at 370). In some instances, Defendants did not remove an individuals' name until the threat of legal action. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX05 \u00b6 7). According to the FTC's sampling of 100 conferences, approximately 60% advertised organizers or participants who had not agreed to serve in such capacity.

FTC's Motion to Strike Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The FTC moves to strike the declaration of Defendants' Indian counsel, Kishore Vattikoti (\"Vattikoti\"), which is attached to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (FTC Mot. to Strike 1:22-24, ECF No. 96 ). In the declaration, Koshore Vattikoti makes numerous broad assertions regarding the validity of Defendants' conference and publishing practices. (Vattikoti Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, Ex. 3 to Defs.' MSJ, ECF No. 89-3 ). Additionally, Vattikoti testifies that \"all consumer complaints [against Defendants] have been resolved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Attached to the declaration is what appears to be a summary exhibit of consumer complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. C). The summary exhibit contains notations regarding the manner in which Defendants purportedly resolved the complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The FTC asserts that this declaration violates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\") 56(c)(4) because it fails to include \"specific facts\" of which the declarant has personal knowledge. (FTC Mot. to Strike 2:7-9). Specifically, the FTC notes that Gedela has previously testified that Vattikoti's responsibilities are limited to helping Defendants with this specific action, and he is not involved in the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:24-3:4). In response, Defendants claim that Vattikoti has sufficient personal knowledge as Defendants' legal counsel and through assisting in Defendants' prior transactional and marketing matters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. 2:25-3:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   FRCP 56(c)(4) states that an affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Here, Defendants fail to articulate how Vattikoti's role as Defendants' legal counsel gives him personal knowledge of whether 74 specific consumer complaints have been resolved. Defendants also fail to identify the source of the notations on Vattikoti's summary exhibit, thus giving no basis to the evidence he is relying upon. The Court therefore strikes these portions as violating Rule 56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the remaining portions, the Court finds Defendants have sufficiently demonstrated Vattikoti's personal knowledge and therefore will not strike them. Nonetheless, the Court notes that these vague and conclusory assertions do not raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casey v.

(FTC's MSJ 43:7-44:10). The Court agrees. In their websites and email solicitations, Defendants represent that their journals follow standard peer review processes in the academic journal industry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX11 Admission No. 60 ); (SJX12 Admission Nos. 61-64); (SJX13 at 6-14); (SJX 15 at 4-8, 11-14); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX1 Solicitation Email at 8); (SJX26 Att. Q at 576, 585, 588, 630, 698); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 657). Under standard industry practice, however, the peer review process takes several weeks/months and involves multiple rounds of substantive feedback from experts in that field. (SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). In this case, the FTC has submitted uncontroverted evidence showing that Defendants' peer review practices often took a matter of days and contained no comments or substantive feedback. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX 26 Att. A at 20, 53, 69, 84, 86, 114). Although Defendants challenge the length of time required for peer review, Defendants fail to provide any evidence to support such a short review time. Furthermore, the FTC has submitted uncontroverted statements from purported \"editors\" indicating that they never even received manuscripts to review or else even agreed to be listed as an editor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX02 Grace Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7); (PX08 Howland Decl. \u00b6 7); (PX11 Rusu Decl. \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants also expressly represent that their publications have high impact factors. (SJX26 Att. Q at 741-768); (PX12 Att. L 657, 691, 762, 766, 768-769, 881-935); (SJX15 Admissions Nos. 196,\n   197). The term impact factor is understood in the community to mean the annual calculation released by Thomson Reuters. (SJX18 Backus Decl. \u00b6 16). In contrast, Defendants base their impact factor off a Google Scholar search. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 770); (SJX14 Admission No. 103 ); (SJX26 Att. P at 467, 763). Despite this deviation, Defendants repeatedly make misleading representations regarding their journals' impact factors without any qualification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX27 Email at 3); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 657, 762); (SJX26 Att. Q at 820). Furthermore, even when Defendants do provide a qualification, such statements are not prominently displayed. The mere fact that Defendants have some form of disclaimer does not alter the deceptive net impression.\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338578\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/96/1110/#p1146\">\n    96 F.Supp.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (D.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX10 Att. D at 16); (SJX26 Att. Q at 589, 820, 916, 923). These representations are rendered false by Defendants' own admissions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX07 Admission Nos. 13, 14); (SJX08 Admission Nos. 13, 14). Moreover, NLM itself refuses to index Defendants' publications due to questionable publishing practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX18 \u00b6\u00b6 32-36, Att. B at 25, Att. C at 28, Att. D at 31, Att. E at 33-34). Despite NLM's requests to disassociate with Defendants, Defendants continue to misrepresent their inclusion in Medline and PubMed Central. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX10 Att. D at 16); (SJX26 Att. Q at 589). The uncontroverted evidence in the record therefore demonstrates that Defendants have made numerous express and material misrepresentations regarding their journal publishing practices. As Defendants have failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact, the Court grants the FTC summary judgment on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    3) Misrepresentations Regarding Scientific Conferences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The FTC moves for summary judgment on the basis that no genuine dispute exists as to Defendants' deceptive conference practices. (FTC's MSJ 44:11-45:3). The FTC is correct. Here, the uncontroverted evidence produced by the FTC demonstrates that Defendants engaged in material misrepresentations regarding their conferences. Notably, the FTC has submitted evidence showing that Defendants advertise the attendance and participation of prominent academics and researchers without their permission or actual affiliation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX05 \u00b6\u00b6 3,5; PX12 Att. U at 1045); (SJX26 Att. A at 22, 56, 170). In fact, based on a sampling of 100 conferences, approximately 60% advertised organizers or participants who had not agreed to serve in such capacity. (SJX25 McAlvanah Decl. \u00b6 7). Had consumers known of Defendants' misrepresentations, it is likely they would not have agreed to attend, participate in, or be affiliated with Defendants' conferences. The fact that some cities may have sent Defendants generic appreciation or invitation letters does not negate Defendants' underlying deception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stefanchik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5656737\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/924/#p928\">\n    559 F.3d at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, as Defendants have failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact, the Court grants the FTC summary judgment on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    4) Misrepresentations Regarding Publishing Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The FTC moves for summary judgment on the basis that no genuine dispute exists as to Defendants' failure to adequately disclose publishing fees. (FTC's MSJ 45:4-46:4). The Court again agrees. As noted above, Defendants frequently\n   send out solicitation emails inviting individuals to submit articles to Defendants' online publications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX04 Att. A at 6); (PX09 Att. A at 4); (PX10 Att. D at 16, Att. G at 37); (PX11 Att. D at 11). In numerous instances, these email solicitations contain no mention of any associated fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Despite these omissions, Defendants invite consumers to submit articles for publication by responding directly to the emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Industry practice is to clearly disclose the fees before authors submit their articles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX13 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6). A consumer submitting an article through email could therefore reasonably and mistakenly assume that there is no charge for publishing in Defendants' journals. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants also solicit article submissions through their online portals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX15 at 25-26). In many instances, however, Defendants' article homepages do not contain clear references to fees. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX12 Att. L at 652-654, 734-738); (SJX26 Att. Q at 631-640). In other instances, Defendants' fee disclosures are contained on secondary webpages but are difficult to find and lack specificity. (PX12 Att. K at 375-381). While Defendants assert that fees are clearly disclosed on their general home page, multiple avenues exist to submit an article without navigating through this page. Additionally, Defendants have provided no evidence to support the assertion that reasonable consumers would check their home page for specific fee disclosures, rather than the actual article submission pages. Indeed, Defendants' Response to the FTC's Motion for Summary Judgment merely asserts broad conclusions based on inadmissible hyperlinks to Defendants' purported websites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. 32:1-33:17, ECF No. 110 ). Regardless, the fact that some consumers may have seen Defendants' fee information prior to submitting an article does not negate the overall deceptive nature of Defendants' fee disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SlimAmerica, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11502572\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/77/1263/#p1275\">\n    77 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1275 ;\n   <em>\n    Figgie Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514353\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/595/#p605\">\n    994 F.2d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX02 Answer \u00b6\u00b6 6-8); (Gedela Decl. \u00b6 6). Furthermore, Defendants do not dispute that Gedela is the sole owner and founding director of the three Corporate Defendants and has maintained control over\n   their business practices and financial accounts. (SJX10 Admission Nos. 1-4, 20); (SJX02 Answer \u00b6 9); (SJX03 OMICS Int. Resp. 2); (SJX04 iMedPub Int. Resp. 2); (SJX05 Conference Series Int. Resp. 2); (Defs.' MSJ 5:3-4, ECF No. 89 ). With respect to pooled resources, the FTC has submitted undisputed evidence of Defendants' comingled assets, such as the bank account in Palo Alto. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FTC's MSJ 6:10-7:27). Lastly, each entity was a beneficiary and participant in Defendants' shared deceptive publishing and conference scheme. The Court therefore finds that the Corporate Defendants operated as a common enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    6) Gedela's Individual Liability for Injunctive and Monetary Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Personal liability for violations of the FTC Act fall into two categories: liability for injunctive relief and liability for monetary relief. Individuals are liable for injunctive relief if they directly participate in the deceptive acts or have the authority to control them.\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

As detailed above, Gedela is the founder, principal, and owner of the Corporate Defendants. He has signatory authority over the corporations' financial accounts and is the billing contact for Defendants' websites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJX02 Answer \u00b6 9); (SJX10 Admission No. 22 ). He is also the main contact for the Corporate Defendants' servicers, including their payment processor. (PX12 Att. P at 1007; Att. O at 997, 999; Att. D at 109). The OMICS website itself openly proclaims Gedela as the \"CEO and Managing Director,\" and states that iMedPub LLC and Conference Series LLC are subsidiaries of OMICS International. (PX12 Att. L at 937; PX22 Att. C at 17). In aggregate, the evidence in the record conclusively establishes Gedela's knowledge, control, and participation in Defendants' deceptive acts.
