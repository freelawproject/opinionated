LEE, U.S. District Judge\n   In this diversity case, Cook County (\"the County\") has sued Kellogg Company (\"Kellogg\") under Illinois law for unjust enrichment, as well as for a declaratory judgment that the County is not obligated to provide free steam heat to Kellogg. Kellogg, in turn, has countersued the County for a declaratory judgment that the County is so obligated and for breach of a covenant running with the land. The County has moved for summary judgment on its claims. Kellogg has cross-moved for summary judgment as to the County's claims, as well as Kellogg's own declaratory judgment claim. For the reasons provided below, the County's motion is denied, and Kellogg's motion is granted. Because Kellogg has not moved for summary judgment on its breach-of-covenant counterclaim, it is the only claim that remains for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prior to December 27, 1973, the City of Chicago (\"the City\") owned a municipal heating plant. Def.'s LR 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 94. On that date, the City and the County entered into an agreement entitled, \"Contract for the Sale of a Municipal Heating Plant from the City of Chicago to the County of Cook\" (\"1973 Agreement\"). Pl.'s Ex. 1, 1973 Agreement at 10, ECF No. 88-1.

The County, however, planned to build and rehabilitate additional facilities that would require significantly more steam heat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. To service these additional facilities, the plant needed to undergo the construction of an addition as well as other improvements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given this, the City and the County agreed that it would be better for the County to possess fee title to the plant, rather than the City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In pertinent part, the 1973 Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1.

B. The warehouse is located\n   south of W. 31\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Street and west of Sacramento Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, on a parcel assigned PIN 16-36-100-056-0000 by the County Recorder (\"Warehouse Property\"). Def.'s LR 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From 1973 to 2015, the County provided steam heat to the Warehouse Property at no cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. During this time, various private entities owned, leased, or otherwise occupied the Warehouse Property. Pl.'s LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. \u00b6 31, ECF No. 88. For example, the City subleased the Warehouse Property to Farley Candy Co. (\"Farley\") in 1992, and the sublease was recorded with the County Recorder. Def.'s LR 56.1(b)(3)(C) Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. At some point thereafter, the City conveyed the deed to the Warehouse Property to Farley, which was succeeded by Favorite Brands International, Inc. (\"Favorite Brands\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Favorite Brands then conveyed the deed in the Warehouse Property to Nabisco, Inc., and the transfer was recorded with the County Recorder in 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Nabisco, Inc. then was succeeded in interest by Kraft Foods Global Inc. (\"Kraft\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, in 2005, Kraft entered into an asset purchase agreement with Kellogg. And, as part of that transaction, Kraft conveyed its fee simple interest in the Warehouse Property to Keebler Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kellogg, by special warranty deed, which was recorded with the County Recorder in June 2005.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to purchasing the Warehouse Property, Kellogg learned, as part of its due-diligence inquiry, that the owner of the Warehouse Property is entitled to steam heat free of charge as in past practice with prior owners.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Not surprisingly, this affected the purchase price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To date, neither the City nor Kellogg has notified the County that steam heat is no longer required at the Warehouse Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. Nonetheless, the County ceased providing steam heat to Kellogg in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. On May 15, 2015, the County sent a letter demanding payment of $ 2,116,800 for steam heat the County had provided Kellogg from 2005 to 2015.

The County relies in part on a case in which an Illinois appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of a motion to compel arbitration where the defendant corporation was deemed a successor due to its merger with a corporation that had signed the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robert A.

First, the\n   <em>\n    Venner\n   </em>\n   court stated, in 1908, that the City was growing through annexation of surrounding villages and cities, not that it faced acquisition. Second, nowhere does\n   <em>\n    Venner\n   </em>\n   refer to any annexing entity as a \"successor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the end, the Court is unpersuaded by the County's crabbed reading of the term \"successor.\" In the context of a contract involving real property, such as the 1973 Agreement, the most natural reading of the term \"successor\" describes one to whom title to the property is conveyed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kessler v.

Because the City conveyed the deed to the Warehouse Property to Farley, and, after a series of owners, the deed was ultimately conveyed to Kellogg, the Court holds that Kellogg is the City's \"successor\" to the Warehouse Property as that term appears in the 1973 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, the County argues that paragraph 3, which states that the \"right of the City to receive steam heat from the Municipal Heating Plant shall be a 'covenant running with the land' for the benefit of [the Warehouse Property,]\" only obligates the County to provide steam heat to the building, not to provide it for free.

But this argument is belied by the unambiguous language in the 1973 Agreement, discussed above. What is more, it is inconsistent with the liquidated-damages provision itself. Paragraph 9 requires the County to pay to the City $ 3,360,000 in damages (less the aggregated value of the steam heat service as of the date of default) if the County defaults within ten years and requires the County to pay to the City \"its actual damages, if any,\" thereafter. 1973 Agreement \u00b6 9.

The conveyance also enabled the County to upgrade the plant to provide heat to additional buildings. This, in turn, aided the County in providing additional public services to its citizens. The public purpose was further served because the 1973 Agreement created an arrangement that saved the County from having to pay the City $ 3,360,000 from public coffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   What is more, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the legislative body of the County, reviewed the 1973 Agreement-including the requirement that the County would provide free steam heat to the City and its successors-and approved it.

But these figures alone do nothing to advance the County's argument, and the County provides little else. For example, the County does not provide the appraised value of the municipal heating plant in today's dollars, as opposed to\n   what it was worth in 1973. Nor does it provide a valuation of the plant that reflects the upgrades that were made possible by the 1973 Agreement. The County also has not compared the percentage of total steam heat output that was used by Kellogg versus the percentage utilized by the County from 2005 to 2015. This information would be helpful, because Exhibit B to the 1973 Agreement shows that the Warehouse Property was only one of sixteen City buildings to which the County was required to supply free steam heat. 1973 Agreement, Ex. B. Assuming that approximately the same amount of steam output was required to heat each building in 1973, the Warehouse Property would have used only one-sixteenth of the steam used by the City (which in turn was only thirty percent of the heating plant's total output at the time). Pl.'s LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. \u00b6 9. Thus, under these conditions, the Warehouse Property would have received only 1.87% of the plant's total steam output.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Given that the County received title to the entire plant as part of the 1973 Agreement, the Count concludes that the County has not provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that its obligation to provide steam heat free of charge to Kellogg is more than incidental to the public purpose served by the 1973 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Whether the 1973 Agreement Is Terminable at Will\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The County's final argument is that the 1973 Agreement is terminable at will because it is a contract of indefinite duration. \"Under Illinois law, perpetual contracts are disfavored, so the law presumes that such contracts are terminable at will by either party.\"\n   <em>\n    Burford v.
