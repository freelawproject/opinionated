For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff brought this suit against Defendant, alleging breach of contract for failure to pay benefits due under the commercial property insurance policy (\"the Policy\"). Defendant issued the Policy to Plaintiff for the period of March 26, 2016, through March 26, 2017. (Insurance Policy, Doc. 49-2, at 2). Plaintiff's insured property consists of thirteen buildings inside a condominium complex named Bahama Bay II located in Kissimmee, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about December 9, 2016, a sinkhole appeared near Building 43. (Vidal Dep., Doc. 49-4, at 17: 8-25; Structural Engineering and Inspections (\"SEI\") Rpt., Doc. 53-3, at 1). After the sinkhole appeared, Building 43 was vacated and the building was declared unsafe. (Deatherage Dep., Doc. 49-5, at 17: 9-11; 21: 5-25). Building 43 remains unoccupied, (Doc. 49-4 at 127: 1-5), and after seven months, Plaintiff's board excused Building 43 condominium owners from paying association dues, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 125: 19-126: 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant for benefits under the Policy, (Wilkinson Dep., Doc. 53-2, at 12: 1-25, 16: 7-14). Defendant investigated the loss, (Doc. 38 \u00b6 9; Answer, Doc. 41, \u00b6 9), accepted coverage for Building 43 under the Policy's Catastrophic Ground Cover Collapse (\"CGCC\") provision, (Wilkinsin Aff., Doc. 49-1, \u00b6 14; Feb. 1, 2017 Letter, Doc. 53-8, at 2), and issued a check to Plaintiff in the amount of $ 290,000 for \"immediate repairs,\" (Doc. 49-1 \u00b6 15; Doc. 53-8 at 2). Defendant denied coverage as to buildings 42, 44, 45; repairs to the foundation of all buildings; the retaining wall and outdoor fences; security fencing and guards; land, landscaping, and patios; uncollected association dues; condominium unit owner property; and matching damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The CGCC provision of the Policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property caused by or resulting from catastrophic ground cover collapse, meaning geological activity that results in all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) The abrupt collapse of the ground cover;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) A depression in the ground cover clearly visible to the naked eye;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c) Structural damage to the building, including the foundation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (d) The insured structure being condemned and ordered to be vacated by the governmental agency authorized by law to issue such an order for that structure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   However, structural damage consisting merely of the settling or cracking of a foundation, structure or building does not constitute loss or damage resulting from a catastrophic ground cover collapse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. 49-2 at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After receiving the initial payment from Defendant, Plaintiff installed underpinning to help stabilize Building 43 as well as to pay attorneys, public adjusters, and for security at the building. (Doc. 49-4 at 151: 5-25). At the time Defendant accepted coverage, it also requested Plaintiff provide a Proof of Loss. (Doc. 53-8 at 2). Plaintiff sent Defendant a Proof of Loss, which Defendant rejected as incomplete. (Doc. 53-2 at 84: 1-16, 92: 3-93: 20; Proof of Loss, Doc. 53-12 at 2-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August 2017, Plaintiff filed suit alleging that Defendant breached the insurance contract by failing to provide additional coverage. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., Doc. 2). Defendant filed an Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counter-claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently amended the complaint twice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 22, 38). The Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 38) is now the operative complaint. Defendant filed Answers and Affirmative Defenses, (Doc. Nos. 29, 41), in response to each Amended Complaint but Defendant never realleged its Counter-claim. Defendant now moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In this context, a blanket policy is a policy which puts an overall \"blanket\" limit of insurance on all property owned by the insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 NEW APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE LAW LIBRARY EDITION \u00a7 41.02[2] (2018). As applicable here, if the Policy is a blanket policy, Defendant would owe Plaintiff for all damage occurring to the covered property-buildings 42, 44, 45-resulting from one covered cause of loss up to the policy limit. On the other hand, a scheduled policy typically schedules separately each piece of covered property into distinct insurance contracts. Here, if the Policy is scheduled, each piece of covered property must qualify for coverage independently of one other, as the policy is not one, but thirteen separate policies-one for each scheduled building.\n   <em>\n    Florida Ins.

Meaning, each building must separately meet the requirements for CGCC in order to qualify for coverage under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COUCH ON INSURANCE at \u00a7 175:90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The most obvious example of a blanket policy would be a policy that does not differentiate between multiple sites or pieces of property, and which only contains a single premium, deductible, and limit of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 NEW APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE LAW LIBRARY EDITION \u00a7 41.02[2] (2018). For a scheduled policy, the classic example would be a policy with separately delineated sites or properties, as well as separate deductibles and limits of insurance. These policies \"typically identify the covered properties by name, address or other description in a declarations page and expressly exclude coverage for all property not so identified.\" NEW APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE LAW at \u00a7 41.02[2]. Scheduled policies can have one or multiple premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Food Stores, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins.

The Policy describes the insured premises by reference to a \"Statement of Values,\" also called a \"Schedule of Covered Premises,\" which is a list of thirteen buildings separately identified by address. Normally, reference to this type of \"statement of values\" indicates that the policy is a scheduled policy.\n   <em>\n    Landmark Am. Ins. Co. v. Pin-Pon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890790\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/432/#p438\">\n    155 So.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Fair Grounds Corp. v.

Ct. App. 1999) ). The Policy never references any overall or combined limit of insurance, and instead each of the thirteen buildings has its own limit of insurance, which is the most the insurer will pay as to the specified building \"for loss or damage in any one occurrence.\" (Doc. 49-2, at 56, 19 \u00b6 C). Though there is one deductible per occurrence, the separate scheduling of the premises plus the separate limits of insurance show that this Policy, read as a whole, is a scheduled policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because the Policy is a scheduled policy, whether Defendant breached the Policy by failing to provide coverage for\n   Buildings 42, 44, and 45 depends on whether each of the buildings independently qualified for coverage. In order to qualify for the CGCC Coverage at issue here, \"all of the following\" must have occurred to each building individually:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (a) The abrupt collapse of the ground cover;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b) A depression in the ground cover clearly visible to the naked eye;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (c) Structural damage to the building, including the foundation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (d) The insured structure being condemned and ordered to be vacated by the governmental agency authorized by law to issue such an order for that structure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Doc. 49-2 at 27). Only Building 43 meets all four prongs necessary for CGCC coverage, as only Building 43 was ordered to be vacated by a governmental agency. (Interogg., Doc. 49-6, \u00b6 5; Doc. 49-4 at 141:18-142:11). Buildings 42, 44, and 45 have not been condemned or ordered to be vacated. Accordingly, Defendant did not breach the contract by refusing to issue coverage under the Policy for Buildings 42, 44, and 45 based on CGCC, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Counts III, IV, and V of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Retaining Wall and Fence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant argues that it did not breach the insurance contract for failing to issue coverage for the retaining wall and outdoor fences allegedly damaged by the CGCC. According to the Policy, Defendant \"will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property caused by or resulting from the catastrophic ground cover collapse.\" (Doc. 49-2 at 27). Thus, the retaining wall and fence must be considered covered property under the Policy to be covered under the CGCC provision. They are not.

Similarly, the fence behind the retaining wall is outside and not connected to any building. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 49-8). Accordingly, a person of ordinary intelligence would find that the retaining wall, as well as the fence parallel to the wall, are not covered property because they are not connected any building.

Patios, land, and landscaping to the extent landscaping includes lawns, trees, shrubs, or plants, are not covered by the Policy. Additionally, foundations that are below the surface of the ground are explicitly not covered by the Policy. Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that the foundations here are above ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for damages relating to patios, land, landscaping, and for foundations below the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

So, to be covered under the Policy, the damage must be actual property damage or loss. The cost of security guards and security fencing for Building 43 is not property damage, or \"physical loss ... to Covered Property,\" but is an economic loss. There is nothing in the Policy that covers economic loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colony Ins. Co. v. Montecito Renaissance, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:09-cv-1469-T-30MAP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204529948\">\n    2011 WL 4529948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2011) (denying coverage under the insurance policy on summary judgment for several counts where economic injury was not property damage as understood by the policy);\n   <em>\n    James River Ins.

Fla. 2016) (holding no duty to defend because underlying action did not seek damages \"from physical injury to tangible property\" per the policy, \"but instead [sought] economic damages\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, even if the Policy did provide coverage for economic losses, two other sections also exclude these specific costs from coverage. First, the Policy expressly excludes from coverage \"loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by ... [t]he enforcement of any ordinance or law ... [r]egulating the construction, use or repair of any property.\" (Doc. 49-2 at 29). The Policy also states that \"[i]n the event of loss or damage covered by this Coverage Form ... [t]he cost to repair, rebuild or replace does not include the increased cost attributable to enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction, use or repair of any property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Therefore, even if Plaintiff proved that the security guard and fencing were mandated by the county, these costs would be excluded because they would be incurred due to the enforcement of a county ordinance or law regulating the use or repair of the property. Defendant is entitled to summary judgement on Plaintiff's\n   claim that it is liable for the costs of security for Building 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Uncollected Association Dues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant also moves for summary judgement on Plaintiff's claim that Defendant is liable for uncollected association dues for Building 43. Uncollected association dues are akin to lost business income and are an economic loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Image Prods., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3980950\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/475/569/#p573\">\n    475 F.

As discussed above, the Policy only provides coverage for physical property damage, not economic losses. Accordingly, Defendant is also entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for uncollected association dues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Condominium Unit Owner Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant asserts that it is not liable for any damages claimed by Plaintiff that are for property within individual units, owned by condominium owners, in any of the Buildings. Plaintiff's Response argues that because these damages are \"certainly caused by or resulting from the CGCC covered cause of loss,\" Defendant is liable for them. (Doc. 53 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Under Florida law, the insured has the burden of proving a claim is covered by the insurance policy, the insurer has the burden of proving an exclusion to coverage, and the insured also has the burden of proving an exception to a policy exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Markel Int'l Ins. Co. v. Brisas Del Yunque Rest., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:09-cv-1989-Orl-35DAB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011507703\">\n    2010 WL 11507703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla.

Plaintiff has not met its burden of showing that the condominium unit owner's property falls within the Policy. The Policy states that it covers \"direct or physical loss or damage to Covered Property caused by or resulting from catastrophic ground cover collapse.\" (Doc. 49-2 at 27). Plaintiff failed to make any argument that condominium property within individual units, owned by unit owners, qualified as Covered Property. Instead, it summarily argued that the damage to this property was caused by a CGCC and thus must be covered. In fact, Florida law makes it clear that property insurance issued to a condominium complex does not cover property within individual units. Section 718.111(11)(f) of the Florida Statutes covers insurance for condominium associations. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (f) Every property insurance policy issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2009, for the purpose of protecting the condominium must provide primary coverage for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   1. All portions of the condominium property as originally installed or replacement of like kind and quality, in accordance with the original plans and specifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   2. All alterations or additions made to the condominium property or association property pursuant to s. 718.113(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The coverage must exclude all personal property within the unit\n   </em>\n   or limited common elements, and floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, electrical fixtures, appliances, water heaters, water filters, built-in cabinets and countertops, and window treatments, including curtains, drapes, blinds, hardware, and similar window treatment components, or replacements of any of the foregoing which are\n   <em>\n    located within the boundaries of the unit and serve only such unit\n   </em>\n   . Such property and any insurance thereupon is the\n   <em>\n    responsibility of the unit owner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20718.111\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 718.111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11)(f) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to\n   meet its burden to show that property owned by condominium unit owners within the individual units is, or even can be, covered under the Policy. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for these damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Matching Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On this issue, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment, that it is not liable for \"matching\" damages-i.e., the cost of making the old, non-damaged components aesthetically match the new components that were replaced or repaired due to the covered loss. Plaintiff's Response makes no argument regarding entitlement to matching damages other than to say in a footnote that whether incurred damages are for matching is a question of fact. While this is true, whether Defendant will be liable for matching damages per the Policy is a question of law for this Court to resolve. Plaintiff, in making no argument regarding entitlement to matching damages, has not met its burden to show these damages fall within the Policy. Moreover, the Policy states that it only covers \"direct physical loss or damage.\" (Doc. 49-2 at 15). Matching damages are not within the Policy as the very premise of matching damages is that they are for the replacement of some building components not damaged so that they \"match\" the replaced components.\n   <em>\n    Ocean View Towers Ass'n, Inc. v.

Failure to Mitigate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that the Policy dictates it is not liable for losses caused by Plaintiff's failure to mitigate damages. Additionally, Defendant requests that the Court enter summary judgment stating that Defendant owes no additional coverage under the Policy due to Plaintiff's failure to protect the Property following the CGCC. (Doc. 49 at 32-34). The Policy requires Plaintiff to \"[t]ake all reasonable steps to protect the Covered Property from further damage, and keep a record of your expenses necessary to protect the Covered Property, for consideration in the settlement of the claim.\" (Doc. 49-2 at 18-19). Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not take \"all reasonable steps to protect to Covered Property from further damage\" after the initial underpinning work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, whether Plaintiff took \"all reasonable steps\" to protect the property and whether other reasonable steps existed and should have been taken are questions of fact for a jury.\n   <em>\n    Bartram, LLC v.

Apr. 29, 2005) (finding there to be a genuine issue of material fact when the court could not \"determine ... what repairs were reasonable and necessary to protect the property\"). The Court's determination that failure to mitigate is a question of fact is especially true where, as here, there is some undisputed evidence of repairs being performed-i.e., the initial underpinning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGuire v.
