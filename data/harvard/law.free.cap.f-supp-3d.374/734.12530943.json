(\"Tootsie Roll\") packaged and sold its Junior Mints candy product in opaque boxes that hid the large amount of empty space contained in them. Stemm believes that this practice violates the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (the \"ICFA\"), 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Stemm also brings a class action claim for unjust enrichment. Tootsie Roll has moved to dismiss Stemm's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6) and to strike Stemm's class claims for unjust enrichment under Rule 12(f). For the reasons set forth herein, Tootsie Roll's motion to dismiss is granted in part and stricken without prejudice in part, and its motion to strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Stemm bought a box of Junior Mints (the \"Product\") from a Walgreens store in Belleville, Illinois for approximately one dollar in March 2018. Compl. \u00b6 6, ECF No. 1. The Product was packaged in an opaque, cardboard box, and Stemm could not see its contents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21-22.
