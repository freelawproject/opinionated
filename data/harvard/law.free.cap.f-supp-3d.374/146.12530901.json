Ms. Maddox, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sued Wells Fargo and the entities for which it was acting as a trustee, alleging violations of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, she contends that Wells Fargo refused to consider her loss mitigation application before foreclosing on her home, and that Defendants acted in bad faith by intentionally undervaluing her home in the foreclosure sale. Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint. Because Maddox has not pled any facts suggesting that she submitted a proper loss mitigation application-instead relying on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan-and because her challenge to the foreclosure sale amounts to an improper collateral challenge to a state-court judgement under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the Court will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Yet she has not pled any facts to suggest that she has done so. She has provided no authority-and the Court has been unable to identify any-to support the notion that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan can function as a loss mitigation application. Neither the relevant Dodd-Frank provisions, their implementing regulations, nor RESPA make any reference to Chapter 13 bankruptcy plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In other words, there is no basis for concluding that a mere mention of a mortgage as part of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan triggered the loss mitigation procedures required by Regulation X. The schemes diverge in important ways, including: a debtor's obligation to submit information regarding alternatives to foreclosure, to whom the debtor submits such information, the information that must be submitted, a creditor's obligation to respond to a debtor's proposals, the process of approval, and the mechanism for oversight. To illustrate: Maddox's proposals for handling her mortgage debt were submitted as a Chapter 13 plan, directed to the Bankruptcy Court for its approval or rejection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201321\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1322, 1324.

R. Bankruptcy P. 3015(f). Regulation X, meanwhile, permits a debtor to submit a loss mitigation application to the servicer itself and obligates some response when the application is properly submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(2). If Maddox were correct that the Chapter 13 plan constituted a loss mitigation application, Regulation X would require a response, even though the plan was submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, not Defendants, and notwithstanding the fact that the Bankruptcy Code and Rules of Procedure make a creditor's response voluntary. The two schemes simply cannot be squared with one another. A reference to mortgage debt submitted as part of a Chapter 13 plan does not suffice to prompt obligations under Regulation X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, even assuming Maddox's complaint seeks to invoke Regulation X and its private right of action, she has not pled sufficient facts to sustain a claim. Because Maddox never submitted a valid loss mitigation application, Defendants\n   could not have violated the procedural obligations such an application triggers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the extent Maddox is dissatisfied that the Bankruptcy Court lifted the stay and declined to confirm her Second Amended Chapter 13 Plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 2, 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 4, 5, 7, she had the opportunity to be heard by Judge Teel, who found that her Chapter 13 Plan was unsatisfactory and rejected her contention that she had positive equity in the property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bankruptcy Matter at ECF Nos. 82, 84, 85.
