Keith Watkins, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case asks whether a city police officer who, apparently without seeking permission or notifying proper authorities, decided to investigate an alleged crime the officer admits occurred outside his city's jurisdiction, then used his findings to get a search warrant allowing him to peruse the contents of an attorney's cell phone, is entitled to qualified and state-agent immunity. The answer, under federal and Alabama law, is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. # 48.) Defendant contends that qualified and state-agent immunity entitle him to summary judgment on the individual-capacity claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Alabama law, respectively. Defendant also argues that the official-capacity claims fail under both \u00a7 1983 and Alabama law. Defendant is correct on the latter, but not on the former. Defendant is immune from the official-capacity claims, but not the individual-capacity claims. The court will therefore grant Defendant summary judgment only on the official-capacity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment is inappropriate on the individual-capacity claims. Defendant contends that, even if he is not entitled to qualified or state-agent immunity, summary judgment is due because a lawful search warrant cleanses any constitutional infirmities in his actions. Not so. For the reasons below, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant violated Plaintiff's constitutional and state-law rights. The court will therefore deny Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the individual-capacity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Shane Ash is an investigator for the Dothan Police Department. Plaintiff Ruth Robinson, an attorney, represents James Bailey, a man convicted of murder, in post-conviction proceedings in state court in Henry County. Dothan is in adjoining Houston County, and both counties comprise the Twentieth Judicial Circuit of Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff was scheduled to attend a hearing in the Bailey case at the Henry County Courthouse on October 7, 2016. In preparation, Plaintiff did some digging. Two days before the hearing, on October 5, 2016, Plaintiff learned that Danielle Whittington might have some information relating to Bailey's case. As it turns out, Whittington was a confidential informant against Bailey in one of his criminal cases, (Doc. # 49-1, at 2), although Plaintiff claims she did not know this when she first reached out to Whittington, (Doc. # 51-6, at 3). In any event, hoping to find out more, Plaintiff called Whittington's mother to try to get in touch with Whittington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Whittington called Plaintiff shortly thereafter. Plaintiff says Whittington told her she needed more time to get her thoughts together and would call Plaintiff back the next day. (Doc. # 51-6, at 2.) Whittington says she told Plaintiff not to call again. (Doc. # 49-1, at 2.) Plaintiff sent Whittington several more messages that evening. According to Plaintiff, Whittington responded by text that she was out of minutes on her cell phone and would be\n   unable to call until the October 7, the day of the hearing. (Doc. # 51-6, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   So Plaintiff decided to visit Whittington in person. The next day, October 6, Plaintiff went to Whittington's house near Newton, Alabama - a town with corporate limits entirely within Dale County - a little after 10:00 p.m. According to an affidavit by the sheriff of Houston County, the actual \"Newton\" address of Whittington is in Houston County, not Dale County. (Doc. # 49-9, at 1.) In any event, the address was outside Defendant's Dothan police jurisdiction but apparently inside the same county - Houston. Plaintiff knocked on the door, but Whittington's boyfriend answered and told Plaintiff that Whittington was not home. (Doc. # 49-1, at 3.) Plaintiff departed Whittington's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Bailey hearing was scheduled in the Henry County Courthouse for the next day, October 7. That morning, Plaintiff left Whittington a voicemail shortly before the hearing asking Whittington to give her a call. (Doc. # 51-6, at 3.) At the hearing, Twentieth Circuit District Attorney Douglas Valeska accused Plaintiff of stalking and harassing Allen Hendrickson (not Whittington), one of the officers involved in one of Bailey's cases and \"the very officer whom [Plaintiff] has sought to hold accountable in [those] cases.\" (Doc. # 1, at 7.) Plaintiff denied the accusations, and the circuit court judge declined to address the matter. (Doc. # 51-6, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As she was leaving the hearing, Plaintiff was detained, and her cell phone was seized by Henry County Sheriff's deputies, who presented her a copy of a search warrant, for the phone, issued by a judge of the Twentieth Judicial Circuit. (Doc. # 51-6, at 3.) The only crime mentioned in the warrant is \"the crime of intimidating a witness.\" (Doc. # 49-4, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As it turns out, Defendant was the one who obtained the search warrant from a judge in Dothan, Houston County. Defendant had received a call the day before from Allen Hendrickson - the individual alleged by Valeska to be the victim of Plaintiff's harassment. (Doc. # 49-2, at 2.) But the call from Hendrickson was not about Plaintiff harassing Hendrickson. Instead, it was about\n   <em>\n    Whittington\n   </em>\n   , who had called Hendrickson to complain about Plaintiff contacting her. Whittington told Hendrickson (who repeated it to Defendant) that Plaintiff had tried to get her to commit perjury by telling the court that a Dothan police officer named Terry Nelson had framed Bailey in his drug case and was framing people for murder. (Doc. # 49-1, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Armed with the tip from Hendrickson, Defendant - who, remember, is a Dothan police investigator - decided to investigate. Defendant called Whittington, who told Defendant the same story she had told Hendrickson about Plaintiff calling her to try to get her to commit perjury. (Doc. # 49-2, at 2-3.) The next day, Whittington called Defendant to tell him that Plaintiff had showed up to her house uninvited late at night asking for her. Defendant asked if Whittington wanted to press charges against Plaintiff, and she said yes. (Doc. # 49-1, at 3; Doc. # 49-2, at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant recounted Whittington's tale in an affidavit he used to obtain the warrant from a judge of Alabama's Twentieth Judicial District to search Plaintiff's cell phone for evidence of the \"crime of intimidating a witness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 49-4, at 2.) The warrant was to be executed in Henry County, where Plaintiff would be at the courthouse. (Doc. # 49-4, at 1.) So it was that Henry County Sheriff's deputies, later joined by Defendant, seized Plaintiff's\n   phone as she was leaving the Henry County Courthouse on October 7, 2016. After Defendant took possession of Plaintiff's phone, it remained in the Dothan police department's possession. A few weeks following the seizure, Plaintiff asked Defendant when she would get her phone back, and he did not give her a definitive answer. (Doc. # 51-6, at 4.) This lawsuit followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant orchestrated an illegal search and seizure of her phone to retaliate against her for representing Bailey and speaking out against police misconduct, as well as to discover attorney-client privileged communications. Defendant contends his actions did not violate Plaintiff's constitutional rights because they were justified by a search warrant supported by probable cause, and, in any event, he is entitled to qualified and state-agent immunity on the individual-capacity claims. He moves for summary judgment on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Individual-Capacity Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant's motion relies almost entirely on qualified and state-agent immunity to defend against the individual-capacity claims. The Supreme Court has articulated a two-step procedure for deciding a claim of qualified immunity. First, the court asks, \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\"\n   <em>\n    Saucier v. Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p201\">\n    533 U.S. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p201\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p201\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). If the plaintiff passes the first step, the court then asks whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313023\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/194/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court later held that lower courts have discretion to decide which of\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   's two prongs they address first when a defendant raises qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n    555 U.S. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Because Defendant does not carry his initial burden of showing he was acting within his discretionary authority, the court will discuss that aspect of the qualified-immunity analysis before turning to the constitutional violations Plaintiff alleges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Because Defendant appears to have acted outside his jurisdiction, he is not entitled to qualified or state-agent immunity.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Several of Defendant's qualified immunity arguments have already been considered and rejected in the court's previous memorandum opinion and order (Doc. # 37) denying Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. # 9) on qualified immunity grounds. But even with the facts available at the summary-judgment stage, Defendant has not shown that he is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before the court reaches the \"clearly established\" prong of qualified immunity, \"the public official must first prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.

Because Defendant has not shown he was acting within the scope of his authority under Alabama law when he, on his own, investigated a crime that occurred outside his jurisdiction, he is not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Municipal police officers do not have free-floating jurisdiction in Alabama.

Defendant is thus limited to operating within three miles of the Dothan corporate limits, unless he is making an\n   <em>\n    arrest\n   </em>\n   in Houston County (in which Dothan sits), he is\n   <em>\n    executing a search warrant\n   </em>\n   in tandem with another county's sheriff's deputies, or the crime was committed in his presence. None of these exceptions covers Defendant's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant uses the arrest and search warrant exceptions to argue that a municipal officer may investigate a crime that occurred outside the city's corporate limits, but within his\n   <em>\n    county.\n   </em>\n   That is not so for two reasons. First, the arrest exception does not help Defendant because there was no arrest here. Moreover, that exception does not speak to the situation when the alleged crime was committed\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the municipal officer's jurisdiction. There is no evidence any part of the alleged crime was committed in Defendant's municipal jurisdiction. Second, Defendant's reliance on the search warrant exception is misplaced because it does not speak to the situation when the municipal officer, on his own, transcends his jurisdictional limitations to\n   <em>\n    investigate\n   </em>\n   alleged crimes, then uses his findings to convince a judge he needs a search warrant. That the warrant was lawfully executed does not mean his actions in obtaining the warrant were lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant cites no authority suggesting that a solo, unauthorized municipal officer who investigates alleged crimes that occurred outside his jurisdiction, then uses that information to obtain a search warrant, is entitled to qualified immunity. The\n   cases Defendant does cite are inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Thorn v. Randall\n   </em>\n   , which involved the execution of a search warrant, it was undisputed that the officers were\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   to execute the search warrant and were accompanied by a prosecutor who\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have jurisdiction over the area.

Defendant attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   on the ground that, unlike here, the incidents occurred in a different county than the city for which the officer worked. But Alabama law does not give a municipal officer authority elsewhere in the county except in the three narrow circumstances already discussed. Since the court must look to Alabama law to decide the threshold question of discretionary authority, it is bound to conclude that Defendant had no authority to act on his own, outside his jurisdiction, in obtaining a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant might have argued that some of Plaintiff's alleged criminal acts occurred in an area where he unquestionably had authority -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , within three miles of the Dothan corporate limits. Had Defendant received word that Plaintiff contacted Whittington while in Dothan to ask her to commit perjury, Defendant would have a much stronger case that he was justified in investigating such an allegation. But Defendant appears to concede that none of Plaintiff's alleged criminal acts occurred within Dothan police jurisdiction, instead basing his entire argument on the premise that his jurisdiction covers the whole county. At the very least, there is a genuine dispute of material fact on this point, and Defendant is not entitled to summary\n   judgment on the Fourth Amendment claim for that reason alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant could have taken a different path. He could have called the Newton Police or the Houston County Sheriff to relay Whittington's allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such cooperation is necessary for effective enforcement of the law. But that is not what Defendant did. Defendant chose to take matters into his own hands by tracking down the alleged victim, asking if she would like to press charges, then obtaining a search warrant based on the things she told him - facts that appear to have arisen in an area where he had no authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because investigating crimes outside his jurisdiction is not part of Defendant's job description under Alabama law, Defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity on the individual-capacity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    b. State-Agent Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the same reasons Defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity, Defendant is not entitled to state-agent immunity with respect to Plaintiff's state-law claims against him in his individual capacity. Under Alabama law, municipal police officers such as Defendant are afforded \"immunity from tort liability arising out of his or her conduct in performance of any\n   <em>\n    discretionary function\n   </em>\n   within the line and scope of his or her law enforcement duties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-5-338\">\n    Ala.

And there is no reason to think that a police search of an attorney's phone for information related to that representation would not chill such activity. It is a closer question, however, whether Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence to prevail on prong three: the causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"In order to establish a causal connection, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was\n   <em>\n    subjectively motivated\n   </em>\n   to take the adverse action because of the protected speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle v.

Although the record lacks direct evidence, circumstantial evidence is appropriate in showing retaliatory motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thaddeus-X v. Blatter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720089\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/378/#p399\">\n    175 F.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399 (6th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there are three pieces of circumstantial evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude Defendant had a retaliatory motive. First, Hendrickson, the officer whose conduct Plaintiff was challenging, is the one who passed along the tip to Defendant, thus prompting Defendant's investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 49-2, at 2.) A reasonable jury could believe that Hendrickson had a motive to retaliate against Plaintiff, and could also infer from Hendrickson's tip that he and Defendant were coordinating the actions against Plaintiff. Second, a reasonable jury could infer from the fact that Plaintiff was never prosecuted for a crime and Defendant kept her phone for about two months, giving no indication of when it would be returned, indicates an intent to harass, rather than to pursue legitimate criminal charges. The fact that it was the phone of an attorney actively involved in criminal proceedings in that circuit is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third and perhaps most importantly, Defendant investigated an alleged crime that apparently occurred in an area where he had no authority. Whittington's home is unquestionably outside Dothan's police jurisdiction, and Defendant could not have reasonably believed he had authority to investigate an alleged crime that occurred there. A reasonable jury could think that Defendant's haste - apparently without seeking permission from a supervisor or notifying proper authorities - to investigate an alleged crime that occurred outside his jurisdiction, shows a motive to retaliate against Plaintiff. Relatedly, Defendant would not have had authority to execute the search warrant on his own in another county. Defendant needed the presence of a Henry County sheriff's deputy to execute the warrant in Henry County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015-5-1\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15-5-5, 15-5-7. A reasonable jury could think Defendant's extra efforts were motivated by something other than desire to just do his job. In sum, there is enough circumstantial evidence of retaliatory intent on the part of Defendant to help Plaintiff carry her \"burden of producing ... evidence that would support a jury verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant argues that because the warrant was supported by probable cause, Plaintiff's retaliation claim is deficient as a matter of law. This argument does not entitle Defendant to summary judgment for two reasons. First, in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612344\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1945/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612344\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1945/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), it is not necessarily true that probable cause defeats any First Amendment retaliation claim.

It instead granted certiorari on that question in\n   <em>\n    Nieves v.

Nor has she named the City of Dothan or the Dothan Police Department as defendants. Thus, whether Plaintiff must prove the absence of probable cause is an open question, and one that will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The court will therefore continue the trial of this case to the next Dothan trial term, when the Supreme Court, barring unusual circumstances, will have answered the probable cause question in\n   <em>\n    Nieves\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Once Plaintiff has shown there was a retaliatory motive, the burden shifts to Defendant to show that he \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected conduct, in which case the defendant cannot be held liable.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085050\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1194/#p1197\">\n    631 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

As the court noted in its opinion denying Defendant's motion to dismiss, the warrant \"authorized a broad-arguably comprehensive-search of the contents of Plaintiff's cell phone\" and is \"seemingly unrestricted.\" (Doc. # 37, at 7, 13.) Cell phones present special privacy concerns given the sheer amount and kind of data they contain.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Riley v.

At this stage, the court agrees with Plaintiff that the warrant was overbroad. While Defendant's affidavit seeks to search \"\n    <em>\n     location services\n    </em>\n    and any digital data\n    <em>\n     to confirm the phone calls and text\n    </em>\n    ,\" (Doc. # 49-3, at 1 (emphasis added) ), the warrant itself allows a search of \"any and all communications, emails, pictures, phone directory lists, and call logs,\" (Doc. # 49-4, at 1). The Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant to \"particularly describ[e] the place to be search, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. \"[A] description is sufficiently particular when it enables the searcher reasonably to ascertain and identify the things to be seized.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Whether the warrant's description is specific enough depends on \"the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526852\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/778/609/#p614\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The breadth of the search warrant appears to have exceeded its initial mandate. Defendant's affidavit mentions the need to search location services, text messages, and call logs to confirm that Plaintiff went to Whittington's house and tried to contact her. Instead, the warrant allowed the Dothan Police Department to look at Plaintiff's pictures, emails, and \"any and all digital evidence\" linked to the alleged crime. (Doc. # 49-4, at 1.) Defendant downloaded 16.2 gigabytes of data from the phone (Doc. # 49-6, at 1) and appears to have searched all of it, since he found pictures of Plaintiff and Bailey on the phone (pictures that the Dothan Police Department later gave to the FBI (Doc. # 49-12, at 3) ).

Moreover, the court is reluctant to decide this issue in Plaintiff's favor because\n    <em>\n     she\n    </em>\n    did not move for a summary judgment that the warrant was overbroad. Thus, at this point in time, the court is reluctant to decide as a matter of law that the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement.
