In this case, Plaintiff Terry Blumenfeld asserts that Regions Bank violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Alabama law by pulling her consumer report and sharing that report with her mother, all without Ms. Blumenfeld's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Regions Bank contends that Ms. Blumenfeld lacks standing because she has asserted nothing more than a bare procedural violation of the FCRA for which she has not shown a concrete injury. In response, Ms. Blumenfeld submitted an affidavit in which she attests that she spent $ 40 to $ 50 on a lock box so that she could secure the consumer report that Regions Bank disclosed to her mother. This affidavit prompted Regions Bank to move to exclude that evidence for failing to timely disclose it during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss because Ms. Blumenfeld has presented sufficient evidence to establish standing. The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to exclude the evidence because Ms. Blumenfeld's failure to disclose the information is harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court described in detail the facts underlying this case in a previous memorandum opinion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 44), and will not now repeat all of those facts. Of relevance to the motions currently before the court, taken in the light most favorable to Ms. Blumenfeld, she has presented evidence that Regions Bank pulled her consumer report and shared that report with her mother, all while knowing it did not have her consent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    at 4-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Blumenfeld testified that she has not experienced any issues with identity theft as a result of Regions Bank accessing or sharing her consumer report, and she is not aware of a decrease in her credit score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Doc. 30-1 at 145-46). She also testified that she did not have any out of pocket damages as a result of the violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164). But she testified that she was very angry, embarrassed, and stressed about the disclosure of her consumer report to her mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Now, after the close of discovery, Ms. Blumenfeld has submitted an affidavit in which she attests that she also spent $ 40 to $ 50 on a lock box in order to secure the consumer report. (Doc. 56-3 at 4 \u00b6 13). The affidavit does not explain why she never before disclosed the purchase of the lock box. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). After Regions Bank moved to exclude that part of the affidavit, Ms. Blumenfeld submitted another affidavit in which she states that \"until [she] provided the affidavit to my lawyer ..., [she] did not at the time understand the $ 40 or $ 50 dollars I spent for the lock box to be the type of out of pocket damages defendant was asking about.\" (Doc. 63-1 at 2). Instead, she believed out of pocket damages meant \"medical bills for seeing a doctor or a psychiatrist or psychologist or lost time from work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But before that, the court will briefly set out the statutory background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FCRA regulates permissible uses of and access to consumer reports, and creates a private right of action for willful violations of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681n, 1681o.

The inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   is whether the alleged harm bears a 'close relationship' to one actionable at common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Muransky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518749\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/1200/#p1207\">\n    905 F.3d at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1549 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress may elevate to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete,\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   injuries that were previously inadequate in law.\") (quotation marks and alteration omitted). Regions Bank's position that Ms. Blumenfeld cannot\n   establish a concrete injury unless she can demonstrate every element of Alabama's invasion of privacy cause of action would mean that a plaintiff's standing depends on where she attempts to bring suit, because each state's specific causes of action may be different. The court rejects that suggestion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the correct standard, the alleged harm in this case-disclosure of Ms. Blumenfeld's private financial information to a third party-bears a close relationship to the common law's protection against disclosure of private information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277509\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1336/\">\n    854 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1341 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"If Congress has created a private duty owed personally to [the plaintiff] to protect\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   information, then the violation of the legal duty suffices for Article III injury in fact.\");\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n    489 U.S. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (\"[B]oth the common law and the literal understandings of privacy encompass the individual's control of information concerning his or her person.\"). Accordingly, Ms. Blumenfeld has established that she suffered a concrete injury based on Regions Bank's violation of the FCRA. The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Regions Bank's motion to dismiss her amended complaint for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motion to Exclude Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Regions Bank moves to exclude the evidence that Ms. Blumenfeld purchased a lock box, contending that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, she failed to timely disclose that evidence and cannot now rely on it. (Doc. 60). Regions Bank does not specify whether it seeks to exclude this evidence solely with respect to the motion to dismiss, but all of its arguments relate to Ms. Blumenfeld's use of the evidence to establish standing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p763\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the court's ruling on the motion to exclude the evidence is limited to whether Ms. Blumenfeld can submit this new evidence in opposition to the motion to dismiss; the court will not address whether Ms. Blumenfeld can submit this evidence to a jury on the question of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Rule 37 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (B) may inform the jury of the party's failure; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (C) may impose other appropriate sanctions....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ms. Blumenfeld concedes that she did not timely disclose the purchase of the lock box, but contends that the court should excuse her late disclosure because Regions Bank waited until after the court had denied its motion for summary judgment to raise the issue of standing (doc. 63 at 3), and because she did not understand the meaning of \"out of pocket damages\" when she first testified that she had none (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court finds that Ms. Blumenfeld has not shown substantial justification based on Regions Bank's timing in filing its motion to dismiss for lack of standing. A party's obligation to disclose evidence in discovery does not depend on what the opposing party may assert in a dispositive motion. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 requires parties to provide information\n   about damages \"without awaiting a discovery request.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(iii). Not only did Ms. Blumenfeld not disclose this evidence in her initial disclosures, she also represented to Regions Bank that she had not incurred any out of pocket damages, and only came forth with contrary evidence when Regions Bank moved to dismiss the amended complaint on that ground. Nor does the court find convincing Ms. Blumenfeld's explanation that she did not understand what \"out of pocket expenses\" meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But the court does find that, with respect to this motion to dismiss, Ms. Blumenfeld's failure to disclose the purchase of the lock box is harmless. As the court has explained, Ms. Blumenfeld has standing to bring her FCRA claim. She does not need to show that she incurred monetary damages in order to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Regions Bank's motion to exclude the evidence. This ruling relates only to the question whether to exclude the evidence from consideration in determining standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Regions Bank's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of standing. (Doc. 55). The court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Regions Bank's motion to exclude the evidence. (Doc. 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this March 18, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
