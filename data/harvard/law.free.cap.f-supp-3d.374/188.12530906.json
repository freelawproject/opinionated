BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Mary Doe (\"Mary\"), a minor, and Jane Doe, her mother and next of friend, brought this action alleging various federal and state Jaw claims against the City of Pawtucket, the Pawtucket School Committee and its members, Superintendent of School, Patti DiCenso, Principal of the Pawtucket Learning Academy, Linda Gifford, and additional teachers and members of the Pawtucket Learning Academy (\"PLA\") staff, regarding alleged incidents of sexual assault. At all relevant times, Mary was a student at the PLA, a federally funded school in the City of Pawtucket for students with disabilities and students treated as disabled students. ECF No. 57 at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24. The Complaint involves five allegations of sexual assault:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Allegation 1\n   </em>\n   : Mary alleges that she was raped, assaulted, and molested for two years at the PLA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The allegations include that during school hours and other occasions, \"at or on the way to and from gym classes, during class hours,\" unnamed students would \"grab at,\" \"butt slap,\" and \"grope\" Mary, and \"make sexual remarks and suggestions to her,\" while Defendants \"stood by.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Allegation 2\n   </em>\n   : Mary alleges that in April 2016, a \"male gym student got behind [Mary], and simulated sexual fornication by rubbing his genitalia area against [Mary's] clothed anal area, in front of the gym teacher and class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. The Complaint also includes that \"[a]t that time, [the gym teacher] and/or the school contacted the police.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Allegation 3\n   </em>\n   : Mary alleges that in May 2016, a student raped her in the school bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. The Complaint continues that Principal Gifford asked Mary if she \"had sex with [the student]?\" and \"took no further steps\" when Mary answered yes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Allegation 4\n   </em>\n   : Mary alleges that in June 2016, a student at the school, Ivander DeBurgo, sexually assaulted her in the school while she was waiting for her father to pick her up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 57.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint includes that Principal Gifford and other teachers directed Mr. DeBurgo to leave the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 50. After being directed to leave, Mr. DeBurgo unlawfully re-entered the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Mr. DeBurgo entered Defendant Thomas Anderson's classroom and he told Mr. DeBurgo to leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Mary left Mr. Anderson's classroom and was found in the bathroom with Mr. DeBurgo by Mrs. McLaughlin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 61-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint alleges that all Defendants knew of Mr. DeBurgo's propensity for sexual assault and that Superintendent Patti DiCenso conspired with Assistant Superintendent Lee Rabbit and Dean Christopher Swiczewicz to keep the matter quiet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Allegation 5\n   </em>\n   : Mary alleges that in April 2017, a faculty member, David Morton, \"smacked and grabbed her butt...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78. The Complaint also alleges that before the incident, Defendants DiCenso, Rabbit, Gifford, Swiczewicz, and Anderson \"had, for some time, known of\" incidents whore Mr. Morton touched and tapped the inner thigh of three other students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

The Title IX Claim (Count I) Fails\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Count I, Mary sues Defendants under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Mary alleges that the Defendant School District violated her rights when it \"continued to subject [Mary]...to sexual harassment based on her sex\" and \"failed to promptly and appropriately respond to the sexual harassment and assaults...\" ECF No. 57 at \u00b6\u00b6 81, 82. Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

Here, no individually named defendant is a recipient of federal funding. Accordingly, Title IX claims against all individual Defendants are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2. The Title IX Claim Fails to Set Forth Facts to Establish the Required Elements of Notice, Severity, and Deliberate Indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A recipient of federal funding can be liable under Title IX if \"its deliberate indifference subjects its students to harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

To establish such a \"deliberate indifference\" claim, Mary must set forth sufficient plausible facts that would show that (1) she was subject to \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" sexual harassment; (2) the harassment caused her to be deprived of educational opportunities or benefits; (3) the Defendants were aware of this harassment in (4) its programs and activities and (5) its response, or lack thereof, to the harassment was \"clearly unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Porto v.

To plead a viable claim under section 1983, the Complaint must allege both a violation of a right secured by the United States Constitution or laws, and that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Both Counts IV and V do not state a constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1. The Equal Protection Clause Allegations Fail to State a Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mary's claims that Defendants violated her equal protection rights by inadequately\n   protecting her from and responding to sexual harassment must be dismissed because she did not adequately allege that she was afforded some different level of protection from harassment than her peers as a result of her membership in a protected class. The Equal Protection Clause \"prohibits a state from treating similarly situated persons differently because of their classification in a particular group.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulero-Carrillo v. Rom\u00e1n-Hern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273474\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/99/#p105\">\n    790 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105-106 (1st Cir.2015). To state a \u00a7 1983 claim based on violations of the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff \"must allege facts plausibly demonstrating that compared with others similarly situated,\" the plaintiff was \"selectively treated...based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273474\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/99/#p105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273474\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/99/#p105\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Typically, a plaintiff asserting an Equal Protection Clause violation \"must identify his putative comparators\" to make out a threshold case of disparate treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barron v.

Mass. 2017) (failure to identify any \"similarly situated comparator forecloses equal protection claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, Mary does not allege any facts or address the argument in their opposition that any defendant treated the alleged harassment of her differently than any other student, let alone that the treatment was because of her membership in a protected class. The insufficient allegations require dismissal of the Equal Protection Clause claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. The Due Process Clause Allegations Fail to State A Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Mary also alleges that all Defendants violated her right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. ECF No. 57 at \u00b6 93. The relevant inquiry here is whether Mary has pleaded plausible allegations of any conscience-shocking behavior by the Defendants that led to the alleged injury. The Court finds that the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, Mary's allegations of sexual abuse by students do not state a due process clause claim because students are not state actors. As for this claim, Mary emphasizes that the rape and sexual molestation of a \"13 or 14-year-old student by older males\" in \"a school bathroom\" is shocking \"to the contemporary [conscience]...\" ECF No. 78 at 63. But the Substantive Due Process Clause protects individuals from abuses of\n   <em>\n    governmental\n   </em>\n   power. Generally, it imposes no constitutional duty on the school to protect students from harm inflicted by other students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v.

Likewise, supervisory officials, such as the school officials here, cannot be held vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983. Supervisory liability exists only where \"(1) there is subordinate liability, and (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was 'affirmatively linked' to the constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.\"\n   <em>\n    Aponte Matos v.

The causal link between the supervisor action or inaction and the subordinate wrongdoing must be tight: \"Deliberate indifference will be found only if it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to violate an individual's constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Pineda v.

Indeed, Mary admits that Mr. Morton was criminally prosecuted because of the alleged interaction with Mary. ECF No. 57 at \u00b6 78 (d).

First, many allegations of alleged assaults omit the names of students, dates, and times of the incidents, but Mary alleges that Defendants had knowledge or should have known about them. ECF No. 57 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-31. As pleaded, there are no facts to set forth that any of the students had known assaultive propensities and the incidents were foreseeable.

The Complaint lacks any facts to show that school officials were on notice to protect against a sexual assault by the student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Mary's allegations about Mr. DeBurgo also do not state a negligence claim. First, there are no alleged facts supporting the claim that \"school personnel\" knew or \"should have known\" about an alleged prior rape by Mr. DeBurgo. ECF No. 57 at \u00b6 42.

ECF No. 57 at \u00b6\u00b6 145-46.

Mary's claim fails because she does not allege facts showing physical harm manifested by objective symptomology.

Finally, Mary cannot show that she suffered an adverse action as there is no standing to challenge the charge against Mr. Morton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441525\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/794/465/#p468\">\n    794 A.2d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the \"decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file...generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor's] discretion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   IV.
