Answering the door in her pajamas, she found several City of Allentown police officers seeking information about her son's whereabouts and requesting permission to search her home without a warrant. The plaintiff flatly refused and attempted to close her door and end the encounter. What happened next is disputed by the parties. The plaintiff argues that two officers proceeded to violently pull her from her doorway, throw her over a railing, handcuff her, and drag her to a police car. The defendants allege that the plaintiff violently slammed the door shut on an officer's hand, then punched him in the face, and was restrained using a reasonable amount of force. Regardless of what occurred, it is undisputed that the encounter ended with a warrantless entry into her home and in her arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff brought the instant civil action against the officers who entered her home and arrested her, the former chief of police, the former mayor of the City of Allentown, and the City of Allentown.

Both avenues to qualified immunity,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , no violation or, if a violation, it is excused because the Arresting Officers made a reasonable mistake of law or fact, hinge on disputed facts (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , whether the plaintiff punched Officer Madison, the degree to which the plaintiff resisted arrest, and the force applied during her arrest).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

As to her first argument, the plaintiff did not produce any record evidence of a conspiracy to violate her constitutional rights other than testifying that prior to entering her home, Officer Hendricks allegedly turned to Officer Madison and said, \"it's your call, Bud.\" Klein Dep. at 92. While the court finds this argument very weak, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the conversation's purpose, it is sufficient to survive summary judgment. Given the procedural posture, the court cannot hold, as a matter of law, that the conversation does not provide evidence of a civil conspiracy because to do so requires the court to credit disputed material facts, namely that the conversation never happened. According to the plaintiff, the two officers came to an agreement and then conducted a warrantless search of her home.

The court will (1) dismiss without prejudice the plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim based on fabrication of evidence because\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bars this claim and (2) grant summary judgment as to the plaintiff's claim for monetary damages under the Pennsylvania Constitution.
