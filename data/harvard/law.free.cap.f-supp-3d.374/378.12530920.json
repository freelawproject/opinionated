PAPPERT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After his wife Bernadette died intestate in 2010, Michael Bordoni became the sole owner of the couple's home at 1110 Moore Street in Philadelphia. For years following his wife's passing, Michael made his monthly mortgage payments. Eventually, after becoming frustrated with his inability to receive information and an explanation from Chase Home Finance regarding the terms of his indebtedness, Michael sued Chase in 2018 and asserted six claims under: the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA); the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA); the Declaratory Judgment Act; the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) and Pennsylvania state law for an accounting and restitution, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Chase filed a Motion to Dismiss Michael's Complaint for failure to state a claim. The Court grants in part and denies in part Chase's Motion for the reasons that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 30, 2004, the Bordonis purchased the property at 1110 Moore Street as tenants by the entireties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ( Compl. \u00b6 5 &amp; Ex. A., ECF No. 1.) Michael did not qualify for a mortgage, but Chase approved Bernadette's application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Bernadette subsequently signed a Truth-In-Lending Disclosure Statement which provided the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed and total payments for the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.) Although Michael alleges he never received a TILA packet, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14), he signed the mortgage and the Adjustable Rate Rider bears his initials, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13 &amp; Ex. D). Michael asserts that Chase sent monthly statements to and communicated with Bernadette only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The mortgage fell into arrears on January 1, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) Chase initiated a foreclosure action seven months later in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That December, Chase offered Bernadette a Forbearance Plan Agreement, which she accepted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) \"As a precondition for qualifying for the loan,\" Bernadette made a down payment of $ 9,000 and then tendered six monthly average payments of $ 1,292 from February through July of 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bernadette's payments pursuant to the Forbearance Plan Agreement did not bring the loan current.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). On July 2, 2009, Chase informed Bernadette that her adjustable interest rate was 6.5%, her monthly principal and interest payment was reduced to $ 1,612.64 and the outstanding balance on the mortgage was $ 240,714.78.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). The following month, Chase told Bernadette that in order to qualify for a Loan Modification, she had to enter into a trial program that required her to make payments from August through December of 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. I.) On January 2, 2010, Chase advised Bernadette that her adjustable interest rate was 5.75%, her monthly principal and interest payment was reduced to $ 1,502.54 and the outstanding balance on the mortgage was $ 238,036.91.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). A few weeks later, on January 18, Chase approved Bernadette for the Loan Modification, which allowed her to avoid foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) Now, Bernadette's fixed interest rate was 7.5%, her monthly payments were $ 2,138.36 and the term of the loan was an additional forty years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bernadette died intestate on June 16, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27 &amp; Ex. B). Since Chase purportedly had not included Michael in its communications regarding the Loan Modification, Michael \"sought an explanation\" from Chase on how Bernadette's payments had been applied to the mortgage's overall balance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28-31). Michael alleges that he tried to speak with Chase but it \"would speak only with an executor of [Bernadette's] estate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) Michael was afraid \"to defend another mortgage foreclosure action\" so he \"continued to make timely monthly payments on the mortgage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because \"Bernadette died without assets of her own [and Michael] did not wish to go [through] the unnecessary expense of raising an estate,\" Michael did not take out letters of administration on Bernadette's estate until July 23, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34 &amp; Ex. M.) On August 21, 2018, Chase provided Michael with the mortgage documents, which Michael alleges contain his fraudulently added signature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) Michael subsequently filed his Complaint on September 12, 2018. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Chase now moves to Dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim. ( Mot.
