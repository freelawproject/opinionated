FITZWATER, SENIOR JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 3, 2018 the United States Magistrate Judge entered her findings, conclusions, and recommendation (sometimes referred to as the \"FCR\"), in which she recommends that the court grant the government's motion for judgment on the pleadings and deny as moot defendant Tanya Lea Lyon's (\"Tanya's\") motion for partial summary judgment and defendant Midwestern Cattle Marketing, LLC's (\"MCM's\") motion for equitable distribution of foreclosure proceeds among all of Tony Lyon's victims. MCM and Tanya object to the FCR. After making an independent review of the pleadings, files, and records in this case, the magistrate judge's FCR, and MCM's and Tanya's objections, the court holds that the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the magistrate judge are correct in part. It is therefore ordered that the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the magistrate judge are adopted in part, and, to the extent the court disagrees with the magistrate judge's FCR, the pending motions are decided as set out in this memorandum opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 8, 2002 defendant Tony Eugene Lyon (\"Tony\") pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a bank, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201014\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On July 12, 2002 Judge Robinson, sitting in the Amarillo Division of this court, sentenced Tony to 37 months' imprisonment, and, under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\"MVRA\"), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , ordered him to pay restitution in the sum of $6,082,754.29 (\"First Restitution Order\") for disbursement to Bank of America, the victim of the offense. After the judgment was entered,\n   the government in 2002 and 2003 recorded liens in favor of the United States on all property belonging to Tony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   More than one decade later, on November 4, 2016, Tony pleaded guilty to wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On March 24, 2017 Judge McBryde, sitting in the Fort Worth Division of this court, sentenced Tony to a term of 120 months' imprisonment, and, under the MVRA, ordered him to pay restitution in the sum of $ 5,137,449.00 (\"Second Restitution Order\") for disbursement to MCM, the victim of the offense. After the judgment was entered, the government on March 30, 2017 recorded liens against Tony's property in the amount set forth in the Second Restitution Order, again in favor of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As of October 5, 2017 Tony's outstanding restitution balance under the First Restitution Order was $ 5,619,156.97, and he still owed the full amount of restitution under the Second Restitution Order. On October 26, 2017 the government filed a complaint to foreclose liens against Tony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   his then-wife Tanya,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   MCM, and Graham Savings Financial Corporation (\"GSFC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking court-ordered foreclosure of its criminal judgment restitution liens on five parcels of real property in which Tony has an interest. The government requests that the proceeds of each foreclosure sale be distributed in the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) costs, expenses, and fees incurred in the sale of each property; (2) ad valorem taxes due on each property; (3) lienholders with a first-in-time-and-right interest superior to the United States' criminal restitution judgment lien; and (4) the remainder to the Clerk of the Court for the Northern District of Texas in partial satisfaction of the restitution judgment debt in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tony Eugene Lyon\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:01-CR-079-J (N.D. Tex.)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Compl. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government later filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), or, alternatively, for summary judgment. MCM opposes the government's motion. It has also filed its own motion for equitable distribution of foreclosure proceeds among all of Tony's victims, requesting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the court distribute any and all proceeds from the foreclosure sale\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   among the victims named in the First and Second Restitution Orders. Tanya also opposes the government's motion and moves for partial summary judgment, seeking compensation for the foreclosure of her separate property interest in her homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   No objections have been filed with respect to the magistrate judge's findings, conclusions, and recommendation that the\n   government is entitled to partial judgment on the pleadings and partial summary judgment to foreclose on the five pieces of real property in which Tony has an interest. Nor have objections been filed with respect to the magistrate judge's recommendation that the government is entitled to judgment on the pleadings against Tony and is entitled to summary judgment against GSFC. Having reviewed the pertinent parts of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for plain error, and finding none, the court adopts these findings, conclusions, and recommendations to this extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court now considers together the government's motion for judgment on the pleadings and/or summary judgment against MCM and MCM's motion for equitable distribution of foreclosure proceeds among all of Tony's victims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government moves for judgment on the pleadings, or, alternatively, for summary judgment as to MCM, contending that courts have consistently held that the rule for priority of liens under federal law is that \"first in time is the first in right,\" Gov't Br. 11; that the government's judgment liens recorded on the First Restitution Order in 2002 have priority over MCM's subsequent abstracts of judgment filed in 2017; and that MCM's equitable argument seeking payment from this action is neither a legal defense nor an impediment to this court's entry of judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment of foreclosure of the federal criminal judgment liens in favor of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In opposition, and in its own motion, MCM maintains that it does not oppose the government's effort to foreclose on the government's liens against Tony and does not contend that MCM's lien filed in 2017 supersedes the government's preexisting lien filed in 2002. Instead, according to MCM, it \"seeks simply to participate in the proceeds of foreclosure as a criminal victim of [Tony] entitled to restitution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203612\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(j)(k) &amp; (o), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613A.\" MCM Resp. Br. 1-2. MCM posits that the government's lien is a lien in favor of the United States; that there is no law establishing or suggesting that the \"first in time\" rule applies to how the government dispenses restitution funds that it has already collected by foreclosing on a lien in favor of the United States; that these distributions are governed by provisions of the Criminal Code that specifically address restitution and that provide for equitable distribution to all of an offender's victims, regardless of the chronological order of their victimization, with consideration by the court of a variety of personal and economic factors; and that the equities in this case weigh in favor of a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distribution of the proceeds of foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Absent binding Fifth Circuit precedent or even persuasive authority that is\n   on point, the court must decide whether it has the authority to order a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distribution of the proceeds derived from the foreclosure of a criminal restitution judgment lien where a second-in-time restitution order has been entered for the benefit of a different victim of a different, subsequent crime committed by the same criminal defendant.

In other words, MCM maintains that this court should fashion an equitable plan for dividing restitution payments made under the First and Second Restitution Orders to the victims of both orders, and should not prefer the victim under the First Restitution Order (Bank of America) over the victim under the Second Restitution\n   Order (MCM). To support this argument, MCM first cites 18 U.S.C. 3612(c), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [t]he Attorney General shall be responsible for collection of an unpaid fine or restitution concerning which a certification has been issued as provided in subsection (b). An order of restitution, pursuant to section 3556, does not create any right of action against the United States by the person to whom restitution is ordered to be paid. Any money received from a defendant shall be disbursed so that each of the following obligations is paid in full in the following sequence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) A penalty assessment under section 3013 of title 18, United States Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) Restitution of all victims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) All other fines, penalties, costs, and other payments required under the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203612\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section \u00a7 3612(c) requires that \"all victims\" receive restitution before \"[a]ll other fines, penalties, costs, and other payments required under\n   <em>\n    the sentence.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203612\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The use of the definite article \"the\" in the term \"the sentence\" would not make sense had Congress intended the phrase \"all victims\" to include a victim of a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   crime for which the defendant had been separately sentenced. A more natural reading of the statute is that the phrase \"all victims\" refers to the victims of the crime or crimes for which the defendant was then being sentenced and who were entitled to restitution under that sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, as the magistrate judge correctly explained in the FCR:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MCM's argument severs the term \"victims\" from its proper statutory context.

MCM argues that because this provision is included in a section entitled \"procedure for issuance\n   <em>\n    and enforcement\n   </em>\n   of order of restitution,\" and because the statute is not specifically limited to \"more than one victim\n   <em>\n    in a single case\n   </em>\n   ,\" the court has the power to set equitable schedules for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   victims requiring restitution by a single defendant, \"with no requirement that the victims' names appear in the same case caption.\" MCM Br. at 10-11. The court again disagrees with MCM's reading of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As explained above, \u00a7 3664(i) is intended to apply only to victims in the same \"case.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

June 6, 2017) (holding that \u00a7 3664(i)\"cannot be used to prioritize the restitution order from one case over the restitution order from another case.\"). Moreover, although, as MCM argues, the statute\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   give the court the authority, under certain circumstances, to modify a defendant's payment schedule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 3664(i) clearly applies only to the issuance of the restitution order in the first instance.

In fact, the court's ability to modify a restitution order that has already been entered-which is essentially what MCM is seeking here-is extremely limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

MCM appears to agree with this proposition, but urges the court to distribute the foreclosure proceeds on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis to all of Tony's victims, rather than prioritize the first-in-time lien (i.e., the lien created by the First Restitution Order in favor of the United States for the benefit of Bank of America). MCM has failed to point to any statutory or other authority, however, that would permit this court to make the distribution that MCM requests. Accordingly, the court holds as a matter of law that the criminal debts that Tony owes under the First and Second Restitution Orders should be paid to the victims based on the \"first in time, first in right\" rule.

However, the Court has not been presented with any argument regarding whether [Tanya] is entitled to compensation for her standalone homestead rights in light of [ Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7] 3.202(c) and, if so, the appropriate methodology for calculating the value of her standalone homestead rights.
