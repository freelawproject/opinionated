BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 17, 2012, Aponte-Aponte and three other co-defendants were charged in a two count Indictment (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 31). Aponte-Aponte was charged in both counts (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 31). On February 8, 2015, Aponte-Aponte pled guilty to Count One (1) of the Indictment which charged that on or about November 30, 2012, in the District of Puerto Rico and elsewhere within the jurisdiction of this Court, defendant [4] Lenisse Aponte and three other co-defendants, aiding and abetting each other, with the intent to cause death and serious bodily harm, did knowingly, willfully and intentionally take a motor vehicle, that is, a Toyota Matrix, bearing license plate number FRT-734, that had been transported, shipped or received in interstate and foreign commerce, from the person of Jose E. Gomez-Saladin, by force, violence, and intimidation by sticking him on the head, and in perpetration of said offense caused his death, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2 and 2119(3) (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 347).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plea Agreement, filed on that same day, stipulated for a base offense level of forty-three (43) pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2B3.1, a two (2) level downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and a three (3) level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b) (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 347 at p. 3). The stipulated sentencing calculations placed Aponte-Aponte's adjusted offense level at 38, with a guideline imprisonment range of 235 to 293 months, assuming a Criminal History Category (CHC) of I; there was no stipulation as to the CHC (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   347 at p. 3). The Plea Agreement included a waiver of appeal providing that defendant would surrender her right to appeal the judgement and sentence if the Court accepted the Plea Agreement and sentenced her within the advisory guideline range of 235-293 months or a more lenient sentence (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 347 at p. 6). Aponte-Aponte did not object to the presentence investigation report (PSR) (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 388).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 2, 2015, Aponte-Aponte was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 293 months, followed by five (5) years of supervised release, and a special monetary assessment of $ 100.00 (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 388). Judgment was entered on that same day (Crim. No. 12-931 (DRD), D.E. 389). Aponte-Aponte did not file a direct appeal of her sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Crim.

On March 3, 2016, Respondent filed a Response in opposition to Petitioner's first Motion under Section 2255 (D.E. 3), and on March 26, 2016, Petitioner replied it (D.E. 4). On March 15, 2019, Respondent filed a Response to Petitioner's Amended Section 2255 Motion (D.E. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Then, when she states that she was not in agreement with the plan, she could have then said well, I'm not going to be any part of this. I'm going to step down. She had those important facts and those important decisions to be made when she knew definitely that, particularly the last time, this looked like a murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court also recognizes that this defendant had a very, very rough, traumatic childhood. She was beaten by her father-in-law, sexually abused, and raped. She also had a tough life with her companion who also beat her. She also was apparently beaten by persons from the street in at least, according to the memorandum, in at least seven times in the period of three years, which is corroborated by the record. She also suffers from a deficiency, a learning deficiency, which was explained. However, this conduct is not a license to murder somebody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   So, balancing all the factors, it is the judgment of this Court that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for a term of 293 months, which is the higher -- the highest end of the guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Crim.

G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn by force, violence intimidation and in the perpetration of said offense caused his death. Specifically, on November 29, 2012, Delgado-Ort\u00edz, Torres-Osorio, Berrios-Cotto, and Aponte-Aponte devised a scheme to rob a victim because Aponte-Aponte did not have enough money to pay her rent. As part of the scheme, Berrios-Cotto and Aponte-Aponte would lure a victim and then Delgado-Ort\u00edz and Torres-Osorio would approach the victim regarding a fictitious debt Aponte-Aponte owed Delgado-Ort\u00edz in the hopes --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    THE INTERPRETER\n   </strong>\n   : Please a little slower.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    MS.

A blue Toyota Matrix that was transported, shipped, or received in interstate and foreign commerce stopped nearby and ... Aponte-Aponte gave Delgado-Ort\u00edz and Torres-Osorio the signal to approach the car and execute the plan [that resulted in the murder of the victim by setting him on fire with gasoline doused on the victim. The four codefendants were present when the defendant Aponte-Aponte was burned and when they purchased more gasoline to burn the car where they had placed the victim]. Delgado-Ort\u00edz and Torres-Osorio entered the car and Delgado-Ort\u00edz told Aponte-Aponte she had to give him the money she owed him. Delgado-Ort\u00edz had pepper spray in his pocket and used it to simulate the presence of a weapon. The driver, later identified as Jos\u00e9 E. G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn, eventually drove to an ATM machine where he, accompanied by Delgado-Ort\u00edz, withdrew $ 400 and gave it to Delgado-Ort\u00edz. The group later drove towards Savarona and discussed G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn's fate since he had seen their face and could identified them. Eventually the group went to a gas station and purchased gas. By this time Delgado-Ort\u00edz forced G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn to stop driving the car. Delgado-Ort\u00edz then drove the Toyota Matrix to an old abandoned prison in Guavate. There he parked the car and everyone got out Delgado-Ort\u00edz and Berrios-Cotto escorted G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn from the car and told him to kneel. They doused him with gasoline and lit him on fire. G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn began yelling and got up and started to run. He stripped off his pants before tripping on a mound of garbage that was at the scene. Delgado-Ort\u00edz and Berrios-Cotto followed G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn and began hitting him with sticks and tubing they found in the area. They beat G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn until he was barely breathing. The four co-defendants gathered the sticks and tubing used to beat G\u00f3mez-Salad\u00edn, placed them in the car and left the prison [at Guavate] [and] the [Toyota] Matrix. Delgado Ort\u00edz then drove to another gas station and they purchased more gasoline in order to burn the Toyota Matrix. They proceeded towards La Macanea Road. There they exited the car and Torres-Osorio poured gas over the seats and the dashboard.

Petitioner provides no further allegations nor arguments as to which statements from her co-defendants she is referring to and/or how these statements prejudiced her. Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard is a generalized allegation that defense counsel failed to challenge the co-defendants' statements that were used in the PSR. There is no indication in the record that the inclusion of co-defendant statements in the PSR prejudiced Petitioner. However, the record does show that at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel stated that Aponte-Aponte had a minor role and that she was the least responsible; the Court agreed (D.E. 417 at p. 11). Consequently, Petitioner's unsupported allegation of deficiency in defense counsel's performance for not challenging co-defendants statements fails to show incompetence and prejudice. Hence, petitioner's request under\n   section 2255 does not comply with the standard of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As such, Petitioner's unsupported claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to challenge co-defendants' statements has no merit and the same is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    (5)\n    <em>\n     Counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal and/or an appeal of her conviction.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Petitioner Aponte-Aponte alleges that she received a very lengthy sentence and she requested her attorney \"that some type of appeal be filed because she believed that with her 'minimal' role in the offense she should have received less time for the charge (D.E. 1, D.E. 4, D.E. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   However, the facts that the defendant accepted as stated in the Government's version of facts at the Plea Agreement (D.E. 345), and the Change of Plea hearing (D.E. 416) reveal that the defendant, although is culpable does not warrant a \"minimal\" role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   First, the armed carjacking in the instant case was caused by lack of money of defendant Aponte-Aponte to pay her rent (D.E. 345, p.9). Second, the defendant Aponte-Aponte accompanied the other three codefendants to execute the plan of the carjacking. She further gave \"the signal to approach the car and execute the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Codefendants \"Delgado and Osorio entered the car\" and began the execution to carjack the victim from \"a blue Toyota Matrix.\" The victim was then taken to an ATM machine where the victim withdrew $ 400, and gave it to Delgado-Ortiz. (D.E. 345, p. 10). The \"group then went to a gas station and purchased more gas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . They then \"drove the [Toyota] Matrix to an old abandoned prison in Guavate,\" and \"parked the car, and everyone got out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Delgado-Ortiz and Berrios-Cotto escorted Gomez-Saladin [the victim] from the car and told him to kneel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"They doused him with gasoline and lit him on fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Gomez-Saladin began yelling and got up and started to run.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"He stripped off his pants before tripping on a mound of garbage that was at the scene.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Delgado-Ortiz and Berrios-Cotto followed Gomez-Saladin and began hitting him with sticks and tubing they found in the area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"they beat Gomez-Saladin until he was barely breathing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"The four co-defendants then gathered the sticks and tubing used to beat Gomez-Saladin, placed them in the car, and left the prison in the [Toyota] Matrix.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Delgado-Ortiz then drove to another gas station and they purchased more gasoline in order to burn the Toyota Matrix.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .... \"they then proceed towards La Macanea Road.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"There they exited the car and Torres-Osorio poured gas over the seats of the dashboard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"He then set the car on fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (D.E. 345, p.10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Hence, the motive of the carjacking was to acquire money for the defendant Aponte-Aponte. The record shows that all the codefendants went to the ATM and forced the victim to give them $ 400. They went together, and two of them lit the Toyota Matrix on fire over the victim. Two of the male codefendants hit the victim with sticks and tubes. As the victim tried to leave, \"the four codefendants then gathered the sticks and tubing they found in the area, ... and began hitting the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Finally, \"the four codefendants then left the scene on foot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"They also attempted to withdraw more money from Gomez-Saladin's bank account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Hence, defendant Aponte-Aponte's participation cannot be considered as a \"minimal role\" considering the above recited factual scenario and other considerations. First, the defendant Aponte-Aponte agreed in the plea to\n   a role adjustment of a \"minor\" participant, hence, \"no further adjustments or departures\" to the defendant, total offense level shall be sought by \"Ms. Aponte-Aponte.\" (D.E. 345, p.p. 3-4) ... further, \"the defendant agreed that she will not seek under any of the factors contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a sentence more lenient than the one detailed in the previous paragraph, as the same is a reasonable sentence.\" (D.E. 345, p.4). Most critical, the \"minimal role\" under the USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b) requires \"that a defendant must be plainly a peripheral player to justify his/her classification as a minimal participant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

What deprives Aponte-Aponte of her appellate claim is her failure to raise a cognizable issue as to this matter under section 2255. Petitioner has failed to set forth adequate facts or evidence to sustain her allegation that she requested her counsel to file a notice of appeal and her counsel ignored her request. Petitioner does not indicate if she followed up with counsel on this matter nor provided information as to how, and when, she learned that her appeal was never filed. In addition, Petitioner did not submit an affidavit or an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury, as provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   , to support her allegation that she told counsel to file an appeal. Because the record does not support Petitioner's alleged instruction to counsel to proceed with an appeal despite her waiver, the Court finds that Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a notice of appeal and/or appeal of her conviction is inadequate on its face and thus, the same is DENIED.
