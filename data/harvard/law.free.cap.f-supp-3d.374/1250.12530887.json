He also raises two other issues not directly related to the D.C. Circuit's mandate: First, he challenges his remaining conviction for conspiracy to commit war crimes. He asserts that the vacatur of the two other charges casts doubt on the legality of the remaining charge, which survived the D.C. Circuit's scrutiny only because that court found that the appellant's\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   challenge had been forfeited. On remand, the appellant urges that our more generous scope of review allows us to perform a de novo review now, even though the D.C. Circuit has affirmed the conviction. The appellant's second new issue is a motion to dismiss his case altogether for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. He claims that his commission lacked jurisdiction because the Convening Authority's appointment was statutorily and constitutionally improper, and that she was therefore without any authority to convene a military commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The government argues that we may reassess the appellant's sentence and that we should affirm the appellant's sentence to confinement for life. The government further argues that the appellant is not entitled to a de novo review of his remaining conviction, and that we should not now consider his newest challenge to the Convening Authority's appointment contending it is not jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Our task, then, is first to determine what arguments we may properly consider given the procedural posture of the case. We conclude that a de novo review of the appellant's remaining conviction is beyond the scope of our review on remand. We further conclude that we should consider the appellant's jurisdictional claim and his argument that his sentence is inappropriate to his remaining offense. We decide both of these issues in the government's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Scope of review on remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The D.C.

The two additional issues raised by the appellant-the request for a de novo review of the remaining conviction and the jurisdictional question-are not plainly within the scope of our review on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. De novo review of remaining conviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first ask if a de novo review of the appellant's remaining conviction is within the scope of our review. We approach this question with two closely-related concepts: the law-of-the-case doctrine and the mandate rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The \" 'law-of-the-case' doctrine refers to a family of rules embodying the general concept that a court involved in later phases of [litigation] should not reopen questions decided ... by that court or a higher one in earlier phases.\"\n   <em>\n    Crocker v.

Thus, the mandate rule places \"two major limitations\" on the scope of a remand: \"any issue that could have been but was not raised on appeal is waived and thus not remanded,\" and \"any issue conclusively decided by [the appellate court] is not remanded.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Since we are not so constrained, argues the appellant, we should conduct a de novo review of this conviction before determining whether we should affirm his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The appellant's assertion that the scope of our review is more generous than the D.C.

The CAAF held that the lower court did not err by refusing to consider supplemental assignments of error beyond the scope of the remand order: \"While appellant is entitled to plenary review under Article 66, Uniform Code of Military Justice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20866\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , he is only entitled to one such review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20866\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20866\">\n    at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   are instructive.

He challenges her appointment on statutory and constitutional grounds, and further argues that Ms. Crawford's defective appointment deprived his commission of subject-matter jurisdiction in his case. In response, the government first argues that even if Ms. Crawford's appointment was infirm, this would not create a jurisdictional issue. Second, the government argues that even if the challenge to Ms. Crawford's appointment did amount to a challenge to the jurisdiction of his commission, we may not now entertain this allegation of error on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We find that jurisdictional challenges are within the scope of our review and that the appellant's challenge to Ms. Crawford's appointment does in fact constitute a challenge to the commission's subject-matter jurisdiction for reasons we explain below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As discussed above, the law-of-the-case doctrine and mandate rule generally prevent a lower court from going beyond the scope of the mandate or addressing issues on remand not previously raised during the initial appeal.

First he argues that pursuant to the Appointments Clause, the convening authority is a principal officer that must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Alternatively, he argues that 2006 MCA \u00a7 948h requires that the convening authority for military commissions be either \"the Secretary of Defense or any officer or official of the United States designated by the Secretary of Defense\" and that Ms. Crawford was neither an \"officer\" nor an \"official\" when she was appointed by the Secretary.

First, our responsibility in 2009 MCA \u00a7 950f(d) to \"affirm only ... the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as the Court finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved\" is nearly identical to the service courts of criminal appeals' task under Article 66(c), UCMJ. Second, 2009 MCA \u00a7 950a mirrors Article 59, UCMJ, and therefore our ability to reassess a sentence necessarily includes the requirement that any reassessed sentence \"is no greater than that which would have been imposed if the prejudicial error had not been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Sales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537114\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/22/305/\">\n    22 M.J. at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find that we may properly reassess the appellant's sentence if we are able to \"reliably determine\" that, absent the convictions for solicitation of others to commit war crimes and providing material support to terrorism, the \"sentence would have been at least of a certain magnitude.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winckelmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279287\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/73/11/\">\n    73 M.J. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under all the circumstances presented, we find that we can reassess the appellant's sentence, and it is appropriate for us to do so. Although sentencing by the military judge alone was not an option under the 2006 MCA, the other factors favor reassessment by this Court. First, the penalty landscape has not dramatically changed. Although two of the three offenses for which the appellant was convicted have been vacated, the maximum punishment for the appellant's remaining conviction remains confinement for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, and most importantly, the remaining offense-conspiracy to commit war crimes-captures the gravamen of the criminal conduct at issue. Specifically, the members found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant entered into an agreement to, among other things, murder protected persons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In furtherance of the conspiracy, the members concluded that the appellant committed several overt acts, including: traveling to Afghanistan with the purpose of joining al Qaeda; undergoing military training at an al Qaeda sponsored training camp; pledging fealty to al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden; preparing various propaganda videos to solicit support for al Qaeda and to indoctrinate al Qaeda personnel; acting as personal secretary and media secretary to Usama bin Laden; arranging for two of the 9/11 hijackers to pledge fealty to Usama bin Laden; preparing propaganda declarations or \"Martyr Wills\" for the two 9/11 hijackers; and researching the economic effects of the 9/11 attacks.\n   <em>\n    Bahlul I\n   </em>\n   , 820 F.Supp.2d at 1222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   These overt acts in support of the conspiracy charge were the same overt acts the members found in support of Charge III (providing material support to terrorism). Moreover, in Charge II (solicitation) the members found that Al Bahlul urged others to commit the same crimes he conspired to commit in Charge I. Thus, any evidence presented to establish Charges II and III was also admissible to establish Charge I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, although the appellant's conviction for conspiracy\n   <em>\n    to commit war crimes\n   </em>\n   remains the only such conviction of its kind reviewed by our Court, we recognize, as we stated above, that \"one of the conspiracy's object offenses was the murder of protected persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Bahlul II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110804,4203228\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1/\">\n    767 F.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conspiracy to commit murder is not so novel a crime that we are unable to \"reliably determine what sentence would have been imposed at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Winckelmann,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279287\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/73/11/\">\n    73 M.J. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Taking these facts as a whole, as well as the entire record of the appellant's trial, we are confident that, absent the error, the members would have sentenced the appellant to confinement for life. We also find that sentence to be an appropriate punishment for the sole remaining conviction and this offender-thus satisfying the requirement for a reassessed sentence to be both purged of error and appropriate for the offense involved.\n   <em>\n    Sales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537114\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mj/22/305/\">\n    22 M.J. at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion that confinement for life is an appropriate sentence for this offender and his offense, we have considered-and rejected-the appellant's renewed claims that a sentence to life in prison is inappropriately severe. As we noted in our original review of the appellant's conviction, \"[t]he nature and seriousness\" of the conspiracy offense is manifest\n   in the charge itself.\n   <em>\n    Bahlul I\n   </em>\n   , 820 F.Supp.2d at 1260. The objects of the conspiracy charge included committing murder and attacking civilians. Undeniably, the appellant's overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy made valuable contributions to the conspiracy and to al Qaeda. As a result, in fulfilling our \"judicial function of assuring that justice is done and that the [appellant] gets the punishment he deserves,\" we affirm a sentence of confinement for life.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
