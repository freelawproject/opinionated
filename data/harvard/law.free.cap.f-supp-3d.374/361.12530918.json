Fleetwood (collectively, Plaintiffs), on their own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated, bring claims for violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and Texas law against Defendants Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc. (CBSG), Prime Time Funding, LLC (PTF), and unnamed John and Jane Does (the Investor Defendants). Plaintiffs assert the Defendants worked together to exploit cash-strapped small businesses by luring them into endless cycles of usurious debt under the guise of false promises of consulting services and debt reduction. CBSG and PTF each moved to dismiss the claims against them. For the reasons explained below, the Court denied their motions to dismiss in its order of March 29, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robert and Pamela Fleetwood are the owners of Fleetwood Services, a Texas\n   limited liability company, which provides golf course construction, development, renovation, and remodeling services. CBSG is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PTF is a Pennsylvania entity also headquartered in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CBSG and PTF are engaged in the merchant cash advance industry, which is the merchant-to-merchant equivalent of consumer pay-day lending-an industry allegedly notorious for its predatory practices and extremely high interest rates. PTF and CBSG, along with the unidentified Investor Defendants, work together to fund, originate, underwrite, and service loans, which, like their consumer analogs, feature exorbitant annualized interest rates. Defendants have been engaged in this business-mostly through their online presence-since at least 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2016 or early 2017, Fleetwood Services experienced a cash shortage, but was ineligible for conventional financing. As a result, it entered into several merchant cash advance agreements, which ultimately encumbered the business with an obligation to make daily payments of $ 6,667.00 to its lenders. In January 2017, Fleetwood Services was approached by PTF and CBSG, who, through various email exchanges, offered to provide it with financial consulting and a debt consolidation program that would \"provide capital for paying off existing debt as well as capital with which to grow the business.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. More specifically, PTF and CBSG claimed their assistance would reduce Fleetwood Services's daily payments by $ 1,666.75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants' promises, according to the Amended Complaint, were lies manufactured to conceal the true purpose behind CBSG and PTF's offer, which was to \"worsen [ ] Fleetwood Services's cash flow and thereby increase its dependence on further loans exclusively from [ ] CBSG.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 41. And, this is exactly what is alleged to have happened to Fleetwood Services. After the funds provided at the beginning of the relationship were exhausted, Fleetwood Services was left \"paying thousands of dollars more to [ ] CBSG than it had been paying prior to the debt consolidation program.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 40. Moreover, at around the time Fleetwood Services experienced cash flow issues created by its obligation to Defendants, CBSG offered Fleetwood Services the \"opportunity\" to restructure its agreement with CBSG by spreading the amount owed over a larger number of smaller payments. As part of this supposed accommodation, CBSG charged Fleetwood Services $ 11,000 in \"Finance Charges,\" which were not provided for in the parties' agreement. Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. Ultimately, Fleetwood Services escaped its relationship with Defendants on July 5, 2017, after receiving a traditional small business loan that it used to repay Defendants in full, including what Plaintiffs' characterize as an undisclosed annualized percentage rate of interest at 114.07%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The relationship between Plaintiffs and CBSG was governed by the terms of the \"Factoring Agreement,\" which was executed on or about January 4, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBSG Mot. to Dismiss Ex. A at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Factoring Agreement obligated CBSG to provide Fleetwood Services with $ 370,000 (the Purchase Price) allegedly in exchange for $ 547,000 worth of Fleetwood Services accounts receivables (the Receipts Purchased Amount).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. However, allegedly unlike a traditional factoring agreement, the fair market value of the accounts receivable (i.e., the Receipts Purchased Amount) was unilaterally dictated by CBSG and based upon the creditworthiness of\n   <em>\n    Fleetwood Services\n   </em>\n   -not the creditworthiness of the customers who were to pay the accounts receivable or any appraisal of the actual value of Fleetwood Services' accounts receivable. Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. The Factoring Agreement obligated Fleetwood Services to repay the Receipts Purchased Amount in 110 daily installments of $ 5,000.25, which were effectuated by electronic automated clearing house debits from Fleetwood Services's Texas-based bank accounts. These daily payments were, like the Receipts Purchased Amount, also divorced from Fleetwood Services's actual accounts receivable because the Factoring Agreement made \"any and all receivables from any customer in any amount based on any sale subject to Defendant CBSG for payment of the daily fixed debit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Factoring Agreement contained several other terms material to the instant motions. These additional terms include: (1) a declaration the money provided by CBSG to Fleetwood Services \"is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed as a loan;\"; (2) CBSG's promise to refund Fleetwood Services any amount greater than the maximum lawful interest rate, in the event \"a court determines that [CBSG] has charged or received interest\" under the Agreement; and (3) a Pennsylvania choice of law provision. CBSG Mot. to Dismiss Ex. A at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Along with the\n   Factoring Agreement, the Defendants also required Fleetwood Services to ensure repayment by granting CBSG security interests in \"all accounts, chattel paper, documents, equipment, general intangibles, instruments and inventory ... now or hereafter owned or acquired by [Fleetwood Services] and (b) all proceeds, as that term is defined in Article 9 of the UCC,\" and obligating Pamela and Robert Fleetwood to personally guarantee Fleetwood Services paid CBSG the Receipts Purchased Amount ($ 547,000). CBSG Mot. to Dismiss Ex. A at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the forgoing, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint asserting claims for breach of Texas Business &amp; Commercial Code \u00a7 17.44(a) (Count I); the Texas Usury Statute (Count II); common law fraud (Count III); RICO (Count IV); common law civil conspiracy (Count VI); and common law negligent misrepresentation (Count VII). In addition, the Amended Complaint seeks specific performance of paragraph 1.10 of the Factoring Agreement (Count V). CBSG and PTF moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on February 16, 2018, and March 27, 2018, respectively. Although Defendants seek to dismiss Counts IV, V, and VII specifically, they claim the Factoring Agreements were not usurious loans under governing Pennsylvania law, an argument which, if credited, all parties agreed would require the dismissal of all but a few of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held oral argument on the motions on November 2, 2018, and on March 29, 2019, it issued an order granting CBSG's motion as to Count V and denying it in all other respects. This order also denied PTF's motion to dismiss in its entirety. The Court writes now to supplement the order with the basis for its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counts IV, V, and VII allege violations of RICO, seek specific performance, and allege negligent misrepresentation, respectively. The Defendants move to dismiss these counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

If the Factoring Agreement is in substance a factoring agreement, i.e., a purchase of accounts receivable below their face value, then there can be no usury-and thus the Amended Complaint must be dismissed to the extent it relies on illegality of the alleged interest rates charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Equip.

If the Factoring Agreement functions as a loan, however, the Court must (1) determine whether it is subject to the usury laws of Pennsylvania or Texas, as the Agreement calls for the application of Pennsylvania law but the Plaintiffs assert Texas law applies, and (2) assess the merits of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the obvious significance of the issue, neither CBSG nor PTF offer any substantive defense of the Factoring Agreement as a true factoring agreement. CBSG claims-without legal citation or explanation-the transaction between it and Fleetwood Services is subject to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs secured transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBSG Mot. to Dismiss 2. PTF makes no argument at all. As a result of Defendants' failure to effectively address this issue, the Court assumes-without deciding and only for purposes of the instant motions to dismiss-the Factoring Agreement was a loan. The Court's assumption is undergirded by the allegations in the Amended Complaint and a review of the Factoring Agreement as a whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.

The parties agree if the Court concludes Pennsylvania law applies to claims arising from the Factoring Agreement, all but a few of Plaintiffs' causes of action must be dismissed (i.e., those that rely on a finding the Factoring Agreement constituted a loan with usurious interest under Texas law).

Kaneff opposed the motion to compel on unconscionability grounds. In deciding the arbitrability of Kaneff's challenge to the title loan, the Court considered whether it must apply the law of Pennsylvania-which prohibits usurious loans to consumers-or the law of Delaware-which does not prohibit usurious loans, but was the state law selected in the contract's choice of law provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Third Circuit found Pennsylvania had a more significant interest than Delaware because the plaintiff lived in Pennsylvania, the collateral was located in Pennsylvania, and, that if Kaneff's car were repossessed and she lost her job as a result, Pennsylvania would have to pay her unemployment and medical benefits, and lose the taxes generated from her income.

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have averred sufficient facts-which the Court must accept as true-to establish Texas's materially greater interest in this dispute. As Plaintiffs aver, Fleetwood Services is a Texas limited liability company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and Robert and Pamela Fleetwood are individuals residing in Dallas, Texas. Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Furthermore, the commercial and personal property- including Robert and Pamela's home and personal assets-securing repayment is located in Texas. Amend. Compl. \u00b6 43. Plaintiffs also allege\n   Defendants' \"conduct in inducing Plaintiffs to enter into the [Factoring Agreement] involved a series of consumer and commerce related transactions that substantially occurred within the state of Texas.\" Amend. Compl. \u00b6 61. In light of these circumstances (and Defendants' failure to explain how or why the Court should disregard them, or consider other factors weighing in favor of Pennsylvania's relationship to the transaction at issue), the Court finds Texas has a more significant relationship to the transaction than Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court also finds applying Pennsylvania law would violate a fundamental public policy of Texas, namely its \"antipathy\" to high interest rates, regardless of the nature of the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Kaneff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681681\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/616/#p621\">\n    587 F.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Plaintiffs point out, the Texas constitution prohibits usury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to CBSG Mot. at 10 (citing Texas Const., Art. XVI \u00a7 11 ). Moreover, the Texas Financial Code sets a specific maximum interest rate for lending for \"a business, commercial, investment, or other similar purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Fin. Code \u00a7 303.009(c). The Texas Financial Code also permits private causes of action for usury in commercial transactions. Texas Fin.

This statutory framework makes clear the existence of Texas's fundamental public policy against the payment of excessive interest rates-no matter the character of the debtor. As a result, enforcing Pennsylvania law-which affirmatively\n   <em>\n    prohibits\n   </em>\n   several types of business entities from claiming a usury defense-would violate Texas's policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 Pa.

The Amended Complaint describes the \"Lending Enterprise\" as a group of John and Jane Doe individuals and two corporate entities associated with one-another which that engaged in unlawful activity, including in a course of conduct (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , mail and wire fraud, and the\n   collection of unlawful debts-both of which are discussed below) for a common purpose (to make money). This \"Lending Enterprise\" also featured included an informal, on-going organization which operated as a unit to provide both legal credit services and the allegedly usurious loans. It is thus sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Turkette\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the extent Defendants challenge the third\n   <em>\n    Turkette\n   </em>\n   element-the alleged enterprise's existence separate and apart from the business entities-the Court is satisfied Plaintiffs have met this requirement. The Amended Complaint alleges Defendants have done more than carry on the normal affairs of actors in the legal credit market. Rather, the Amended Complaint explains how they each worked together in this scheme to originate, underwrite, and service loans with illegal interest rates. Each player in the enterprise had a different role, but the alleged enterprise was greater-and distinct from-its component parts (at least some of which were likely legitimate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court is also satisfied that the Amended Complaint meets the\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   requirements. The Amended Complaint \"plausibly impl[ies]\" the purpose of the enterprise was to make money by means of luring small businesses into otherwise unenforceable loans or collecting unlawful debts, there were relationships between each of the members (the John and Jane Does provided the capital, PTF brokered the loans, and CBSG serviced them), and sufficient longevity (from at least 2015) to accomplish that purpose.\n   <em>\n    Brokerage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775339\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/300/#p362\">\n    618 F.3d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Amended Complaint is also sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CBSG also challenges Plaintiffs' ability to plead the existence of an enterprise because companies engaged in the \"provision of routine credit services,\" like CBSG, are beyond the scope of RICO liability.

An enterprise violates RICO not only by conducting its affairs through a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" but also by engaging in the \"collection of unlawful debt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). An \"unlawful debt\" is defined as a debt \"(A) incurred or contracted ... which is unenforceable under State or Federal law in whole or in part as to principal or interest because of the laws relating to usury, and (B) ... which was incurred in connection with ... the business of lending money ... at a rate usurious under State or Federal law, where the usurious rate is at least twice the enforceable rate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs' allegation the payments Fleetwood Services made amounted to \"collection of unlawful debt\" and the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges a RICO violation based on this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Defendants also move to dismiss on the grounds Plaintiffs lack standing to prosecute their RICO claim.

As a result, the Court finds Plaintiffs have alleged a cognizable loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court also finds Plaintiffs' alleged damages-the usurious payments and lost profits- were proximately caused by Defendants' RICO violations-Defendants' pattern of racketeering activity\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   collection of unlawful debts.

Accordingly, the Court need not analyze them in any great depth, other than to say the usurious payments and lost profits appear to stem directly from Defendants' alleged violations of both aspects of \u00a7 1962(c), the Court perceives no potential difficulty apportioning damages (at least at this stage), and there does not appear to be a more directly injured party.\n   <em>\n    Knopick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021265\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/121/444/#p460\">\n    121 F.Supp.3d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Court finds the Amended Complaint alleges sufficient proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges an association-in-fact enterprise, RICO violations, and damages sufficient to establish Plaintiffs' standing to bring their claim. The Court will, therefore, deny Defendants' motions to dismiss as they pertain to Plaintiffs' RICO claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having addressed the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' RICO claim, the Court turns to the claims for specific performance (Count V) and negligent misrepresentation (Count VII). CBSG moves to dismiss Count V of the Amended Complaint, which is entitled \"Contract,\" and seeks recovery based on Paragraph 1.10 of the Factoring Agreement. The Court will dismiss Count V, but not for the reasons advanced by CBSG. Count V is properly construed as a claim for specific performance of Paragraph 1.10. However, Texas law\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not recognize a cause of action for specific performance independent of a claim for breach of the underlying contract, and Plaintiffs have not alleged CBSG breached Paragraph 1.10 by retaining the difference between what it was paid in interest and the legal maximum rate of interest after a court characterized the Factoring Agreement as a loan.\n   <em>\n    Stafford v. S. Vanity Magazine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8979886\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/231/530/#p535\">\n    231 S.W.3d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (Tex.

Thus, this stand-alone claim for specific performance shall be dismissed without prejudice to reassertion as a measure of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Defendants' motions challenge Plaintiffs' claim for negligent misrepresentation (Count VII), arguing that the Amended Complaint is too vague. CBSG offers no legal citation in support of its argument, and PTF only gestures towards\n   Rule 9(b) without explaining how or why that rule would apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBSG Mot. to Dismiss 15; PTF Mot. to Dismiss 8.
