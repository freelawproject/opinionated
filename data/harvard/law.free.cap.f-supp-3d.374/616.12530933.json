E.M., through his best next friend and mother Monica Guerra (\"Ms. Guerra\") (collectively \"Plaintiff\"), timely filed \"[Plaintiff's] Response to San Benito Independent Consolidated School District's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (\"Plaintiff's Response\") (Docket No. 11). Defendant timely filed its \"Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted\" (\"Defendant's Reply\") (Docket No. 18). For the reasons below, Defendant's MTD is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the relevant time, E.M. attended Miller Jordan Middle School (\"Middle School\") in San Benito, Texas-a school within Defendant's school district. E.M. is a child with several disabilities, including chronic asthma, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\"), skeletal muscular nerve syndrome, developmental delays, and speech impediments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about December 2, 2014, a classmate began to bully E.M. during world history class-calling him names and threatening physical violence. E.M. reported the bullying to these individuals: teacher Ms. Brenneke, school counselor Ms. Lanoy (\"Counselor Lanoy\"), and Principal Mary Leal (\"Principal Leal\"). On or about December 3, 2014, Ms. Guerra delivered letters to all three of the above individuals over her concerns about her son's situation. Defendant did not respond to her letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the 2015-2016 school year, students in E.M.'s social studies class repeatedly called him names, damaged his property, and mocked his speech impediment. On or about October 27, 2015, Ms. Guerra delivered a second round of letters to Principal Bobbie Jo Hushen (\"Principal Hushen\"), Assistant Principal Rosie Garcia (\"Assistant Principal Garcia\"), and Counselor Lanoy about the harassment inflicted upon E.M. during social studies class. Ms. Guerra alleged the other students were targeting E.M. because of his speech impediment. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's second round of letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around the same time, a group of sixth-grade students in a physical education class (\"P.E.\") supervised by Lamar Lewis (\"Coach Lewis\") began harassing E.M.-calling him names and repeatedly making fun of him for his physical and speech-related impediments. This harassment caused E.M. to fear changing clothes in the locker room. On or about December 9, 2015, Ms. Guerra delivered a third round of letters detailing her concerns about the harassment. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's third round of letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about February 25, 2016, a classmate intentionally tripped E.M. during P.E. (\"February 2016 incident\"). A different child then jumped and landed on E.M., slamming E.M.'s face against the floor and breaking E.M.'s front teeth. E.M. was sent to the school nurse, who called Ms. Guerra. Upon Ms. Guerra's arrival at school, Coach Lewis misrepresented that E.M. had chipped his front teeth playing basketball. Ms. Guerra requested to see the video of the incident, but Principal Hushen refused. That evening, Assistant Principal Garcia informed Ms. Guerra she had taken a statement from E.M. without the authorization or presence of Ms. Guerra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about February 29, 2016, Ms. Guerra contacted Ruben Franco (\"Mr. Franco\"), Defendant's Director of Student and Administrative Services, and again requested to see video of the February 2016\n   incident. Mr. Franco refused Ms. Guerra's request because Principal Hushen briefed him on the incident and Mr. Franco believed Principal Hushen's version of events. Ms. Guerra then requested information about how to file a complaint, but Mr. Franco refused to give her said information. Following their meeting, Ms. Guerra repeatedly tried to contact Mr. Franco, but Mr. Franco never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about March 2, 2016, Ms. Guerra delivered a fourth round of letters to Principal Hushen, Assistant Principal Garcia, Counselor Lanoy, and Coach Lewis expressing her frustration with the following: (i) not being allowed to view the video of the February 2016 incident, and (ii) Defendant's failure to address the bullying and harassment against E.M. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's fourth round of letters. Ms. Guerra later discovered Principal Hushen falsely represented to the school district's police department that Ms. Guerra no longer wished to pursue an investigation into the February 2016 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about March 11, 2016, the same group of sixth-grade students who bullied E.M. during P.E. supervised by Coach Lewis approached E.M. while he was playing cards. The students tore up E.M.'s cards and homework. On or about March 21, 2016, Ms. Guerra delivered a fifth round of letters, this time requesting that Defendant place E.M. in a different P.E. class. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's fifth round of letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Other students continued to bully E.M. for the rest of the 2015-2016 school year and throughout the 2016-2017 school year. In February 2017, Ms. Guerra delivered a sixth letter to \"Principal Perez\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   about a specific group of students consistently bullying E.M. and his brother. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's sixth round of letters. This group of students made threats of violence against E.M. and his brother, causing both boys to fear attending school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2017, a classmate in E.M.'s eighth period class began to harass E.M.-making fun of his speech impediment and calling him names. Ms. Guerra delivered a seventh round of letters detailing her concerns. Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's seventh round of letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At some point, Defendant reported Ms. Guerra to the Social Security Administration to have E.M.'s Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") benefits discontinued. Defendant also dismissed E.M. from certain special education services and never provided a psychological assessment, school-based counseling services, payment for community-based counseling services, or social skills training for E.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result, Plaintiff began this action August 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
