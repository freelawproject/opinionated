(Redacted Compl. (\"Compl.\") (Dkt. 8-1) \u00b6 19.) Until August 30, 2007, Plaintiff lived in Brooklyn, New York, with her daughter Tricia, Tricia's two children (A.M. and R.R.), and Plaintiff's younger daughter Samantha. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, she and Tricia \"maintained an extremely close relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Tricia was Plaintiffs \"best friend and only source of emotional support.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, both women relied on each other \"to take care of their children\": Tricia would often look after Samantha, while Plaintiff would help take care of A.M. and R.R. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff states that A.M. and R.R. would call their grandmother \"mommy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.M. and R.R.'s father, Arlington Marshall (\"Arlington\"), allegedly did not take care of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 30, 2007, Tricia and A.M. visited Arlington's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) While there, Arlington and Tricia got into an argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As the argument intensified, Arlington locked himself, Tricia, and A.M. in the bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Arlington then shot Tricia twice in the head and then shot himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A.M. witnessed both shootings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When neighbors broke into the room and found Tricia and Arlington dead, A.M. was crying on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The police called Plaintiff and informed her that A.M. was at a police station in the Bronx. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Police officers picked Plaintiff up and brought her to the police station, where they informed her that Tricia had been killed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff brought A.M. home from the police station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since that date, Plaintiff has been A.M. and R.R.'s sole parental figure, and she has been their legal guardian since December 5, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of Tricia's murder, Plaintiff \"has experienced substantial mental pain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) She claims to suffer from chronic, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") as well as from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Petition for U-Visa Status\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 19, 2013, Plaintiff filed a petition for U nonimmigrant status (the \"Petition\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) U nonimmigrant status, otherwise referred to as a \"U visa,\" is a temporary legal status \"set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and provide assistance to investigations or prosecution of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Argueta Anariba v. Shanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125853\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/190/344/#p346\">\n    190 F.Supp.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The Petition stated that Plaintiff was qualified for a U visa as a \"victim of qualifying criminal activity\" that caused her \"substantial mental abuse,\" and that she had provided helpful information to law enforcement. (Compl. \u00b6 5.) The Petition included a U nonimmigrant status certification (\"Supplement B\") signed by the Immigration Services Coordinator for the New York City Administration for Children's Services certifying that Plaintiff was a victim and identifying two crimes for which Plaintiff had provided helpful information to law enforcement: child endangerment of A.M. and the murder of Tricia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) On May 12, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a supplemental response following a request for additional materials from USCIS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those additional materials included an affidavit from Plaintiff detailing her \"substantial mental suffering due to her daughter's murder and her role as A.M.'s sole provider of parental care\" and an affidavit signed by Jennifer H. McQuaid, a clinical psychologist, attesting to the emotional harm suffered by Plaintiff as a result of Tricia's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 18, 2014, the Director of the USCIS Vermont Service Center denied Plaintiff's Petition (the \"Denial Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The Denial Letter stated that Plaintiff could not be a direct victim of the qualifying criminal activity because she was not physically present at the time of Tricia's murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) USCIS re-mailed the Denial Letter to Plaintiff on June 10, 2015, after originally sending it to the wrong address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; July 10, 2015, Notice of Appeal (AR at 41).) Plaintiff filed an appeal from the Denial Letter with USCIS's Administrative Appeals Office (the \"AAO\") on July 10, 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) The AAO denied Plaintiff's appeal on October 10, 2016, \"for largely the same reasons that USCIS provided in the Denial Letter\" (the \"AAO Decision\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also stated that she did not qualify as an indirect victim of child endangerment because a legal guardian does not qualify as a parent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint with this court on July 5, 2017, seeking declaratory judgment and attorneys' fees and costs. (Compl.) The complaint alleges that the AAO Decision is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (the \"APA\") because it (1) \"reads a new requirement of physical presence into an agency's determination of direct and proximate harm\" and (2) \"failed to consider the evidentiary record in determining whether [Plaintiff] had been proximately harmed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) The complaint also challenges the conclusions that Plaintiff could not be an indirect victim of the qualifying crime because she was not A.M.'s legal guardian at the time of the crime and was not in a parent-child relationship with A.M. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Within two months of filing her complaint, Plaintiff sought leave to move for summary judgment; a month later, Defendants sought leave to move to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint or, in the alternative, cross-move for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 30, 2017 Letter (Dkt. 12); Oct. 12, 2017 Letter (Dkt. 15).) The court granted both sides leave to file their cross-motions and ordered a briefing schedule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 20, 2017 So-Ordered Briefing Schedule (Dkt. 17).) Following numerous extensions of time, the cross-motions were fully briefed on March 22, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mot.; Defs. Mem.; Pl. Mot.; Defs. Reply; Pl. Reply.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of her motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff argues that the AAO's decision was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA and that USCIS's interpretation of the U-visa regulations does not warrant deference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mot.) Defendants, on the other hand, argue that USCIS's interpretation is permissible and entitled to deference, and that USCIS's ultimate determination was correct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

This does not alter the court's analysis, however, because someone who has been directly and proximately harmed is not \"only indirectly\" harmed by the crime, whether present at the scene or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants also rely heavily on the preamble reference to a \"bystander\" as a potential victim, and point to the example given of a non-targeted individual as a victim-a pregnant woman miscarrying after witnessing a violent crime. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem. at 15-16, 16 n.6.) It is true that this example involves both substantial physical injury and physical presence at the scene of the crime. The weight of such an example in a preamble, however, is insufficient to overcome the clearly established meaning of \"direct and proximate\" as laid out above. While the preamble to a regulation is persuasive evidence of a regulation's purpose, it is not part of the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254492\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/42/#p53\">\n    819 F.3d at 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (adopting the proposition that \"the preamble to a regulation is evidence of an agency's contemporaneous understanding of its proposed rules,\" but \"language in the preamble of a regulation is not controlling over the language itself\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wyo.

Defendants respond that he was actually physically present at the crime because he was present in the immediate aftermath. (Defs. Reply at 14.) This is not, however, how AAO characterized its ruling at the time: in the course of determining whether to presume the applicant had suffered emotional harm, AAO decided not to apply that presumption because \"he was not present during the commission of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    S-O-C-L\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206735245\">\n    2015 WL 6735245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4.

It is true that this decision has no precedential value; however, it does illustrate that USCIS can apply-and has applied-a more flexible approach to direct and proximate cause than the one it espouses here.\n   <em>\n    S-O-C-L\n   </em>\n   , in fact, demonstrates exactly the kind of inquiry mandated by the regulation: one where a lack of physical presence is considered as a factor weighing against a finding of direct and proximate harm, but where it is not dispositive. USCIS may be correct that, in the majority of situations, a non-targeted individual who is not present at the crime scene does not suffer direct and proximate harm as a result of the crime. But the regulation does not create a requirement of physical presence to be met in every case. Rather, it envisions a case-by-case analysis to determine whether, in this case, for this crime, the harm suffered by the applicant is a direct and proximate harm of the qualifying criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because \"an 'alternative reading is compelled by the regulation's plain language [and] by other indications of the [agency's] intent at the time of the regulation's promulgation,' \"\n   <em>\n    Thomas Jefferson Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39585\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/504/#p512\">\n    512 U.S. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39585\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/504/#p512\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gardebring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14012\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/415/#p430\">\n    485 U.S. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14012\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/415/#p430\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the court will not defer to USCIS's interpretation.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Mem. at 18; Defs. Reply at 8-9.) This is a stretch. While such a cap does indicate that Congress wanted to limit the number of direct victims receiving U visas in any given year, it provides no indication about whether Congress intended that direct victims must always be physically present at the crime scene. Without other, more direct, indicia of Congressional intent, such tenuous evidence is insufficient to overcome the plain meaning of the regulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Contrary to Defendants' assertions, this interpretation is consistent with the AG Guidelines. The current Guidelines state that \"emotional harm may be presumed in violent crime cases where the individual was actually present during a crime of violence.\" Attorney General's Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance at 9 (2012). However, the Guidelines go on to discuss situations where the individual was not present: \"In all other cases, emotional harm should not be presumed in the absence of physical or pecuniary harm, but rather the existence of cognizable or emotional harm should be determined on a factual, case-by-case basis.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324473,4071846\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1013/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This sentence makes no sense if, as Defendants argue, the Guidelines support a strict rule that a non-targeted individual may only be a direct victim when they were actually present at the commission of the crime. And as noted above, the 2005 version of the Guidelines merely stated that \"a person whose injuries stem only indirectly from an offense is not [a victim].\" Attorney General's Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance at 10 (2005). It does suggest that a bystander will generally only be considered a victim where they suffer \"an unusually direct injury\"; this does not foreclose the possibility, however, that someone who is not present may, on occasion, also suffer an unusually direct injury and thereby qualify as a victim.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324473,4071846\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1013/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That situation may be even more rare than for an individual who was physically present at a crime, but the AG Guidelines nonetheless provide no basis to disregard the long-standing meaning of \"direct and proximate\" as discussed above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    In its original denial letter, USCIS stated that Plaintiff was not an indirect victim of child endangerment because she was not a legal guardian at the time of the crime.
