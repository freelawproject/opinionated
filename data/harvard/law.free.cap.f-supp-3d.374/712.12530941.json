Wood, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In July 2006, Plaintiff Shelbourne North Water Street Corporation (\"Shelbourne\") set out to construct a towering residential skyscraper-informally called the Chicago Spire-that was intended to be an iconic part of the Chicago skyline. Its grand\n   plans were derailed when the world's financial markets crashed in 2008 and Shelbourne could no longer obtain funding for the project. Meanwhile, the Irish bank that had previously provided Shelbourne funding was facing insolvency. Ireland created Defendants National Asset Management Agency (\"NAMA\") and National Asset Loan Management (\"NALM,\" and together with NAMA, \"Defendants\") by statute for the purpose of taking defaulted real estate assets off the books of such failing Irish banks. Among the assets Defendants acquired were the loans that had funded the Chicago Spire. Eventually, Defendants sold the Spire loans for millions less than par value. Shelbourne contends that, at the time of sale, it had the contractual right and the ability to buy those loans at par. Shelbourne thus has brought the present lawsuit alleging that Defendants improperly prevented it from redeeming its loans. Defendants move to dismiss this case pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), 12(b)(3), and 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 24.) For the following reasons, Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shelbourne is a company associated with Garrett Kelleher, an Irish international real estate developer. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, Dkt. No. 68.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2006, Shelbourne began a project to build what was commonly referred to as the Chicago Spire, which it hoped would be the tallest residential building in the world. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 85, 88.) The Chicago Spire would be located in downtown Chicago near the shore of Lake Michigan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) By early 2008, the \"entire design, marketing, sales, foundation and substructure of the Spire was completed at a cost of $ 300 million.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115.) Funding for the initial portion of the project came in the form of a $ 225 million equity investment by Shelbourne and an approximately $ 90 million loan from the Ireland-based Anglo Irish Bank Corporation (\"Anglo\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) The Anglo loan was personally guaranteed by Kelleher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2008, due to the worldwide financial crisis, Anglo was unable to continue funding the Chicago Spire project and Shelbourne was not able to acquire an alternative funding source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118, 122.) With Shelbourne lacking liquidity to make up for the loss of outside funding, development of the Chicago Spire \"came to a grinding and painful halt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 127-29.) Around this time, in addition to the approximately $ 90 million owed for the Chicago Spire project, companies owned either directly or indirectly by Kelleher owed around $ 510 million of debt to Anglo, which Kelleher had personally guaranteed either entirely or in part. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.) Kelleher's companies also owed another $ 600 million to other Irish banks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) In total, Kelleher's companies owed approximately $ 1.2 billion to various Irish banks related to property development projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 132-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in the fall of 2008, Irish banks were facing the threat of insolvency as a result of the financial crisis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   30-31.) To rescue the banks, Ireland passed the National Asset Management Agency Act of 2009 (\"NAMA Act\" or \"Act\") on December 21, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The central aspect of the Act was the creation of NAMA, a state-funded entity created as a \"bad\n   bank\" that would acquire property-development loans from Irish banks in return for government-backed debt bonds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 134) NALM is a subsidiary of NAMA, and NAMA controlled NALM in all material respects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2010, a contractor who had previously filed a mechanic's lien on account of $ 500,000 owed to it in relation to work done on the Chicago Spire project commenced a foreclosure lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) Anglo responded by filing a defensive foreclosure action to assert its interest by virtue of its first mortgage on the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151.) One month later, Anglo and NAMA advised Kelleher that the $ 600 million in Anglo loans that Kelleher had personally guaranteed were being transferred from Anglo to NAMA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.) From that point on, Shelbourne and Kelleher dealt with NAMA with respect to the Chicago Spire debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During this time, Shelbourne worked with NAMA to figure out a way to resume development of the Chicago Spire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.) Yet NAMA rejected numerous Shelbourne proposals, including one under which NAMA would advance $ 10 million to Shelbourne so it could deal with lien litigation and other matters necessary to keep the project afloat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152-53.) In September 2011, NAMA and Shelbourne executed an Interim Support Agreement that required Shelbourne and Kelleher to provide NAMA with all the information necessary for NAMA to prepare an appraisal of the partially-developed Chicago Spire project, which would be used in the foreclosure proceeding and to oppose the claims of mechanic's lien holders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 168-70.) A virtual data room containing confidential information relating to the Chicago Spire project was set up to aid NAMA in preparing the appraisal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206.) In return for entering into the Interim Support Agreement, Kelleher would be released from all personal guarantees of the Chicago Spire loans and he would be afforded the opportunity to purchase the Chicago Spire site at a judicial auction for less than the full amount due on the loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yet at the time NAMA executed the Interim Support Agreement, according to Shelbourne, NAMA did not even own the loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188.) Rather, the loans were transferred to NALM on May 21, 2013, and the transfer documents show that the loans were transferred from Anglo-successor Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (\"IBRC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the NAMA Act, NAMA and its affiliates such as NALM were prohibited from selling any defaulted loan that they acquired to the defaulting borrower or any entity in which the defaulted borrower had any interest or affiliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197.) On the other hand, a bank such as IBRC faced no similar prohibition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198.) Thus, by representing itself as the owner of the Chicago Spire loans, NAMA deprived Shelbourne of the opportunity to propose to IBRC a \"Work Out\" of the loans whereby Shelbourne could make an offer to pay off the loans for less than the full amount of their principal, interest, and penalty interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 200, 202.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite Shelbourne's and Kelleher's compliance with the Interim Support Agreement, NAMA ultimately publicly offered the Chicago Spire loans for sale and sold them with Kelleher's personal guarantees still attached. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 205, 210.) Through a Chicago-based real estate firm, NAMA began marketing the loans on March 16, 2013, which was before the\n   loans had been transferred from IBRC to NALM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 204, 211, 234.) NAMA allowed potential bidders access to the virtual data room containing Shelbourne's confidential information regarding the Chicago Spire project so they could conduct due diligence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 206, 232-33.) In order to bid or even explore a bid on the loans, a potential bidder had to represent that it would not have any association, assistance, or communication with Kelleher, Shelbourne, or any of Shelbourne's affiliates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 233.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, Shelbourne found an investor who was willing to advance approximately $ 92 million to fund the redemption of the Chicago Spire loans at par, which would allow Shelbourne to regain control of the site and finish construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 237.) Irish taxpayers would not have lost money at all from the transactions, while Shelbourne would have gained $ 1.21 billion, representing $ 225 million of cash, $ 300 million of equity, and $ 685 million in profit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 239, 241.) To consummate the transaction, Shelbourne and its investor needed access to the data room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 245-46.) Yet they were both denied access because NAMA made access conditional on signing a non-disclosure agreement, which the investor refused to do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 260.) Moreover, IBRC\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was never informed of Shelbourne's offer to purchase the Chicago Spire loans at par. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 313.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July 2013, the Chicago Spire loans, which had just months before been transferred from IBRC to NALM, were sold by NALM to RMW Acquisition Company (\"RMW\") for about $ 35 million and with Kelleher's personal guarantees still attached. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 311.) That price was about $ 57 million less than what Shelbourne and its investor had been willing to pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 312.) Shelbourne contends that the sale of the loans to RMW breached a provision in the Chicago Spire note that allowed Shelbourne to redeem the note by paying the full outstanding principal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 321, 324.) Moreover, the sale also prevented Shelbourne from entering into a business relationship with the investor who sought to provide Shelbourne with the funds necessary to pay off the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 347.) Following the sale, RMW commenced litigation against Kelleher based on his personal guarantees that were not, but should have been, released in accordance with the Interim Support Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 316.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shelbourne filed the present lawsuit against Defendants seeking $ 1.21 billion in damages, based on the amounts it allegedly lost as a result of Defendants' conduct. The amended complaint sets forth claims for tortious interference with contract-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Chicago Spire note and mortgage-and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, both based on Defendants' actions to prevent Shelbourne from purchasing its defaulted Chicago Spire loans. The amended complaint also sets forth a claim against NAMA for breach of statutory and common law duties to preserve confidential information arising out of a criminal matter in Irish court concerning a former NAMA employee's leak of confidential information related to the Chicago Spire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 353-69.) Specifically, when Shelbourne sought to discover the nature of the leaked confidential information, NAMA refused to provide a copy or details of the leaked information in violation of its statutory and common law duties to take reasonable\n   care to preserve Shelbourne's confidences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 365-66.) Finally, Shelbourne brings a claim of negligent spoliation of evidence against NAMA based on NAMA's adoption of a policy calling for the destruction of all e-mails and other written communications of former employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 370-79.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue for dismissal under several subsections of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). One of the cited grounds for dismissal is lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Specifically, Defendants contend that because they are foreign states, they are immune from the jurisdiction of courts in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   This Court must be secure in its subject-matter jurisdiction before evaluating any other grounds for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh v.

Waiver Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first exception to sovereign immunity that Shelbourne invokes is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), which renders a foreign state not immune when it \"has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication.\" The waiver provision is read narrowly, and \"courts rarely find that a nation has waived its sovereign immunity ... without strong evidence that this is what the foreign state intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Frolova v. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29419\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/370/#p377\">\n    761 F.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (7th Cir. 1985). One way a foreign state may waive sovereign immunity is by agreeing \"that a contract is governed by the law of a particular country.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29419\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/370/#p377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Shelbourne contends there has been a waiver of immunity here because the terms of the National Asset Management Agency Act states that foreign law will govern foreign bank assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But Shelbourne reads too much into the language of the Act. The relevant provisions provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) To the extent that a bank asset proposed to be acquired by NAMA is or includes a foreign bank asset-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) if the law governing the transfer or assignment of the foreign bank asset permits the transfer or assignment of that asset, the participating institution shall if NAMA so directs do everything required by law to give effect to the acquisition,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (b) if the relevant foreign law does not permit the transfer or assignment of the foreign bank asset, the participating institution shall if NAMA so directs do all that the participating institution is permitted to do under that law to assign to NAMA the greatest interest possible in the foreign bank asset.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 81 (quoting Section 91 of the NAMA Act).) These provisions simply recognize that when a bank transfers a foreign bank asset to NAMA, the bank must abide by the law to which the bank agreed so as to effect a full transfer of the asset, or at least the greatest interest possible in the asset, to NAMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because NAMA acquires pre-existing assets from Irish banks, it had no role in agreeing to the law governing the transfer or assignment of those assets. The Court cannot conclude that NAMA's recognition that a bank must comply with the governing foreign law in transferring foreign bank assets to NAMA amounts to a clearly expressed intent to be subject to suit in United States courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sampson v.

Similarly, the fact that the mortgage and note underlying the Chicago Spire debt were expressly governed by Illinois law does not amount to a waiver when NAMA had no role in agreeing to the choice-of-law provisions in those documents. There is simply no basis for the Court to find that Defendants waived sovereign immunity by contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Commercial-Activity Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Shelbourne next argues that Defendants' commercial activities subject them to this Court's jurisdiction under the FSIA's commercial-activity exception to sovereign immunity.

Here, the two main claims before the Court are tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shelbourne alleges that Defendants tortiously interfered with the Chicago Spire note by not allowing Shelbourne to redeem the entire outstanding principal on the note, not informing it that IBRC was the legal owner of the note, and not informing IBRC of Shelbourne's offer to pay off the outstanding principal. Shelbourne further alleges that it had a reasonable expectation of entering into a business relationship with the investor offering to resolve the Chicago Spire debt, and Defendants tortiously interfered with that relationship by misrepresenting NAMA as the owner of the loan, refusing the investor access to the data room, and requiring as a condition of bidding on the loans that the successful bidder have no association with Shelbourne and Kelleher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Shelbourne identifies six sets of Defendants' commercial activities that occurred within the United States for purposes of the commercial-activity exception. Yet for two of those sets of activities, there is insufficient support showing that the activities occurred inside the United States. First, Shelbourne refers to Defendants' purported bad-faith negotiations with an entity called Point Capital. No allegations of such negotiations appear anywhere in the amended complaint, and instead are set forth in the Declaration of\n   Theodore Williams (Dkt. No. 58).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, nowhere in that declaration are there any facts establishing that NAMA or NALM ever met with Point Capital in this country. Indeed, according to the declaration, the only face-to-face interactions between NAMA and Point Capital occurred in Dublin. Thus, the Court disregards this contact. The Court also disregards as a relevant commercial activity NAMA's purported bad-faith negotiations with the investor who sought to redeem Shelbourne's Chicago Spire note. Once again, neither the amended complaint nor the supporting Declaration of Andy Ruhan (Dkt. No. 62) contain any allegations or evidence showing that the negotiations occurred in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition, Shelbourne alleges that Defendants engaged in a commercial activity within the United States by financing the stabilization of the Chicago Spire project and funding Shelbourne's payroll. The amended complaint does vaguely allude to a promise by NAMA to fund Shelbourne's day-to-day operations, but then alleges that NAMA threatened to withhold the payroll of Shelbourne's staff without ever alleging that the stand-off was resolved. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 180-84.) Given the lack of clarity of these allegations, the Court disregards them as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That leaves just three categories of commercial activities that Defendants conducted in the United States. First, Shelbourne cites the fact that Defendants retained Chicago counsel, negotiated the Interim Support Agreement, and created the virtual data room. Yet Shelbourne expressly states that these actions were in connection with the foreclosure proceeding. Actions in connection with that proceeding provide background for, but are not elements of, Shelbourne's claim for relief. Indeed, these actions occurred almost a year and a half prior to the allegedly tortious behavior. Therefore, the present action is not based upon this commercial activity. Shelbourne next alleges that a NAMA representative's single to visit to Chicago was a sufficient commercial activity. The visit was not referenced in the amended complaint but alluded to in the Declaration of Enda Farrell (Dkt. No. 57). However, Farrell supplied only very minimal details concerning the purpose of the visit. In particular, the declaration states that the representative asked how much it would cost to \"fill the hole\" and seems to suggest that the meeting occurred in late 2010. (Decl. of Farrell \u00b6 6.) Those facts suggest that the meeting occurred while Shelbourne was exploring how it could resume development of the Chicago Spire, which was well before Defendants began marketing the loans and Shelbourne and Kelleher made any offer to redeem the loans. Thus, the meeting was far removed from Defendants' conduct forming the basis of this action and is insufficient to deprive Defendants of their sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is a closer call on whether Defendants' appointment of a real estate firm to assist it in the sale of the Chicago Spire loans suffices. Certainly, the sale is a necessary element of the claim; without the sale there would be no tortious interference. However, the Supreme Court has made clear that the fact that a particular\n   commercial activity \"would establish a single element of a claim is insufficient to demonstrate that the claim is 'based upon' that [activity] for purposes of \u00a7 1605(a)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    OBB Personenverkehr AG v.

Here, it is not the sale itself that forms the gravamen of the tortious interference claims. Indeed, Defendants' sale would not have injured Shelbourne in a legally cognizable manner absent Shelbourne's offer. Rather, the suit arose by virtue of Defendants' misrepresentation concerning the rightful owner of the loans, its concealment of Shelbourne's offer to redeem the loans for the full amount owed to the rightful owner, and its acts in thwarting the investor from funding Shelbourne's offer to redeem the loans. The amended complaint does not allege that the real estate firm itself was involved in any of the purported interference. Thus, while the firm's activities in facilitating the sale \"led to the conduct that eventually injured\" Shelbourne,\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229496\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/349/#p359\">\n    507 U.S. at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229496\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/349/#p359\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , they were not the basis for the tortious interference claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although Shelbourne does not make any argument on the other two prongs of the commercial-activity exception, the Court has \"an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.\"\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p514\">\n    546 U.S. at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p514\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court will proceed to determine whether the other prongs of the commercial-activity exception are applicable here. The Court cannot identify from the amended complaint any acts performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity elsewhere that gave rise to the claim, so the second prong does not apply. There is, however, a conceivable argument that the third prong applies, as the tortious acts occurring in Ireland in connection with the loan sale may have had a direct effect in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The primary effect in the United States of Defendants' commercial activities in Ireland was that they caused injury to Shelbourne, a United States corporation. However, financial injury to an American corporation, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish a direct effect in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Med.

The alleged $ 1.21 billion injury Shelbourne suffered as a result of Defendants' conduct was based on Shelbourne's prediction that, had it been able to buy the loans, it would have completed construction of the Chicago Spire. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 237-41, 344.)

Shelbourne contends that Ireland waived the immunity of its statutory bodies-including NAMA and NALM-by entering into the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, September 14, 1950, United States-Ireland (\"Friendship Treaty\"). That treaty provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   No enterprise of either Party which is publicly owned or controlled shall, if it engages in commercial, manufacturing, processing, shipping or other business activities within the territories of the other Party, claim or enjoy, either for itself or its property, immunity therein from taxation, suit, execution of judgment or other liability to which privately owned and controlled enterprises are subject therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   1 U.S.T. 785, art. XV(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendants' contention that they are not an \"enterprise\" for purposes of the Friendship Treaty is baseless. As alleged, Defendants operated as a \"bad bank\" that bought defaulting real estate assets from failing Irish banks and sold them in their best effort to realize the greatest value possible. That is sufficient to constitute an enterprise. Nonetheless, the Friendship Treaty \"does not waive the right of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   agency or instrumentality of the Republic of Ireland to raise the sovereign immunity defense before the United States courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibbons v.

No. 70), and cites the same six (narrowed above to three) commercial activities, the Court could conclude that the treaty exception does not apply on that basis alone. However, the Court is not as confident as the parties that the waiver provision in the Friendship Treaty and the FSIA's commercial activity exception should be treated the same. The FSIA uses different language from the Friendship Treaty and provides statutory definitions\n   expanding on the terms \"commercial activity\" and \"commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign state.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court finds that three discrete transactions in assistance of the larger transaction conducted in Ireland from which the suit arises do not suffice for a waiver of immunity under the Friendship Treaty.

Ill. 1980) (emphasis added). Moreover, the treaty's use of \"activities,\" plural, is telling. Unlike the FSIA's commercial-activity exception, which can be based upon a single \"particular commercial transaction or act,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), the Friendship Treaty does not appear to anticipate that sovereign immunity will be waived by an enterprise engaging in an isolated transaction within the other country or even a few. Instead, \"activities\" is suggestive of a requirement more akin to the enterprise having continuous and systematic business contacts with the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Ultimately, because the Court finds that Ireland and the United States did not intend to waive immunity for their respective enterprises on the basis of a small number of commercial activities within the other country when the enterprise is not carrying on regular business in that country, it cannot conclude that the treaty exception applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss (Dkt.
