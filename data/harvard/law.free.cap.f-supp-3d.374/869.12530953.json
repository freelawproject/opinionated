(\"Conagra\") to dismiss plaintiff Mark Beasley's first amended class action complaint. Docket No. 30 (\"Mot.\"). The motion is scheduled for hearing on March 22, 2019. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without oral argument, and hereby VACATES the hearing. For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS defendant's motion to dismiss, with and without prejudice, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a proposed class action regarding the use and labeling of partially hydrogenated\n   oils (\"PHOs\") in Conagra's popcorn snack, Crunch 'n Munch. According to the first amended complaint, \"PHO was and is an unlawful and dangerous food additive due to its artificial trans fat content. Artificial trans fat is a toxic substance whose unlawful use contributed to hundreds of thousands of untimely deaths in the United States, primarily from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.\" Docket No. 22 (\"FAC\") \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"[d]uring much of the Class Period,\" which runs from January 1, 2010, through May 31, 2018, \"Crunch 'n Munch was made with PHO yet contained the deceptive and unlawful nutrient content claim '0g Trans Fat Per Serving' prominently displayed on the front of the box. This language was part of an intentional, long-term campaign to deceptively market Crunch 'n Munch as healthful and free of trans fat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66, 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff \"regularly purchased Crunch 'n Munch during the Class Period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.

He states that he \"relied on ConAgra's '0g Trans Fat' claim as a substantial factor in some of his purchases of Crunch 'n Munch\" and that he \"lost money when he purchased products that hurt his health and were unfairly sold [in] violation of federal and California law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 85. Plaintiff alleges that he \"suffered physical injury when he repeatedly consumed\" the trans fat-containing Crunch 'n Munch and also that \"on at least one occasion, [he] would not have purchased Crunch 'n Munch absent Defendant's 0g Trans Fat misrepresentation, and never would have purchased it had he known it was unlawful and dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 89.

For instance, the Ninth Circuit has found that the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act does not expressly preempt California state law that bans the sale of foie gras made by force-feeding birds, nor is the state statute preempted under field preemption or obstacle preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n des \u00c9leveurs de Canards et d'Oies du Qu\u00e9bec v.

As support, plaintiff selectively quotes from the Final Determination's response to comments requesting the FDA take a position regarding the effect of its order on state and local laws, but plaintiff omits key language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

Thus, if plaintiff purchased Crunch 'n Munch after it stopped containing PHO, plaintiff's claims would fail.

He cites the following allegations from the FAC: that \"[u]nless otherwise stated, references to Crunch 'n Munch only include Crunch 'n Munch during the period it contained PHO[;]\" that plaintiff \"regularly purchased Crunch 'n Munch during the Class Period[;]\" and that the \"Class\" is defined as \"All citizens of California who purchased in California, between January 1, 2010 and May 31,\n   2018, Crunch 'n Munch products containing partially hydrogenated oil.\" Opp'n at 21 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 60, 94).

For two reasons, more specific information is needed regarding when plaintiff purchased Crunch 'n Munch. First, as defendant notes, if plaintiff purchased Crunch 'n Munch after the time when it stopped containing PHOs, he would have no claim. The present allegations, that plaintiff purchased the product at some time during an 8.5 year window, is insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b), particularly where the complaint lacks allegations regarding when Crunch 'n Munch discontinued using PHOs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as will be discussed below, some or all of plaintiff's purchases may fall outside the statute of limitations. The Court therefore DISMISSES Claims Three through Six, with leave to amend.

Until that time, he lacked the knowledge regarding the facts of his claims against Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   92. Plaintiff is a reasonably diligent consumer who exercised reasonable diligence in his purchase, use, and consumption of Crunch 'n Munch. Nevertheless, he would not have been able to discover Defendant's deceptive practices and lacked the means to discover them given that, like nearly all consumers, he is not an expert on nutrition and does not typically read or have ready access to scholarly journals such as The Journal of Nutrition,[ ] The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,[ ] and The New England Journal of Medicine,[ ] where the scientific evidence of artificial trans fat's dangers has been published. Furthermore, ConAgra's labeling practices-in particular, falsely representing for many years that Crunch 'n Munch has \"0g Trans Fat\"-actively impeded Plaintiff's and Class members' abilities to discover these claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 (footnotes omitted). These allegations will not suffice to invoke the delayed discovery rule. Plaintiff alleges no facts regarding the manner in which he discovered that Crunch 'n Munch contained trans fat. Without this information, his statements that he could not have made his discovery sooner are nothing more than conclusory. If plaintiff wishes to continue to bring claims that fall outside the applicable statute of limitations by utilizing the delayed discovery rule, he must plead sufficient facts accordingly. Accordingly, in addition to the dismissal under Rule 9(b) discussed above, for the timeliness\n   reasons discussed herein, the Court DISMISSES Claims Three through Six, with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, defendant argues in a footnote that plaintiff's CLRA claim fails because plaintiff failed to file the requisite declaration of venue under California Civil Code section 1780(d) and because plaintiff \"failed to file and provide sufficient statutory notice before filing his original complaint.\" Mot. at 23 n.13. Defendant's motion regarding notice is DENIED. Plaintiff's original complaint did not state a claim under the CLRA, so he was not required to provide notice under California Civil Code section 1782 before filing that complaint. As to the declaration of venue, other judges in this district have dismissed without prejudice CLRA claims where the plaintiff has failed to file the requisite declaration under Civil Code section 1780(d).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Apple &amp; AT &amp; T iPad Unlimited Data Plan Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160584\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/802/1070/#p1077\">\n    802 F.Supp.2d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1077 (N.D.
