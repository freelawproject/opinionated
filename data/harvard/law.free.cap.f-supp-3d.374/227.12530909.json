After motion practice, the Town became the sole defendant. The parties proceeded to trial and the jury found the Town liable for private nuisance and trespass. Before the Court is the Town's motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 or, in the alternative, a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. Plaintiffs have not moved for any post-trial relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, Defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the background of the case and will only discuss the evidence at trial necessary to its analysis. Briefly, Plaintiffs own beachfront homes in Montauk, New York, next to two jetties. The jetties, which were originally built in 1926 to maintain the inlet near Plaintiffs' properties, have allegedly stopped the flow of sand to Plaintiffs' beaches and caused them to erode. Plaintiffs seek monetary and equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action in June 2012 against the United States of America (the \"United States\"); the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the \"Army Corps\"); Colonel John R. Boule, Commander of the New York District of the Army Corps, individually and in his official capacity (\"Boule\"); the Town; William J. Wilkinson, Supervisor of the Town, individually and in his official capacity (\"Wilkinson\"); the County of Suffolk (the \"County\"); the State of New York (\"the State\"); Joe Martens, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (\"DEC\") (\"Martens\"); and Cesar A. Perales, Secretary of the New York State Department of State (\"Perales\"). (Compl., D.E. 1.) Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in September 2012. (Am.

The Court finds that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Plaintiffs suffered a substantial interference with their right to use and enjoy their land, and that it was caused in part by the jetties, or, at the very least, exacerbated by them. However, the Court agrees with the Town that no reasonable juror could have found that the Town intentionally interfered with that right, or that the injury was caused by the Town's conduct in acting or failing to act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As will be discussed, the causation and intent elements of private nuisance are impacted by the Town's lack of control over the jetties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Control and Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties are exceedingly familiar with the history of the jetties, first built by a private businessman with a federal permit in 1926 to facilitate Montauk's economy and growth. The documentary evidence at trial demonstrates that in 1939, the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army recommended the adoption of a federal project for Lake Montauk Harbor to continue and expand the jetties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from the Sec'y of War, June 1939, Defs.' Tr. Ex. A-1, D.E. 210-1.) That report concluded that \"[r]epair of the jetties and dredging of the basin and entrance channel [were] justified at the expense of the Federal Government in the interest of safety and convenience to navigation and in view of other general benefits.\" (D.E. 210-1 at ECF p. 6.) The jetties and the Lake Montauk Harbor inlet were subsequently made a Federal Navigation Project (\"FNP\") by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, Defs.' Tr. Ex. H-1, D.E. 210-2.) This Act \"adopted and authorized [the project] in the interest of national security and stabilization of employment.\" (D.E. 210-2 at ECF p. 4.) FNPs are subject to the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20401\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   ), which essentially gives the Federal Government and the Army Corps exclusive control over navigable waters of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 1962, the Town granted the federal government an \"absolute and indefeasible easement in the body of water known as Lake Montauk Harbor and in the shores and bed thereof as may be necessary to insure its permanent dedication to the uses and purposes of a public navigable waterway.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Correction Deed\", 1962, Pls.' Tr. Ex. 10, D.E. 210-22, at ECF p. 2.) The Deed recognized that the federal government was \"about to enter upon the improvement of Lake Montauk Harbor ... [including] the extension shoreward of the west jetty.\" (Correction Deed at ECF p. 2.) It conveyed \"the lands and lands under water together with the structures thereon to the United States for the purpose of conveying to the said United States all rights and easements.\" (Correction Deed at ECF pp. 2-3.) The \"title to the said lands under the waters of Lake Montauk\n   Harbor ... remain[ed] in the Town of East Hampton, subject to all the rights and easements to insure the permanent dedication of the Harbor to the uses and purposes of a public navigable waterway.\" (Correction Deed at ECF p. 5.) As a result of the Deed, the Town became the servient owner and the federal government became the dominant owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court is mindful that in prior orders, it stated that Plaintiffs had \"at least plausibly suggested that [the Town] can maintain the Jetties without creating a nuisance or trespass by remedial actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Cangemi I\n   </em>\n   at 198. However, the evidence at trial has convinced this Court that the Town simply could not and did not exercise control over the jetties sufficient to impose liability on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jetties were not built by the Town. Decades ago, and well before all Plaintiffs here bought their homes, the Town asked the federal government to take over the maintenance and care of the jetties to keep the inlet open. This was to benefit the public. While the Town may own the jetties and the land the jetties sit upon, its agreement with the Army Corps bars it from changing the jetties. Thus, the only action the Town has taken to \"control\" the jetties was to relinquish control over them. Further, it is clear from the evidence at trial that while the Town wanted the Army Corps to maintain the inlet, it did not mandate how the Army Corps should do so. The Army Corps was given the discretion and control to accomplish the ongoing project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thomas Pfeifer, retired from the Army Corps, testified that the jetties and the navigation channel were a federal navigational project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1688.) \"[F]ederal responsibilities for the jetties ... occurred going back to ... 1945 or so, because those jetties ... were lengthened and fortified at the request of the United States Navy.\" (Trial Tr. 1692-93.) \"[I]n this case maintenance responsibilities for the federal project are 100 percent federal.\" (Trial Tr. 1693.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Army Corps had done several studies regarding the \"navigation\" \"problem\" and \"identified that there was indeed an erosion problem to the west of the jetties\" where Plaintiffs' homes are located. (Trial Tr. 1690.) It came up with several potential solutions, including \"[j]etty rehabilitation,\" \"deepening of [the] federal navigational channel,\" \"[r]emoval of the large shoal at the east jetty,\" \"advance maintenance dredging 50 feet outside of the channel limits to serve as a deposition basin; also, disposal of dredge material on the western shoreline,\" and \"[s]and bypassing the western shoreline.\" (Trial Tr. 1691.) The Court recognizes that the Army Corps was often in communication with the State, the Town, and other local entities. (Trial Tr. 1718 (\"The majority of the studies are done by the Corps. Sometimes there are contributions from the state and, in fact, the local community, local government\").) However, Pfeifer's testimony demonstrates that the Army Corps ultimately considered the jetties and the channel to be a federal responsibility with federal responses required to solve the erosion problems. Further, while Pfeifer alluded to an internal \"headquarters\", (Trial Tr. 1756), desire to move studies faster, the pace of the federal studies and response (or lack thereof) was not something the Town could control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Mark Byrnes, a former Army Corps employee and the expert retained by Plaintiffs to prepare an erosion report, explained that the Army Corps extended the west jetty in 1942 (Trial Tr. 515), extended the east jetty in 1968, and rehabilitated the east jetty in 1995 (Trial Tr. 398). Jay Schneiderman, the former Town Supervisor, testified that the jetties were federal navigation projects maintained by\n   the federal government to stabilize the inlet. The federal government \"performs maintenance and dredging and the other operations with respect to th[e] inlet.\" (Trial Tr. 1560.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Considering the above, the evidence at trial showed that the Army Corps expanded and maintained the jetties and \"[t]he [Town] was a mere instrumentality for performance of certain plans and improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    Ireland v. Suffolk Cty. of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011394156\">\n    2008 WL 11394156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (E.D.N.Y.

App'x 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2010).\n   <em>\n    Ireland\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, a plaintiff homeowner sued Suffolk County for negligence and nuisance, claiming that certain dredging and jetty and groin construction projects accelerated shoreline erosion and caused damage to her home. After a bench trial, the court found that the plaintiff had not adequately established causation. As relevant here, the court additionally found that \"the [discretionary] decisions to construct these structures were made primarily by the [Army Corps].\"\n   <em>\n    Ireland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011394168\">\n    2008 WL 11394168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9. The court concluded that \"[t]he fact that various interested constituencies ... gave input to the [Army Corps] as to its decision on how to proceed does not create a duty on the part of those constituencies to account for the consequences of the [Army Corps'] decision\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011394168\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) even where the County agreed to hold the United States government \"free from all damages\" caused by the construction of the works (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011394168\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *3 ). The court could \"not see how the County assumed a legal duty to construct and maintain or exercise any control over the groins and jetties that the [Army Corps] actually constructed and maintained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. Here, the Town is similarly positioned to the County in\n   <em>\n    Ireland\n   </em>\n   : it is \"a mere instrumentality for performance of certain plans and improvements and owed no duty to [P]laintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they are not asking the Town to change or eliminate the jetties, but rather to address their impact in some other way. They point to Pfeifer's testimony indicating that there was no federal prohibition on the Town performing a sand bypass project. The fundamental problem with this argument is that the Town is not responsible for fixing a problem it did not cause, approve, or exacerbate. That the Town\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have done something for these Plaintiffs does not mean it was legally required to do so (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangusi v.
