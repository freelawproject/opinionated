Scola, Jr., United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on the Plaintiff Luis Gonzalez's (\"Gonzalez\") motion to remand, (the \"Motion,\" ECF No. 12 ), which raises two related jurisdictional issues: (1) whether removal jurisdiction under the Ted Stevens Olympic Amateur Sports Act (the \"Sports Act,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20220501\">\n    36 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 220501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) extends to Defendants USA Taekwondo, Inc.

Thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Motion (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 12\n   </strong>\n   ) and\n   <strong>\n    remands\n   </strong>\n   this case to the Florida state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   USAT is the national governing body (\"NGB\") for taekwondo in the United States, as designated by the United States Olympic Committee (\"USOC\"). The Center is a non-profit corporation empowered by Congress to exercise jurisdiction over the USOC and its NGBs \"with regard to safeguarding amateur athletes against abuse, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, in sports.\" Gonzalez is a taekwondo coach in Florida who runs a training academy for young athletes. Gonzalez was a member of the USAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises from the Center's investigation of allegations that Gonzalez engaged in an improper romantic and sexual relationship with a young athlete he was coaching. That investigation culminated in a finding that Gonzalez violated the Center's code of conduct. Ultimately, the Center suspended Gonzalez from coaching for ten years and prohibited him from participating in any activity authorized by the USOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 2, 2018, Gonzalez filed suit in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida, raising one count for declaratory relief under Florida law. The complaint requested a declaration that no arbitration agreement existed between Gonzalez and the Center, that Gonzalez was not bound by the Center's Code of Conduct, and that Gonzalez did not violate the Center's Code of Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The Center and USAT removed the case to this Court, (ECF Nos. 1, 12), and Gonzalez timely sought remand (ECF No. 16 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

In doing so, the Court avoids making any determination of whether Gonzalez's state law claim, in fact, challenges the Center's eligibility ruling, or whether the SSAA would \"ordinarily\" preempt such a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In 2018 Congress enacted the SSAA, designating the Center \"as the independent national safe sport organization\" for the United States with jurisdiction over the USOC and NGBs to safeguard amateur athletes against emotional, physical and sexual abuse in sports.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20220541\">\n     36 U.S.C. \u00a7 220541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), (2).

Though the defendant in a diversity case, unlike the plaintiff, may have no actual knowledge of the value of the claims, the defendant is not excused from the duty to show by fact, and not mere conclusory allegation, that federal jurisdiction exists. Indeed, the defendant, by removing the action, has represented to the court that the case belongs before it. Having made this representation, the defendant is no less subject to Rule 11 than a plaintiff who files a claim originally. Thus, a defendant that files a notice of removal prior to receiving clear evidence that the action satisfies the jurisdictional requirements, and then later faces a motion to remand, is in the same position as a plaintiff in an original action facing a motion to dismiss. The court should not reserve ruling on a motion to remand in order to allow the defendant to discover the potential factual basis of jurisdiction. Such fishing expeditions would clog the federal judicial machinery, frustrating the limited nature of federal jurisdiction by encouraging defendants to remove, at best, prematurely, and at worst, in cases in which they will never be able to establish jurisdiction.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Post-removal discovery disrupts the careful assignment of burdens and the delicate balance struck by the underlying rules.
