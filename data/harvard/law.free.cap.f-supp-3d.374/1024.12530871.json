Petitioner, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has been in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") for over six and a half years while his removal proceedings have been pending. At each of his five bond hearings, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") concluded that no amount of bond or conditions of release could prevent petitioner's flight or protect the community from the danger he presents. Her justification: DUIs from 2005 and 2007, and a DUI/vehicular assault conviction from 2011. While certainly serious crimes, the most severe criminal sentence he received was three months of work release and 12 months of probation. He was never sentenced to any jail time. The convictions are\n   the basis for his exceedingly lengthy civil detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While detention pending removal proceedings is constitutionally permissible, it must comport with due process. Among other requirements, the Government must justify prolonged detention with clear and convincing evidence that the noncitizen presents a current flight risk or danger to the community. Dangerousness cannot be based on criminal history alone; the severity and recency of the criminal conduct must be taken into account. The IJ also must consider changes in circumstances that would make recidivism less likely. Finally, although the Court cannot review the IJ's discretionary judgment, it may review the record for constitutional claims and legal error and to ensure that the clear and convincing evidence standard is met as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this case, petitioner seeks release from immigration detention or a new bond hearing. The Government moves to dismiss. Having considered the parties' submissions, the balance of the record, and the governing law, the Court concludes that petitioner is not entitled to release but is entitled to a new bond hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ erred as a matter of law in failing to consider petitioner's flight risk and dangerousness on a current basis. In addition, given that petitioner's only criminal history involves alcohol and driving, and there is evidence in the record regarding petitioner's sobriety and willingness to refrain from driving if he is released, the Court concludes that there is not clear and convincing evidence in the record that justifies his continued detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, the Court recommends that both the Government's motion to dismiss and petitioner's habeas petition be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Petitioner's request for immediate release should be denied, but the Government should be ordered to release him on appropriate conditions within 30 days unless, at a new bond hearing, it presents clear and convincing evidence that he presents a\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   flight risk or danger to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner is a native and citizen of El Salvador who initially entered the United States without inspection in July 2001.

Based on this record, the Court concludes that clear and convincing evidence does not support the IJ's decision to deny bond or release on appropriate conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court's conclusion aligns with district court decisions from this circuit. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Mau v. Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067644\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/562/1107/\">\n    562 F.Supp.2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Cal. 2008), the IJ denied release where the petitioner, who had been detained for over three years, had two misdemeanor DUIs and one felony DUI that were between four and six years old.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067644\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/562/1107/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067644\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/562/1107/\">\n    at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that the petitioner's \"past DUI convictions, while serious, cannot independently justify his continued indefinite detention, especially in light of the fact that the detention period (which has surpassed three years) has nearly doubled the 16 month penalty\n   Petitioner received for that crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067644\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/562/1107/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court concluded, \"Under the circumstances, the IJ's reliance on [these] convictions ... as the basis for the finding of present dangerousness was an error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067644\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/562/1107/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Petitioner in this case and the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Mau\n   </em>\n   have very similar criminal histories. Petitioner's claim of error, however, is stronger because he received no jail time for his most serious crime, whereas the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Mau\n   </em>\n   received 16 months, and yet petitioner's detention is more than twice as long as in\n   <em>\n    Mau\n   </em>\n   . Thus, like in\n   <em>\n    Mau\n   </em>\n   , the IJ in this case erred in finding dangerousness based on petitioner's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Ramos II\n   </em>\n   is also instructive. There, the IJ denied bond where the petitioner had two non-violent misdemeanor DUIs from 2015 and 2016 and was never sentenced to any custodial time.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523634\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1021/#p1034\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that clear and convincing evidence did not support continued detention, reasoning that the petitioner never served time in jail, was complying with the terms of her probation when ICE arrested her, was committed to addressing her alcohol addiction, and the most recent offense occurred 16 months earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523634\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1021/#p1034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523634\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1021/#p1034\">\n    at 1036-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also found that there were many alternatives to detention that would be sufficient to protect the public from any danger the petitioner posed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523634\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1021/#p1034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523634\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/1021/#p1034\">\n    at 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the offenses in\n   <em>\n    Ramos II\n   </em>\n   were less significant than in petitioner's case, both petitioners received no jail time for their crimes. The cases are also similar in that both petitioners were complying with the terms of their probations when ICE arrested them, and the petitioners indicated a commitment to remaining sober and obtaining help with that commitment upon release. In addition, the offenses in\n   <em>\n    Ramos II\n   </em>\n   occurred much more recently, only 16 months before the court's opinion whereas petitioner's most recent offense occurred approximately 89 months ago. The\n   <em>\n    Ramos II\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion that appropriate alternatives to detention could be imposed to protect the public from any risk the petitioner posed is equally applicable here, particularly given that petitioner's only criminal history involves alcohol and driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Both\n   <em>\n    Mau\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ramos II\n   </em>\n   support the Court's conclusion that the Government has not presented clear and convincing evidence, as a matter of law, that justifies petitioner's continued detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Remedy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For relief, petitioner asks the Court to release him because his lengthy detention is both \"unreasonable and unjustified.\" Dkt. 7 at 16. Petitioner seizes on language from Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , quoted in full above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 1034-35. As noted, however, Justice Kennedy's proposed remedy for unreasonable or unjustified detention was a bond hearing, not release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The same remedy is appropriate in this case, particularly given the length of time since petitioner's last bond hearing. Only if the government is unable to justify petitioner's continued detention, at a new bond hearing conducted under the standards articulated above, should he be released on appropriate conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Eighth Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Petitioner contends that his continued detention violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1. The Government argues that petitioner fails to state a claim because the Eighth Amendment does not apply to immigration detention. Dkt. 4 at 12.
