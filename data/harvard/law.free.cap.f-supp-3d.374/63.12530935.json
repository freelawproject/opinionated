KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is about the H-2A temporary agricultural labor program, which permits agricultural employers that face a shortage of domestic workers to meet their labor needs by hiring foreign workers on a temporary or seasonal basis (\"H-2A workers\"). To ensure that the employment of temporary foreign workers under this program does not adversely affect the wages of similarly employed domestic workers, the Department of Labor (the \"Department\") must publish an annual notice setting forth the next year's Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs). AEWRs set a wage floor that employers participating in the H-2A program must pay to all agricultural workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Peri &amp; Sons Farms, Inc., and the National Council of Agricultural Employers (NCAE) (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") have sued the Secretary of Labor and two Department\n   officials (\"Defendants\"), alleging that the Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, Plaintiffs contend that the Department lacked statutory authority to promulgate AEWRs without first making a finding on whether the employment of H-2A workers adversely effected the wages of domestic agricultural workers. Second, Plaintiffs allege that the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it disregarded certain factors, such as differences in workers' geographic area, occupation, skills, and experience, in assessing any such adverse effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The parties have agreed to consolidate that motion with the merits, and to allow the Court to rule on the merits based on the current briefing and record. Defendants argue in their opposition that the Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims. As explained in more detail below, the Court agrees. Plaintiffs' claims present challenges to the 2010 regulation that established the methodology for determining AEWRs. Thus, because they fall outside the statute of limitations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and because Plaintiffs have not shown that a narrow exception to that statute applies, the Court must dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In other words, Plaintiffs allege that by issuing the 2019 AEWR Notice, the Department \"impose[d] significantly higher labor costs ... without acting in accordance with the INA's requirement to find adverse effect and beyond the authority provided to it by Congress with respect to setting the terms and conditions of H-2A employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.

The Department explained that, even without a finding that the employment of H-2A workers created an adverse effect on domestic wages, the use of AEWRs was necessary \"in order to effectuate its statutory mandate of protecting domestic agricultural workers from the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of adverse effects on their wages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%206884\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%206884\">\n    at 6895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Because AEWRs represented \"wage floor[s]\" that addressed \"the forward-looking need to protect U.S. workers [from] wage stagnation or deflation that has the potential to result from the hiring of immigrant labor,\" the Department concluded that it could circulate AEWRs without finding actual \"evidence of wage depression in agriculture.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%206884\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%206884\">\n    at 6891-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department codified how AEWRs are calculated a month later, in March 2010, when it defined the AEWR as \"[t]he annual weighted average hourly wage for field and livestock workers (combined) in the States or regions as published annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) based on its quarterly wage survey.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20655.103\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

In that case, the Circuit clarified that, for purposes of the exception, \"applications\" are not limited to \"formal enforcement actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323738,4119774\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/142/\">\n    744 F.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). But it also advised, at least by implication, that the term does not include every type of agency action. By using the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    the sort of 'application'\n   </em>\n   that opens a rule to such challenge,\" it suggested that the exception does not extend to every situation in which a regulation affects a party, or even every situation in which, at least arguably, the regulation has been \"applied\" in some sense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323738,4119774\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Circuit then listed \"the sort[s]\" of applications that it had held did so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323738,4119774\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In every example, the agency applied the challenged regulation through an order or other agency action directed at a particular party, its property, or a set of circumstances specifically affecting that party. As far as the Court can tell, district courts in this Circuit have permitted this exception to be invoked only in similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And unfortunately for Plaintiffs, the 2019 AEWR Notice simply does not fit the description of agency \"applications\" under these cases. It did not, for example, adjudicate a complaint or petition submitted by Plaintiffs or apply the 2010 Rule such a way that affected Plaintiffs in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Edison Electric\n   </em>\n   further suggests that the 2019 AEWR Notice was not an \"application\" of the 2010 Rule such that an otherwise time-barred challenge to it is permitted under the exception. Although it is not precisely clear how the 1989 decision \"applied\" the earlier\n   <em>\n    Yoyo\n   </em>\n   rule in that case, the Circuit's analysis did not turn on the relationship between the two agency actions. Instead, the court held that the 1989 decision, while perhaps affecting the\n   <em>\n    Yoyo\n   </em>\n   rule's impact on the railroads' profits, did not apply it \"to any particular [party] nor extend it to any new circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862257,10519286\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/1221/\">\n    969 F.2d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in contrast, the \"sorts of applications\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   had done precisely that. Here, the 2019 AEWR Notice did not apply the 2010 Rule to any particular party nor extend it to any new circumstances. Rather, it simply updated the annual wage rates applicable to all H-2A employers in accordance with the methodology set in 2010. To be sure, Plaintiffs, like all H-2A employers, are subject to the new AEWRs, just as all railroads were subject to both the\n   <em>\n    Yoyo\n   </em>\n   rule and the subsequent 1989 decision. But that fact alone does not an \"application\" make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, because Plaintiffs have not established that the 2019 AEWR Notice is an \"application\" of the 2010 Rule for purposes of this exception, their claims, which are entirely facial, must be dismissed because they are barred by \u00a7 2401(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court's conclusion is guided by several additional considerations. The D.C. Circuit has expressly described the exception as a \"narrow\" one.\n   <em>\n    Genuine Parts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516943\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/304/#p315\">\n    890 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if it applies here, the Court would be hard-pressed to describe its limitations. Moreover, where the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdictional, the Court must start with a presumption that this \"narrow\" exception\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    511 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (noting that because federal courts have limited jurisdiction, the law presumes that \"a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction\").

Finally, in the Court's view, applying the exception here would effectively nullify the six-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2401(a). If the 2019 AEWR Notice were sufficient to invoke it, any H-2A employer could challenge the 2010 Rule at any time. And regulations establishing other similar regimes would also be exposed to never-ending facial challenges from those subject to them. For that reason, allowing the exception to be invoked here would \"frustrate Congress's objective that facial challenges to a regulation be confined to a limited period.\"\n   <em>\n    Coal River Energy, LLC v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069451,5900053\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/659/\">\n    751 F.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663 (D.C.

The law in this Circuit recognizes \"[t]he general rule is that it is a perfectly valid 'method of obtaining judicial review of agency regulations once the limitations period has run ... to petition the agency for amendment or rescission of the regulations and then to appeal the agency's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

And, if successful, their claims would invalidate the AEWRs effective in 2018, as well as in all previous years they were established under the 2010 Rule. Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin all implementation and enforcement of the 2019 AEWRs, rather than their application to a specific party or region.
