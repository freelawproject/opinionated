Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas Becher, individually and on behalf of those similarly situated, filed this lawsuit against defendants United Healthcare Services, Inc. (\"United\"), The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential\"), and AARP. Plaintiff asserts that he and his wife, Jerri Becher, purchased an insurance policy from an AARP agent, and that this policy insured both of them. Since purchasing this policy, plaintiff alleges, both Prudential and United have underwritten the policy. Plaintiff's Complaint asserts that defendants breached the insurance policy when United refused to indemnify him for a hospital visit. Now, all defendants, together, ask the court to dismiss plaintiff's Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Doc. 14. They argue\n   dismissal is proper because plaintiff was not an insured party under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has filed a Response (Doc. 22), and defendants have filed their Reply (Doc. 23). But, plaintiff asks the court to strike defendants' Reply because it includes a copy of what defendants assert is the application form for the insurance policy at issue. Doc. 24. This application, plaintiff alleges, falls outside the collection of materials that a federal court can consider on a motion to dismiss. The court discusses this issue first, and then addresses the merits of defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Ultimately, the court concludes that plaintiff has stated plausible claims and denies defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants attached the application form for the insurance policy at issue to their Reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss. Doc. 23-2. Plaintiff asks the court to strike defendants' Reply. While the court agrees with plaintiff that it cannot consider the application form when ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the court declines to strike defendants' Reply in its entirety. Instead, for reasons explained below, the court declines to consider the application form and any argument relying on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court generally \"may not look beyond the four corners of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Indeed, plaintiff already has attached the policy to the Complaint. But defendants ask the court also to consider the application form that led to the insurance policy. The court may not do so without converting the motion into a summary judgment motion. The application does not fall within any of the three exceptions recognized by the Tenth Circuit that permit a district court to consider a matter outside the pleadings without converting the motion into one seeking summary judgment. The Circuit has recognized\n   the following three exceptions to the four corners of the complaint rule: (1) \"documents that the complaint incorporates by reference\"; (2) \"documents referred to in the complaint if the documents are central to the plaintiff's claim and the parties do not dispute the documents' authenticity\"; and (3) matters \"which a court may take judicial notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Gee v.

Plaintiff responds, arguing that an application is part of the policy only when the insurer meets certain requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26 at 1 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Admin.%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%2040-4-12\">\n    Kan.

Here, the facts that the court properly can consider on a motion to dismiss do not show that the court can construe the application at issue as part of the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With a different showing, the issue whether the court could consider the application for insurance would pose an interesting question. But the Kansas Administrative Regulation above and several Kansas case authorities require insurers to comply with that regulation before an application is part of an insurance policy. Here, nothing establishes that the application form qualifies for one of the limited exceptions to the rule against considering matters outside the pleadings. Also, defendants have not demonstrated that they complied with the Kansas regulation. The court thus cannot consider the application form as part of plaintiff's policy and, subsequently, when deciding defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court also declines to convert defendants' Motion into a motion for summary judgment. Several reasons support this outcome. First, none of the parties ask the court to convert the Motion in this fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368905\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/242/1009/#p1016\">\n    242 F.Supp.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (D. Kan. 2003). Second, defendants \"filed their motion at an early stage\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs\n   </em>\n   , No. 00-2180-KHV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20705806\">\n    2001 WL 705806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Kan. May 31, 2001) (\"Because defendants filed their motion at an early stage of the proceedings and discovery is not scheduled to close [for more than one month], the Court decline[d] to consider evidence outside the pleadings.\"). Third, the court also \"has not notified the parties that it will apply a summary judgment standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Grogan v. O'Neil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301399\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/292/1282/#p1292\">\n    292 F.Supp.2d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (D. Kan. 2003). Fourth, defendants' Motion does not provide \"a concise statement of material facts,\" as D. Kan. Rule 56.1 requires for summary judgment motions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301399\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/292/1282/#p1292\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Together, these reasons convince the court that it should not convert defendants' motion into one seeking summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, plaintiff asks the court to strike defendants' Reply in its entirety. Rather than striking the whole Reply, the court exercises its discretion and simply will disregard the application form and all arguments that reference it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rezac Livestock Comm'n Co. v. Pinnacle Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275083\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/1150/#p1163\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163-64 (D. Kan. 2017) (concluding that a bank check was a matter outside the pleadings and, after declining to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the court disregarded only the check when considering a motion to dismiss). The court thus grants plaintiff's Motion to Strike (Doc. 24) in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court now turns to the substance of defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14).

The Plan B8 policy was issued on April 1, 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the mid- to late-1990s, United began underwriting and administrating Plan B8 policies. Prudential underwrote and administered Plan B8 policies when it issued the policy at issue here.

Doc. 15 at 8-9; Doc. 23. They are: (1) reading the contract's plain language; (2) looking to the last antecedent rule; (3) harmonizing contract provisions; (4) avoiding superfluity; and (5) avoiding absurd results.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"907921\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/24/810/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court summarizes and addresses defendants' arguments in the following paragraphs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When it describes who is covered by the policy, the policy provides: \"The person or persons (the member and the spouse of the member) named above are covered from the Effective Date shown if the required premium contribution has been paid when due. The term\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   refers individually to each person named.\" Doc. 1-1 at 1. Plaintiff does not argue that he is an individual \"named above\" on the policy; rather, his Complaint theorizes that the words inside the parenthetical-\"the member and the spouse of the member\"-presumptively cover him under the policy. In the alternative, the Complaint alleges, the insurance policy is ambiguous, and its content must be construed against the drafters-here, the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants first argue that the parenthetical, given its plain meaning, merely modifies the person or persons named on the policy. They assert that the parenthetical provides an option for coverage rather than a requirement for who must be covered. Defendants contend that plaintiff has not alleged plausibly that the insurance policy covered him because he was not named as an insured under the policy. Conversely, as discussed above, plaintiff argues that the plain meaning of the parenthetical language presumptively covers him as an insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Next, defendants invoke the last antecedent rule. The rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In construing statutes, qualifying words, phrases and clauses are ordinarily confined to the last antecedent, or to the words and phrases immediately preceding. The last antecedent, within the meaning of this rule, has been regarded as the last word which can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Barten v.

Defendants argue that the parenthetical language, \"the member and the spouse of the member,\" describes the word \"persons\"-it clarifies the word \"persons.\" Doc. 15 at 10. Plaintiff responds, contending that applying the last antecedent rule would produce an absurdity. Plaintiff asserts that if the word \"persons\" is described by the following parenthetical-\"the member and the spouse of the member\"-the policy language would be redundant. Doc. 22 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, the parties agree that Kansas law requires the court to \"harmonize\" contract language by \"not constru[ing] ... [a contract's] paragraphs or clauses so as to make them conflict with each other,\" but rather, the court must \"construe them so as to give to each and all their terms full force and operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cobb, Stribling &amp; Co. v.

Defendants assert here that the policy uses the words \"you\" and \"your\" more than 80 times, and it expressly defines \"you\" as the individual named in the policy-in this case, they argue, Jerri Becher and Jerri Becher alone. Doc. 15 at 12-13. But plaintiff contends that the parenthetical language-\"the member and the spouse of the member\"-and the requirement that the policy itself must identify the insured parties are not in harmony with one another. Doc. 22 at 7. Plaintiff thus argues that the court should interpret the words in the parenthetical to cover him independently under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fourth, defendants argue interpreting the parenthetical language as a definition that presumptively covers plaintiff under the policy would render other provisions of the policy superfluous. For example, defendants contend, the policy provides that \"[i]f the member dies, the spouse, if covered under the Group Policy, may elect to continue coverage by paying the required premium contribution.\" Doc. 1-1 at 5. Defendants argue that, if the parenthetical language were read to mandate coverage of the named insured's spouse, regardless of whether the spouse was named on the policy, the policy language \"if covered under the Group Policy\" would be unnecessary. But plaintiff asserts that the policy covers spouses presumptively with the words in the parenthetical, and a spouse would be entitled to continued coverage automatically under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the parties agree that Kansas law favors avoiding contract interpretations that \"vitiate the purpose or reduce the terms of the contract to an absurdity.\"\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of Olathe v.

Defendants then argue that plaintiff's interpretation of presumptive coverage \"essentially imposes on the insurer a roving mandate to insure any spouse of any member, requiring an insurer to provide coverage without knowing who it is covering and without collecting a premium from all individuals in the risk pool.\" Doc. 15 at 15-16. Conversely, plaintiff argues, the policy could specify that it covers only named insureds, but, instead, it includes the redundant parenthetical providing that both the member and the spouse of the member may be covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Those five requirements for a prima facie claim are: \"(1) the existence of a contract between the parties; (2) sufficient consideration to support the contract; (3) the plaintiff's performance or willingness to perform in compliance with the contract; (4) the defendant's breach of the contract; and (5) damages to the plaintiff caused by the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416554\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/297/2/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, the court can draw a \"reasonable inference\" that plaintiff is entitled to recover for defendants' alleged breach of the insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, plaintiff plausibly interprets the parenthetical language, \"the member and the spouse of the member,\" to provide that he is included, presumptively, as an insured party. The court can draw a reasonable inference that the policy covers plaintiff because the words in the parenthetical would be redundant if defendants: (1) required the policy to name both spouses expressly for coverage to apply; but (2) also included language that already extends coverage to \"[t]he person or persons (the member and the spouse of the member) named\" in the contract. Doc. 1-1 at 1. Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to support a plausible inference that the parenthetical language covers him. Also, he has pleaded sufficient facts to allege plausibly, at a minimum, that the policy is ambiguous about the scope of its coverage. Given that conclusion, the policy must be construed against the drafters,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the defendant insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Prudential underwrote and administered Plan B8 policies when it issued the policy in question. He alleges, on information and belief, that United began underwriting and administrating Plan B8 policies in the mid- to late-1990s. Also, plaintiff alleges that AARP acted as an agent of both United and Prudential, and vice versa. Doc. 1 at 2. He directs the court to the insurance policy document: the first page contains both AARP and Prudential's logos. Doc. 22 at 10. These alleged facts, plaintiff contends, are \"sufficient ... to meet the definition of an implied agency under Kansas law, since the appearance of the Prudential and AARP logos is intended to give the viewer the perception that these organizations are behind the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219736\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/751/#p756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that discovery is required to determine whether one or more of the defendants should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court agrees with plaintiff.

Plaintiff plausibly has alleged that: (1) each defendant held itself out as a party involved in the insurance coverage at issue; and (2) acted within the scope of an agency relationship when it denied plaintiff's insurance claim. Plaintiff's Complaint sufficiently states a breach of contract claim against all three defendants. The court thus denies defendants' Motion to Dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, plaintiff seeks declaratory relief to establish his rights under the policy. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-58. Plaintiff alleges that the policy, at a minimum, is ambiguous and should be interpreted against defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. And plaintiff seeks a declaration that the policy covers spouses of individuals named on the policy document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. Plaintiff asserts, based on the contract interpretation grounds discussed above, that he is covered under the policy, and defendants' actions continue to harm him. Doc. 22 at 9. Plaintiff also argues that defendants are \"large, sophisticated actors\" who can affect many individuals in Kansas and beyond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He and the putative\n   class seek a declaration of their rights under the policy because there is an actual controversy with defendants about the policy's coverage terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Courts can \"declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the court grants plaintiff's Motion to Strike (Doc. 24) in part and denies it in part, as set forth in this Order.
