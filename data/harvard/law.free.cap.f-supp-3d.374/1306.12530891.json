Defendants move for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's sole claim for retaliation in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 215 (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following is a summary of the facts in this case for background purposes. It does not reflect findings of fact by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Furkids is \"a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, [which] has operated one of the largest cage-free, no-kill cat shelters in the Southeast since 2002.\" (Def.'s Reply to Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Separate St. of Undisputed Material Facts (Def.'s Reply SMF), Doc. 54-1 \u00b6 1.) Furkids' shelter \"is dedicated to protecting the lives and safety of Atlanta's homeless cats.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) \"Defendant Samantha Shelton is the founder and CEO of Furkids.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, Laura Moakler, loves cats. (Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc. 54-1 \u00b6 6.) In June of 2015, this passion led her to a job as a veterinary assistant with Defendant Furkids, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) She worked at Furkids until August 1, 2016 when her employment was terminated by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48.) Her termination is the subject of this lawsuit. (Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a veterinary assistant, Moakler was required to provide weekly room counts of the cats in Furkids' care, receive intake appointments, carry out and schedule appointments, clean cages, and prepare \"med\" cards for sick cats. (Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 43:2-17.) Both Ms. Moakler and Furkids agree that Ms. Moakler was required to perform room counts weekly. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 8-11.) \"Weekly room counts entail counting the cats that are in each room at the cage-free shelter and recording this number on a room count chart that was then given to Furkids' CEO, Shelton.\" (Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc. 54-1 \u00b6 9.) Furkids houses hundreds of cats in 20 largely cage free rooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9) (The parties dispute whether Furkids houses between 300-350 cats or 400-500 cats.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Moakler was an hourly employee with Furkids. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 10:17-11:19.) Initially, she was paid for thirty hours of work, but at some point, she became a full-time employee and was then paid for forty hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Moakler contends that she frequently worked long hours without receiving additional compensation. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 10:4-9, 11:23-14:5, 19:20-20:1.) These long hours caused stress for Ms. Moakler at home because she was not able to spend time with her family or tend to normal household chores. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 13:5-14:5, 74:18-21, 118:1-7.) After much discontent, she sought legal advice \"to talk about the hours I was working versus the hours I was being paid for.\" (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 9:10-11.) Her lawyer sent the Defendants a letter on May 25, 2016, which stated that Ms. Moakler retained the firm \"to investigate a Fair Labor Standards Act overtime case arising out of her employment with Furkids.\" (Doc. 50-7 at 1.) The letter does not state any conclusions but merely advises Furkids and Ms. Shelton that Moakler has retained the firm to investigate Ms. Moakler's overtime claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Moakler testified that after her lawyer sent the letter, \"there was a palpable tension at work and everything changed.\" (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 43:7-8.) She explained that she experienced this tension with Renee Cardona, the Animal Care Manager, and Terri Brunson, the Shelter Manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:24-61:7.) Ms. Moakler testified that \"had I worked with Ms. Shelton, there would've been tension, but I didn't work with her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:8-10.) Defendants provide evidence that neither Brunson nor Cardona knew about the letter from Moakler's attorney at the time Moakler was discharged. (Cardona Decl., Doc. 39-8 \u00b6 6; Brunson Decl., Doc. 39-7 \u00b6 9). Plaintiff does not dispute this fact in the Parties' Statement of Undisputed Facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc. 54-1 \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moakler explains that \"as soon as the letter was sent, everything changed at work\" - Defendants implemented a new\n   overtime policy, a time card policy, and excluded Plaintiff from staff meetings. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 43:7-44:5.) The first of these policy changes occurred in early June, when Furkids instituted a policy to stop its employees from working overtime without permission. The parties dispute when this policy was announced to the employees. Defendant Shelton states that it was announced to staff on June 8, 2016, but Ms. Moakler contends that this new policy was announced to staff on June 13, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 56:1-20; Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 9.) Ms. Shelton testified that on June 8, 2016, \"I instructed that no staff was to work beyond their scheduled shift.\" (Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 56:15-20.) Then, Shelton testified that on that same day \"Laura Moakler worked beyond her scheduled shift.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moakler disputes this and testified that no one told her to stop working beyond her scheduled shift. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 55:4-56:21.) Moakler contends that she was notified of the new policy on June 13, 2016. (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 9.) On June 12, 2016, a day before Moakler states that she was notified of the new policy, Shelton disciplined Moakler for not following her supervisor's instruction to stop working past 5 p.m. on June 8, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 56:1-20.) Thus, Ms. Moakler claims that she was disciplined for an alleged violation of the new policy before she was advised of the policy change. (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, also on June 12, 2016, Furkids implemented a \"Time Card Instructions Policy\" and distributed it to all employees, including Moakler. (Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 130:16-134:21). Ms. Shelton testified that \"[e]very [employee] received a hard copy of the memo and was required to sign it, and then that went into their employee file.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:19-21.) Shelton also testified that Moakler signed the document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135:5-18.) (identifying the memo with Moakler's signature as Exhibit 10). Moakler contends that she was given different instructions than other employees were given regarding working overtime. (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3\u00b6 12.) According to Moakler, other employees were required to obtain permission to work overtime from their direct supervisor, while Moakler was required to obtain prior permission, in writing, from Furkids' CEO. (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, after her attorney sent the letter, Moakler contends she was excluded from staff meetings. According to Defendants, \"[m]anagers attend the staff meeting[s]. We had opened it up to vet assistants, but found that the meetings were going quite wrong and it was not as efficient. So we cut back and just said manager level. So we no longer had the vet assistants attending the meeting.\" (Furkids Dep. at 136:18-23.) Moakler testified that this affected her ability to do her job because \"I wasn't privy to the info discussed at the staff meetings.... If there were decisions made, I would not necessarily know these decisions ... that would affect my ability to do my job because I wouldn't know what the priorities were.\" (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 45:24-46:3.) While Defendants state that this decision meant none of the vet assistants had to attend staff meetings, Moakler notes that she \"was the only Vet Assistant scheduled on Mondays when the staff meeting was held.\" (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ultimately, Furkids terminated Ms. Moakler's employment for \"failure to follow instructions and complete room counts.\" (Shelton Decl., Doc. 39-6 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 37;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Shelton Decl., Doc. 39-6 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Cardona Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Brunson Decl., \u00b6 68). Room counts were supposed to be completed weekly on Mondays. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 125:20:23, 48:8-11.) Before Ms. Moakler's lawyer sent the letter, Defendants contend that there were three\n   weeks when Ms. Moakler did not provide room counts and Ms. Shelton emailed her to request that she send the counts. (Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc. 54-1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-24; Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 125:24-126:23) (describing Shelton's emails to Moakler regarding missed room counts on February 2, 2016, April 27, 2016, May 12, 2016.) After the first missed room count on February 2, 2016, Shelton emailed Moakler about the missed count and she complied by providing the count. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 125:24-126:3.) Then, on April 27, 2016, Shelton again had to email Moakler to provide the room count. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:4-9.) This time, Moakler did not comply, and Shelton sent Moakler another email on May 4, 2016, stating \"it's been a week and I do not have the room counts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:10-19). Then, just a few days later on May 12, 2016, Shelton emailed Moakler to ask her to provide the room count. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126:2-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Ms. Moakler's lawyer sent the letter, Furkids contends and Moakler agrees that she failed to provide seven weeks of room counts. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 128:11-131:17) (June 6, 2016, June 13, 2016, June 20, 2016, July 4, 2016, July 11, 2016, July 25, 2016, and August 1, 2016). After the second missed room count on June 13, 2016 Shelton gave Moakler a written warning. Moakler testified that the June 17, 2016 warning stated \"[a]s you are aware, you're expected to provide me with a weekly inventory of the cat rooms at the cat shelter. You have not fulfilled this responsibility after repeated requests. If you fail to provide this information weekly, your employment will be terminated.\" (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 57:22-58:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Ms. Shelton, \"[d]oing room counts was an important part of Moakler's job. Timely and accurate room counts allow Furkids to make decisions on intakes. Not having timely and accurate room counts can lead to negative outcomes for Furkids and its feline wards.\" (Shelton Decl., Doc. 39-6, \u00b6 10.) Additionally, \"[h]aving too many cats at the shelter could create safety or health issues for the cats and/or employees. As a result, Furkids tries to avoid rescuing more cats than it can safely and responsibly care for. On the other hand, having unused capacity at Furkids is contrary to Furkids' charitable mission of rescuing as many homeless cats as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Thus, she states that she \"needed the room counts by Monday of each week so that [she and Furkids] knew the turnover in cats that occurred the previous weekend, could prepare for the week, and knew how much space [they] had to rescue more cats.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) However, Moakler states that \"[r]oom counts were not an important part of [her] duties.\" (Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 5.) According to Moakler, \"[d]ecisions were not based on room counts. Furkids would provide shelter for cats irrespective of the room counts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Thus, Moakler contends that \"[r]oom counts were not used to allocate Furkids' resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) The parties also dispute whether performing room counts was solely Moakler's responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Moakler Decl., Doc. 50-3 \u00b6 7 (\"Other Furkids' employees besides myself performed room counts.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 102:18-24 (stating that no one else did room counts).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 1, 2016, Ms. Shelton decided to terminate Ms. Moakler's employment \"for failing to follow instructions regarding completing room counts.\" (Shelton Decl., Doc. 39-6 \u00b6 34.) Ms. Shelton told Cardona and Brunson about her decision, and then she witnessed Cardona tell Ms. Moakler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Moakler was provided with a Separation Notice, which stated \"employee was discharged for repeatedly failing to follow her supervisor's instructions. She was previously disciplined for failing to complete her weekly inventory and told that further instances would result in termination\n   of employment.\" (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 132:21-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Further, they contend that even if Moakler were able to allege a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, she failed to show pretext for discrimination that rebuts the Defendants' legitimate non-retaliatory reason for terminating her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Moakler argues that she has successfully alleged a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, because the letter from her attorney is protected activity and there is a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination.

Ms. Moakler worked as an hourly employee and therefore viewed herself as likely entitled to the overtime compensation protections provided under federal law when she worked overtime hours. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 10:17-23) (Furkids Dep., Doc. 40 at 44:3-5.) This was an objectively reasonable belief because it is true in connection with the vast majority of hourly wage employees working for employers the size of Furkids. She also consulted an attorney with a specialty in employment law who in turn contacted Furkids in an effort to investigate her claim. Moakler's course of action reflects a diligent effort to obtain information concerning her status and the legality of defendants' pay practices and properly would authorize the Court to find that she engaged in protected activity under the FLSA. However, the Court need not reach a definitive finding in this regard because, as discussed later, Plaintiff's claim ultimately flounders on another ground: Moakler's failure to show that Defendant's legitimate non-retaliatory reason for her termination was a pretext for retaliation. For purposes of the Court's analysis here though, the Court treats Plaintiff's evidence as satisfying the requirement that she engaged in activity protected by the FLSA based on the evidence submitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to the other elements of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff's termination by Furkids constitutes an adverse action.

Specifically, Defendants argue that Moakler's attendance at staff meetings was entirely unrelated to both her attorney's letter and her discharge. Further, they argue there is no evidence that Moakler's write-up for working late is connected to her discharge. Third, they contend the tension Ms. Moakler says she felt cannot be related to the letter, because Moakler claimed she experienced this tension between herself and Brunson and Cardona and there is undisputed evidence that neither Brunson nor Cardona knew about the letter. (Doc. 39-1 at 17) (citing Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 60:24-61:12; Cardona Decl., \u00b6 6; Brunson Decl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moakler contends that the time that elapsed between her letter and her discharge - just over two months - is close enough to support that the two events were connected. She then argues that if the Court rejects the temporal proximity as insufficiently close, the evidence shows a pattern of treating Moakler disfavorably after her protected activity. This pattern includes the significant rise in workplace tension Moakler experienced after Furkids's CEO received her counsel's letter. Indicia of this include Defendants' exclusion of Moakler from staff meetings, Defendant's threats to terminate her for working late, and threats to fire her for not completing room counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, there were sixty-eight days, just over two months, between Ms. Moakler's protected activity and her termination.

She urges this Court that the changes that took place after her protected activity - making failure to conduct room counts and staying after hours terminable offenses, subjecting her to increased scrutiny, formal write-ups,\n   and not allowing her to attend staff meetings - \"cast[ ] ample doubt on the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment.\" (Doc. 50 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants argue that Moakler has failed to show pretext because she admitted that her termination was for failing to follow instructions regarding room counts. (Doc. 54 at 9.) Moreover, they contend that her examples about the changes that took place after her protected activity are not logically connected to her termination. (Doc. 54 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has failed to carry her burden to show pretext as she has failed to rebut Defendant's core legitimate non-retaliatory reason for its termination action. Defendants maintain that Moakler was fired for repeatedly failing to provide room counts, a requirement of her job. Plaintiff admits that she repeatedly failed to provide room counts. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 128:11-131:17.) While Plaintiff argues that it was only after her protected activity that failing to provide room counts became a terminable offense, she has not shown that Defendants instituted a new policy regarding room counts to retaliate against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants have shown that Moakler failed to provide room counts before and after her protected activity. Before Ms. Moakler's lawyer sent the letter, Defendant contends that there were three weeks when Ms. Moakler did not provide room counts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc. 54-1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-24; Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 125:24-126:23) (describing Shelton's emails to Moakler regarding missed room counts on February 2, 2016, April 27, 2016, May 12, 2016.) Ms. Moakler's lawyer sent the letter on May 25, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5-7.) Ms. Moakler then missed room counts on June 6, 2016 and June 13, 2016. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 129:3-8) (confirming that Moakler did not do any room counts between May 30th and June 23rd.) Confronted with an employee who repeatedly failed to do a core aspect of her job, Defendants gave her a written warning on June 17, 2016 that a continued failure would lead to her termination. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 57:22-58:15.) After the warning she continued to fail to provide timely room counts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 129:12- (acknowledging that Moakler provided late room counts the weeks of July 4, 2016, July 11, 2016, July 25, 2016, and August 1, 2016); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply SMF, Doc 54-1 \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39, 41, 42) (Plaintiff does not dispute that she did not provide room counts on July 4, 2016, July 11, 2016, and July 25, 2016, but disputes that Moakler did not provide a room count on August 1, 2016 as this was the day Moakler was discharged). Thus, Ms. Moakler failed to timely provide the counts, and her rate of failure actually increased after her protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While Moakler disputes the importance of room counts, this contention is immaterial to the Court's analysis as \"the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of [the employer's] reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman v. AI Transport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191307\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/1012/#p1030\">\n    229 F.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1030 (11th Cir. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moakler also argues that her job was changed by Furkids excluding her from staff meetings but fails to state how this change affected her ability to actually do her job. (Moakler Dep., Doc. 41 at 45:17-48:7.) She further maintains that she was subjected to increased scrutiny and a write-up for working overtime without being advised of the overtime policy change. While this may be true, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff was not fired for working overtime; she was fired for failing to follow instructions regarding providing room counts that the employer - correctly or not - viewed as essential to its operations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shelton Decl., Doc. 39-6, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11, 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Based on the summary judgment record and applicable legal standards for demonstration that Defendant's reasons were a pretextual cloak for retaliation, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not shown sufficient evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that her termination was a pretext for unlawful retaliation. Accordingly, Plaintiff's FLSA retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
