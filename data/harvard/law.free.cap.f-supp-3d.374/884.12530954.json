INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 29, 2018, Plaintiffs Kristi Kelley and Chad Loya (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), individually and on behalf of the United States filed a complaint to redress violations of the Federal False Claims Act. ECF 1 (\"Complaint\"). Plaintiffs rented a residential unit from Defendants Roger Denault and the Denault Family Limited Partnership (collectively, \"Defendants\") for over a decade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the terms of their Housing Assistance Payment Contract (\"HAP Contract\") and took a number of unlawful actions related to Plaintiffs' tenancy.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   On October 11, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and motion to strike Plaintiffs' first, second, third and tenth claims as well as Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages. ECF 30. The Court held a hearing on December 11, 2018. Based on the pleadings, submissions of the Parties, arguments presented at the hearing and relevant law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion as to Plaintiffs' third claim and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion as to Plaintiffs' first, second and tenth claims as well as to Plaintiffs' punitive damages allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ECF 1 at \u00b6 9. Defendants own the Subject Premises, which is a 500 square foot, one bedroom dwelling, constructed in 1978.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18. Santa Cruz County never approved the Subject Premises for use as either a residential rental unit or as a second unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Indeed, when Defendant Denault applied for a permit to expand the septic system in 2002, he labeled the Subject Premises as an office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Kelly became a Section 8 voucher recipient in September 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The federal government assists low-income families, the elderly and disabled persons in obtaining decent, safe and sanitary housing in the private market through the Section 8 voucher program. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") implements the program by providing funding to public housing agencies to use as rent subsidies to pay landlords renting to tenants with Section 8 vouchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before approving Plaintiffs' tenancy with Defendants, the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Cruz (\"Housing Authority\") required that Defendants enter into a HAP Contract with the Housing Authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The HAP Contract imposes conditions on Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. In particular, it requires that Defendants certify that the lease complies with local and state law and that Defendants will not receive any rent or other consideration for the property beyond the payment amount provided for in the HAP Contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The HAP Contract further provides that Plaintiffs would pay $ 202 per a month in rent as well as their share of the utilities, while the federal government would contribute $ 748 in subsidies for a total rent of $ 950 a month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. In October 2016, the Housing Authority issued an HAP Contract amendment that reduced Plaintiffs' portion of the rental payments to $ 33 and increased the federal government's payments to $ 917.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants increased Plaintiffs' share of the water bill to 60% in June 2016, and Plaintiffs paid this increased utility bill through December 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 42. In April 2017, Defendants sent Plaintiffs notice of a rent increase from $ 950 to $ 1,100 without seeking prior approval or notifying the Housing Authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Defendants then served Plaintiffs with two 90-day notices to terminate tenancy and filed an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiffs on December 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 44. In January 2018, Defendants demanded $ 1,200 in allegedly delinquent utility payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the Subject Premises suffers from a number of habitability problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. In addition to frequent septic and sewage problems, the Subject Premises had electrical issues, a leaking roof, [and] growth of toxic biological contaminants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. Finally, Defendants complained several times to Plaintiffs about their water use suggesting that Plaintiffs limit their showering or take sponge baths to avoid over taxing the septic system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 11, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and motion to strike Plaintiffs' first, second, third and tenth claims as well as Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages.

Legal Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs' first claim seeks relief under the False Claims Act. ECF 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-68. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who knowingly submits a false claim to the United States government.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Courts have recognized two theories of liability under the False Claims Act relevant to this case. First, the implied certification theory provides that \"liability can attach when the defendant submits a claim for payment that makes specific representations about the goods or services provided, but knowingly fails to disclose the defendant's noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p1995\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1995,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p1995\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Second, liability can arise based on the promissory fraud theory. That theory provides \"that liability will attach to each claim submitted to the government under a contract, when the contract or extension of government benefit was originally obtained through false statements or fraudulent conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Hendow v. Univ. of Phoenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/#p1173\">\n    461 F.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173 (9th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). To state a claim under either of those two theories, a plaintiff must plead four \"essential elements[:] ... (1) a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct, (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   made with scienter, (3) that was material, causing (4) the government to pay out money or forfeit moneys due.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/#p1173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/#p1173\">\n    at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants submitted false claims for federal funds as part of the Section 8 voucher program. ECF 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-68. Plaintiffs specifically allege that two theories support their False Claims Act claim against Defendants. First, Defendants misrepresented the legality of the Subject Premises in violation of the HAP Contract which requires that the rental property be legal under state law, and second, Defendants charged and collected excess side-payments beyond the approved amount under the HAP contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. Defendants' motion to dismiss focuses on the second and third elements of a False Claims Act claim-scienter and materiality. ECF 24 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the False Claims Act, a person acts \"knowingly\" if that person \"(i) has actual knowledge of the information; (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). The term \"knowingly\" within the False Claims Act context \"requires no proof of specific intent to defraud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3729(b)(1)(B). The Ninth Circuit has further clarified that to satisfy the scienter requirement, a defendant must make \"some request for payment containing falsities made with ... knowledge of the falsity and with intent to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/#p1173\">\n    461 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \"a palpably false statement, known to be a lie when it is made, is required for a party to be found liable under the False Claims Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/#p1173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint contains adequate allegations regarding scienter for each of their two theories of False Claims Act liability. First, the Complaint alleges that Defendants had knowledge of the illegality of the Subject Premises based on Defendants' misrepresentation on their July 12, 2002, permit application to expand the septic system in which Defendant Denault labeled the structure that would become the Subject Premises as an office. ECF 1 at \u00b6 20. This allegedly fraudulent permit application was made prior to Defendants signing the HAP Contract in 2015. As a result, Defendants' alleged failure to advise the Housing Authority about the illegality of the unit is a misrepresentation by omission that \"could constitute a knowing and intentional fraud on the government.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel Sutton v.
