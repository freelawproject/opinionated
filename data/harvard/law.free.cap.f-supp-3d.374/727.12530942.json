The letter listed the amount of the debt and also stated, \"Accrued Interest: $ 0.00.\" It also warned that Ms. Lemke might incur an additional charge if her payment was returned for insufficient funds. Ms. Lemke alleges that both the statement of interest and the warning of insufficient funds were false, deceptive, and misleading in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Illinois Collection Agency Act (\"ICAA\"), 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 425/9. Both parties move for summary judgment. For\n   the reasons set forth below, Defendant Escallate's motion for summary judgment granted and the case is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Escallate is a debt collection agency based in Ohio, licensed and doing business in Illinois. (Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts in Support of Her Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s SOF\") [54] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4; Answer [12] \u00b6 7.) Laura Lemke is a Chicago resident who owed an unpaid balance on a medical account from Emergency Medicine Physicians of Will County, LLC. (Pl.'s SOF [54] \u00b6 7.) On October 28, 2016, Escallate sent Ms. Lemke a letter informing her that her \"account ha[d] been listed with our office for collection,\" and that she had a \"balance due\" of $ 1,225.00. (Collection Letter, Exhibit B to Compl. [1].) Ms. Lemke does not dispute that she owed the $ 1,225.00. (Pl.'s Resp. to Df.'s Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Facts in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s Resp. to Df.'s SOF\") [60] \u00b6 2.) Instead, she takes issue with the contents of the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The letter itemizes the amount Ms. Lemke owed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Amount Assigned: $ 1225.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Accrued Interest: $ 0.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Balance Due: $ 1225.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Collection Letter, Exhibit B to Compl. [1].) The letter also notes: \"You may be charged a $ 20.00 Non-Sufficient Funds ['NSF'] Fee for any payment that is not honored because sufficient funds are not available in the account on which the payment was drawn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This NSF statement appears a little more than half-way down the page and is followed closely by Escallate's contact information and a detachable slip, typical of billing statements, that is to be returned with payment. The detachable portion contains Escallate's return mailing address, and it has a form for credit card payments. That form states, \"If paying by credit card, please check card [type] and fill out below,\" and it provides space for providing a card number, CVC code, expiration date, and signature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Lemke contends that both the interest itemization and the NSF statement contained in the letter are false, misleading, and deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Lemke never made any payments on the debt, and there is no evidence that she ever contacted Escallate to attempt to make any payment. She filed this lawsuit through counsel on July 15, 2017. Count I alleges that Escallate's letter violates \u00a7\u00a7 1682e, 1692e(2)(a), and 1692e(5) of the FDCPA. Count II alleges a violation of FDCPA \u00a7 1692g(a)(1). Finally, Count III alleges that Escallate has violated the ICAA, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 425/9. Escallate now moves for summary judgment on all counts of the Complaint; Ms. Lemke seeks summary judgment only on her FDCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

In the case before this court, Escallate did \"stop there\"; the letter makes no mention of any need to request a current balance.
