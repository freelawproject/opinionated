For the reason stated herein, the Court finds that the motion to amend should be granted and the motion to dismiss should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The statement of facts set forth below is taken from the Plaintiff's amended complaint and supporting exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff, Scott Napper, Administrator of the Estate of Joshua Napper, deceased, filed a one-count amended complaint against the Defendant, the United States of America, pursuant to the Federal Tort Claim Act (hereinafter \"FTCA\") 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1346(b). Joshua Napper, along with 28 other miners, died on April 5, 2010, at the Upper Big Branch Mine (hereinafter \"the Mine\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   due to an explosion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the explosion, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (hereinafter \"MSHA\") began investigating its cause. MSHA determined that on a longwall face, methane ignition at the Mine transitioned into a small methane explosion that propagated into a massive coal dust explosion and the deadliest U.S. coal mine disaster in nearly forty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MSHA also reviewed its conduct in the period leading up to the fatal accident. The investigation revealed that MSHA inspectors violated mandatory regulations which created, maintained, or contributed to unsafe working conditions including the violations before and including those cited in the March 6, 2012 Internal Review of MSHA's actions at the Mine. For example, according to the report, in violation of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook, some parts of the mine were not inspected during the previous six regular inspections, fire protection equipment inspections were not conducted or documented, checks for imminent dangers were not conducted and self-contained self-rescue devices were not properly inspected. Moreover, inspection trainees conducted some inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff, the father of the deceased, instituted this action on February 9, 2018. The sole count of the complaint asserts claims for negligence and wrongful death under West Virginia law. The Plaintiff alleges that \"the United States is liable here for negligently executing a duty it undertook, and for failing to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm to Joshua Napper caused by the United States' affirmative negligent conduct.\" (Compl. \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 11, 2018, the Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The United States contends that (1) the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the sovereign immunity of the United States, (2) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA, because the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the discretionary function exception, (3) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the United States has not waived sovereign immunity under the FTCA to allow tort claims based on alleged violations of federal law, and (4) the Plaintiff's claims are based on alleged violations of the Mine Act, and federal law does not recognize a private right of action for alleged violations of the Mine Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 25, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss and on June 1, 2018, filed a motion to amend the complaint and attached the amended complaint. On June 1, 2018, the Defendant filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss. Finally, on June 16, 2018, the Defendant filed a memorandum opposing the Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint, wherein it argued that the amendments were not sufficient to defeat its motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A.

First, it argues that many of the claims alleged in the complaint are not violations of mandatory duties. It notes that the Plaintiff did not dispute that MSHA conducted the required six regular quarterly\n   inspections of the Mine and that the inspectors inspected the working areas of the mines as determined by the active operation of the Mine at the time of the inspections. To the extent that an area of the mine was not inspected, the Defendant contends that the mine operator failed to maintain current maps and information reflecting all active working sections of the mine. The Amended Complaint alleges the following specific mandatory violations of inspection procedures:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   19. The findings of the MSHA investigation were breathtaking. Inspectors from MSHA violated certain mandatory regulations which created, maintained, or contributed to unsafe working conditions including, but not limited to, those violations identified in the March 6, 2012 Internal Review of MSHA's actions at [the Mine], which is incorporated by reference. A copy of the MSHA Internal Review is attached as Exhibit C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   20. Plaintiff alleges, and according to the MSHA Internal Review:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. In violation of the General Coal Mine inspection procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook, some areas of the Mine were not inspected during each of the six regular inspections reviewed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   B. The inspector who traveled to EP-LW3 on March 10, 2010 took [only] two of the three air readings required for that location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   C. In violation of Standard Operating Procedures and District 4 guidance, ROE (\"right of entry\") trainees conducted inspection activity, apart from ARs (Authorized Representatives of the Secretary), for portions of five of the six regular inspections at [the Mine] during the review period. Some of the inspection activities conducted by ROE trainees involved areas mandated by the Mine Act to be inspected by ARs, such as air courses and seals. A ROE trainee inspected some of the 1 North Longwall face equipment on March 15, 2010, while the AR remained on the headgate side of the longwall panel. Also during the review period, ROE trainees conducted inspections (apart from ARs) of seals, return air courses, a conveyor belt entry, a shop, surface equipment, SCSRs, and explosives storage magazines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   D. For each regular inspection reviewed by the Internal Review team, and in violation of Uniform Mine File Procedures Handbook, one or more inspectors or specialists did not review or did not document reviewing the UMF (Uniform Mine File) prior to inspecting at [the Mine].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   E. In violation of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook, an inspector arrived at [the Mine] on a Saturday after the start of the day shift but did not travel underground during the first regular inspection of fiscal 2009. Another MSHA inspector did not visit the Mine until 19 days later, when the lead inspector arrived before the start of the shift and traveled underground with the mantrip. During the first regular inspection of fiscal 2010, an electrical specialist and a health specialist arrived at the Mine after the shift's starting time on the first day of the inspection to inspect the AMS (atmospheric monitoring system) and respirable dust parameters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   F. Inspectors violated the provisions of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook requiring mine visits on all working shifts during one of the six regular inspections reviewed. During the third regular inspection for fiscal 2009, inspectors did not inspect the Mine on evening shift.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   G. In violation of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook inspectors did not consistently conduct or document conducting the following activities:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   i. Inspect fire protection equipment, first aid equipment, potable water, escapeway maps, and sanitary facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ii. Hold health and safety discussions with miners on every working section. During three inspections, inspectors did not conduct or document conducting health and safety discussions on any of the sections. During the other three inspections, inspectors documented conducting these discussions underground on one to four of the working sections. Two inspectors interviewed indicated that they held their health and safety discussions with miners on the surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   iii. Check for imminent dangers in working places every time they inspected a working section. Inspectors sometimes went to a section to terminate a citation(s) or to inspect equipment or other items on the section, but they did not check for imminent dangers as directed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   iv. Observe or document observing the entire mining cycle on some working sections during the first five regular inspections of the review period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   v. Document the location of the last open crosscut on the working sections that had advanced since their last inspection visit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   vi. Inspect all SCSRs carried or stored on working sections, as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   a. Inspect any SCSRs (self-contained self-rescue device) carried by miners on each working section during two of the six inspections. Only some of the SCSRs carried by miners were checked during two other inspections. During one inspection some SCSRs were inspected by a ROE trainee while he was apart from the AR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   b. Inspect the SCSRs stored on the longwall section during the fourth regular inspection for fiscal 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   c. Consistently document the manufacturer, model, and serial numbers of SCSRs on working sections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   H. In violation of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook, Inspectors did not travel with or document traveling with at least one preshift, one on-shift, and one weekly examiner during three of the six inspections in the review period. During the first regular inspection for fiscal 2009, inspectors did not travel with or document traveling with a preshift examiner. During the fourth regular inspection for fiscal 2009, inspectors did not document traveling with a preshift or weekly examiner. During the first regular inspection for fiscal 2010, inspectors did not document traveling with an on-shift examiner. While inspectors traveled areas of the Mine with Operator representatives, the inspectors did not document that these persons were conducting examinations or that they were mine examiners. Inspectors also did not consistently document the examiners' names in their inspection notes as required by the Handbook. During the first regular inspection for fiscal 2009, an inspector did not document the name of the on-shift examiner he accompanied. During the second regular inspection for fiscal 2009, inspectors did not document the names of any of the examiners they accompanied. During the first regular\n   inspection of fiscal 2010, an inspector did not document the name of the preshift examiner he accompanied. The inspector traveling with a preshift examiner during the second regular inspection for fiscal 2010 did not document the examiner's name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I. Inspectors did not always follow the instructions related to gas detectors in the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook. District 4 personnel did not inspect a representative number of gas detectors in use at [the Mine]. During the 6 regular inspections of the review period, inspectors documented examining a total of 13 gas detectors at the Mine. Only 3 of the 13 gas detectors examined were being used by mine examiners. Inspectors documented examining four gas detectors during one regular inspection, the most of any inspection in the review period. For the second regular inspection of fiscal 2010, there was no documentation to indicate that any detectors were examined. Inspectors did not always document a means to identify gas detectors, such as the Operator's identification number or manufacturer's serial number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   J. Inspectors did not document that they examined all required records and postings during the other four regular inspections in the review period. Only a few of the individual records or postings were listed in the notes as having been inspected, as directed. Some inspectors documented in the ITS (inspection tracking system) that they examined several records and postings but did not document doing so in their notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   K. In violation of the Handbook directive to check records back to the end of the previous regular inspection, inspectors were not consistent in their review of past records. Although the Handbook directed them to check records back to the end of the previous regular inspection, inspectors stated they would check the record books but only back to the start of the current inspection, to the beginning of the current record book, or for the past few days or weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   L. District 4 inspectors did not inspect the [the Mine] explosives storage facilities during the third regular inspection for fiscal 2009.

Inspectors did not consistently inspect or document inspecting some surface items, areas, and equipment in either in their notes or in the listing provided in the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   N. In violation of the General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook and other Agency directives, inspectors did not always comply with the instructions for documenting in their notes their inspection activities and the areas and equipment they inspected during each of the six regular inspections. Required information that inspectors did not always document in their inspection notes includes the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   i.

Checking for imminent dangers when inspecting the working places on each working section\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ix. A statement such as \"No Violations Observed\" or \"NVO\" after they inspected an area or item and did not observe any violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   O. Inspectors sometimes did not include a statement such as \"No Imminent Dangers Observed\" or \"NIDO\" when they inspected working places and did not observe an imminent danger.

Many pages of notes were not dated as required. Some notes did not have any dates, while other notes listed incorrect dates. The General Information Cover Sheets for three of the six regular inspections were not completed as directed by the Handbook or contained errors. Three of the Cover Sheets had missing or incorrect dates, two had other missing information, and one had an incorrect event number. The Daily Cover Sheet for three days also included the incorrect event number. Inspectors rarely listed shift and shift type on the Daily Cover Sheet to show the shift during which they were inspecting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. The General Coal Mine Inspection Procedures and Inspection Tracking System Handbook directs inspectors to document certain inspection activities in the appropriate section of the ITS.

Unlike the inspectors in\n   <em>\n    Bernaldes\n   </em>\n   , who were found to have discretion in determining where there was a sufficient \"danger of falling,\" the Plaintiff in this case alleges that the violations in question are beyond the scope of discretion and run afoul of required procedures when conducting an inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In doing so, the Court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Here, the FAA has determined that a program of \"spot-checking\" manufacturers'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   compliance with minimum safety standards best accommodates the goal of air transportation safety and the reality of finite agency resources. Judicial intervention in such decisionmaking through private tort suits would require the courts to \"second-guess\" the political, social, and economic judgments of an agency exercising its regulatory function. It was precisely this sort of judicial intervention in policymaking that the discretionary function exception was designed to prevent. It follows that the acts of FAA employees in executing the \"spot-check\" program in accordance with agency directives are protected by the discretionary function exception as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208166\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Varig\n   </em>\n   , this case does not involve second guessing\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   inspections are conducted or how the agency used its discretion (i.e. \"spot checking\"). This Plaintiff alleges the Defendant failed to follow the required procedures which govern the inspections. Clearly, the Plaintiff has alleged that the Defendant did not retain discretion in where, when, and the manner in which it conducted certain inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Holbrook v. United States\n   </em>\n   , an inspector made the decision to certify the airworthiness of an aircraft under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2021.183\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) governing imported aircraft, rather than under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2021.183\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which governed \"other\" aircraft.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n    673 F.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiff brought suit against the United States under the FTCA, alleging that he suffered financial harm as a result of the FAA's negligence in issuing an airworthiness certificate under section (c) as opposed to section (d).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court found that the plain language of the regulation indicated that the inspector accurately assessed the airworthiness of the aircraft.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that case, the plaintiff cited guidance from an FAA order which established that the inspector should have relied on \u00a7 21.183(d).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n    at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction based on the discretionary function exception. The appellate court noted that each of the two regulations were potentially applicable and the inspector made a judgment call about which one to follow. In doing so, he exercised his discretion and was protected by the discretionary function exception, because \"if a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the employee obeys the direction, the Government will be protected because the action will be deemed in furtherance of the policies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740811\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/341/\">\n    at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In dicta, the Fourth Circuit further opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   What is more, the Order's internal guidance to FAA employees is insufficient to establish a mandatory requirement such that the exercise of discretion was removed from the task at hand. If select passages from a lengthy and complex order could serve as the basis for government tort liability, the FAA would be hobbled by the specter of litigation as it worked to promote aircraft safety. The price of circulating internal guidance should not be an exponential increase in exposure to a tort suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, there is no conflicting guidance that the inspectors relied on in their inspection of the mine. In\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   , the inspector made a choice to rely on one regulation when another may have also been applicable. This scenario squarely falls within the purview of the discretionary function exception, since the inspector was required to use discretion in determining which regulation best applied. Based on this Court's review of the facts pled in the Amended Complaint, the MSHA IR, and the Defendant's legal memorandum in the present case, there does not appear to be any conflicting guidance relied on by the inspectors when allegedly\n   choosing not to follow mandatory inspection procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Lastly, the Court can easily distinguish the facts in\n   <em>\n    Indem.

In that case, the owners and operators of a double pontoon vessel sued the United States seeking to recover damages they had paid to settle personal injury and death claims resulting from the capsizing of the vessel. As plaintiffs, the owners and operators claimed that the United States Coast Guard had certified the vessel to carry no more than twenty-five passengers when, if the stability proof test had been performed correctly, the vessel would have been certified to carry no more than fifteen passengers. The district court dismissed the action based on the discretionary function exception and the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Marine Safety Manual in question in\n   <em>\n    Indem. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   \"outlined recommended procedures\" and a \"recommended testing methodology\" for conducting the stability proof test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661095\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661095\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/175/\">\n    at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no mandatory language set forth in the manual of how the test was to be conducted. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit held that the discretionary function exception was applicable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661095\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661095\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/175/\">\n    181-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Memorandum in Support of the Mot. of the U.S. to Dismiss pg. 5 n2). Specifically, the Defendant argues the primary responsibility for safety in the mine remains with the mine operator, not MSHA and that therefore, MSHA is not to be considered an insurer for mine safety.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481716\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/187/#p192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The one-count complaint relies exclusively on West Virginia negligence law and West Virginia's Wrongful Death Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2055-7-6\">\n    W.
