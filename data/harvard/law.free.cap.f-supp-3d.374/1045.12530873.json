Thereafter, BP delivered the document to the Corps, which adopted it and submitted it to the Services for consultation. The Court concludes that the March 2017 BE is therefore not an agency document for purposes of the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Corps makes two arguments that the March 2017 BE is-despite its origin-an agency document for purposes of FOIA. First, the Corps argues that \"once the Corps adopted the March 2017 BE as its own document\" all connections between\n   BP and its consultant \"were severed.\" Def.'s Reply, docket no. 22 at 4. However, the Corps has not identified a single case in which an agency's \"adoption\" transforms a third-party document into a federal agency-created document.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536288\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/698/#p700\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Martin Supplemental Decl. \u00b6 3.

As a result, the March 2017 BE is not a federal agency document subject to exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Corp.'s second argument relies on the so-called \"consultant corollary,\" a judicially-created rule that treats certain third-party documents as agency documents for purposes of FOIA.

The Corps has offered no evidence that the consultant did not represent an interest of its own or the interest of BP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although the Corps has its own, neutral interests in the consultation and participated in the creation of the BE by directing the consultant to make certain edits earlier in the process, the Corps made no changes to the March 2017 version that it received from BP and transmitted to the Services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martin Supplemental Decl. \u00b6 3 (describing how the Corps \"directed modification\" of earlier versions of the BE, adopted the version received in April 2017, and \"then submitted the BE directly to the Services\"); Martin Decl. \u00b6 7 (explaining that the Corps \"received from the applicant [BP] a revised version of the BE\" and transmitted that version to the Services without describing any intervening revisions or changes).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Corps relies on numerous cases in which courts have found records exempt under the consultant-corollary of Exemption 5.
