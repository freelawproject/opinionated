This Court has jurisdiction to review Meadowvale's denial of Marquez's claim under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 et seq. Oral argument is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Iowa L.R. 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Avera, a South Dakota nonprofit corporation that operates a hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, filed its complaint (Doc. No. 1) on February 12, 2018. After I denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the parties submitted merits briefs (Doc. Nos. 27, 40, 47) and filed a joint administrative record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. Nos. 22, 40-1. This matter is now ready for a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan is a self-insured employee benefits plan. Doc. No. 17 at \u00b6 3. Meadowvale, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Rock Valley, Iowa, sponsored the Plan on December 1, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6; Doc. No. 17-3. The Plan was subsequently amended and restated on February 10, 2016, with an effective date of December 1, 2015. Doc. Nos. 17 at \u00b6 6; Doc. No. 17-1; Doc. No. 17-2. The Plan is\n   intended to qualify as a welfare benefit plan under ERISA. Doc. No 17-3 at 2. Under the terms of the Plan,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A full-time Employee of the Employer who regularly works 30 or more hours per week will be eligible for coverage under this Plan once he/she completes a waiting period of 60 days from the date he or she completes at least one hour of service with the Employer. Participation in the Plan will begin as of the first day of the month following completion of the waiting period provided all required election and enrollment forms are properly submitted to the Plan Administrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doc. No. 17 at \u00b6 7. Coverage begins \"as of the first day of the month following completion of the waiting period provided all required election and enrollment forms are properly submitted to the Plan administrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Marquez was employed by Meadowvale from September 30, 2015, until January 2016, when he began receiving treatment for Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rapid-onset muscle weakness disease that ultimately left Marquez paralyzed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Marquez was treated at Avera, where he incurred medical expenses in the amount of $ 760,713.45, excluding interest, prior to his death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. As a full-time employee of Meadowvale, Marquez enrolled in the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. As a result, the Plan submitted payment for some of Marquez' medical expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While Marquez was being treated, it was discovered that he was an undocumented immigrant and that he had enrolled in the Plan using a false name and social security number. On April 12, 2016, the Administrator - through Meadowvale CFO Nathan Jansen - sent Marquez a letter stating \"effective May 13 your coverage under the Plan will be rescinded retroactive to 9/30/15.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. The proffered reason for rescinding coverage was that Marquez had falsely misrepresented his identity to Meadowvale. Doc. No. 13-1 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plan permits rescission of coverage on the following terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Termination of Employee Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Coverage under the Plan will terminate on the earliest of the following dates:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) The end of the month in which you cease to be eligible for coverage under the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) The end of the month in which you terminate employment or cease to be included in an eligible class of Employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) The date you (or any person seeking coverage on your behalf) performs an act, practice or omission that constitutes fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (7) The date you (or any person seeking coverage on your behalf) makes an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Doc.

In such cases, the Plan will provide at least 30 days advance written notice to the individual affected before coverage will be retroactively terminated. As provided above, coverage may be retroactively terminated in cases where required employee contributions have not been paid by the applicable deadline. In those\n   cases, no advance written notice is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223352\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/934/#p945\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Avera is the assignee of Marquez' rights under the Plan.

An assignment of benefits by a Covered Person to a provider will not constitute appointment of that provider as an authorized representative. To appoint such a representative, the Covered Person must complete a form which can be obtained from the Plan Administrator or the Third-Party Administrator. However, in connection with a claim involving urgent care, the Plan will permit a health care professional with knowledge of the Covered Person's medical condition to act as the Covered Person's authorized representative without completion of this form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   AR 48. Avera responded on September 12, 2016, with a copy of the Assignment as well as all other documents referenced above, arguing that it did in fact have authorization to request the documentation on behalf of Marquez.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Administrator denied that the Assignment was valid or enforceable, it produced the documents on September 30, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n    at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is a dispute as to whether the production of documents was timely. Nevertheless, Avera submitted an appeal to the Administrator within the Plan's 180-day deadline on October 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n    at 2-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Meadowvale denied the appeal on October 31, 2016, and denied a secondary appeal on December 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to the denial of benefits appeal decision, authored by Meadowvale CEO Sjerp Ysselstein, Avera's appeal was denied for three reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   First, Avera has no right to pursue this appeal because it is not an authorized representative of Mr. Marquez/Fuentes. An authorized representative is one who \"has been authorized to act\n   <strong>\n    on behalf of a claimant\n   </strong>\n   ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) (emphasis added). The Plan states that assignment of benefits to a medical provider does not constitute appointment of that provider as an authorized representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meadowvale Dairy Employee Benefit Plan, Plan Document and Summary Plan Description p. 57. Instead, the Covered Person must complete a form to designate an authorized representative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since no form was completed, Avera is not authorized to act on behalf of Mr. Marquez/Fuentes or his estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the assignment that Avera has submitted as part of this appeal is not valid. It was not signed by Mr. Marquez/Fuentes, and the person who allegedly signed it on his behalf did not have the power to do so. The power of attorney submitted by Avera in support of this assignment was limited to health care decisions only, and was only effective if Mr. Marquez/Fuentes was \"unable, in the judgment of [his] attending physician, to make ... health care decisions.\" Further, Meadowvale believes this power of attorney is invalid under Iowa law because it was witnessed by an Avera employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa Code. Ann. \u00a7 144B.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the appeal is denied because Mr. Marquez/Fuentes submitted a false name and social security number to Meadowvale. The Plan specifically states that coverage will be terminated on the date that an employee \"performs an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud\" or \"makes an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meadowvale Dairy Employee Benefit Plan,\n   Plan Document and Summary plan Description p. 21. Retroactive rescission under these circumstances is permitted under federal law. 45 C.F.R. 147.128(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Marquez/Fuentes' lack of proper documentation also means that Meadowvale could not have legally employed him. As the Meadowvale Dairy Employee Benefit Plan only covers employees of Meadowvale, it is clear that Mr. Marquez/Fuentes made an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact that constitutes fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Doc. No. 18-3 at 1-2. The resolution of the second appeal, authored by Ysselsteins' wife, Natalie Ysselstein, was substantially identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to the Plan's provisions, the Plan was required to follow these procedures in resolving an appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Internal Review of Initially Denied Claims\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   If you submit a claim for Plan benefits and it is initially denied ... you may request a review of that denial under the procedures described below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   You have 180 days after you receive notice of an initial adverse determination within which to request a review of the adverse determination. For a request for a second level appeal, you have 60 days after you receive notice of an adverse determination at the first level of appeal to request a second level appeal of the adverse determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If you request a review of an adverse determination within the applicable time period, the review will meet the following requirements:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) The Plan will provide a review that does not afford deference to the adverse determination that is being appealed and that is conducted by an appropriate named fiduciary of the Plan who did not make the adverse determination that is the subject of the appeal and who is not a subordinate of the individual who made that adverse determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (4) The reviewer will afford you an opportunity to review and receive, without charge, all relevant documents, information and records relating to the claim and to submit issues and comments relating to the claim in writing to the Plan. The reviewer will take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim regardless of whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (5) You will be provided, free of charge, any new or additional evidence or rationale considered, relied upon or generated by the Plan in connection with the claim. Such evidence or rationale will be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the Plan's deadline for providing notice of its determination on review to give you a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to such determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (6) The Plan will ensure that all claims are adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the person involved in making the decisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (7) The Plan will provide you with continued coverage pending the outcome of an internal appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Doc.

Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Avera argues for a less-deferential standard of review because of a \"serious procedural irregularity in the Plan's decision-making progress.\" Doc. No. 27 at 12. Specifically, Avera argues that the internal appeal of Marquez' denial of benefits was tainted by the fact that there was a close relationship between the three people who reviewed and denied Marquez' application for benefits (first the company CFO, then the company's CEO, and then the CEO's wife), and that the second level of review consisted of nothing more than \"copy[ing] and past[ing] the first appeal into the second appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13, see also Doc. No. 19 at 5 (\"The resolution of the second appeal was substantially identical.\"). According to Avera, the close relationship between the reviewers meant that Marquez did not receive a \"full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination\" as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(3)(ii). Meadowvale responds, with various arguments related to its internal procedures, its stop-loss insurance policy and the availability of outside review of its plan, that there was no conflict of interest resolving Marquez's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ultimately, the conflict of interest and procedural irregularity do not require that I review Meadowvale's decision under a less-deferential standard. Instead, the conflict, if it exists, must \"be weighed as a 'factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion' \" in denying the claim benefit.\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Life Ins.

First, an inherent \"conflict of interest exists whenever the plan administrator is also the employer or insurance company which ultimately pays benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Standard Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5657905\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/825/#p830\">\n    559 F.3d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (8th Cir. 2009). Meadowvale argues that the fact it is the administrator and the responsible party in this case does\n   not require a finding that there is a conflict of interest because \"[h]ad the Plan Administrator determined that Marquez's claim for benefits should be allowed, Meadowvale LLC could still make a separate and independent determination of whether to fund benefits.\" Doc. No. 40 at 24. This argument is nonsensical - the fact that Meadowvale could choose not to pay benefits despite a duty to do so under its Plan does not mitigate this conflict. Instead, it demonstrates the reason courts have held that companies like Meadowvale are inherently conflicted. Meadowvale's arguments involving stop-loss insurance coverage that would limit its liability to the deductible (and thus its motive to provide less-than-adequate review of claims for benefits) similarly does not demonstrate that Meadowvale complied with its duty to provide a \"full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, the administrative record itself raises questions as to whether Marquez received a full and fair review of his claim. Meadowvale does not address Avera's argument that the initial denial (by CFO Jensen) was reviewed by his superior, CEO Ysselstein, and that the second level of review was conducted by Mr. Ysselstein's wife. Nor has Meadowvale addressed the fact that Mrs. Ysselstein's written review of the claim consisted of nothing more than copy-pasting Mr. Ysselstein's written review of the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(3)(ii) requires plan administrators to \"provide for review that does not afford deference to the initial adverse benefit determination and that is conducted by [a] ... fiduciary ... who is neither the individual who made the adverse benefit determination that is the subject of the appeal, nor the subordinate of such individual.\" The close relationship between those who issued the adverse benefits decision in this case, combined with the fact that the second-level review was clearly not de novo, raise an inference that the conflict of interest affected the decision-making process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Meadowvale also attempts to argue that its plan administrators - Jensen and the Ysselsteins - would not have rendered a decision tainted by a conflict of interest because \"any administrator would have known, during internal review, that any decision\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be appealed externally,\" through the state of Iowa's external review process. Doc. No. 40 at 23. However, this external review process is not mandatory under either the regulations or the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 C.F.R. 2560.503-1(c)(2) (\"The claims procedure of a group health plan will be deemed to be reasonable only if ... the claims procedures do not contain any provision, and are not administered in a way, that requires a claimant to file more than two appeals of an adverse benefit determination prior to bringing a civil action.\"). Meadowvale cannot rely on a voluntary, external procedure to comply with its responsibilities under federal law for providing a fair internal procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Simply put, a conflict of interest exists in this case. I will consider this conflict and the effect it may have had on Marquez' benefit determination when deciding whether Meadowvale abused its discretion in denying benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Standing (Again)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the second time, Meadowvale asks me to address Avera's standing to bring this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40 at 36-53. Much of Meadowvale's arguments repeat the same issues I have addressed. Nevertheless, I will (briefly) address each of Meadowvale's arguments related to standing and exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. The Assignment was not properly executed.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Meadowvale argues that Avera does not have standing because the Assignment\n   was not properly executed by Marquez, and that I should give deference to the Plan Administrator's finding of fact on that issue. As discussed above, the Assignment was signed \"Juan Pablo x GM.\" Doc. No. 17-4 at 4. Avera represented to Meadowvale that the Assignment was executed by Graciela \"as [Marquez'] attorney in fact. Doc. No. 18-1 at 23. Meadowvale denied Avera's right to pursue the internal appeal because it believed the Assignment was \"not valid\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   It was not signed by Mr. Marquez/Fuentes, and the person who allegedly signed it on his behalf did not have the power to do so. The power of attorney submitted by Avera in support of this assignment was limited to health care decisions only, and was only effective if Mr. Marquez/Fuentes was \"unable, in the judgment of [his] attending physician, to make ... health care decisions.\" Further, Meadowvale believes this power of attorney is invalid under Iowa law because it was witnessed by an Avera employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 144B.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Doc. No. 18-3 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, as it weighs on the issue of standing, Meadowvale's findings as to the proper execution of the Assignment are not entitled to deference. Standing is an issue of jurisdiction. Meadowvale cannot avoid jurisdiction over this case by interpreting the law to deprive an adverse party of standing. Second, as it relates to the issue of the merits determination in this case, Meadowvale is not entitled to deference in its determination that the Assignment was not properly executed, as this question is not within the scope of discretion granted to it under the Plan. Whether an assignment of a cause of action was properly executed is not an issue of Plan interpretation, nor is it a fact related to Marquez' eligibility for benefits. See Doc. No. 17-1 at 69 (grant of discretion). Rather, the proper execution of the Assignment is a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Even if this were an area in which Meadowvale were afforded deference, the finding that the Assignment was not properly executed is not supported by substantial evidence. Meadowvale deemed the Assignment improperly executed because Graciela was appointed Marquez'\n   <em>\n    medical\n   </em>\n   power of attorney, an appointment that does not include authorization to make non-medical decisions. However, a \"power of attorney\" is not the only source of authority for one person to sign a contract (such as the Assignment) on behalf of another. If Graciela signed the Assignment at Marquez' direction, she was acting as his agent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A fundamental principle of agency law is that whatever an agent does, within the scope of his or her actual authority, binds the principal. In addition, all acts and contracts of an agent, which are within the apparent scope of authority conferred on him or her, are also binding upon the principal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Magnusson Ag. v.

Although Avera informed Meadowvale that the Assignment was signed by Graciela \"both at the direction of her son, Mr. Marquez, and pursuant to the Power of Attorney,\" Doc. No. 18-1, Meadowvale did not acknowledge that by signing the Assignment at Marquez' direction, Graciela (the agent) was acting with both the express and actual authority of Marquez (the principal).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3.01 (2006) (\"Actual authority, as defined in \u00a7 2.01, is created by a principal's manifestation to an agent that, as reasonably understood by the\n   agent, expresses the principal's assent that the agent take action on the principal's behalf.\"). \"A plan administrator abuses its discretion when it ignores relevant evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilcox v.

This argument against Avera's standing to bring the case fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. The Assignment only conveyed an interest in an unmatured cause of action, which was never properly exhausted.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Meadowvale next argues that Avera does not have standing because, at the time of the Assignment, Marquez did not have a \"cause of action\" to assign to Avera for ERISA benefits, as the Plan's remedies had not yet been exhausted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). Meadowvale claims that the \"cause of action\" Marquez conveyed never accrued as Marquez died before his claim was exhausted and Avera could not exhaust Marquez' claim under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40 at 40. Further, Meadowvale contends that under South Dakota law the assignment of an unripe cause of action does not permit the assignee to control litigation of the cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   I have already addressed these issues in a previous ruling. South Dakota does not prohibit assigning the right to a cause of action that arises under a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 19 at 9.

In\n   <em>\n    Chorosevic\n   </em>\n   , the beneficiary failed to file an internal appeal and, as a result, the Plan Administrator did not have an opportunity to reconsider the initial denial of benefits. This case is distinguishable. Although Meadowvale denied Avera's right to pursue administrative exhaustion, Meadowvale nevertheless issued a decision on the merits that Marquez was not entitled to benefits under the plan and allowed Avera to appeal that decision. Further administrative action is unnecessary. This argument against Avera's standing fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

It contends that the Assignment should be interpreted to provide Avera with only a security interest because the Assignment's expressed intent to both convey a security interest and a cause of action are mutually exclusive, thus creating an ambiguity that should be construed against Avera. Finally, Meadowvale contends that a mere security interest does not give Avera the right to pursue this claim against Meadowvale because Avera cannot prove its right to recover an unsatisfied debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Meadowvale's argument on this ground is unsupported. As I have previously stated, \"[t]here is no rule against a single contract granting a lien and assigning a cause of action[,] and it is clear that this particular contract intended to do both.\" Doc. No. 45 at 7. Meadowvale cites no authority prohibiting a contract from conveying multiple types of interests in the alternative. This particular contract unambiguously did so. In effect, the Assignment gave Avera a choice of remedies to collect the payment owed to it in the event that Marquez' medical condition took one of many possible turns.

In\n   <em>\n    Ellenburg\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an ERISA claimant who had lied about his age to obtain early retirement benefits was barred from recovery in a suit brought to gain those same retirement benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373069\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/763/1091/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For several reasons, this case is distinguishable. First, Marquez did not lie about his employment status, as he was in fact an employee. The movant in\n   <em>\n    Ellenburg\n   </em>\n   attempted to obtain a benefit for which he undoubtedly was not eligible due to his age. Second, granting benefits in this case would not allow Marquez to \"gain[ ] from wrongdoing or ... escap[e] its consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Equity\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 126, at 605. The consequences of working without authorization do not include the denial of earned wages or benefits, but rather relate to immigration matters. Finally, applying the clean hands doctrine in cases like this would be contrary to public policy requiring employers to not violate employment law as to undocumented workers. The clean hands doctrine does not bar recovery in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Merits of the Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Avera's claim to benefits turns on whether Marquez was an \"employee\" of Meadowvale, and whether his alleged fraud - submitting a false social security number because he did not have permission to work in the United States - cancelled his status as an employee. For the following reasons, I find that Meadowvale's decision to rescind benefits plainly violated the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, the language of the plan clearly establishes that Marquez is an employee. \"Ordinarily, courts are to enforce the plain language of an ERISA plan 'in accordance with its literal and natural meaning.' \"\n   <em>\n    Admin.

In that case, the ERISA plan at issue was a life insurance plan. As Judge Zoss explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   An employee of Tur-Pak known to the company as Juan Alberto Chavez (\"Chavez\") enrolled in the Plan effective May 1, 2003. On the enrollment form, \"Chavez\" listed his Social Security Number as XXX- XX-XXXX, and his date of birth as September 30, 1980.

On October 22, 2003, Garcia-Moreno filed a claim under the Plan for $ 15,000 in life insurance benefits arising from the death of Orlando Garcia. On the \"Life Claim Report\" form, Garcia- Moreno stated his son was known to Tur-Pak as \"Juan Alberto Chavez.\" Great-West's records indicated a \"Juan Chavez\" was eligible for a $ 15,000 life insurance benefit.

The undisputed evidence showed that the employee who worked at Tur-Pak under the name of Juan Alberto Chavez was actually Orlando Garcia, \"an illegal alien who used false identification documents belonging to Chavez, an Hispanic male of about his same age, to work in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"567450\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/402/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"567450\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/402/1031/\">\n    at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the fact that Garcia used a false name and social security number to gain employment, and thus to acquire coverage under the life insurance plan, Judge Zoss found that \"[t]he [denial] decision was not supported by substantial evidence, but instead, was reached at the behest of the employer to avoid setting a 'precedent.' \" Thus, he concluded that the Plan \"abused its discretion when it denied the plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"567450\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/402/1031/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Based on the record before me, and in light of Meadowvale's conflict of interest, the same conclusion is mandated here. Marquez' use of false identification information to obtain employment was not an intentional misrepresentation of\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fact that would justify the retroactive termination of coverage under the Plan. Regardless of his true identify, Marquez was an employee of Meadowvale and, therefore, was entitled to coverage under the Plan. Meadowvale used the fortuity of Marquez' immigration status to avoid expense, not to remedy actual harm caused by a material misrepresentation. Its decision to deny benefits and retroactively rescind coverage was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI.
