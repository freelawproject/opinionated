According to South Carolina's WTA system, voters in South Carolina cast their ballot for either of \"the\n   candidates for President and Vice President of each political party recognized in\" the state. S.C. Code \u00a7 7-19-70. South Carolina then calculates which of the two candidates receives the most votes and delegates each of its nine electoral votes to that candidate. Plaintiffs argue that this dilutes the value of the votes cast for the losing representative, because those votes are not ultimately represented by the electoral votes in the presidential election. For example, South Carolina has not given its nine electoral votes to a Democratic presidential candidate for forty years. In other words, those South Carolina residents who have voted for Democratic candidates for the last forty years have had no electoral votes cast by South Carolina that reflect the vote that they cast for their choice of President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the WTA system violates: (1) the Fourteenth Amendment, as it runs afoul of the one person one vote principle (\"OPOV principle\"); (2) the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as it burdens the freedom of the people to associate and engage in political activity; and (3) section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\"), as it prevents African-American South Carolinians from having their preferred candidate receive any representation among South Carolina's electoral votes.

Plaintiffs claim that the WTA system \"counts votes for a losing presidential candidate in South Carolina only to discard them in determining the Electors who cast votes directly for the presidency.\" Comp. \u00b6 14. In the last five presidential elections, about 40% of South Carolina voters cast votes for a candidate who did not win the popular vote in South Carolina.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that those voters \"effectively had their votes cancelled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs emphasize that they are not contesting the constitutionality of the electoral college as a whole, but rather the method used by South Carolina for choosing how to distribute its electoral votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Supreme Court first foreshadowed the OPOV principle in\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Specifically, the relevant Virginia statute that established the Commonwealth's WTA system provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [t]here shall be chosen by the qualified voters of the Commonwealth, ... so many electors for President and Vice President of the United States as this State shall be entitled to at the time of such election.... Each voter may\n   <em>\n    vote for one elector\n   </em>\n   from each congressional district of the state ... and for two electors from the State at large.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Va. \u00a7 24-7 (emphasis added). Virginia's system provided for the election of individual electors; after the votes regarding all electors from each district were tallied, Virginia would see which party got the most votes and, in essence, transform the process into a WTA system and give all of the electoral votes to the winning candidate/party. By contrast, S.C. Code \u00a7 7-19-70 provides that the \"names of candidates for electors ... shall not be printed on the\n   ballot.\" Rather, \"in place of their names ... there shall be printed on the ballot the names of the candidates for President and Vice President of each political party recognized in this State.\" The statute specifically states that a \"vote for the candidates named on the ballot shall be a vote for the electors of the party by which those candidates were nominated.\" The court finds it irrelevant that the Virginia statute allowed its citizens to vote for a particular elector rather than the candidate, because the electors in Virginia were aligned with one of the two parties, and the Commonwealth ultimately gave 100% of its electoral college votes to the candidate of the party that had the most electors chosen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ultimately, the question of one person one vote depends upon whether an electoral system unfairly elevates one person's vote over another. The court agrees with the other district courts that have recently considered this issue and finds that the WTA system \"complies with equal protection because it does not inherently favor or disfavor a particular group of voters.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyman v. Baker\n   </em>\n   , 1:18-cv-10327, ECF No. 52 at 15. As the District of Massachusetts aptly summarized, the \"WTA system [ ] sets the stakes, but it does not help or hurt one group's chances of winning the [state's] electors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. While the outcome is not as proportional to the citizens' choices as plaintiffs might like, \"[t]o the extent that the plaintiffs desire nevertheless to invalidate this system and establish a proportionate one, that is not something this court is empowered to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Since Williams in 1968, the Supreme Court has further developed the OPOV principle. Williams seemed to indicate that the Supreme Court foreclosed any actions against the WTA system based on the Fourteenth Amendment. However, plaintiffs argue that, since Williams, Supreme Court jurisprudence on election law has developed to such an extent that there are new standards that should be relied upon to determine whether any election process-including the system for choosing Electors-violates the OPOV principle. The expansion of the OPOV principle in various election law cases reached its pinnacle in\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    531 U.S. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). In\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the manner in which Florida recounted some of its contested ballots for the presidential election was unconstitutional because the recounting process was arbitrary and resulted in disparate treatment of votes. The court found that \"[w]hen the legislature vests the right to vote for president in its people, the right to vote as the legislature has prescribed is fundamental; and one source of its fundamental nature lies in the equal weight accorded to each vote and equal dignity owed to each voter.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    531 U.S. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the state of South Carolina has vested the right of each voter to cast a vote for a specific presidential candidate and as such, each person's vote is entitled to equal weight. The real question then becomes what it means for \"equal weight\" to be accorded to each vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There are, in reality, two stages of the presidential election process when using a WTA system. First, the citizens of each state cast their vote for a particular candidate, party, or elector who in essence represents a particular candidate. The second stage requires the state to determine which candidate the majority of its citizens voted for and then allocate however many electoral votes it has in favor of the candidate that received the majority of votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   indicated that according \"equal weight\" to each vote means that the literal ballot cast by a voter in stage one of the presidential election process be treated exactly the same as every other ballot cast in stage one. Notably,\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   did not involve a claim against Florida's system for allocating electoral votes; rather, it involved the manner in which a Florida treated the votes of individual citizens before the state even chose how to allocate its electoral votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This differs from the issue currently presented before this court-whether the OPOV principle requires that equal weight be given to each vote during stage two of the election process. Plaintiffs make compelling arguments based on logic and public policy, and even create an enticing legal argument for extending the principles of\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   and other election law cases to the context of WTA systems for the electoral college. While the court recognizes that the plaintiffs' arguments have some merit, it will not extend the principles of\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   to a factually distinct scenario, particularly given the unique nature of the electoral college system. The court leaves it to the Supreme Court to determine whether it wishes to extend\n   <em>\n    Bush v. Gore\n   </em>\n   's reasoning to find that South Carolina's WTA system of apportioning its electoral college votes violates the constitutional rights of South Carolinians to have their vote for president be accorded \"equal weight\" and \"equal dignity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Right to Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, plaintiffs allege that the WTA system \"poses a severe burden on plaintiffs' rights to associate and to effectively express their political preference through voting that is not outweighed by any legitimate state interest,\" and as such violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Comp. \u00b6 115. The court acknowledges that it is \"beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the 'liberty' assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n for Advancement of Colored People v.

Regarding the right of association, the plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that the rights of voters to associate in any manner or to engage in any political activity or association have actually been burdened. Rather, plaintiffs merely allege that the inability of Democratic voters in South Carolina to succeed in having any electoral votes distributed to a Democratic presidential candidate for the past forty years has dampened the likelihood that they will engage in political activity, as it appears useless. This argument conflates a diminishing\n   <em>\n    motivation\n   </em>\n   to participate with a severe burden on the actual\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   of people to participate in the voting process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Tashjian v.

That case differs significantly from the system for electing a President established by our Constitution. The parties have not provided any cases in which a court has questioned the WTA system under a freedom of association theory.

Voting Rights Act, Section 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs argue that the WTA system results in the denial or abridgement of the voting rights of African-American South Carolinians on account of race or color, in violation of \u00a7 2 of the VRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 2 provides that: \"[No] standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State [ ] in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the Right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The VRA states that a violation of this statute will be established if the election process is \"not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Supreme Court set out the following three-part test for bringing a successful \u00a7 2 claim: (1) \"the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\"; (2) \"the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive\"; and (3) \"the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc enable it ... to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornburg v.

Plaintiffs have argued that the vast majority of African-American voters in South Carolina identify as Democrats, and that because Democrats have not had any electoral votes cast for their preferred candidate in forty years, the African-American community in South Carolina has not had any votes cast for its preferred candidate in forty years. However, as discussed above, the WTA system does not mean that the political process is \"not equally open to\n   <em>\n    participation\n   </em>\n   by\" Democratic voters, whether they be African-American or of another race.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).
