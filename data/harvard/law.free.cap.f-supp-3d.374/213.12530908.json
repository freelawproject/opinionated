D'Agostino, U.S. District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action against Defendants Kathleen A. Peters and Auto-Owners Insurance Company (\"Auto-Owners\") on July 31, 2018, asserting claims arising from an accident that occurred in Clay, New York on or about September 29, 2016. Peters is the alleged tortfeasor and Auto-Owners is Plaintiffs' insurance carrier for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Before the Court is Defendant Auto-Owners' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendant Peters' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The parties dispute whether Virginia or New York law should apply and whether this district or the Eastern District of Virginia is the proper forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Factually, this case is straightforward. Cory Dix, a resident of Virginia, was involved in a motor-vehicle accident in New York with Kathleen Peters, a resident of New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 11. Auto-Owners is a corporation organized in Michigan, with a principal place of business in Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Auto-Owners provided underinsured motorist coverage to Plaintiffs at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Defendant Peters' liability carrier, USAA Insurance, exhausted her policy limits in settlement of Plaintiff Cory Dix's bodily injury claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs seek to recover uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits from Auto-Owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Procedurally, this case is anomalous because of the application of Virginia law and procedure to the insurance policy while New York law applies to the accident. The case is further complicated by Defendant Peters being a resident of New York, and thus likely not subject to the jurisdiction of a court sitting in Virginia. Defendant Peters argues that if the underinsurance claim were brought under New York law, her participation would not be required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25 at 3. Auto-Owners asserts it has no substantial contact with New York, and Plaintiffs have offered no evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 24 at \u00b6 2. The only basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over Auto-Owners would be on the theory that Auto-Owners' contractual duty to defend extends to New York because the accident occurred in New York and the defendant driver resides in New York. However, because the Court finds that this action cannot proceed against Defendant Peters, the Court finds no basis for the exercise of jurisdiction over Auto-Owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure tests the legal sufficiency of the party's claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane v.

In considering the legal sufficiency, a court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the pleading and draw all reasonable inferences in the pleader's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v.

There is no choice-of-law provision governing the entirety of the insurance contract in this case. However, Part C of the policy, which provides for uninsured motorists coverage, states that Auto-Owners \"will pay, in accordance with Va. Code Ann.

No. 20-5 at 42. This language clearly evinces the intent of the contracting parties that at least the underinsured motorist coverage portion of the policy be governed by Virginia law. Thus, the Court need not conduct a further conflict-of-laws analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ministers and Missionaries Ben. Bd. v.

Virginia Uninsured Motorist Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(F) details the process for recovering uninsured and underinsured coverage benefits. The section provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   If any action is instituted against the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle by any insured intending to rely on the uninsured or underinsured coverage provision or endorsement of this policy under which the insured is making a claim, then the insured shall serve a copy of the process upon this insurer in the manner prescribed by law, as though the insurer were a party defendant. The provisions of \u00a7 8.01-288 shall not be applicable to the service of process required in this subsection. The insurer shall then have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or in its own name. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, the immunity from liability for negligence of the owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall not be a bar to the insured obtaining a judgment enforceable against the insurer for the negligence of the immune owner or operator, and shall not be a defense available to the insurer to the action brought by the insured, which shall proceed against the named defendant although any judgment obtained against an immune defendant shall be entered in the name of \"Immune Defendant\" and shall be enforceable against the insurer and any other nonimmune defendant as though it were entered in the actual name of the named immune defendant. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle from employing counsel of his own choice and taking any action in his own interest in connection with the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Va. Code. \u00a7 38.2-2206(F). The Code further provides that a notice must be issued to any defendant who settles to available liability-insurance limits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Any settlement between the injured person or his personal representative, any insurer providing liability coverage applicable to the claim, and the underinsured motorist described in subsection K shall be in writing, signed by both the injured person or his personal representative and the underinsured motorist, and shall include the following notice to the underinsured motorist, which must be initialed by the underinsured motorist:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"NOTICE TO RELEASED PARTY: Your insurance company has agreed to pay the available limits of its insurance to settle certain claims on your behalf. This settlement secures a full release of you for all claims the claimant/plaintiff has against you arising out of the subject accident, as well as ensures that no judgment can ever be entered against you by the claimant/plaintiff. In order to protect yourself from subrogation by any underinsured motorist insurer, you are agreeing to cooperate with the underinsured motorist benefits insurer(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Under this manner of settlement, the underinsured motorist benefits insurer(s) that is/are involved in this case has/have no right of subrogation against you unless you fail to reasonably cooperate in its/their defense of the claim by not (i) attending your deposition and trial, if subpoenaed, (ii) assisting in responding to discovery, (iii) meeting with defense counsel at reasonable times after commencement of this suit and before your testimony at a deposition and/or trial, and (iv) notifying defense counsel of any change in your address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Upon payment of the agreed settlement amount by your insurance company(ies), such company shall no longer owe you any duties, including the duty to hire and pay for an attorney for you. You are not required to consent to settlement in this manner. If you do not consent to settlement in this manner, your insurance company will still defend you in any lawsuit brought against you by the claimant/plaintiff, but you will not have the protections of a full release from the claimant/plaintiff, judgment could be entered against you and may exceed your available insurance coverage, and any underinsured motorist benefits insurer would have a right of subrogation against you to recover any moneys it pays to the claimant/plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   You are encouraged to discuss your rights and obligations related to settlement in this manner with your insurance company and/or an attorney.

Code. \u00a7 38.2-2206(L). Compliance with Subsection L is a prerequisite to the application of the remainder of this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that the Auto-Owners insurance policy permits them to bring suit against an underinsured motorist as a \"released defendant,\" but only when certain conditions have been met. The relevant section of the Auto-Owners' policy provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   We will pay, in accordance with Va. Code Ann. Section 38.2-2206, damages which an \"insured\" or an \"insured's\" legal representative is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \"uninsured motor vehicle\" or an \"underinsured motor vehicle\" because of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. \"Bodily injury\" sustained by an \"insured\" and caused by an accident; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. \"Property damage\" caused by an accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dkt. No. 23-2 at 43. As this language makes clear, an application for payment of damages relating to a claim involving an \"underinsured motor vehicle\" must follow the procedures outlined in Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-2206.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As discussed, Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 sets forth several conditions that must be met before such a claim can proceed. Specifically, Plaintiffs were required to settle with Defendant Peters for the available limit of her liability coverage, which was done. What Plaintiffs failed to do, however, was execute the settlement in the manner prescribed in the statute. The statute sets forth verbatim the language that is to be used when a plaintiff and the underinsured motorist are settling to the limits of the policy, so that the underinsured motorist is placed on notice that he or she will be required to continue cooperating with the plaintiff's insurance carrier or face possible subrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(L). This compliance entails the underinsured motorist being listed as a \"released defendant,\" attending a deposition and trial, if subpoenaed, assisting in responding to discovery, meeting with defense counsel at reasonable times after commencement of the suit and before any testimony, and notifying defense counsel of any change in address.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131264\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/26/466/#p476\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the present matter, Plaintiffs failed to provide this notice to Defendant Peters and we now find ourselves in the exact\n   position that the required notice is intended to avoid. In the release by USAA, Defendant Peters was released \"from any liability now accrued or hereafter to accrue on account of any and all claims or causes of action which I/we now or may hereafter have for personal injuries, damage to property, loss of services, medical expenses, contribution indemnification, losses of damages of any and every kind or nature whatsoever, now known or unknown or that may hereafter develop, by me/us sustained or received on or about\n   <em>\n    September 29, 2016\n   </em>\n   through\n   <em>\n    an automobile accident\n   </em>\n   [.]\" Dkt. No. 21-2 at 2. No notice of any ongoing obligations was provided to Defendant Peters. Rather, the release unequivocally released Defendant Peters from all further potential liability and responsibilities related to the September 29, 2016 automobile accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Without citation to any authority, Plaintiffs argue that the \"responsibility to secure her consent to settle the liability claim under Virginia law and notify her of her duty to cooperate with Auto-Owners is born solely by her own liability insurance carrier, not the Plaintiffs.\" Dkt. No. 23 at 21. Contrary to Plaintiffs' position, the burden was on Plaintiffs or their counsel to ensure that Defendant Peters was provided with the required notice of her duty to cooperate. It is illogical to suggest that USAA should bear the responsibility to ensure that provisions of the Auto-Owners policy are followed so that Plaintiffs would be afforded the opportunity to collect additional benefits under the Auto-Owners policy. The Auto-Owners policy was a contract between Plaintiffs and Auto-Owners, not USAA and Auto-Owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, the complaint and evidence submitted in support of the motion to dismiss make clear that Plaintiffs did not make their demand to Auto-Owners for underinsured benefits until months after they had settled with Defendant Peters. The complaint alleges that their demand package was first forwarded to Auto-Owners on or about August 1, 2017, yet the release and letter confirming the settlement between Plaintiffs and Defendant Peters are dated March 10, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 22; Dkt. No. 21-2 at 1-2. While Plaintiffs allege that Auto-Owners \"had notice of the accident since December 8, 2016,\" they fail to allege that it was made aware of the possibility that Plaintiffs would be pursuing an underinsured claim under the Auto-Owners policy. Even assuming that the burden was on Auto-Owners to ensure Plaintiffs settled their claim against Defendant Peters in compliance with the Virginia Code (which it was not), notice to Auto-Owners about the existence of this claim would necessarily be required before any such duty would attach. It is axiomatic that only parties to a contract can be bound by that contract. Therefore, without first obtaining Defendant Peters' written consent to proceed with this action with her acting as the released defendant, Defendant Peters is not subject to suit in the present action. The general release that Defendant Peters signed released her from all obligations stemming from the underlying accident. Had Defendant Peters or her insurance carrier known of the extensive continuing obligations that would be placed on Defendant Peters in connection with a forthcoming underinsured motorist claim, they may very well have made a different determination and not settled the case. Unfortunately, Defendant Peters and USAA were not presented with that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Virginia Code, as incorporated into Plaintiffs' auto-insurance policy, the Court finds that Defendant Peters must be dismissed from this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Having no agents or offices in New York, the exercise of jurisdiction over Auto-Owners would impose an undue burden.

It does not follow, however, that by agreeing to defend in the forum, that the insurance company also by implication agrees that it will litigate disputes between it and its insured regarding the terms of an insurance contract in a foreign forum. While it is reasonably foreseeable that an insured would be involved in litigation with a third-party in another forum, it is not necessarily foreseeable that a dispute between the insured and the insurer over an insurance contract prepared, negotiated, and executed pursuant to Virginia law in Virginia with a Virginia domiciliary would be litigated in a foreign forum where the insurer had no contacts related to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Having examined the factors above in their entirety, the Court concludes that to subject Auto-Owners to litigating this matter in New York, which has no genuine interest in the dispute and with which Auto-Owners has only tenuous contacts, would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the notions of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" Accordingly, the Court grants Auto-Owners' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
