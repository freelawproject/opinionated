Specifically, Petitioner argues that the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision invalidates his ACCA sentence because when he was sentenced in 2009, his Georgia convictions for aggravated assault would have qualified as violent felonies under the residual clause of the ACCA. Petitioner also argues that his aggravated assault convictions are not violent felonies under the enumerated offenses clause because assault is not included in that list of crimes. And finally, Petitioner argues that his convictions under the Georgia aggravated assault statute do not qualify as violent felonies under the elements clause. Consequently, Petitioner asserts that he is \"no longer, by law, an armed career criminal because his convictions for aggravated assault no longer qualify as ACCA violent felonies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.

As a result, a \u00a7 2255 motion based on\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   cannot rely on \u00a7 2255(f)(3) as the starting point of the limitations period. Instead, the petitioner must file the \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of one of the other triggering dates set out in \u00a7 2255(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The timeliness of Petitioner's \u00a7 2255 Motion thus hinges on whether he asserts a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim or a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim. If his \u00a7 2255 Motion raises a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim, it is timely; but if it raises a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim, it is not. A\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim and a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim make two distinct and separate assertions. A\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim contends that the defendant was sentenced as an armed career criminal under the residual clause, while a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim asserts that the defendant was incorrectly sentenced under the elements or enumerated offenses clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his \u00a7 2255 Motion, Petitioner relies heavily on the\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   decision in arguing that his Georgia convictions for aggravated assault can no longer qualify as \"violent felonies\" under the elements clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [86]. This is clearly a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim. Petitioner, however, also claims in his \u00a7 2255 Motion that when he was sentenced in 2009, the Court relied on the residual clause to find that his Georgia aggravated assault convictions qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068900\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/769/#p775\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, he contends that the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision requires that he be resentenced without the ACCA enhancement.
