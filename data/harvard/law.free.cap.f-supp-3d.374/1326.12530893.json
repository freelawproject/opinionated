The criminal complaint in this case describes the differing roles the defendants allegedly played in the drug trafficking conspiracy, [Doc. 1], which creates a significant potential conflict of interest from joint representation because each defendant does not stand on equal footing with respect to their potential culpability and opportunity to negotiate a resolution of the pending charges against them. For example, as commonly occurs in conspiracy cases, the government may be willing to offer a favorable plea deal to one or more defendants in return for their cooperation and testimony against co-defendants, and Lee and Bennett could not fulfill their duty to effectively represent all of the defendants by advising one defendant to take a plea deal that would be detrimental to their other clients.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ill. 1989) (citation omitted) (\"When one attorney represents multiple defendants, however, plea bargain negotiations are fraught with danger of conflicts of interests.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lee and Bennett suggest that there is a tactical advantage to joint representation during the pretrial portion of the case so that defendants may more effectively challenge the search warrants used during the investigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 72; Doc. 73 at 7-9], but the very decision of whether to file pretrial motions or pursue a potential plea agreement has very real consequences in this district as the United States Attorney's office regularly reserves the most favorable plea terms for those defendants who do not file pretrial motions. Thus, even the pretrial strategy being jointly pursued by these six defendants presents a strong potential conflict of interest given their different alleged roles and levels of exposure and corresponding potential opportunities to negotiate a favorable plea agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The joint representation of individuals\n   with differing alleged participation in the charged conspiracy \"could force defense counsel to forego certain strategic options that might otherwise be pursued if defendants were separately represented.\"\n   <em>\n    Dempsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20Supp.%20573\">\n    724 F.Supp. at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   If the defendants choose to go to trial, a serious potential conflict of interest remains with joint representation. Should any defendant elect to testify in his own defense, his testimony could prove to be harmful to the other defendants, and Lee and Bennett \"would be faced with the prospect of examining or cross-examining a witness whom he represents and whose interest lies in direct conflict with his other client.\"\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2099396\">\n    2013 WL 99396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Lee and Bennett, who are associated in law practice, have represented all of the defendants since the case initiated with the filing of a criminal complaint, and because there is an irrebuttable presumption that they received confidential communications from the defendants during the course of that representation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freund v.

As the Eleventh Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   If the conflict could cause the defense attorney improperly to use privileged communications in cross-examination, then disqualification is appropriate. Indeed, it is also true that disqualification is equally appropriate if the conflict could deter the defense attorney from intense probing of the witness on cross-examination to protect privileged communications with the former client or to advance the attorney's own personal interest. In short, the court must protect its independent interest in ensuring that the integrity of the judicial system is preserved and that trials are conducted within ethical standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534171\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/1507/#p1523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lee and Bennett emphasize in their response that the scope of their representation is limited to the pretrial portion of the case and \"once the current benefits of concurrent representation are exhausted through the pretrial process, [the defendants] will revisit the issue at that time.\" [Doc. 73 at 11]. The notice of appearance Bennett filed on behalf of Pacheco-Romero does not include such a limitation in representation, [Doc. 38], nor does the docket reflect entry of a limited appearance upon arraignment of the defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [Docs. 64-69], and generally, such limited appearances are not permitted in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, as the government points out, [Doc. 75 at 3 n.2], the prospect of new counsel appearing for each of the defendants after pretrial motions have been litigated could result in delay of the trial of this case, contrary to the Local Rules, which provide that \"[c]ounsel will not ordinarily be allowed to withdraw after pretrial or at a time when withdrawal will cause a delay in the trial of the case,\" LCrR 57.1E(1), NDGa. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Wheat\n   </em>\n   that trial courts need not wait for an actual conflict to emerge before disqualifying counsel because \"[n]ot only the interest of a criminal defendant but the institutional interest in the rendition of just verdicts in criminal cases may be jeopardized by unregulated multiple representation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    486 U.S. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court is mindful that a defendant may waive conflict-free representation,\n   but courts are not bound to accept the waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534171\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/1507/#p1523\">\n    33 F.3d at 1524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Wheat\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that \"in the murkier pre-trial context when relationships between parties are seen through a glass, darkly[,] [t]he likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict, even for those thoroughly familiar with criminal trials.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    486 U.S. at 162-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, \"court[s] must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212318\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/153/#p164\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The full range of potential conflicts of interest can be difficult to assess at this early stage in this case, but the foregoing discussion demonstrates that there are very obvious potential, if not actual, conflicts already present, and the Court need not wait until these conflicts become even more certain to disqualify counsel from further representation of all defendants, despite the waivers executed by the defendants. Thus, the waiver option has been considered, but rejected, in order \"to ensure the adequacy of representation, to protect the integrity of the court, and to avoid future attacks over adequacy of waiver and fairness of trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
