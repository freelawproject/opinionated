MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matter is before the Court on Defendants' motions for summary judgment. Dkt. 96; Dkt. 97. Plaintiff Betty Clayton, the former Director of D.C. Government Operations of the District of Columbia National Guard (\"DCNG\"), is suing the District of Columbia (\"the District\") and the DCNG for unlawful retaliation and sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and for unlawful retaliation under D.C. law. Clayton alleges that her career position was converted to at-will employment and that she was subsequently terminated because of her various whistleblowing activities, and she further alleges that she was terminated because of her sex. Defendants counter that Clayton was fired because of her poor job performance. Neither the District nor the DCNG, however, can identify the person who made the decision to terminate Clayton, anyone who can explain how the decision was made, or anyone who can offer a contemporaneous account of why the decision was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In light of that evidentiary lacuna and the fact that Clayton has adduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to infer that her termination was in retaliation for reporting another employee's sexual harassment allegations against the Commanding General of the DCNG, the Court will deny both motions for summary judgment as to Clayton's Title VII retaliation claims. The Court will, however, grant both motions as to Clayton's sex discrimination claims. With respect to Clayton's D.C. law claims, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of the District as to Clayton's retaliation claim under the D.C. False Claims Act and will deny summary judgment as to Clayton's retaliation claim under the D.C. Whistleblower Protection Act. The following claims, accordingly, remain in the case: Clayton's Title VII retaliation claims against both defendants and Clayton's D.C. Whistleblower Protection Act claim against the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dkt. 106 at 82-83 (Clayton SMF \u00b6\u00b6 2-4). As the Director, Clayton supervised at least six employees, \"mak[ing] sure they got their work done on time, mak[ing] sure [the Division was] coordinating properly with D.C. government downtown, and [managing] the budget for the agency.\" Dkt. 97 at 50-51 (District SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties dispute whether, at the time of Clayton's tenure as Director, the Division was an entity within the District government\n   or within both the DCNG and the District government.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 96-1 at 2 (DCNG SUMF \u00b6 3) (\"District Government Operations is a District Division within the District City Administrator's Office.\"),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357922\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/117/68/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (DCNG SUMF \u00b6 5) (\"District Government Operations employees working at the Armory are District employees subject to District, not DCNG, policies procedures, and guidelines.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 106 at 83-84 (Clayton SMF \u00b6 8) (\"[F]rom the 2008-2010 timeframe[,] ... the DC Government Operations [was] simultaneously a Directorate within Joint Force Head Quarters, DC National Guard[,] and an agency of the Government of the District of Columbia.\").

The DCNG disputes this assertion. It contends that the \"DCNG, with the permission and coordination of the District, investigated all of ...

It is undisputed that Jones, General Schwartz's administrative assistant, relayed to Clayton that she \"had been a victim of sexual harassment/assault by [General Schwartz]\" and that she \"felt th[at] [she] had been intimidated and threatened by [General Schwartz] not to act/file a complaint,\" and that she had sought Clayton's counsel. Dkt. 107-47 at 3 (Jones Email to Sharpe) (May 10, 2010) (listing witnesses and describing their involvement);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-14 at 12-13 (Clayton Dep.) (relaying same conversation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties disagree about the ensuing events. According to Clayton, she was approached by Sergeant Christopher Martin, the DCNG's EEO Officer, who informed her that he had discussed the allegations with General Schwartz and demanded to know her involvement in the case. Dkt. 107-14 at 13 (Clayton Dep.). As he left the office, he allegedly added: \"I never lose a case,\" or words to that effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Clayton further testified that, in January 2010, April 2010, and September 2010, General Schwartz himself threatened her employment, stating, \"We'll see who's still sitting in that chair come October 1.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (Clayton Dep.). General Schwartz also requested that Nickels clarify the legal status\n   of the D.C. Government Operations Division and the DCNG Commanding General's authority over the Division's employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-60 at 2 (Nickels Memo). The DCNG counters that it \"was unaware of ... Clayton's alleged involvement in Jones's discrimination complaint prior to ... Clayton's filing [of] this lawsuit.\" Dkt. 96-1 at 7 (DCNG SUMF \u00b6 38);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 115-6 at 28 (Schwartz Dep.) (testifying that he was unaware of Clayton's involvement prior to the lawsuit). For its part, the District does not dispute the occurrence of General Schwartz's threats, but contends that they were the result of interpersonal disputes with Clayton,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 97 at 53 (District SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 17-19), including one that occurred in June or July 2009, before Clayton reported that General Schwartz had allegedly sexually harassed Jones,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at 10 (Second Amd.

Office of Human Resources, notifying Clayton that her career position was being converted to the \"Management Supervisory Service\" (\"MSS\")-that is, at-will employment-effective October 10, 2010, \"in accordance with the [MSS] transition provisions of D.C. official Code \u00a7 1-609.58(a) ; and legal opinion from Peter J. Nickels, Attorney General for the District of Columbia.\" Dkt. 107-35 at 2 (Sept. 27, 2010 Notice). The letter further advised that, if Clayton \"decline[d] appointment to the [MSS],\" she would \"receive priority for appointment to a vacant Career Service position within [her] agency, if available,\" but that, \"[i]f no such vacant position is available,\" she would receive 30-days' notice of separation and be terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, Clayton received further notice that \"all other Career Service supervisory and managerial staff in [the Division]\" at \"grade level 11 and above\" would be \"transitioned into the MSS,\" and the letter asked Clayton to identify all positions that qualified for conversion within her division. Dkt. 97-10 at 2-3 (Sept. 28, 2010 Notice). Clayton elected to accept her MSS appointment on October 5, 2010. Dkt. 97-9 at 5 (Acceptance of MSS Appointment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 26, 2010, Clayton received notice of her termination from the Office of the City Administrator. Dkt. 97-17 at 2 (Oct. 26, 2010 Separation Notice). The parties disagree about the reasons for Clayton's termination. The separation letter, signed by the City Administrator, Neil Albert, did not contain any reasons for Clayton's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Oct. 26, 2010 Separation Notice). He later testified at his deposition: \"I didn't make the decision to remove ... Clayton as far as I can recall.\" Dkt. 115-12 at 6 (Albert Dep.). Other potential decisionmakers-Gregory, General Schwartz, and the Mayor at the time, Adrian Fenty-likewise denied responsibility for making the decision to terminate Clayton and denied knowledge of who made that decision or why.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-33 at 7 (Gregory Dep.); Dkt. 107-59 at 2 (Fenty Decl. \u00b6 2); Dkt. 107-20 at 18 (Schwartz Dep.). The District nevertheless maintains that Clayton was terminated because of her job performance: specifically, because \"the City Administrator ... had expressed frustration with [her] lack of cooperation with [his office],\" Dkt. 97 at 56 (District SUMF \u00b6 36), and because he was \"advised ... about [Clayton's] unauthorized use of federal letterhead on or about September 17, 2010\" with regards to an adverse personnel action against Clipper,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 57 (District SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 41-42), after receiving three prior directions or suggestions not to use DCNG letterhead,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (District SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 37-39). Clayton\n   counters that that the District's inability to identify the actual decisionmaker-or anyone who can provide an account of how her termination actually came about-provides sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that the District's proffered, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination is pretextual. Dkt. 106 at 53-59;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-03 (Clayton SMF \u00b6 113). She also disputes the District's characterization of her job performance, asserting that she had \"no performance issues according to both General Schwartz and DC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101 (Clayton SMF \u00b6 110) (citing Dkt. 107-20 at 10-15 (Schwartz Dep.) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Clayton's lack of cooperation with the City Administrator's Office and misuse of DCNG letterhead were the real reasons for her termination, or whether she was, in fact, terminated for assisting Jones in reporting General Schwartz for sexual harassment. Because this dispute provides sufficient grounds to deny the District's motion for summary judgment, the Court need not address Clayton's other alleged adverse action: the conversion of her career position to at-will employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Clayton asserts that the District's reliance on her purported lack of cooperation and improper use of DCNG letterhead is pretextual. She stresses, in particular, that none of her supervisors testified that these reasons prompted her termination; rather, that explanation was devised by the District, after-the-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 97 at 55-56 (District SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 33-36). Clayton argues that the record is silent as to (1) who made the decision to terminate her, and (2) what his or her thinking was at the time, Dkt. 106 at 52-53, and that a reasonable jury could, accordingly, find that the District's proffered rationale is pretextual. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the District has failed to identify a decisionmaker who can verify that Clayton's alleged non-cooperation and misuse of the DCNG's letterhead actually played any role in the decision to terminate her employment. City Administrator Albert, the person who signed Clayton's termination letter, testified that \"[he] didn't make the decision to remove ... Clayton as far as [he could] recall,\" and that \"those decisions were made at the ... D.C Office of Human Resources.\" Dkt. 115-12 at 6 (Albert Dep.). But the Director of the D.C. Office of Human Resources at the time, Brender Gregory, testified that she did not know who ordered Clayton's termination, and she \"assume[d] that [it] was her supervisor ... which would have been Neil Albert.\" Dkt. 107-33 at 7 (Gregory Dep.). General Schwartz likewise disclaimed any knowledge of why Clayton was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-20 at 18 (Schwartz Dep.) (stating he had \"no idea\" why Clayton was terminated). The District's Corporate Designee, Thompson, testified that Mayor Fenty was the ultimate decisionmaker, Dkt. 107-38 at 7 (Thompson Dep.), but he, too, disclaimed any role in making the decision to terminate Clayton, Dkt. 107-59 at 2 (Fenty Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3) (\"I have no personal\n   knowledge or recollection of Betty Clayton .... Similarly, I had no involvement in the conversion of ... Clayton's position to the Management Supervisory Service or the decision to terminate her employment.\"). Finally, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Forrest, the DCNG's Corporate Designee, and the person who complained about Clayton's use of DCNG letterhead, stated that the DCNG had no position one way or the other as to the reason Clayton was terminated. Dkt. 107-58 at 4 (Forrest Dep.). Without identifying a decisionmaker or anyone with knowledge of the actual decisionmaking process, the District cannot carry its burden of demonstrating, beyond genuine dispute, that Clayton was terminated because she was uncooperative and used DCNG letterhead to notify Clipper of an adverse personnel action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , aside from the testimony of D.C.'s corporate designee, LaTonya Thompson, who did not testify based on her personal knowledge, and a passing statement from Gregory, relaying her secondhand knowledge, none of the alleged decisionmakers identified any issues with Clayton's job performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 115-8 at 26 (Thompson Dep.) (confirming that Clayton received no negative performance reviews from any supervisor). Contrary to Thompson's and Gregory's assertion that Clayton's non-cooperation with the City Administrator's Office contributed to her termination, the City Administrator himself testified that he \"do[esn't] recall the specifics\" of why Clayton was terminated or who was involved. Dkt. 115-12 at 6 (Albert Dep.). He further testified that he does not even \"recall knowing ... Clayton or knowing her work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (Albert Dep.). General Schwartz's testimony, moreover, directly undermines the District's proffered rationale. He stated that Clayton \"did a great job as the Director of the D.C. Government Operations\" and that \"[he] had no issue with her performance.\" Dkt. 107-20 at 11 (Schwartz Dep.). His performance review, in fact, awarded Clayton the highest score in every category.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15 (Schwartz Dep.). And, General Schwartz agreed that, until her dismissal, Clayton's performance continued to be at the \"highest possible level.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Schwartz Dep.). Finally, in any event, even if Clayton was terminated because General Schwartz had communicated to City Administrator Albert that she was \"uncooperative,\" that does not preclude the possibility that General Schwartz acted with retaliatory animus. To the contrary, a reasonably jury could conclude that the reason General Schwartz found Clayton \"uncooperative\"-despite his glowing remarks about her job performance-was because she assisted Jones in reporting her allegations of sexual harassment, rather than squelching her allegations. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the District's proffered reasons for Clayton's termination were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Demonstrating pretext-or, more precisely, a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext-however, is insufficient. \"The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n    530 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Here, the Court concludes that Clayton has adduced sufficient evidence to establish a genuine dispute of fact as to whether she was, in fact, terminated for reporting Jones's claim of sexual harassment against General Schwartz. It is undisputed that Clayton reported Tamara Jones's sexual harassment complaint to Linda Brown, the District of Columbia Human Resources EEO Officer in January 2010.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 107-18 at 2 (Brown Email to Jones) (Jan. 14, 2010) (\"I spoke with ... Clayton today referenc[ing] your situation.\"). What is disputed is whether\n   General Schwartz knew of Clayton's involvement in the making the report, and whether that was the real reason for her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   General Schwartz testified that he was unaware-prior to this lawsuit-that Clayton had assisted Jones in making a sexual harassment complaint. Dkt. 115-6 at 28 (Schwartz Dep.). Two pieces of evidence, however, arguably cast doubt on this contention. First, the D.C. OHR served the DCNG with notice of Jones's complaint and its pending investigation, specifically addressing the letter to Sergeant Martin, the DCNG's EEO Officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-46 (Apr. 26, 2010 Notice). According to Colonel Kenny Ricket, General Schwartz's Chief of Staff, Dkt. 115-2 at 16 (Ricket Dep.), \"General Schwartz kept close counsel with Sergeant Martin,\" and Colonel Ricket thought that \"Sergeant Martin spoke with\" General Schwartz about the complaint, Dkt. 107-10 at 10 (Ricket Dep.). During the course of the investigation, moreover, Jones disclosed all potential witnesses and persons assisting with her claim, including Clayton. Dkt. 107-47 at 3-4 (Jones Email to Sharpe) (May 10, 2010) (listing witnesses and describing their involvement);\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-43 at 7-8 (Sharpe Dep.) (denying that she shared Jones's witness list with General Schwartz or Sergeant Martin). Jones also alerted Melissa Sharpe, her assigned EEO investigator, that Sergeant Martin had approached her in January 2010 and questioned her about Clayton's involvement in the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   During the week of 11 January, DCNG EEO/SARC (Sexual Assault RC), SMSgt Dwight [Chris] Martin, called my office and requested that I see him in his office immediatel[y].

Dkt. 107-14 at 13 (Clayton Dep.). Sergeant Martin informed her that he had discussed the allegations with General Schwartz and demanded to know if Jones had reported the incident to her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Clayton testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q.

[a plaintiff] needn't provide direct evidence that [her] supervisors knew of [her] protected activity; [s]he need only offer circumstantial evidence that could reasonably support an inference that they did.\"). Moreover, although Clayton denied knowledge of Jones's report to Sergeant Martin, a jury could reasonably infer from Clayton's initial refusal to answer and the fact that she, instead, simply \"looked at\" Martin \"without saying a word,\" that Martin and Dickens understood-or at least suspected-that Clayton had in fact assisted Jones in reporting the alleged harassment, and that they passed this information along to General Schwartz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   There is also sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to infer that General Schwartz played a role in Clayton's termination based on his knowledge or suspicions of her involvement in the Jones case. Clayton alleges that General Schwartz threatened her employment on three separate occasions in close proximity to her report-in January 2010, April 2010, and September 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (Clayton Dep.)

Gregory also testified that City Administrator Albert had \"raised the issue that the General had some concerns about his ability to gain [Clayton's] cooperation.\" Dkt. 107-33 at 13 (Gregory Dep.).

When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Clayton, and taking into account General Schwartz's testimony that he had no issues with Clayton's work during the course of her tenure, the Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether his threats were motivated by her protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, deny the District's motion for summary judgment as to Clayton's retaliation claim under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Sex Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Clayton also alleges that she was converted to at-will employment and terminated shortly thereafter because of her sex in violation of Title VII. Dkt. 45 at 20-21 (Second Amd. Compl. \u00b6 128). Previously, the Court held that Clayton's allegations were sufficient to state a claim for sex discrimination at the motion to dismiss stage because she needed only to \"alleg[e] that she was treated less favorably than a 'similarly situated male employee' \" (her predecessor, Anthony Devassey) and that she \"suffered a 'materially adverse consequence[ ]' \" as a result (her career position was converted to at-will employment).\n   <em>\n    Clayton III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357922\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/117/68/\">\n    117 F.Supp.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Teneyck v.

Thus, Clayton pointed to only two disputed facts in support of her claim: The District allegedly treated her differently than her male predecessor, Anthony Devassey, because he was not converted from a career appointment to at-will employment during his tenure even though\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-609.58\">\n    D.C.

Clayton's sex discrimination claim fails under this standard. First, and most\n   significantly, the District did not simply reclassify \"\n   <em>\n    Clayton\n   </em>\n   ... as a Management Supervisory employee,\" Dkt. 97-18 at 14 (emphasis added); it reclassified the\n   <em>\n    position\n   </em>\n   of Director of the D.C. Government Operations Division-along with all other \"supervisory or managerial Career Service position[s] at a grade 11 level and above.\" Dkt. 97-10 at 2. As a result, Clayton's successor in the position, Herman Preston, assumed-and still holds-an \"at-will\" position, Dkt. 97-21 at 5 (Preston Dep.), and, to the extent a tenure-protected position ever existed, the District has eliminated that position. Clayton, moreover, does not contend that the reclassification was legally erroneous,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 106 at 50, and she has offered no evidence that the District reclassified the position because of her sex. Her principal claim of sex discrimination, accordingly, reduces to the proposition that the District treated her and her male successor (along with other \"supervisory and managerial\" employees) less favorably than her male predecessor, when it correctly reclassified her position (along with other positions). In the absence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other direct or indirect evidence of sex discrimination, that sequence of events-standing alone-is insufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that the District's asserted reason for reclassifying the position was pretext for intentional discrimination based on Clayton's sex.\n   <em>\n    Adeyemi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570306,3582918\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1222/\">\n    525 F.3d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Clayton's efforts to premise her sex discrimination claim on Devassey's greater discretion to award performance incentives fares no better. Even assuming that Devassey had greater discretion, that fact would not permit a reasonable jury to find that Clayton's position was reclassified, or that she was terminated, because of her sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Clayton and Devassey did not have the same direct supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt 115-5 at 54 (Clayton Dep.) (acknowledging that General Wherley was Devassey's Commanding General). Accordingly, it is a stretch too far to contend that the fact Devassey's supervisor granted him greater discretion over incentive awards, while Clayton's supervisor took a more active role in deciding who should receive awards, would allow a reasonable jury to find that Clayton's job position was re-classified, and that she was subsequently terminated, because of her sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Clayton also argues in her brief in opposition that she has successfully stated a claim for sex discrimination because she was replaced by a man, Herman Preston, who \"had far less experience than [her].\" Dkt. 106 at 48-49. As Clayton herself seems to recognize, however, it is far from clear whether and to what extent Preston's qualifications bore on the District's decision to terminate her employment; the District does not contend that Clayton was terminated because she lacked the necessary experience or qualifications, and no one suggests that Preston was chosen over Clayton because of their respective\n   experience or qualifications. Instead, Clayton contends that a reasonable jury could find that she was fired because of her sex based on the District's false assertion that Preston was chosen because he was \"deputy director\" of the Division, Dkt. 106 at 36, and because the District never explored whether he had the necessary qualifications for the job. But, as the District explains, it never relied on the fact that Preston was \"deputy director\" to justify his appointment. Dkt. 110-4 at 43 (District's Reply to Clayton's SMF) (\"Preston was second in command at the Government Operations Division at the time of plaintiff's termination, and his position was 'somewhere along the lines of deputy director.' \" (citing Dkt. 107-38 at 16 (Thompson Dep.) ) ). Rather, the District cited to Preston's thirty years of experience at the DCNG. Preston \"joined [the] DCNG as a budget clerk in 1978, ... [and] gradually worked his way up the organization, receiving promotions to senior analyst, program manager, and senior program manager before assuming the position of interim director in 2010 and director in 2012.\" Dkt. 110 at 29 (citing Dkt. 110-3 at 3-6 (Ex. 31) (Preston Dep.) ). Given this undisputed evidence, no reasonable jury could infer that Clayton was terminated because of her sex based on the purported inexperience of her successor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, grant summary judgment in favor of the District on Clayton's sex discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    D.C.

False Claims Act (\"DC-FCA\"). Dkt. 45 at 14-16 (Second Amd. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86-97).

The D.C.

The DCNG argues that Clayton has failed \"to point to specific evidence in the record creating a material issue for trial on this front.\" Dkt. 109 at 5. Specifically, the DCNG asserts that Clayton has \"proffer[ed] no evidence showing that [the] DCNG was involved in the decision to convert her position and terminate her employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The Court is unpersuaded and concludes, instead, that Clayton has met her burden of showing that a genuine dispute of material fact exists with respect to (1) whether the DCNG was Clayton's joint employer, and (2) whether the DCNG was involved in the decision to terminate her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   With respect to the first element, Clayton points to testimony that suggests the DCNG exerted control over her incentive pay, that it reviewed her performance, and that General Schwartz had authority to initiate disciplinary measures against her. General Schwartz and personnel from both the District and the DCNG testified, for instance, that Clayton was in the General's chain of command.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-20 at 10 (Schwartz Dep.) (testifying that he was Clayton's supervisor); Dkt. 107-10 at 10 (Ricket Dep.) (confirming that General Schwartz was Clayton's supervisor); Dkt. 107-33 at 17 (Gregory Dep.) (noting that Clayton reported to Neil Albert and General Schwartz);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-60 at 2 (Nickels Memo) (\"[I]t appears that the Director of the Government division, a District employee, is in [the General's] chain of command.\"). General Schwartz, moreover, filled out Clayton's performance review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-21 (Perf. Eval.), and approved the incentive pay for District employees in the District of Columbia Government Operations Division,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 107-28 (Memo to General Schwartz). The District's corporate designee, Thompson, also testified that the \"commanding general [could] ... initiate[ ] remedial or disciplinary measures against the Government Operations Division personnel\" and \"participate in administrative actions against [those] employees.\" Dkt. 107-38 at 15-16 (Thompson Dep.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As such, the nature of Clayton's employment is similar that of the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Al-Saffy\n   </em>\n   . There, a Department of Agriculture employee stationed at a U.S. embassy abroad brought suit against both the Department of Agriculture and the State Department for employment discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Al-Saffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n    827 F.3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the State Department on the ground that Al-Saffy had failed to establish he was an employee of the State Department.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n    at 91-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the D.C. Circuit reversed, holding that \"Al-Saffy [had come] forward with evidence creating a genuine dispute concerning the State Department's control over his work and employment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n    at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, although Al-Saffy\n   was \"not officially employed by\" the State Department, the court found that there was evidence that he reported to State Department employees while stationed overseas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Indeed, [two State Department employees] had recommended Al-Saffy's removal\" to the Department of Agriculture based on his conduct overseas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals found \"further support[ ]\" for Al-Saffy's \"relationship with the Department of State\" in the \"federal chief of missions statute,\" which \"grants the United States ambassador of a foreign country plenary authority over other executive branch employees in that country.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334232,12310570\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As noted above, similar indicia of the DCNG's control over Clayton's employment are present in here: Multiple sources have confirmed that Clayton reported to General Schwartz, and, even the Nickels Memo acknowledges that, pursuant to the D.C. Code, Clayton has a \"dotted-line reporting relationship with the Commanding General,\" Dkt. 107-60 at 3 (Nickels Memo). Accordingly, as in\n   <em>\n    Al-Saffy\n   </em>\n   , there is, at the very least, a genuine dispute as to whether the DCNG exerted sufficient control over Clayton's employment to satisfy the standard for joint employment in this circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   There is also a dispute of fact as to whether the DCNG was involved in Clayton's termination. On one hand, the DCNG argues that \"there is no evidence that [General] Schwartz or anyone else at DCNG requested [Clayton's] termination or was even notified prior to the action being effected.\" Dkt. 96 at 9. As noted above, however, Clayton has pointed to multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to infer that General Schwartz was involved in her termination. As such, the Court declines to enter summary judgment in favor of the DCNG on the basis that it was not Clayton's employer and will proceed to the merits of her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   One final issue remains: Whether Clayton's Title VII sex discrimination and retaliation claims against the DCNG pass muster under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. Because these claims are identical to the ones that Clayton alleged against the District, however, the Court need not conduct a separate analysis. Instead, the Court will, for the reasons stated above, grant the DCNG's motion for summary judgment as to Clayton's sex discrimination claim and deny summary judgment as to Clayton's retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants' motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 96; Dkt. 97, are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.

Dkt. 109 at 3; Dkt. 110 at 7 n.2. Although Defendants are correct that Clayton's opposition fails to satisfy the requirement of offering a paragraph-by-paragraph response to Defendants' statements of undisputed material facts, with citations to the record demonstrating whether and how each asserted undisputed fact is disputed, the Court will not impose the extreme sanction of accepting all of Defendants' assertions of fact as true for purposes of resolving the pending motions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    As Local Civil Rule 7(h)(1) makes clear, the decision whether to treat any fact set forth in a SUMF, which is not controverted in the statement of genuine issues, resides in the sound discretion of the district court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Local Civ. R. 7(h)(1) (\"[T]he Court\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    assume that facts identified by the moving party in its statement of material facts are admitted.\" (emphasis added) ). Although Clayton's submission omits the required, paragraph-by-paragraph response to Defendants' statements of undisputed material facts, it does include a substantial statement of disputed facts containing record citations, and the Court has been able to identify the relevant areas of genuine dispute. Counsel are advised, however, to ensure that they have familiarized themselves with-and that they\n    <em>\n     fully\n    </em>\n    comply with-all applicable rules going forward.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    As the DCNG notes in its motion for summary judgment, Clayton alleges in her Second Amended Complaint that General Schwartz also threatened to terminate Clayton in \"June or July 2009,\" Dkt. 45 at 10 (Second Amd.

When asked at her deposition about this earlier threat, however, Clayton could not recall what had happened. Dkt. 107-14 at 10 (Clayton Dep.).
