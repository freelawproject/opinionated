Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how this testimony would provide any insight beyond the understanding and experience of an average citizen to assist the trier of fact, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Langley may testify about his expert opinions regarding the red light because they meet the above stated requirements. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion [65] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine [80]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will address Plaintiffs' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Release Agreement Between State Farm and Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Court should exclude any evidence of the Release Agreement between State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") and Plaintiffs. This issue is fully briefed in response to Defendant's separate Motion in Limine Admissibility of the Release Agreement [84]. For the reasons discussed in Section IV, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trooper Smith's Opinions and the Traffic Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs move to exclude any opinion testimony by Trooper Garrett Smith and the Traffic Crash Report. The Court will consider each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    A. Trooper Smith's Opinion Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs move to exclude Trooper Smith's opinions because he was never identified as an expert witness and his opinions are unduly prejudicial and will confuse the jury. Trooper Smith's testimony is permissible. First, Trooper Smith was never identified as an expert witness because he is not an expert witness. Instead, Defendant suggests Trooper Smith will testify as to what he witnessed at the scene. If his ultimate conclusion is that, based on what he saw, he could not draw a conclusion about what happened and therefore does not have an opinion on the matter, that is evidence Defendant may present to the jury without confusing them or unduly prejudicing Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Traffic Crash Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Traffic Crash Report is inadmissible because it contains\n   hearsay statements of witnesses, as well as Trooper Smith's opinion regarding the validity of the hearsay statements. In response, Defendant offered to redact \"any reference to these inadmissible hearsay statements from the Traffic Crash Report prior to its submission to the jury.\" The Court agrees with this resolution at this stage and will resolve at trial the admissibility of the document otherwise. Thus, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part and GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue. The Traffic Crash Report is admissible, as long as any hearsay statements and Trooper Smith's opinions regarding the hearsay statements are redacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Statements of Trooper Smith's Post Commander\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to exclude Trooper Smith's testimony on two statements made to him by his post commander as hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2). Specifically that 1) Trooper Smith needed to supplement his Traffic Crash Report to include statements of eyewitnesses; and 2) Donna Compton called to inquire why the statements were not included. At the pretrial conference, the Court saw value in these statements to explain the existence of a supplemental Traffic Crash Report. In Response [95], Plaintiffs submitted copies of both reports. The only substantive difference between the original report and the supplemental report is that the witnesses' names and contact information are included on the supplemental report. In line with the Court's holding in section 5(B) of this Order, witness names and information should be redacted from the Traffic Crash Report. Accordingly, the Court sees no difference between the two police reports and agrees with Plaintiffs that admission of the supplemental report is unnecessary. Further, without the supplemental report, explanation of its existence is also unnecessary, leaving the Post Commander's comments as inadmissible hearsay with no probative value. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Bach's Wife's Medical Condition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the Court should exclude any testimony regarding Defendant Dr. Bach's wife's medical condition and his role as her caretaker, because it is irrelevant and prejudicial. A party, however, is permitted to present basic information about himself to the jury. Accordingly, Dr. Bach is permitted to say that his wife had a stroke and that he cares for her. The Court recognizes that testimony beyond basic facts could be irrelevant or prejudicial and will sustain properly made objections in that regard. Thus, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Word \"Accident\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs move to prevent Defendant from suggesting that the collision was merely an accident because it would be unfairly prejudicial. While Plaintiffs are correct that using the \"legal accident\" defense is impermissible, that does not include all references to the crash as an accident. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Effect of Large Verdict on Dr. Bach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs argue Defendant should not argue a significant verdict would negatively impact his life and future. This part of the motion is unopposed. Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    7.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Financial Status of Either Party\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs move to exclude reference to the financial status of any party. This part of the motion is unopposed. Plaintiffs' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    8.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collateral Source Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs move to exclude any evidence related to any collateral source\n   payments including those made by any insurance company, Medicare, or any other entity to satisfy all or part of the medical bills. Defendant maintains he should be able to use evidence of payments made on behalf of Marvin and Betty Brock by Medicare and their other insurers to contest the reasonableness of medical expenses incurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under Georgia law, \"[t]he collateral source rule, stated simply, is that the receipt of benefits or mitigation of loss from sources other than the defendant will not operate to diminish the plaintiff's recovery of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Polito v.

Second, and most notably, evidence of those payments was proposed to demonstrate a biased billing relationship between the litigation investment company and medical providers. Bias is a separate ground for admissibility, and Defendant has not alleged such a biased relationship here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ML Healthcare Servs., LLC v.

While there are no Georgia cases directly on point, the Georgia law that does exist on the issue strongly suggests that Georgia courts would consider evidence that a defendant received medicare benefits as inadmissible under the collateral source rule, even to establish the reasonable value of medical services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court recognizes that evidence of medicare market rates for care does not violate the collateral source rule when offered to establish the reasonableness of the amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaddy v.

While lay witnesses, including Plaintiffs, may not testify on matters requiring an expert, such as a medical diagnosis, they may testify as to what they observed. Thus, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED to the extent a lay witness cannot offer a medical diagnosis, but is otherwise DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Settlement Offers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude any reference to settlement negotiations between the parties.

Plaintiffs argue that this matter is best reserved for the charge conference. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs. Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue. However, should a party intend to argue this point, counsel shall advise the Court at the charge conference so that objections can be addressed prior to closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vouching for Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiffs cannot vouch for a witness.

Plaintiffs agree \"Golden Rule\" arguments are inappropriate but maintain the \"Reptile Strategy\" is better addressed at trial. Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED to the \"Golden Rule\" issue\n   </strong>\n   in full, and is further\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED for the \"Reptile Strategy\" issue\n   </strong>\n   , to the extent Plaintiffs intend to argue damages should be set to punish Defendant or to send a message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    10.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ineffectiveness of Money Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude arguments that money damages are ineffective to fully\n   compensate Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs may argue hedonic damages but cannot suggest that a measure greater than what the Court instructs is appropriate. To that extent, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    11.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Impact of Death on Family and Friends\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude all evidence of how the deaths of Marvin and Betty Brock have impacted their family and friends. Testimony about the survivors' relationships with the deceased can be relevant in calculating the amount lost by the deceased. Therefore, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on this issue. That said, such testimony can only be used to determine damages from the perspective of the deceased's loss, not the surviving family and friends' loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    12.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Improper Opening Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude any improper arguments made during opening statements. This is a premature and broad objection. The Court will rule on any objections at trial. Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    13.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Bach's Blurred Vision and Choroidal Folds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude the testimony of Dr. Bach that he experienced occasional and temporary instances blurred vision at times prior to the subject accident and medical records from North Carolina Eye, Ear, Nose &amp; Throat regarding a diagnosis of choroidal folds. This evidence appears relevant to the issue of Dr. Bach's ability to safely operate a vehicle. Thus, if Plaintiffs can lay a proper foundation for the evidence, it is admissible. Thus, for the purposes of this Motion, Defendant's request is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    14.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hearsay Statements of Accident Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude hearsay statements of people present at the scene of the accident. This part of the motion is unopposed. Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   15. Apportionment Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiffs cannot argue that apportionment will reduce the amount of damages recoverable to them. Plaintiffs object, pointing to the pattern jury charge that informs the jury of the effect of apportionment. Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to this issue. The Court will, however, revisit the issue at the charge conference, if Plaintiffs request apportionment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Defendant's Motion in Limine Admissibility of the Release Agreement [84]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendant moves to admit at trial the Release Agreement (\"agreement\") between State Farm and Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs conversely move in limine to exclude the agreement [80]. Defendant argues the agreement is relevant and therefore is admissible unless otherwise prohibited under Rule 402. Plaintiffs seek to exclude the agreement on three grounds: \"(1) it is inadmissible under F.R.E. 408 ; (2) it is inadmissible under F.R.E. 411 as it will inject inadmissible insurance evidence into the record; and (3) it is inadmissible under F.R.E. 402 &amp; 403 because it is irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\" (Pls.'s MIL, Dkt [80] at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court finds that the agreement is inadmissible under F.R.E. 402 and 403 because the agreement is irrelevant and has no probative value to the issues in the case. Evidence that Plaintiffs took a check from an insurance company does not qualify them to say either party was at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   This sideshow exploration will only serve to confuse the jury. Therefore, Defendant's Motion in Limine Admissibility of the Release Agreement [84] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate [85]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant moves for separate trials on the issues of liability and damages. \"The decision whether to bifurcate, or to sever and try issues separately, pursuant to Rule 42(b) is one committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimberly-Clark Corp. v.

Ga. 1982) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Having considered all of these factors, the Court will not bifurcate this trial. Defendant argues that should he prevail at the liability phase, there would be no need for all of the damages testimony. This exact argument was rejected by the Brown court, and this Court finds the reasoning from Brown to be persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1171 (\"[Defendant's] observation that a jury determination of no liability would eliminate the need for a trial on damages is true in any negligence case-it does not advance the cause of bifurcation\").
