LISA GODBEY WOOD, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff filed the original Complaint on December 10, 2018. Dkt. No. 1. Defendants timely moved to dismiss the original Complaint. Dkt. No. 10. Plaintiff responded to the motion to dismiss, dkt. no. 12, but also timely filed an Amended Complaint, dkt. no. 13. Defendants then filed a motion to dismiss this new, Amended Complaint, dkt. no. 15. Before the Court, then, are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the original Complaint, dkt. no. 10, and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, dkt. no. 15. These motions are fully briefed and ripe for review. For the reasons stated below, both motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts stated herein are taken solely from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and are assumed to be true pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defendant South Georgia Cargo builds and sells trailers to customers across the country. Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6 11. Plaintiff was employed by Defendants at their plant in Pearson, Georgia from 2017 to 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Plaintiff worked five days a week and sometimes six days a week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Plaintiff was not required to clock in or out each day he worked and thus does not have records of his hours worked in a particular week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Nevertheless, Plaintiff alleges that he worked in excess of 40 hours per workweek throughout his employment; in fact, most weeks he worked between 50 and 60 hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. His work day typically\n   began at 7:00 a.m. and lasted anywhere from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Throughout his employment, Defendants classified Plaintiff as \"exempt\" and compensated him on a purported \"salary\" basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. For each week's pay period, Plaintiff was paid a lump sum, which varied, and that sum was characterized on his paystub as a \"salary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-38. During the twenty workweeks identified in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff worked more than 40 hours but was not paid overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Plaintiff alleges that he was not an \"exempt\" employee as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), and thus, he was entitled to be paid at a rate of time-and-a-half his regular rate of pay, i.e., an overtime rate, for all hours worked over 40 in a particular workweek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because Plaintiff was not paid the compensation to which he alleges he was entitled, Plaintiff filed this action to recover damages under the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a plaintiff's complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).

M/V OLYMPIA VOYAGER\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722856\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/1210/#p1215\">\n    463 F.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1215 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritz v.

Further, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint supersedes his original Complaint. Defendants' motion to dismiss the original Complaint, then, has been rendered moot by Plaintiff's filing of his Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief because his allegations contained in the Amended Complaint do not make it plausible that he can prove all the material elements necessary to recover under the FLSA. Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claim is not plausible because he has not \"set forth facts as to how many hours he worked over 40 in a work week in order to maintain a facially plausible claim for unpaid overtime (i.e., compensation for hours worked over 40 in a work week).\" Dkt. No. 15 at 7. Indeed, Defendants argue \"Plaintiff still has not identified a single instance in which he worked more than 40 hours in any particular week.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To the contrary, Plaintiff has identified twenty such weeks: Plaintiff set forth twenty workweeks in which he alleges that \"Plaintiff worked more than 40 hours in the workweek.\" Dkt. No. 13 \u00b6 41. Through these allegations, Plaintiff has \"sufficiently allege [d] 40 hours of work in a given workweek as well as some uncompensated time in excess of the 40 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Lundy v. Catholic Health System of Long Island\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805357\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/106/#p114\">\n    711 F.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (2d Cir. 2013). This is especially so considering that Plaintiff alleges that he was not required to keep track of his hours, so he is unsure of the number of hours in excess of 40 that he worked in each of the identified workweeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landers v. Quality Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290934\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/638/#p645\">\n    771 F.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645 (9th Cir. 2014),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 26, 2015) (holding that \"like the other circuit courts that have ruled before us, we decline to make the approximation of overtime hours the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of plausibility for claims brought under the FLSA. After all, most (if not all) of the detailed information concerning a plaintiff-employee's compensation and schedule is in the control of the defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This case is not like\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   , cited by Defendants, where the plaintiffs second amended complaint attempted to certify a class and alleged that \"[d]uring periods throughout the last three years, Plaintiffs have frequently worked more than 40 hours per week without being paid overtime compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell, et al. v. High Teck Rail and Fence, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-cv-4-TCB, dkt. no. 7 \u00b6 29 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 23, 2018). There, the Court found that this \"loose, generalized verbiage\" did \"not readily demonstrate how these particular plaintiffs, and the class they purport to represent, were subjected to a violation of the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell et al. v. High Teck Rail and Fence, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-cv-4-TCB, dkt. no. 45 at 5 (N.D. Ga. May 17, 2018). Similarly, this case is not like\n   <em>\n    Cooley\n   </em>\n   (another case cited by Defendants) where the court found that the complaint there did not \"even [set forth] an allegation that they had worked in excess of forty hours in any workweek.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooley v. HMR of Alabama, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273990\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/259/1312/#p1321\">\n    259 F.Supp.3d 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1321 (N.D. Ala. 2017). The\n   <em>\n    Cooley\n   </em>\n   court found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden because \"more is required than just the bare allegation that the Plaintiffs 'regularly' worked over 40 hours per week but were not paid overtime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273990\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/259/1312/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 320 n.15. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cooley\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has alleged twenty specific workweeks in which he worked over 40 hours but was not compensated at an overtime rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the original Complaint, dkt. no. 10, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, dkt. no. 15, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED,\n   </strong>\n   this 16th day of April, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
