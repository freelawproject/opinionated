(Dkt. ## M31; C56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the allegations, backgrounds, and defenses in both cases are similar, the Court will address both motions in this single decision. For the following reasons, Bottling Group's motions are granted, and Morales's and Campbell's Complaints (Dkt. ## M1; C1), are dismissed in their entirety and with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Bottling Group and the Account Merchandiser Position\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bottling Group is a seller and distributor of Pepsi products, and has a distribution facility in Rochester, New York. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 12; C56-1 at \u00b6 13). In addition to staff at the facility, Bottling Group employs Bulk Customer Representatives (\"BCRs\") and Account Merchandisers (\"Merchandisers\"), both of which service customer stores. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). BCRs travel daily to customer stores, interface with store managers, order necessary Pepsi products and provide merchandise for the stores. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). Merchandisers-a level below BCRs-act as \"back up\" for BCRs; they generally cover for BCRs when BCRS are off from work. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 23; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Morales and Campbell were both Merchandisers. They were supervised by several people at Bottling Group, including Sean Trottier (\"Trottier\") and Robert Flaherty (\"Flaherty\"), who are Caucasian, and James Sapp, Jr. (\"Sapp\"), who is African American. Trottier, Flaherty, and Sapp were all supervised by Jesse Pitts\n   (\"Pitts\"), who is Caucasian. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 60-68; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 62-70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Merchandisers, plaintiffs had to follow various company policies and procedures, specifically, the \"P.R.E.M.I.E.R. In-Store Service Process,\" which provided guidance on how to service each customer's store. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-41; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-42). This process required Merchandisers to \"scan-in\" and \"scan-out\" at each location, in order to record the time spent at a specific location. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 42; C56-1 at \u00b6 30, 44). Plaintiffs received formal and informal training on P.R.E.M.I.E.R. and failing to follow it was a \"serious violation\" of company policy. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 44-46; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 45-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bottling Group also reimbursed Merchandisers for their work-related mileage. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 47; C56-1 at \u00b6 49). Accordingly, Merchandisers were expected to track and submit their mileage to Bottling Group at the end of each work week. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 50; C56-1 at \u00b6 52). Although there was no formal policy pertaining to tracking mileage, (Dkt. # C64 at 3-4), Trottier discussed, at least to some extent, the need for plaintiffs to track their mileage, (Dkt. ## M36 at \u00b6 3; C59 at 2, \u00b6 9). Plaintiffs maintain, however, that they were never formally trained on how to track their mileage. (Dkt. ## M36 at \u00b6 6; C59 at 2, \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties do not seem to dispute the method of tracking mileage. According to Bottling Group, mileage generally \"start[ed] with the first scheduled customer store and end[ed] with the last scheduled customer store, except when, on occasion, Merchandisers [had to] stop at the Rochester facility to attend a meeting, update handhelds, or pick up product displays.\" (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 47; C56-1 at \u00b6 49). Based on the odometer, Merchandisers submitted the distance traveled from store to store during a shift. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 49; C56-1 at \u00b6 51). Morales calculated his mileage \"starting after arriving at [his] first store or at the plant,\" (Dkt. # M36 at \u00b6 2), and Campbell apparently tracked his mileage beginning and ending at the Rochester facility on occasions when he passed or stopped by that location, (Dkt. # C59 at 2, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Merchandisers reviewed various company policies at the outset of their employment, including the General Rules of Conduct, the Global Code of Conduct, and the Employee Handbook. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6 53; C56-1 at \u00b6 54). Pursuant to those documents, employees who felt discriminated against, retaliated against, or harassed, could report such conduct to a manager, Human Resource representative, or the company's \"Speak Up\" line. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56). Company rules also prohibited the \"misrepresentation of facts or falsification of Company records or other documents,\" and the \"intentional concealment, alteration, or falsification of information for personal benefit\"; violating these rules was deemed to be a \"serious infraction.\" (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 57-59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Morales's Employment with Bottling Group\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Morales began working as a part-time Merchandiser on June 26, 2013, and became full-time by December 29, 2013. (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 81, 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Open BCR Position\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2014, Morales applied for an open BCR position and was interviewed by Trottier and Flaherty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99). For these positions, Bottling Group maintained an internal policy to \"promote the best suited individual for the job, based upon merit and seniority.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101). Based on these criteria, Bottling Group promoted\n   Chuck Jewell-not Morales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). According to Bottling Group, Jewell was more qualified for the open BCR position because he was already a BCR for another geographical area and had been employed by Bottling Group since 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97, 102-03). Morales did not apply for Jewell's former BCR position and did not complain then about Bottling Group's decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104-06).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Performance Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   P.R.E.M.I.E.R. required Morales to obtain a customer's signature, such as the store manager, prior to leaving the store, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38), and to fill the store with Pepsi products, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). Bottling Group claims that on February 7, 2015, Morales failed to do either these things at a specific store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 107-08). Morales contends that he was not a regular at that store, that he signed out with who he believed to be the assistant manager, and that there was no more Pepsi products at the store. (Dkt. # M36 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). On February 9, 2015, Pitts discussed these issues with the customer, who requested that Morales no longer service his store. Morales concedes that this was a \"serious violation.\" (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 109-11). Pitts, therefore, issued Morales a written warning on February 13. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 110, 112).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, on March 27, 2015, Morales-and Campbell-met with Flaherty and Pitts to discuss the new attendance policy and safety training (the \"March 27 Meeting\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-17). During that meeting, Flaherty told plaintiffs that they had a \"stink\" on them based on, apparently, their recent job performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 118-20). Morales understood this to mean \"basically that there w[ere] people that didn't like us and that we needed to try to figure out a way to get that stank off.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122). Morales also told Flaherty and Pitts that \"people were treating ... [him] differently,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124), although he failed to provide specific details of this treatment because, according to Morales, the person who was \"treating [him] differently/ discriminating against [him] ... was at the table and [Morales] didn't feel comfortable,\" (Dkt. # M36 at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 5, 2015, Pitts learned that another customer had requested that Morales no longer service its store due to performance issues. (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 127). Morales also apparently had told the customer that he was late on a specific day because another store was a higher priority. (Dkt. ## M31-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 130-31; M36 at \u00b6 18). In Morales's words, the customer \"came at ... [him] with disrespect ... [and he] answered [the customer] the [same] way[.]\" (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 131).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Morales met with Pitts on April 13, 2015, at which Pitts planned to issue Morales a Last Chance Agreement based on customer complaints (the \"April 13 Meeting\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 128, 133). At the meeting, Morales complained that Flaherty was \"treating him differently,\" but failed to provide Pitts with examples (the \"April 13 Complaint\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 136). Morales claims Pitts barely gave him the opportunity to talk, and that his concerns were \"shot down.\" (Dkt. # M36 at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pitts then issued Morales the Last Chance Agreement, which Morales signed on April 13, 2015. (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 137). By doing so, Morales agreed to follow company rules and understood the failure to do so could result in termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Morales's Termination from Bottling Group\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Several months later, in June 2015, Sapp reported to Pitts that one Merchandiser had \"unusually high mileage reimbursement requests.\" (Dkt. # M31-1 at \u00b6 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This prompted Pitts to perform a mileage audit of ten Merchandisers\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from May 24, 2015, through June 28, 2015 (the \"Audit\"). Pitts used \"scan-in\" and \"scan-out\" reports to determine which stores Merchandisers traveled to, used MapQuest to calculate the distance between those stores, and compared that number to the reported mileage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 143-46). Pitts completed this process a second time, beginning and ending his MapQuest calculation from the Rochester facility, as opposed to the first and last customer store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148). In both instances, Pitts discovered that the same two Merchandisers had reported consistently higher mileage compared to MapQuest's calculations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 147, 150).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Morales was one of these two Merchandisers (the other was Campbell). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 151). Pitts determined that although Morales reported 1,595 miles traveled, MapQuest indicated that Morales only drove 1,083 miles, which resulted in a $ 290.40 reimbursement overpayment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152-53). Morales denies any wrongdoing. In Pitts's view, this conduct violated the rule against misrepresenting facts or falsifying company records or other documents and, in Morales's circumstance, also the Last Chance Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 154). As a result, Pitts terminated Morales's employment on July 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Morales's \"Speak Up\" Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following day, July 7, 2015, Morales reported Pitts and Sapp to the \"Speak Up\" line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 164, 167). Morales complained that Pitts and Sapp did not show him proof of falsified mileage reports, and believed that the issue was race discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 165-66). The HR Department concluded that his termination was justified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 168).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Campbell's Employment with Bottling Group\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Campbell began with Bottling Group on September 7, 2014. (Dkt. # C56-1 at \u00b6 84). Prior to that, Campbell worked as a Merchandiser at another Pepsi affiliate, which had similar training and policies, thus obviating the need for such training with Bottling Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85-88, 90). Campbell did not apply for a promotion or other position at Bottling Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 181, 183).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   He attended the March 27 Meeting, at which Flaherty discussed the new attendance policy, and told Campbell, as he did Morales, that there was a \"stink\" on him also due to performance issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). Campbell disputes that he had performance issues. During that meeting, Campbell told Flaherty and Pitts that he was being \"treated differently,\" but did not provide any specific examples of differential treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Attendance and Performance Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The attendance policy prohibited employees from texting supervisors about the need to take off work; rather, employees had to contact supervisors \"directly over the phone,\" and leave a voicemail if the supervisor was unavailable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109; Dkt. # C56-3 at 170). Bottling Group claims that Campbell violated the policy on April 6, 2015, and three times between April 24, 2015, and April 27, 2015, by texting his supervisor that he could not make a scheduled shift. (Dkt. # C56-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 120, 124). He did so again on April 28, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125). Campbell also apparently failed to follow P.R.E.M.I.E.R. policy on April 8, 2015, and April 11, 2015, by failing to scan-in and scan-out at one customer\n   store, and failing to check out with another customer before leaving the location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 121, 123). On May 2, 2015, Campbell left another store without the customer's signature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On May 6, 2015, Flaherty and Sapp met with Campbell and issued him two verbal warnings based on the April 28 and May 2 violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128). After that meeting, Campbell called the \"Speak Up\" line to report incidents with Flaherty that Campbell felt had happened because \"he is black, and Flaherty is white\" (the \"May 6 Complaint\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129). The following day, Pitts removed both verbal warnings, after learning that the April 28 and May 2 violations stemmed from medical issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 130). Beyond these verbal warnings, Campbell was not disciplined during his time at Botting Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The HR Department investigated the May 6 Complaint and determined that the verbal warnings were removed, and that other Merchandisers were being held accountable for violating company policies and P.R.E.M.I.E.R. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 139). Specifically, two Caucasian Merchandisers were on Last Chance Agreements, and one Caucasian Merchandiser had received a verbal warning, for failing to follow P.R.E.M.I.E.R. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also, Sapp replaced Flaherty as Campbell's supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Campbell's Termination from Bottling Group\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 22, 2015, Sapp spoke with Campbell after flagging his mileage reimbursement request for 688 miles as \"unusually high.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146-47, 149). Campbell then texted Pitts that, as a compromise, he would settle to be reimbursed for 420 miles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Campbell was, thereafter, subject to the Audit. Pitts determined that Campbell had submitted for 577 more miles than MapQuest's calculation, which resulted in a $ 331.78 reimbursement overpayment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 163-64). In Pitts's view, as with Morales, this violated Bottling Group's rules against misrepresenting facts or falsifying records or other documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 161, 166). Campbell denies any wrongdoing. Accordingly, and in consultation with the HR Department, Pitts terminated Campbell's employment on July 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Campbell's \"Speak Up\" Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Campbell, too, filed a \"Speak Up\" complaint on July 7, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 174). He complained that Pitts had not shown him evidence of his inaccurate mileage reporting, and indicated that he was terminated and \"targeted\" by Pitts and Sapp because of the May 6 Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 175-76). The HR Department concluded that his termination was justified.

First, he has not shown that he was qualified to be a Merchandiser at the time he was terminated in July 2015. Bottling Group had issued Morales the Last Chance Agreement in April 2015 after a series of performance issues, including the fact that\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   different customers had requested he no longer service their stores, and ultimately terminated Morales's employment for violating the terms of the Last Chance Agreement. This is enough to show that Morales was not qualified for the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Specifically, Morales has not identified any comparator who was treated more favorably than him, instead alleging that management \"treat[ed] minority employees differently than Caucasian employees,\" and subjected minorities to \"unequal terms, conditions, and privileges of employment as compared to non-minority employees.\" (Dkt. # M1 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Without more, such generalized allegations are insufficient to show that anyone was similarly situated to Morales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Thus, Morales cannot raise an inference of discrimination on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nor can Morales establish an inference of discrimination based on how management allegedly treated him leading up to his termination. Flaherty's \"stink\" comment at the March 27 Meeting cannot support such an inference. The evidence does not suggest that the comment was, in fact, racial, and, in any event, Flaherty neither recommended nor was involved in the decision to terminate Morales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nweze v.

In the absence of specific evidence showing otherwise, Morales's conclusory allegations and personal speculation, alone, is insufficient to infer discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boise v.

Initially, Campbell appeared to have his own performance issues in early April due to violating the attendance and P.R.E.M.I.E.R. policies, even though Bottling Group did not discipline him for such violations. Bottling Group also terminated him for misrepresenting facts and falsifying records related to mileage reimbursement. Therefore, there is at least a serious question as to whether Campbell was qualified to be a Merchandiser.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Fed.%20Appx.%2050\">\n    24 Fed.

Like Morales, Campbell has not established that non-minority, similarly situated employees were treated more favorably than him. In an effort to do so, Campbell argues that two Caucasian Merchandisers also falsified their mileage reports and were overpaid as a result, yet were not terminated. (Dkt. # C59 at 4, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). It is undisputed, though, that based on the Audit, Campbell reported miles 31% higher than what MapQuest calculated, whereas the two Caucasian Merchandisers only reported miles an average of 9% higher than MapQuest's calculations. (Dkt. # C64 at 22). According to Bottling Group, Pitts accounted for some differential in mileage calculations in the Audit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Still, Campbell's differential was 577 miles, compared to 36 miles and 56 miles in the case of the two Caucasian employees, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court does not find this vast difference to be \"comparable conduct,\" and therefore, finds that the two Caucasian employees were not similarly situated to Campbell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690711\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/486/#p491\">\n    609 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   493-94 ;\n   <em>\n    Parrilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20611849\">\n    2011 WL 611849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Aside from this, Campbell states in general terms that \"minority employees [were treated] differently than Caucasian employees[,] [m]inority employees were harassed[, and] [minority employees'] performance was criticized.\" (Dkt. # C1 at 7).

Pitts determined, after performing the Audit, that Morales inaccurately reported his miles from May 24, 2015, through June 28, 2015, which resulted in a $ 290.40 mileage reimbursement overpayment.

(Dkt. # C1 at 5, 8). Campbell admits that the May 6 Complaint was the only time he ever made an allegation of race discrimination while employed by Bottling Group, and that the verbal warnings which instigated the May 6 Complaint were removed from his file. (Dkt. # C56-3 at 56, 67). According to Campbell, though, after he complained, the \"[h]arassment and discrimination ramped up,\" (Dkt. # C58 at 10, \u00b6 16), and he was eventually fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Campbell's vague claim that \"[h]arassment and discrimination ramped up\" fails to set forth a materially adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bickerstaff v.

As discussed elsewhere, even after the benefit of discovery, Campbell provides no direct proof of discrimination on the part of Bottling Group, and provides no indirect proof related to other similarly situated employees. Therefore, Campbell only bases causation on the temporal proximity of the May 6 Complaint and his July 6 termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Again assuming, without deciding, that the temporal proximity of two months is sufficient to satisfy Campbell's prima facie case, Bottling Group puts forth a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating\n   Campbell. Specifically, Pitts determined that Campbell also falsified his miles from May 24, 2015, through June 28, 2015, which resulted in a $ 331.78 mileage reimbursement overpayment. In Pitts's view, this violated company rules. Therefore, as in Morales's case, the temporal proximity of the May 6 Complaint and termination, alone, cannot establish that Bottling Group's stated reason for Campbell's termination was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20Fed.%20Appx.%20107\">\n    416 Fed.
