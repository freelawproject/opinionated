Plaintiff Uttam Galva Steels Limited (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Uttam Galva\") initiated this action challenging the final determination in an antidumping duty investigation, in which the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"Commerce\") found that certain corrosion-resistant steel products from India are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less-than-fair value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products From India\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2035%2C329\">\n    81 Fed.

For the reasons discussed below, the court concludes that Commerce's modified calculation of Uttam Galva's weighted-average dumping margin\n   is unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with the law. The\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court presumes familiarity with the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uttam Galva I\n   </em>\n   . The one issue in dispute was whether Commerce reasonably calculated Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment by allocating import duties rebated and exempted by reason of export of finished product over total cost of production. The court concluded that Commerce's methodology was not permitted under the governing statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(b) (2012), and remanded Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   with directions to recalculate Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment using a different methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Commerce filed its\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   under protest on August 16, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 1. Commerce recalculated Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment by allocating import duties rebated and exempted by reason of export of finished product over total exports, as reported by Uttam Galva.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.

Pursuant to Commerce's modified calculations, Uttam Galva's weighted-average dumping margin changed from 3.05% in the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   to 3.11% in the Remand Results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Uttam Galva filed comments on the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Comments Remand Redetermination, Sept. 25, 2018, ECF No. 86 (\"Pl.'s Comments\").

Both the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   and Defendant's comments in support of the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   quote language from\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   discussing why export price, cost of production, and constructed value \"should be increased together, or not at all\" in order to achieve a \"duty-neutral\" comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 18, 22; Def.'s Reply 8. This reference to\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   is taken out of context. As explained by the court before, the quoted passage in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   relates \"to an adjustment to normal value with respect to the particular facts, exemption program, and recordkeeping practices presented in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   , and should not be expanded to encompass all duty drawback adjustment calculations made by Commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Uttam Galva I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525282\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1345/#p1357\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When viewed in this context,\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   \"does not support Commerce's methodology in the instant matter before this court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525282\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1345/#p1357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce's justification for the circumstance of sale adjustment is untenable in light of the court's previous interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court reiterates that Commerce's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   concerned Commerce's separate calculations of U.S. price and of cost of production\n   and constructed value. Generally, Commerce makes a duty drawback adjustment to a respondent's U.S. price to account for duties rebated and exempted by reason of exportation of the finished product to the United States. Commerce makes a separate adjustment to a respondent's cost of production and constructed value to reflect import duties incurred when the finished product is sold in the home market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Habas Sinai ve Tibbi Gazlar Istihsal Endustrisi A.S. v.United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529747\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/361/1314/\">\n    361 F.Supp.3d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1320 &amp; n.8 (2019) (distinguishing Commerce's duty drawback adjustment to U.S. price, which the opinion refers to as the \"sales-side adjustment,\" and Commerce's adjustment to cost of production and constructed value, which the opinion refers to as the \"cost-side adjustment\").\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   sustained Commerce's utilization of these two corresponding adjustments but did not hold that the two adjustments should be \"equal\" or \"duty neutral,\" as Commerce and Defendant continue to espouse here.\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   does not support Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Commerce reasoned in the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   that the additional circumstance of sale adjustment was necessary to correct a perceived imbalance in the dumping margin calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Commerce again departs from the legislative purpose of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B) in an impermissible way. As stated in the court's previous Opinion and Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The purpose of a duty drawback adjustment is to ensure a fair comparison between normal value (\"NV\") and export price (\"EP\"). Under a duty drawback program, producers may receive an exemption or rebate for imported inputs used in exported merchandise. As a result, producers are still required to pay import duties for domestically-sold goods, which leads to an increase in normal value. A duty drawback adjustment corrects this imbalance, which could otherwise lead to an inaccurately high dumping margin, by increasing EP to the level it likely would be absent the duty drawback.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Uttam Galva I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525282\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1345/#p1357\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted). The upward adjustment to export price contemplated by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B) aids Commerce's statutory duty to make a fair comparison between normal value and export price in antidumping duty investigations. Commerce's action on remand here negates the statutory duty drawback adjustment that Uttam Galva earned by exporting its finished product to the United States and impinges on the agency's ability to make a fair comparison. The court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   are not in accordance with the law and remands this case again for a second redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As Plaintiff argues, Commerce's adjustment to Uttam Galva's normal value creates an additional problem within the dumping calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Comments 13-15. Commerce accounts for Uttam Galva's import duties incurred when subject merchandise was sold in the home market. Specifically, Commerce makes an upward adjustment to the cost of production and constructed value, which are part of Commerce's overall calculation of Uttam Galva's normal value. Commerce's circumstance of sale adjustment in this case double-counts Uttam Galva's import duties within normal value because Commerce's original calculation incorporated already the import duties incurred for merchandise sold in the home market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. from A. Sepulveda to N. Halper re: Cost of Production and Constructed Value Calculation Adjustments for the Final Determination - Uttam Galva Steels Limited at 2, PD 417, bar code 3473140-01 (May 26, 2016).
