Plaintiff responded and defendants replied. In this posture, the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For the following reasons, defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on February 20, 2018, in Wake County Superior Court arising out of his work as an insurance agent for defendant The Leazer Group, Inc. (\"TLG\"), a North Carolina corporation allegedly controlled by defendant Benny Art Leazer (\"Leazer\"). Plaintiff asserts claims under North Carolina law on behalf of himself and a proposed class of all similarly situated persons and entites who were also TLG agents, based upon breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, trebled damages, punitive damages, declaratory judgment, class certification, jury trial, attorney's fees, costs, expenses, and interest. Plaintiff attaches to his complaint as Exhibit A an \"Agent Agreement\" that plaintiff allegedly executed with defendant TLG (hereinafter\n   the \"Agent Agreement\" or the \"agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss on June 29, 2018, asserting that all claims fail as a matter of law and should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6). The court stayed scheduling activities pending decision on the motion. Plaintiff responded in opposition on August 10, 2018, and defendants replied on August 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts alleged in the complaint may be summarized as follows. Plaintiff is a Tennessee resident. Defendant TLG \"is an insurance marketing organization founded and controlled by [defendant Leazer] and specializing in mortgage protection insurance, burial insurance (also known as \"final expense insurance\"), annuities, and index universal life insurance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to plaintiff, \"TLG is structured as a 'multi-level marketing' or 'pyramid selling' scheme, a ... marketing strategy whereby TLG's revenue is obtained by hawking various products and services to a sales team comprised of independent insurance contractors,\" referenced in the complaint as \"TLG Agents,\" \"who are themselves contractually obligated to both purchase these products and services from TLG and to exclusively market and sell TLG's insurance products to retail customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"TLG sells so-called 'leads' to TLG Agents,\" where the \"leads contain the contact information for potential retail purchasers of the insurance products offered by TLG through TLG Agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). \"The insurance products themselves are sourced from third party insurance companies who have agreed to provide TLG and Leazer with the rights to market certain policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to plaintiff, \"TLG erects a pyramid-type commission scheme for commission distribution,\" which is \"created when one TLG Agent recruits a second TLG Agent,\" and the \"second TLG Agent is then deemed 'down-line' from the first TLG Agent, and the first TLG Agent receives a portion of the commissions generated from the second TLG Agent's retail sales, as does TLG.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). The process continues \"so on down the line\" as new agents are recruited. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff entered into an \"Agent Agreement\" with TLG, on or about March 23, 2016, in the position of \"Independent Contractor\" referenced in the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; pp. 33-48).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Agent Agreement provides that \"in consideration of (i) this contract to sell the products of the Contracted Insurance Companies through TLG's relationship with such companies ... [ii] marketing incentives from time to time made available by the Contracted Insurance Companies through TLJ; (iii) access for a limited time to marketing tools and services and (iv) other good and valuable consideration, including but not limited to a one-time $ 100.00 credit toward each existing Independent Contractor's purchase of leads,\" the parties agree to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Agent Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Among those terms and conditions, \"TLG has developed a lead program (the \"Lead Program\") to allow its associated insurance agents to buy leads from TLG in connection with the sale of insurance and recruiting insurance agents for TLJ Contracted\n   Insurance Companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35). Pertinent terms of the Lead Program in the agreement are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   a. Request for Leads. The Independent Contractor's acceptance of the terms of this Agreement constitutes his/her request for TLG to supply Independent Contractor with leads at the rate assigned to the applicable commission level at the time of purchase of such leads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   b. Diligent Use of Leads. Independent Contractor agrees to use best efforts to work and solicit the number of leads requested on a weekly basis and to ensure that any leads provided to the Independent Contractor or Independent Contractor's down-line agents are diligently and legally solicited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). As part of his obligations as an Independent Contractor under the agreement, plaintiff agreed \"that all leads provided to [him] or to [his] down-line agents must only be used (i) to sell insurance or products authorized by TLG through TLG or TLG Contracted Insurance Companies or (ii) to recruit insurance agents to sell insurance or products through TLG Contracted Insurance Companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Provision of and payment for leads is further governed by the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   d. TLG to Supply Leads. TLG, by itself or through its agents, contractors or assigns, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Independent Contractor leads on a weekly basis so long as such leads are available and Independent Contractor is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   e. Payment for Leads; Default. Independent Contractor agrees to pay for each lead received by It (exclusive of any free leads that may be provided by TLG from time to time), including any associated charges assessed by TLG from time to time relating to the Lead Program, as detailed in Invoices submitted by TLG. In the event of default on any obligation to pay TLG, Independent Contractor shall be responsible for and promptly pay (i) interest on the amount owed at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest legally permitted rate, whichever Is lower; and (ii) TLG's costs of collecting such debt, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, plaintiff agreed \"to pay all charges or costs for leads received by [his] down-line agents, should such agents fail to pay for such lead costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He agreed \"to guarantee payment and performance of [his] down-line down-line agents ... even if the down-line agent's obligations are discharged in bankruptcy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36). The agreement allowed plaintiff to \"withdraw from the Lead Program with thirty (30) days prior written notice to TLG.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). It also allowed TLG to \"terminate or suspend [plaintiff's] participation in the Lead Program upon written notice by TLG.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As part of the agreement TLG agreed to provide plaintiff temporary access to TLG products, described as \"tools, websites, products, services and incentives of TLG as are generally offered to all insurance agents associated with TLG.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44). The agreement provided that plaintiff's access to TLG's products may cease when TLG notifies plaintiff in writing, and that plaintiff \"may renew [his] access to the TLG products only\" under conditions set forth in the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As part of the agreement, plaintiff also acknowledged he \"is or will be one of many Independent Contractors associated with TLG.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). Plaintiff also acknowledged that the Agent Agreement \"contains the entire\n   Agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that \"in its marketing materials directed to Plaintiff and other prospective TLG Agents, TLG and Leazer promised 'fresh, high quality direct mail leads! [O]ur exclusive Mortgage Protection Platinum Direct Mail Lead program is unique and enables our agents to yield a much higher ROI (rate of return) on their marketing investments than other lead sources.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). According to plaintiff, \"TLG's leads are neither generated in-house nor proprietary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Rather, as is common in the industry, TLG and Leazer purchase leads from certain third-party vendors who specialize in selling leads to insurance agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). \"TLG and Leazer then re-sell these third-party leads to TLG Agents at an inflated price without informing the TLG Agents that the leads they are purchasing were generated by a third party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"TLG would typically purchase the leads from a third-party vendor with a 90-day term of exclusive use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). \"TLG and Leazer do not disclose any of this information to the TLG Agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, \"TLG and Leazer do not provide the TLG Agents with the dates that TLG purchased its leads from third-party vendors. Accordingly, TLG Agents have no way to know or assess how long they have exclusive use of any particular lead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). According to plaintiff, defendants knew \"that if TLG Agents learned that the leads were sourced from third parties, they would purchase the leads from the third parties at a lower price rather than through TLG and Leazer at the inflated price.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to plaintiff, \"TLG's leads are offered through a tiered purchasing system and pricing structure wherein leads are offered and priced based upon the age of leads,\" described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   According to its published materials, TLG offers five levels of leads as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"PLATINUM LEADS - Our direct mail Platinum are our most exclusive leads and are highly sought after by all of our agents. A Platinum lead is a fresh direct mail lead that is uploaded into our lead management system within 24 hours of receipt. Agents have access to purchasing these leads 24/7 utilizing our state of the art lead management system, OPT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 TLG GOLD LEADS - A Gold lead is simply a Platinum lead that has not been sold to an agent but is now reached an age of 90 days. The lead is then changed to a Gold lead with a discounted price to the agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 TLG B-1 LEADS - These are leads that were distributed 1x to another TLG agent but did not sell a policy within a 5 week exclusive period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 TLG B-2 LEADS These are leads that were distributed 1x to another TLG agent as a B1 lead and they did not sell a policy within a 5 week exclusive period or the leads were sold as a Platinum lead but never resold as a B1 lead then the lead will automatically become a B2 lead after 12 weeks from the date it was originally sold as a Platinum lead in OPT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 TLG RW (Re-work) LEADS \"Leads that were never sold a policy and were distributed to another agent (non-TLG) and were generated 10-18 months prior to becoming an RW lead. These can be a great source of income for many agents who are working with limited budget as well who need to improve their phone and closing skills.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"In his role as a TLG Agent, [plaintiff] began purchasing leads from TLG in April\n   2016, as is required by the Agent Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). Plaintiff \"purchased Platinum leads from TLG and Leazer, typically at a price in excess of $ 40.00 per lead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). \"Had [plaintiff] been informed by TLG and Leazer that the leads were purchased from third party vendors, that the leads were not proprietary, and that he did not have 90-days exclusive use, [plaintiff] would never have purchased leads from TLG and Leazer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Indeed, the market price for may such leads is as low as $ 3.00-$ 4.00.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). \"Dillon did not know any of this information at the time he purchased leads from TLG and Leazer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff describes his experience with certain leads he purchased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [In] attempting to make retail sales of TLG insurance products, Dillon discovered that many of the retail customers he contacted through the allegedly Platinum leads he purchased complained that he contacted them long after they filled out the form indicating that they were interested in purchasing insurance products. Dillon discovered that other TLG Agents had the same experience with allegedly Platinum leads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of these complaints from retail customers, Dillon questioned the age of the allegedly Platinum leads to his up-line agents, Jerry Blackburn, Bill South, and Nicholas Homer, all of whom were higher up the pyramid from Dillon and recipients of commission overrides sourced from retail sales made by Dillon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Each of Dillon's up-line agents accused the prospective retail customers of lying and flatly denied ever having similar problems themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Unconvinced, [plaintiff] raised the issue with TLG directly, who initially denied that any allegedly Platinum leads were older than 90 days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). Plaintiff \"continued to pursue this issue with TLG, despite this initial denial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"An in-house TLG manager reiterated this denial to [plaintiff] via telephone and email on several occasions before ceasing correspondence with him for several weeks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"When correspondence resumed, TLG's in-house manager admitted that some of the allegedly Platinum leads were older than 90 days, though she refused to disclose with specificity which leads she was referring to.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). \"TLG refused to provide [plaintiff] with a full refund for the leads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Rather, TLG merely offered [plaintiff] a small credit for the purchase of future TLG leads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff \"rejected this ... offer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Shortly thereafter, \"TLG and Leazer locked [plaintiff] out of all company websites and online agent support sites, despite the fact that Dillon had paid TLG and Leazer for these services. Likewise, Dillon was unable to access leads that he had already paid for and was not offered a refund or reimbursement for these leads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). \"TLG and Leazer did so without providing [plaintiff] ... written notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, defendants changed plaintiff's \"compensation rate from the industry standard 9-month commission advance, which is the compensation rate Leazer promises to LTG Agents when recruiting them to join TLG, to 'as earned,' meaning that [plaintiff] would receive commission on a monthly basis for any retail sales rather than receiving the first 9-months commission as a lump sum at the time the sale is processed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). Finally, defendants transferred plaintiff's \"down-line TLG Agents to other TLG Agents, thereby ... depriving [plaintiff] of ... commission[s] from the retail sales of his down-line TLG Agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69).

The Agent Agreement requires defendant TLG \"to use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to [plaintiff] leads on a weekly basis so long as such leads are available and [plaintiff] is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\" (Compl. at 35). Plaintiff does not allege facts permitting an inference that defendant failed to comply with this provision.

But, the Agent Agreement does not specify the characteristics of the leads sold, nor does it require TLG to disclose the characteristics of the leads sold. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). It only requires \"TLG to Supply Leads\" and requires plaintiff \"to pay for each lead received by\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to rates, it provides that plaintiff's \"acceptance of the terms of this Agreement constitutes [his] request for TLG\n   <em>\n    to supply [him] with\n   </em>\n   leads at the rate assigned to the applicable commission level at the time of purchase of such leads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) ). While plaintiff suggests that the leads plaintiff purchased were not of the value or quality that he expected, the Agent Agreement does not guarantee any particular results from leads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff argues that a duty of good faith and fair dealing \"provides the missing terms of the agreement that necessarily flow from the parties' intentions,\" thus requiring defendant TLG to provide plaintiff with certain characteristics of lead as reflected in \"defendants' representations of its products.\" (Pl.'s Resp.

(DE 15) at 22 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 31) ). He states: \"For instance, TLG and Leazer induce prospective TLG Agents to join TLG by promising the opportunity of significant 'passive' income through the development of a stream of income from commission overrides on the earnings of down-line agents.\" (Compl. \u00b6 32). Plaintiff also states that \"in ... marketing materials directed to Plaintiff and other prospective TLG Agents, TLG and Leazer promised '[f]resh, high quality direct mail leads! ... [o]ur exclusive Mortgage Protection Platinum Direct Mail Lead program is unique and enables our agents to yield a much higher ROI (rate of return) on their marketing investments than other lead sources.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Notably missing from plaintiff's complaint are any specific allegations as to what communications (allegedly fraudulent or otherwise) were made to plaintiff prior to his execution of the Agent Agreement on March 23, 2016. There is no allegation as to\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   made any such statements to plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   such statements were made,\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   were the specific contents of such statements, nor\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   such statements were made. Plaintiff's fraud claims based thereon must therefore be dismissed for failure to comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, with respect to the quoted \"marketing materials directed to Plaintiff,\" (Compl. \u00b6 19), plaintiff has not alleged any facts permitting an inference that such quoted marketing materials contain a \"[f]alse representation or concealment of a material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Forbis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739573\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/361/519/#p526\">\n    361 N.C. at 526-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12639168\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/649/382/\">\n    649 S.E.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff alleges, for example, that \"TLG's leads are neither generated in-house nor proprietary.\" (Compl. \u00b6 20), but the quoted marketing materials do not promise \"in-house\" or \"proprietary\" leads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Similarly, plaintiff alleges that leads \"were not exclusive to TLG Agents,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22), but the quoted marketing materials do not promise leads \"exclusive to TLG Agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Finally, plaintiff alleges that defendants sold him leads \"well into or even after the expiration of the 90-day term,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24), but the quoted marketing materials do not promise leads within a 90-day term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Thus, plaintiff fails to state a claim for fraud where there is a mismatch between, on the one hand, the specific statements plaintiff suggests were fraudulent and, on the other hand, what plaintiff alleges he was promised but did not receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, plaintiff has not pleaded an independent fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment claim against defendant TLG with requisite specificity, and plaintiff has not pleaded facts permitting an inference of a false representation or concealment of a material fact. Therefore, in addition to being barred by the economic loss rule, plaintiff's tort claims against defendant TLG based upon fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   c. Tort Claims Against Defendant Leazer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff suggests in his brief that he may assert tort claims against defendant Leazer without bar of the economic loss rule, where plaintiff does not assert a breach of contract claim against defendant Leazer. Plaintiff's tort claims, all of which are grounded in part in fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment, fail for lack of specificity in pleading in the manner described above with respect to defendant\n   TLG. Moreover, with respect to defendant Leazer, plaintiff has failed to plead conduct by Leazer or any personal duty towards plaintiff to subject him to individual liability for torts asserted in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lillian Knitting Mills Co. v.

Accordingly, the court rejects plaintiff's assertion that statements or acts of defendant TLG are \"one-and-the-same.\" (Pl.'s Resp. (DE 15) at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiff's claim of civil conspiracy against defendant Leazer fails because \"acts of corporate agents are acts of the corporation itself, and corporate employees cannot conspire with each other or with the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Godfredson v.

While plaintiff suggests that this rule does not apply where corporate employee's \"actions exceeded the bounds of their authority,\" (Pl.'s Resp. (DE 15) at 23), plaintiff has not alleged facts permitting an inference that defendant Leazer's actions exceeded the bounds of his authority as an agent for defendant TLG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, plaintiff's tort claims against defendant Leazer must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   3.

Rather, he expressly alleges the existence of a contract \"which governs the business relationship between [plaintiff] and TLG,\" and he attaches the contract to his complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 44).

But, where plaintiff himself alleges the existence of a contract governing his relationship with TLG and attaches the contract to his complaint, plaintiff has not alleged facts upon which a plausible inference may\n   be made of the absence of a contract between plaintiff and defendant TLG. Thus, under federal pleading rules, plaintiff has not stated facts sufficient to assert a claim of unjust enrichment, in the alternative or otherwise, against defendant TLG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   With respect to defendant Leazer, plaintiff has not pleaded facts giving rise to an inference that plaintiff conferred a benefit upon him as an individual. Indeed, plaintiff does not allege any interaction or communication between plaintiff and defendant Leazer. While plaintiff bases his unjust enrichment claim on \"numerous misrepresentations and omissions made by Defendants to Plaintiff,\" (compl. \u00b6 116), as discussed above, plaintiff does not allege any personal conduct by Leazer to plaintiff or from plaintiff to Leazer, to support a claim of unjust enrichment, or any other claim asserted, against Leazer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Therefore, plaintiff's claim of unjust enrichment must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   4.
