(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff has since reached the age of majority and has been substituted as the new party plaintiff. (Dkt. 58 at 1 n.1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57). On August 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging that Maryellen Elia, in her official capacity as Commissioner of Education of the State of New York (the \"Commissioner\"), the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, Inc., and Section IV of the New York Public High School Athletic Association, Inc. (\"Section IV\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") unlawfully denied him extended athletic eligibility to play a fifth consecutive year of high school basketball in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"ADA\"), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 504\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19 at 9-11). On December 4, 2017, this Court issued a Decision and Order denying Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and denying the Commissioner's motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 58). Plaintiff has since filed a second amended complaint (the \"SAC\"), which remains the operative pleading in this action, and seeks compensatory damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. (Dkt. 81). All Defendants have answered the SAC. (Dkt. 84; Dkt. 87; Dkt. 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 15, 2018, the Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the SAC or, in the alternative, a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Dkt. 89). Specifically, the Commissioner contends that Plaintiff's requests for declaratory and injunctive relief should be dismissed as moot because the 2017-2018 basketball season is over and Plaintiff is preparing to graduate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the rest of Plaintiff's action be dismissed based on the doctrines of absolute judicial immunity and absolute legislative immunity. (Dkt. 89-1 at 4-10). In the alternative, the Commissioner contends that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for compensatory damages under Section 504 because Plaintiff has insufficiently alleged that the Commissioner intentionally discriminated against him, and that Plaintiff's ADA claim for money damages should be dismissed based on sovereign immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-15). Plaintiff opposes the Commissioner's motion in all respects, but he concedes that \"compensatory damages pursuant to the ADA are not available to him from a state defendant like [the Commissioner].\" (Dkt. 93 at 11 n.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts of this litigation, which are described in more detail in the Court's December 4, 2017, Decision and Order. (Dkt. 58). For the following reasons, the\n   Commissioner's motion to dismiss the SAC (Dkt. 89) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Commissioner argues that because an application to extend Plaintiff's athletic eligibility was filed and then proceeded through the administrative review process, the Commissioner's order denying Plaintiff's participation during the 2017-2018 basketball season was a judicial or quasi-judicial act that warrants absolute immunity from all claims arising from that determination.

While the Commissioner acknowledges that the Court previously rejected this argument, allowing her to reassert it \"in a subsequent motion supported by a more fully developed argument\" (Dkt. 58 at 26), the Commissioner's motion papers provide little if any additional reason for this Court to apply the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity to the facts presented (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 89-1 at 9-10,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 46-1 at 15-16).

If a board of education has adopted a policy, pursuant to subclause (a)(4) of this subparagraph, to permit pupils in the seventh and eighth grades to compete in senior high school athletic competition, such pupils shall be eligible for competition during five consecutive seasons of a sport commencing with the pupil's entry into the eighth grade, or six consecutive seasons of a sport commencing with the pupil's entry into the seventh grade. A pupil enters competition in a given year when the pupil is a member of the team in the sport involved, and that team has completed at least one contest. A pupil shall be eligible for interschool competition in grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 until the last day of the school year in which he or she attains the age of 19, except as otherwise provided in subclause (a)(4) or clause (d) of this subparagraph, or in this subclause.
