Barse's administrative claim was untimely, and thus his complaint under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is barred by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although the Anti-Injunction Act includes several statutory exceptions, none have been asserted by Barse, and the court does not find any applicable here. Barse fails to plead any statute that would waive sovereign immunity for the court to have jurisdiction over his action. Thus, to the extent that Barse seeks to enjoin the collection of any outstanding federal tax liabilities or levies, or seeks declaratory relief as it pertains to federal taxes, such a suit is barred under the Tax Anti-Injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Finally, even if the declaratory relief Barse seeks is instead construed as a request for the court to \"cancel\" a particular levy by way of requesting a credit or refund of previously levied funds under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), that claim is barred by the time limitations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and for the reasons discussed at length above. Thus, the court is without jurisdiction over Barse's declaratory or injunctive request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Barse's claim for refund or credit is barred by sovereign immunity because Barse has failed to plead that he complied with the jurisdictional prerequisites of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207422\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to properly maintain a tax refund claim in federal district court.
