The law firm of Butler Wooten was the owner and beneficiary of the policy at that time. In 2006, several attorneys, including Daughtery, left Butler Wooten to form their own firm. Those partners formed a firm called \"Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP.\" The firm created and filed a limited liability partnership election. The firm also\n   became the owner and beneficiary of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2012, Clay Fuller left the partnership to become a federal magistrate. The remaining partners then created and filed a new limited liability partnership election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal Ex. A, Superior Court Compl. Exs., Limited Liability Partnership Election of Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP (Sept. 6, 2012), ECF No. 1-2 at 46-47 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1-2 at 26-45 (partnership agreement for Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP). The owner and beneficiary of the policy remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Daughtery died on October 29, 2017. Dustin Brown then submitted a proof of claim to American General, which American General received on November 22. Several weeks passed, and Brown did not hear from American General acknowledging receipt of the claim. Brown Aff. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 21-1. He then called American General on December 11, 2017 and was told the claim was being processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On that date, he also sent a demand letter for payment within 60 days pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The statutory demand indicates that payment is being sought by the partnership Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from D. Brown to AIG (Dec. 11, 2017), ECF No. 13-15. It is undisputed, however, that the owner and beneficiary of the policy was Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP. It also appears clear that Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP and Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP were separate legal entities, and it is unclear whether at the time of the demand Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP was the legal successor to Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Dep. 45:9-13, ECF No. 13. The demand does not mention the relationship between the two partnerships. American General received the demand letter on December 17. Therefore, the deadline for payment imposed by the letter would have been February 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brown followed up regularly with American General after submitting the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Dep. Exs. 17-26, ECF Nos. 13-17 to 13-26 (transcripts of phone calls between Brown and American General representatives). Nobody ever informed Brown that there was any issue with the identity of the beneficiary. Brown Aff. \u00b6 13. Although American General's policies typically require processing and payment within ten days, Dorothy Lomas, a claims examiner for American General, did not receive the claim until January 24. Lomas Dep. 11:15-21, ECF No. 14. Lomas noticed the discrepancy between the beneficiary named in the policy and the name of the claimant; thus she referred the claim to management for further review. Lomas then contacted Brown on February 9 regarding the discrepancy. Brown responded by faxing documentation regarding Judge Fuller's departure and the firm name change. Brown Aff. \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fax from D. Brown to D. Lomas (Feb. 9, 2018), ECF No. 13-28 at 3-10 (partnership election of Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP, deed of property from Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP to Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP, and partnership election of Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP). Although Brown had originally asserted the claim in the name of Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP, he told Lomas that American General could instead write the check to Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP, which was the name of the owner and beneficiary listed on the policy. Brown Aff. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter from D. Brown to D. Lomas (Feb. 9, 2018), ECF No. 13-28. Brown received no response from American General by the February 14 payment deadline. American General then paid the claim to Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown,\n   LLP with interest on February 20, which was eleven days after Brown explained for the first time the discrepancy between the name of the claimant and the name of the owner and insured under the policy. Because payment was not made by February 14, Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP brought this action, claiming that American General's failure to make payment within 60 days of the original demand was in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under Georgia law, \"[i]n the event of a loss which is covered by a policy of insurance and the refusal of the insurer to pay the same within 60 days after a demand has been made by the holder of the policy and a finding has been made that such refusal was in bad faith, the insurer shall be liable to pay such holder, in addition to the loss, not more than 50 percent of the liability of the insurer for the loss ... and all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution of the action against the insurer.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6(a). \"Bad faith for purposes of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6 is any frivolous and unfounded refusal in law or in fact to pay according to the terms of the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP was the holder of this policy. It is clearly listed as both the owner and the beneficiary. This does not mean that Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP did not eventually become entitled to the proceeds from the policy. But when the demand was first made, there was no indication at that time that Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP had become the holder of the policy. American General was never notified of the partnership change prior to the demand. It only became aware of facts suggesting that Daughtery, Crawford &amp; Brown, LLP was the legal successor to Daughtery, Crawford, Fuller &amp; Brown, LLP when Brown sent it additional information on February 9. And even based on that information, it was not entirely clear who exactly had the legal right to the proceeds. Nevertheless, American General paid the entire claim within eleven days of receiving that information. The Court finds no bad faith refusal to pay under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the reasons explained above, American General's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 11 ) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED, this 10th day of April, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
