Stegemann's premises pursuant to a\n   New York search warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5, 12, 24, 27; Dkt. No. 44, Attach. 1.) A few days later, the Berkshire County Drug Task Force seized $ 160,020.00 inside a safe at Stegemann's sister's residence pursuant to a Massachusetts search warrant. (Am.

Thereafter, the government obtained\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   turnover orders\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the respective state courts, which authorized a transfer of the seized property identified above (hereinafter \"the defendant property\") to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for the commencement of administrative forfeiture proceedings, \"upon probable cause to believe that it was used to facilitate a violation of a drug offense or represents drug proceeds.\" (Dkt. No. 44, Attachs. 3, 4.) Following execution of the turnover orders, the DEA served administrative forfeiture notice upon Stegemann; in turn, Stegemann filed claims for the defendant property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 18, 2013, a grand jury indicted Stegemann, charging him with violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (possession with intent to distribute controlled substances),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A) (possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) (possession of firearms and ammunition by a prohibited person). (Dkt. No. 10, 1:13-cr-357 at 1-2.) The indictment also included a forfeiture allegation naming the defendant property, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), as proceeds from and property used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6.) After lengthy motion practice\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a trial, a jury convicted Stegemann on all counts, (Dkt. No. 150, 1:13-cr-357), and determined that the defendant property was subject to forfeiture, (Dkt. No. 151, 1:13-cr-357). Thereafter, the court ordered forfeiture of the defendant property. (Dkt. No. 208, 1:13-cr-357.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, on appeal to the Second Circuit, the government conceded that it failed to demonstrate the requisite nexus between the defendant property and the criminal activity outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) because, in its opinion, \"the evidence at trial proved only that the cash was likely the proceeds of prior drug transactions and that the [SUV]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   was the instrumentality of prior drug transactions.\" (\n   <em>\n    United States of America v. Stegemann\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 16-2596, Dkt. No. 75 at 60-62.) On the same day as the government's concession, it filed this civil forfeiture proceeding alleging that the defendant property is subject to forfeiture pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and (6). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, Dkt. No. 1.) Eventually, the Second Circuit reversed the order of forfeiture as to the defendant property, based on the government's lack of opposition. (Dkt. No. 223, 1:13-cr-357.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stegemann then sought dismissal of the government's complaint\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   as well as various other forms of relief, (Dkt. No. 10), which the court denied, (Dkt. No. 31). At the time, the court noted that \"the government has thus far failed to convince the court that it took the proper steps to maintain custody of the [defendant] property or that [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 983(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) is not implicated,\" but it stopped short of fully addressing the argument because it was improperly raised in Stegemann's reply papers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.2.) Thereafter, the government filed an amended complaint, (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 32), which was followed by Stegemann's pending motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule G(5)(b) of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), (Dkt. No. 33).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stegemann argues that, like the initial complaint\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , the amended complaint\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   must be dismissed because the government failed to satisfy the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(ii)(II).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Attach. 1 at 9-13.) For the following reasons, Stegemann's motion is denied with leave to renew in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The general rules regarding civil forfeiture proceedings are outlined by Section 2 of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), P.L.106-185,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Stat.%20202\">\n    114 Stat. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), which is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) and states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (A) Not later than 90 days after a claim has been filed, the [g]overnment shall file a complaint for forfeiture in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims or return the property pending the filing of a complaint, except that a court in the district in which the complaint will be filed may extend the period for filing a complaint for good cause shown or upon agreement of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (B) If the [g]overnment does not-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) file a complaint for forfeiture or return the property, in accordance with subparagraph (A); or\n   (ii)\n   <strong>\n    before the time for filing a complaint has expired\n   </strong>\n   -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (I) obtain a criminal indictment containing an allegation that the property is subject to forfeiture;\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (II)\n   <strong>\n    take the steps necessary to preserve its right to maintain custody of the property as provided in the applicable criminal forfeiture statute\n   </strong>\n   ,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    the [g]overnment shall promptly release the property\n   </strong>\n   pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General,\n   <strong>\n    and may not take any further action to effect the civil forfeiture of such property in connection with the underlying offense\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (C) In lieu of, or in addition to, filing a civil forfeiture complaint, the [g]overnment may include a forfeiture allegation in a criminal indictment.

Given that the government retained the defendant property and did not file a civil forfeiture complaint within ninety days of Stegemann's claims, it was required to satisfy the mandates of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B) in order to preserve its ability to later seek civil forfeiture of the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A),(B). The court has already decided that the government satisfied \u00a7 983(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) by indicting Stegemann and naming the defendant property in the indictment. (Dkt. No. 31 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The only issue now before the court is whether the government \"t[ook] the steps necessary to preserve its right to maintain custody of the [defendant] property as provided in [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ],\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as required by \u00a7 983(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II).

(Dkt. No. 44 at 8-13.) First, there is no merit in the government's contention that \"neither Section 983(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) or 983(a)(3)(B) is applicable\" because \"[t]he property was seized by the government pursuant to a search ... warrant and turnover orders.\" (Dkt.

This argument seems to rely on the government's contention that the initial seizure of the defendant property satisfied the civil forfeiture seizure provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i).

However, the government's argument misses the\n   mark given that the government eventually decided to commence these civil forfeiture proceedings.

(Dkt. No. 44 at 12.) The court in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lindell\n   </em>\n   , CR NO. 13-512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204707976\">\n    2016 WL 4707976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (D.

That is plainly not the case here. The only other case cited by the government,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Were the court to adopt the position that all the government had to do to preserve its ability to file a subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding was name the defendant property in the criminal indictment within ninety days of Stegemann's claim, it would render \u00a7 983(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) wholly superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

Moreover, were the court to adopt the government's position, CAFRA's procedural safeguards could be easily circumvented, given that Supp. Rule G(3)(b) requires the court clerk to issue a warrant of arrest\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   for property in the government's possession without the need for any probable cause determination. Under such circumstances, there would be no initial check on the government's continued possession of property, which is the very type of abuse that Congress sought to curb by enacting CAFRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5217395\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/460/669/#p675\">\n    460 F.Supp.2d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"CAFRA comprised a series of reforms to strengthen the rights of the owners of seized property, including a deadline for the [g]overnment to act on claims made by an interested party in response to notice of an intended forfeiture.\"). Instead, the government has an \"obligation to give effect to the very clear and precise language of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B) ] which authorizes no short cut seizure or continued retention\n   of a citizen's property.\"\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203545026\">\n    2006 WL 3545026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, the government argues that it was unnecessary to take additional steps to hold the defendant property for the purpose of forfeiture because the defendant property was held for evidence in the criminal proceedings. (Dkt. No. 44 at 9-11.) However, the government fails to develop this argument. That is, the government does not identify the evidentiary value of the defendant property or specify how long it persisted. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203545026\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This is troublesome because a review of the record suggests that the evidentiary value of some or all of the defendant property expired prior to the initiation of this civil forfeiture proceeding. That is, the evidentiary value of the currency seized from Stegemann's premises was arguably lost on May 1, 2013, when the sums were deposited into bank accounts. (Dkt. No. 29 at 11, 13\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198426\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/140/513/#p521\">\n    140 F.Supp.3d at 521, 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This reasoning would obviously apply with equal weight to the currency seized from the safe at Stegemann's sister's residence. However, it is unclear whether the agency responsible for seizing that currency followed the same protocol as the agency responsible for seizing the currency from Stegemann's premises. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 184 at 191, 262-63, 1:13-cr-357,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 185 at 363, 1:13-cr-357.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Also tending to indicate the evaporation of the defendant property's evidentiary value, the SUV and the currency seized at Stegemann's premises have been in Marshals Service custody since May 23, 2013, (Dkt. Nos. 161, 162, 1:13-cr-357), and the currency seized from the safe has been in Marshals Service custody since at least September 2015, (Dkt. No. 171, 1:13-cr-357). Although not dispositive, it is concerning that the government's policy manual indicates that \"[t]he [Marshals Service] does not store property held as evidence, even when it is subject to forfeiture. Such property is retained in the custody of the seizing agency until such time as it is no longer needed for evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Asset Forfeiture Policy Manual\n   </em>\n   , Chap. 1, Sec. III.C.3. Furthermore, the government's need to maintain possession of the defendant property for its evidentiary value throughout the duration of the criminal proceedings is difficult to discern, given that it only relied on pictures of the defendant property at trial. (Dkt. No. 153 at 12, 17, 1:13-cr-357);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To be sure, if the evidentiary value of the defendant property expired, the government was required to seek an additional avenue to maintain custody of the defendant property pursuant to the applicable criminal forfeiture statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198426\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/140/513/#p521\">\n    140 F.Supp.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the court finds that the government did not do this, the absence of evidentiary value would bar these civil forfeiture proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(ii)(II). However, further clarity from the government regarding any evidentiary value of the defendant property is necessary. As such, the government is directed to file a supplemental response within ten days identifying any specific evidentiary value of the defendant property and addressing how long this evidentiary value provided\n   an independent basis for its continued possession of the defendant property based on the above analysis.

(Dkt. No. 44 at 8-9.) However, court documents indicate that any deficiencies with Stegemann's initial claim for this sum, (Dkt.
