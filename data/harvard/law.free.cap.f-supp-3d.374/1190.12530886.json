Spath ruled that the trial of Abd Al-Rahim Hussayn Muhammad Al-Nashiri (Al-Nashiri) was indefinitely abated until a superior court orders him to resume. Tr. 12,297-98; Mil. J. Spath Resp. to Order (Mar. 26, 2018). Appellant timely filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950d(a)(1). Appellant Br. (Mar. 5, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We reverse the military judge's decision to indefinitely abate the proceedings and order Al-Nashiri's trial to resume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Statement of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our superior Court has \"recount[ed] the details of Al-Nashiri's alleged offenses\" and the procedural posture of the case in a previous decision.\n   <em>\n    In re Al-Nashiri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353591\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/110/#p113\">\n    835 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113-17 (D.C. Cir. 2016). After issuance of this decision, litigation in pretrial motions continued until the military judge issued the abatement order. On February 21, 2018, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950d(a) of the military judge's decision to place Al-Nashiri's case in an indefinite abatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant urged our Court to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   specifically hold that the Military Judge is the sole authority to determine if there is good cause shown on the record to warrant excusal of a defense counsel who has formed an attorney-client relationship with an accused and appeared before the Commission; hold that there is no absolute right to representation by learned counsel; reverse the Military Judge's abatement order as an abuse of his discretion; order that the proceedings be resumed with the presently detailed counsel; and grant whatever other relief the Court deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant Br. 37 (Mar. 5, 2018). Al-Nashiri challenged the jurisdiction of our Court arguing that jurisdiction under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 950d(a)(1) is limited to a decision of the military judge that is tantamount to dismissal of a charge or charges. Appellee Br. 1-2, 6-8 (Feb. 28, 2018). Al-Nashiri listed a series of government actions over a six-year period that he believes undermined his counsel's ability to effectively represent him. AE 389 at 29-37. These actions served as a basis for Al-Nashiri's three senior defense counsel (SDC) to stop attending commission hearings, purportedly ending their representation of Al-Nashiri.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-37. Al-Nashiri argued that Brigadier General (BGen) John G. Baker, the Chief Defense Counsel (CDC), Military Commission Defense Office (MCDO), lawfully approved the excusal requests of Al-Nashiri's three SDC - namely, learned counsel Richard Kammen and counsel Mary E. Spears and Rosa A. Eliades. Appellee Br. 2-10, 14-15 (Apr. 9, 2018). Appellant countered that the releases of the three SDC from their representation of Al-Nashiri did not have a valid basis. Appellant Br. (Apr. 16, 2018). In any event, appellant asserted that the military judge's order to the CDC to rescind his excusal, and the military judge's orders to the SDC to continue to represent Al-Nashiri, are binding on the CDC and Al-Nashiri's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. 3-4 (July 23, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Al-Nashiri also argued that the abeyance should continue until a learned counsel is detailed to represent him. Appellee Br. 26-28 (Mar. 15, 2018). On October 11, 2017, the CDC excused Mr. Kammen. AE 339L at 5. The CDC or Acting CDC was responsible for the initial selection of replacement learned counsel. CDC/Acting CDC Resp. to Order (Mar. 30, 2018). From October 11, 2017, to January 8, 2018, the CDC or Acting CDC searched for, selected, and nominated a new learned counsel for Al-Nashiri.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3. The convening authority, however, declined to appoint new learned counsel until resolution of Mr. Kammen's status as Al-Nashiri's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. As of February 16, 2018, the date the military judge abated the proceedings, Mr. Kammen had not returned to represent Al-Nashiri and new learned counsel had not been appointed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The Acting CDC refused to detail additional counsel to assist Al-Nashiri's lone detailed counsel, Lieutenant (LT) Piette, U.S. Navy, because the Acting CDC wanted new learned counsel to be appointed first, and then new learned counsel would\n   be able to choose additional counsel to represent Al-Nashiri.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 11,500-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We conclude: (1) the three SDC established an attorney-client relationship with Al-Nashiri, and they entered appearances before the military commission on behalf of Al-Nashiri; (2) good cause is required before the SDC may be excused from representing Al-Nashiri; (3) the CDC made the initial excusal decision without good cause because the SDC did not establish that the government intruded into Al-Nashiri's attorney-client relationships; (4) the military judge properly overruled the CDC's excusal decision; (5) the SDC are obligated to comply with the military judge's orders to continue to represent Al-Nashiri; (6) counsel must obey the military judge's orders unless a higher court overrules the military judge; (7) the CDC and Acting CDC abused their discretion and violated the Regulation for Trial by Military Commission (RTMC) when they failed to detail additional counsel to represent Al-Nashiri after it became apparent that the SDC would not return to represent Al-Nashiri and the military judge said he wanted to proceed with pretrial motions; (8) there is no absolute right to learned counsel; and (9) our Court declines to delay our decision pending litigation in the U.S. District Courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Detailing of Senior Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The then-current CDC appointed Richard Kammen on December 23, 2008, to represent Al-Nashiri as learned counsel under Manual for Military Commissions (MMC) (2007 ed.), Rule for Military Commissions (R.M.C.) 506. Tr. 11,004;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AE 389 at 9-15; AE 389F at 2-3 (citing MMC, pt. II.V, R.M.C. 506(b); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 948k ). At the time of his appearance, Mr. Kammen signed an Affidavit and Agreement (MC Form 9-2) describing his duties and responsibilities as required by Chapter 9-5.b.1 of the RTMC. AE 389 at 9-15. Among other things, Mr. Kammen \"agree[d] to comply with all applicable regulations and rules for counsel, including any rules of court governing proceedings ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He also agreed to represent Al-Nashiri \"throughout the military commission process, from the inception of [his] representation through the completion of any post-trial proceedings\" and \"to ensure [detailed] counsel is capable of conducting the defense independently if necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades are both civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DoD).

Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades signed an Acknowledgement of Responsibilities document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 339E &amp; AE 339F, Attachs. B. Their acknowledgements did not require compliance with orders of the commission. Tr. 11,493; 11,507-08;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AE 339E &amp; AE 339F, Attachs. B. It is unclear if this was because as DoD employees they are subject to supervision by their superiors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Allegations that the Government Intruded into the Attorney-Client Relationship of Al-Nashiri and other Defendants and Detainees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Kammen requested excusal from representing Al-Nashiri, and he cited a series of intrusions into the attorney-client\n   relationship from October 2011 (\"Guards confiscate privileged legal materials from the accuseds' cells, and JTF GTMO's [Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Cuba] legal department reads counsels' correspondence to their clients.

AE 389 at 19-37. Appellee did not present any evidence that the prosecutors involved in this case received access to communications to or from Al-Nashiri or his counsel. The most prominent alleged intrusions will be discussed in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2012, the JTF-GTMO Staff Judge Advocate learned that microphones were hidden inside a smoke detector where defense counsel met with their clients. Appellee Br. 6 (Mar. 15, 2018); AE 389 at 31-32. A military judge ordered the listening devices to be dismantled. AE 389 at 32. There is no evidence that the microphones were ever used to monitor communications between Al-Nashiri and his counsel. Tr. 10,038; AE 369ZZZ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Al-Nashiri alleged that the government accessed the attorney-client mail of detainees at Guantanamo. Appellant Br. 5 (Mar. 5, 2018); AE 389 at 29-30. In February 2012, the military judge ordered the establishment of a Privilege Review Team (PRT), independent from JTF-GTMO and the prosecution, to screen detainee legal mail for prohibited contraband. AE 027 at 2-3. Al-Nashiri did not present any evidence that the PRT violated the military judge's restrictions prohibiting the PRT from communicating contents of detainee mail to prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Al-Nashiri alleged that in 2013, during technical upgrades of servers and other technology, DoD information technology (IT) personnel caused the loss of numerous defense files.

Tr. 10,037; AE 389 at 23. He cautioned counsel to\n   \"not conduct any attorney-client meetings at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba until they know with certainty that improper monitoring of such meetings is not occurring.\" Appellee Br. 6-7 (Mar. 15, 2018); Tr. 10,037.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the same day, the CDC wrote further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   On 30 November 2016, the Military Judge in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Military Judge further ordered that defense counsel must be advised in advance if a meeting with an accused is to be monitored. The Military Judge issued these orders because he recognized the legitimate concerns of defense attorneys that attorney-client meetings at GTMO were being improperly monitored by government personnel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   At present, I am not confident that the prohibition on improper monitoring of attorney-client meetings at GTMO as ordered by the commission is being followed.

In doing so, the military judge noted, \"the Government, as officers of the court, have represented facts which affirmatively negate what the Defense seeks to disclose to the Accused.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319016\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/1198/#p1205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Each of Al-Nashiri's lawyers had a security clearance that required them not to disclose classified information to anyone who was not authorized to receive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defense moved on July 13, 2017, to take discovery regarding potential intrusion by the government into privileged communications. Appellee Br. 8 (Mar. 15, 2018) (citing AE 369PP). On September 20, 2017, the military judge denied Al-Nashiri's request for discovery. Tr. 10,037 (citing 369YYY);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appellee Br. 8 (Mar. 15, 2018) (citing AE 369YYY-AE 369CCCC). After full briefing that included classified information, the military judge concluded that there was no \"basis to find there had been an intrusion into attorney-client communications\" between Al-Nashiri and his counsel. Tr. 10,038;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AE 369ZZZ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite the repeated urgings of the military judge, the government took several months to declassify the circumstances involving the microphone or microphones found in April 2017 in the room in which defense counsel and Al-Nashiri met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Juris. Br. 5 &amp; n.18 (Mar. 5, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most of the information was released\n   after the SDC ended their representation of Al-Nashiri. Some information about the intrusions relating to detainees other than Al-Nashiri and the August 2017 inspection of a room in which Al-Nashiri and his counsel previously met continues to be classified. App. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In August 2017, a defense inspection of the room allocated for meetings between Al-Nashiri and his counsel revealed a microphone or microphones that were not connected to recording or transmission equipment. Appellant Disc. Br. Ex. 1, Wells Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20.v-w (June 5, 2018) (Wells Decl.). The government referred to the devices as \"legacy\" microphones left over from before 2012 when the building was configured for detainee interviews.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20, 34 &amp; at Attach. B.2; Appellant Juris. Br. 5 (Mar. 5, 2018). Thus, Al-Nashiri's meeting room was equipped with recording equipment. Appellant Juris. Br. 5 (Mar. 5, 2018). However, the government represented to the military judge that when Al-Nashiri met with his SDC, the room\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   included disconnected, legacy microphones that were not connected to any audio listening/recording device. While it was apparent that this room serving as the new meeting location had been previously configured for interviews, no audio equipment was used while Mr. al Nashiri was in the room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (detailing facts declassified after the military judge abated the proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As the events unfolded during the summer of 2017, Mr. Kammen sought an opinion from Ellen Yaroshefsky, an ethicist and professor at Hofstra University's School of Law in New York\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding his ethical obligations to continue to represent Al-Nashiri in light of SDC's concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 339L at 8; AE 389 at 21. As understood by Professor Yaroshefsky, Mr. Kammen was concerned that (1) the government had intruded into SDC's privileged communications with Al-Nashiri, and (2) SDC lacked confidence that they could securely communicate with their client, and because of this lack of confidence SDC were unable to inform Al-Nashiri of these matters and discuss their concerns with him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 339L at 10-11; AE 389 at 23-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition to the dispute involving \"legacy\" microphone(s) in the meeting room where Al-Nashiri met with his counsel, the bases of SDC's concerns over the security of their privileged communications with Al-Nashiri included a series of events that occurred between 2008 and 2017. Among these events were intrusions or alleged intrusions by the government into the privileged communications of detainees and defendants at JTF-GTMO. Mr. Kammen summarized the SDC contentions regarding these matters in a document titled, \"Governmental Interference with Attorney-Client Communications, Intrusions into Attorney-Client Relationships, Undisclosed Monitoring, and Infiltration of Defense Teams\" (Defense Intrusion Allegations). AE 339L at 16-24; AE 389 at 29-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Al-Nashiri's contentions principally can be divided into four categories: the United States did or allegedly did: (a) overhear attorney-client conversations and seize privileged materials; (b) obtain emails sent and received by defense counsel; (c) allow JTF-GTMO staff to review legal mail for security reasons; and (d) allow attorney-client meetings to be held in rooms that had (i) microphones concealed as smoke detectors and (ii) \"legacy\" microphones that, according to the government, no longer were connected to recording devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 339L at 16-24; AE 389 at 29-37; Appellant Juris. Br. 5-6 (Mar. 5, 2018). The defense community also contended that the government sought to insert an informant in their midst and complained about the lack of timely and effective action by the commissions and the DoD to address defense counsel concerns regarding communications with their clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389 at 34-35; AE 389N at 379.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Significantly, there is no evidence that the prosecution received any privileged information involving Al-Nashiri. The only contention in the Defense Intrusion Allegations that specifically discusses Al-Nashiri, as opposed to allegations about compromising attorney-client confidentiality rights of detainees other than Al-Nashiri, involves the \"legacy\" microphone(s) found in the room where Al-Nashiri met with his counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 339L at 16-24; AE 389 at 29-37; Appellant Juris.

In April 2013, the CDC established a separate email system for defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389 at 34. In August 2013, the military judge declined to order JTF-GTMO staff to not monitor future attorney-client communications because he found that there was no evidence that the government had monitored any attorney-client meetings. AE 149K at 4. He explained that JTF-GTMO had a duty to not monitor attorney-client communications, and accordingly, ordering the execution of this existing duty \"would be superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Professor Yaroshefsky was also aware that the military judge denied requests for discovery\n   into the alleged intrusions and that Al-Nashiri's counsel were prohibited from informing Al-Nashiri about classified information relating to the alleged intrusions.

The CDC Acts to Terminate SDC's Attorney-Client Relationship with Al-Nashiri\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On October 6, 2017, Mr. Kammen, Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades requested permission from BGen Baker, the CDC at that time, to withdraw from representing Al-Nashiri for ethical reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The requests were made separately, but were similar. SDC cited their inability to adhere to three ethical duties as the reasons for their requests for withdrawal: the obligation to provide competent representation; the duty to inform their client regarding the alleged intrusions; and the duty to protect their client's confidences. In support of their requests, the SDC considered several documents, including Professor Yaroshefsky's ethics opinion and classified and unclassified documents. SDC stated that these documents and \"facts that I know, both classified and unclassified,\" establish \"extraordinary circumstances ... which prevent me from meeting my obligations under [these ethical] rules.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On October 11, 2017, BGen Baker determined that there was good cause to approve the SDC request to withdraw as defense counsel for Al-Nashiri based \"on the distinct circumstances of this case.\" AE 389 at 18. Accordingly, pursuant to R.M.C. 505(d)(2) he excused SDC as Al-Nashiri's defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   BGen Baker acted on his own authority in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Two days later, SDC informed the military judge \"as a courtesy\" that they no longer represented Al-Nashiri. Tr. 10,039; AE 339J; AE 339K; AE 339L. On October 16, 2017, November 3, 2017, and January 19, 2018, the remaining detailed defense counsel, LT Piette, moved to abate the proceedings until the appointment of new learned counsel to represent Al-Nashiri. AE 389;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 10,040; 10,173; 11,099. The military judge directed briefing on the issue. AE 389A. The military judge suggested that the CDC file a brief \"on the issue of his authority unilaterally to excuse Learned Counsel and other Civilian Counsel after they have formed an attorney-client relationship with the Accused and appeared in court on his behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In response, the CDC argued that R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B) authorized him to excuse counsel of record based upon his finding that good cause existed for excusal. AE 389C at 2-3; AE 389E at 7-8. The CDC further contended that his decisions to release SDC were his alone to make and were not reviewable by the military judge. AE 389C at 5-6, 11; AE 389E at 7-8. The argument put forward by the CDC was focused on his reading of Rule 505(d)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389C; AE 389E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After considering the matter, the military judge denied the defense motion to abate. AE 389F. He concluded that under relevant law the military judge is required to determine pursuant to R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B) (2016 ed.) whether there is good cause to permit counsel to terminate an attorney-client relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The military judge gave three reasons for reaching these conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   First, [accepting the CDC's claim of authority] removes control of the proceedings from the military judge, as well as\n   renders impossible the military judge's responsibility to ensure fair and orderly proceedings free of \"unnecessary delay or waste of time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Discussion to R.M.C. 801. Second, it contradicts the established practices of military and civilian courts, which recognize[ ] the judge's sole discretion in determining whether excusal is warranted after counsel has appeared in the case. Likewise, disqualification of counsel based on a breach of ethical duties is well established to be within the discretion of the military judge. Third, while the ambiguity in R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B) is troublesome, it cannot be read so as to conflict with other provisions within the R.M.C., rendering some superfluous, or read in a way that may directly prejudice the Accused if no judicial oversight is permitted. As such, in conformity with federal and military case law, the Commission is the appropriate authority to determine if good cause is shown on the record to warrant excusal of counsel pursuant to R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The record before us and in the commission does not identify the additional facts or documents that SDC and the CDC claim as support for their requests for excusal.

The CDC refused to answer questions about the basis for his release of the SDC. Tr. 10,052-10,059, 11,003. Accordingly, more specific information about why SDC and the CDC believed there was good cause warranting termination of the SDC attorney-client relationships with Al-Nashiri was unavailable to the military judge. The facts supporting good cause for any intrusions into Al-Nashiri's attorney-client relationship are not part of the record that is before us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389F at 5-6 (findings of military judge).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The military judge also said, \"thus far no evidence has been presented to demonstrate intrusions in this case affecting this Accused which would ethically require the withdrawal or disqualification of Learned Counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, he remarked that \"at this stage of the proceedings, the excusal of Learned Counsel [Mr. Kammen], who has acted as lead attorney for the Accused for nine years, will prejudice the Accused's due process rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The military judge further pointed out that under Indiana Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(c), \"[a] lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation.

Al-Nashiri was represented by detailed defense counsel, LT Piette. During commission sessions, LT Piette did little more than object to all proceedings before the commission on the ground that he was not competent to represent Al-Nashiri in the absence of learned counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 10,062-63; 10,165; 10,173; 11,097-99;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 11,500-03; AE 389. The military judge, however, ruled that Al-Nashiri was only entitled to learned counsel to the greatest extent practicable and under the circumstances, it was not practicable for Al-Nashiri to have learned counsel represent him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 10,061-63; 10,175-76; 10,260-62; 10,588-90; 11,005-07; 12,257; 12,269-70; 12,277.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Despite these circumstances, the Acting CDC would not detail additional counsel to represent Al-Nashiri.

Moreover, he \"undetailed\" [i.e. withdrew] three field grade senior lawyers who had been designated to assist in the defense of Al-Nashiri but who had not yet established an attorney-client relationship with him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353591\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/110/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Acting CDC said that he did this because the learned counsel had authority to determine who would assist in Al-Nashiri's representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353591\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/110/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, without assignment of learned counsel first, the Acting CDC would not detail counsel to assist LT Piette in his representation of Al-Nashiri.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 11,500-03; 11,097-99; AE 389 at 2.

The Military Commissions Act states an accused has the right to learned counsel, as follows: \"When any of the charges sworn against the accused are capital, to be represented before a military commission in accordance with clause (i) [concerning non-capital charges] and,\n   <em>\n    to the greatest extent practicable\n   </em>\n   , by at least one additional counsel who is learned in applicable law relating to capital cases ....\" 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 949a(b)(2)(C)(ii) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R.M.C. 506(b) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    Capital Offenses.\n   </em>\n   In any case in which ... the convening authority refers a charge to a capital military commission, the accused has the right to be represented in accordance with section (a) above [concerning general right to counsel], and by at least one additional counsel who is learned in applicable law relating to capital cases....

The Secretary's authority is limited to promulgating rules that are \"not ... contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\" 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 949a(a). Any expansion of the right to learned counsel in R.M.C. 506(b) and RTMC \u00b6 9-1.a.6 to an absolute right, as Al-Nashiri argues, is both \"contrary to [and] inconsistent with\" the limited right established by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 949a(b)(2)(C)(ii).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20M.J.%207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   While there may not be an absolute right to learned counsel, the right to learned counsel in a military commission case should not be abridged absent unusual circumstances.

Permitting the CDC to unilaterally approve excusal of counsel after entry of appearance on behalf of an accused, at any time during the pendency of a case, will cause havoc with adjudication of the\n   charges against the accused, as amply demonstrated in Al-Nashiri's case. Under the CDC's view of his authority, he may remove defense counsel the moment the government rests or before closing arguments on the merits without the approval of the military judge. The military commission would have no power to stop the withdrawal. This could force a mistrial as the accused would have no one to represent him or it could delay the trial for months, as it has here. Even in a situation where the excusal occurs during pretrial motions, excusal of Mr. Kammen after nine years of representation without good cause or Al-Nashiri's consent may prejudice Al-Nashiri's right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Moreover, replacement of Al-Nashiri's learned counsel could take months because a security clearance for counsel is required. In the event new learned counsel is required pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 949a(b)(2)(C)(ii), a delay of this magnitude may cause a mistrial, as the accused would not have the legal representation he is required to have.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   We conclude that the record does not establish good cause for the excusal of Al-Nashiri's SDC. Nevertheless, the CDC had authority to make the initial decision to excuse Al-Nashiri's SDC under R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B) because the SDC asked to be excused. The military judge, in turn, had the responsibility to review the CDC's decision and to make an independent assessment of whether there existed good cause for excusal. The military judge correctly determined that excusal of the SDC was unsupported by good cause and inimical to a fair and orderly trial for Al-Nashiri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   We further conclude that the military judge's orders take precedence over the orders of the CDC under the circumstances of this case. The military judge's orders to the SDC to continue their representation of Al-Nashiri were lawful. The current 2016 version of RTMC \u00b6 9-1.a.3 requires the CDC to ensure that Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades comply with the Rules of Court and orders of the military judge. We conclude that the CDC violated RTMC \u00b6 9-1.a.3 (2016 ed.), as well as the military judge's order, when he refused to order Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades to resume their representation of Al-Nashiri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Finally, in deciding Al-Nashiri's abeyance request to this Court, we have ruled with respect to Mr. Kammen that the military judge's approval is required to terminate an attorney-client relationship for good cause and to withdraw as counsel of record. We have further ruled that the\n   right to learned counsel is statutorily limited to \"the extent practical.\" Both these holdings are now the law-of-the-case and the law of the military commissions even if we did not have pendent jurisdiction to decide them in addressing the merits of appellant's appeal of the abatement order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaShawn A. v.

I write separately because the majority goes both too far and not far enough in resolving the appeal before us. Therefore, I concur in part with, and dissent in part from, the Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Before the Court is the government's appeal of an abatement order that brought to a halt the prosecution of Abd al Rahim Hussayn Muhammad Al-Nashiri (Al-Nashiri) for capital and other crimes related to his alleged role in attacks and an attempted attack upon two United States Navy vessels and a French supertanker. The government argues that the military judge abused his discretion in entering this order. It asks the Court to reverse the order so that the trial of the appellee can resume. At the core of what led to the abatement\n   was a challenge to the authority of the military judge to control the proceedings before him and, in particular, defense counsel's disobedience of the military judge's orders that they provide Al-Nashiri with the vigorous and zealous defense to which he is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   I agree, at times for different reasons, with most of the Court's conclusions. We have jurisdiction to hear the government's appeal. There is no reason to delay deciding the appeal, as sought by Al-Nashiri's requests to abstain and for abeyance. Lawyers who appear before a commission are required to obey the orders of the military judge. The Chief Defense Counsel also must obey those orders. However, for now, we need not say more than this obligation extends only to orders that pertain to the military judge's control over lawyers who appear before him or her. Al-Nashiri's right to learned counsel is not absolute. Rather, it is limited to the greatest extent practical. When good cause is the basis for a request to terminate the attorney-client relationship between an accused and a defense lawyer who has appeared before a commission (counsel of record), the military judge is required to find on the record that good cause exists before the relationship may be terminated. As a separate and independent step in addition to the good cause finding, the military judge must approve withdrawal as counsel of record pursuant to Military Commissions Trial Judiciary Rule of Court (RC) 4 (Sept. 1, 2016). Al-Nashiri's senior lawyers, Richard Kammen, Mary E. Spears and Rosa A. Eliades (collectively Senior Defense Counsel) remain Al-Nashiri's defense counsel because they did not secure the military judge's approval for the termination of their attorney-client relationships with the appellee and withdrawal as counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the Court finding pendent jurisdiction to address two issues: the military judge's (a) finding that the United States did not intrude into the attorney-client communications between Al-Nashiri and his defense counsel, Tr. 10,038; AE369ZZZ, and (b) ruling that there was no good cause for the termination of Senior Defense Counsel's attorney-client relationship with Al-Nashiri, AE 389F at 5. The only appealable order before the Court is the February 16, 2018 order abating Al-Nashiri's trial. Tr. 12,297-98. Our pendent jurisdiction, therefore, is restricted to reviewing only those non-appealable issues that must be decided in determining whether the military judge abused his discretion by abating the appellee's trial. The majority goes beyond this by addressing issues that we need not decide in reviewing the abuse of discretion question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The appellee's trial was abated because Al-Nashiri's defense lawyers made it impossible for the trial to continue. First, Mr. Kammen, Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades refused to obey the military judge's orders to appear before the commission and represent their client after the military judge rejected their efforts to terminate their attorney-client relationship with Al-Nashiri and withdraw as counsel of record without the military judge's approval. Second, the Navy lawyer who remained as detailed defense counsel passively represented Al-Nashiri on the ground that he could do little more until a new learned counsel, that is a lawyer experienced in death penalty cases, filled Mr. Kammen's role in that position. Given this, the Court only needs to address four otherwise non-appealable issues to decide if the military judge entered the abatement order in the proper exercise of his discretion, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   (a) Are lawyers who appear before a military commission required to obey the orders of the military judge?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   (b) Does the termination of an attorney-client relationship with an accused for\n   good cause pursuant to R.M.C. 505(d)(2)(B) require the military judge to find on the record the existence of good cause, as defined by R.M.C. 505(f)?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   (c) In addition to the military judge finding good cause, is defense counsel required to obtain the military judge's consent to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to RC 4?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   (d) Does an accused have an absolute right to learned counsel when charged with capital offenses in a prosecution before a military commission?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The Court has pendent jurisdiction to review these issues because they are intertwined with whether the abatement order was appropriately entered, or because it is necessary to address them in order to meaningfully review the abuse of discretion question. The Court, however, does not have pendent jurisdiction to hear and decide the other disputes that the majority addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In addition, it is unwise to reach the merits of the good cause and intrusion issues on the limited record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   I further dissent from the Court's failure to say explicitly that Mr. Kammen, Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades are\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to appear before the commission and resume representing Al-Nashiri. The Court has held that they remain counsel of record. This means that the Senior Defense Counsel have a legal duty that requires them to return to the courtroom and represent their client. The majority, however, will not say this because we have refrained, for now, from deciding whether this Court has the power to\n   <em>\n    order\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kammen, Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades back to the courtroom. Whether we have that power is separate from stating, as the Court should do, that the Senior Defense Counsel's duty as counsel of record requires them to resume forthwith representing Al-Nashiri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Thus, I write separately to address these and other matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Abstention Based on the First-to-File Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The majority correctly denies Al-Nashiri's motion asking that we defer resolving this appeal because Mr. Kammen filed a habeas action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana that raises some of the same issues before us and did so before the government filed its appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Part VI.B.

The Court correctly holds that Mr. Kammen at all times remained Al-Nashiri's learned counsel and was obligated to represent his client before the military commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parts VII.E; X. The Court also correctly holds that Mr. Kammen refused to represent Al-Nashiri despite lawful orders to do so, which he was required to obey, and a contractual obligation to continue as counsel, including with respect to the instant appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parts VII.E, IX, X. Thus, the predicate of Al-Nashiri's abeyance request fails because Mr. Kammen was his learned counsel at all relevant times and continues in this role until properly relieved or the case comes to a conclusion. The fact that Mr. Kammen refuses to perform his duty has no effect on this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In addition, Lieutenant (LT) Alaric Piette, the remaining detailed defense counsel, has demonstrated that he has the skill and ability to represent competently Al-Nashiri regarding the issues before the Court. Further, during May 2018, Commander (CDR) Brian Mizer, a highly experienced criminal defense lawyer, was detailed as co-counsel to represent Al-Nashiri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee Br.

Thus, the conduct of the defense attorneys and the Chief Defense Counsel made it impossible for the military judge to move the case forward. This is what led to the military judge abating the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   To determine whether the military judge abused his discretion in entering the abatement order, the Court should only address (1) the obligation to obey the military judge, (2) the need for and failure of Senior Defense Counsel to obtain the military judge's approval for (a) their excusal for good cause and (b), separately, their withdrawal as counsel of record, and (3) the qualified right to learned counsel. Each of these issues is \"inextricably intertwined with\" whether the military judge abused his discretion in abating the trial because the defense's refusal to obey the military judge's orders was the cause of the commission's inability to continue the trial. For the same reasons, the Court cannot meaningfully review the validity of the abatement order without first deciding if the military judge correctly ruled on these issues. There is no need to address any other matters in determining whether abating the trial was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit's request for information is irrelevant to this Court's pendent jurisdiction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The No Good Cause Finding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   After Mr. Kammen, Ms. Spears and Ms. Eliades asserted that they no longer were Al-Nashiri's lawyers and left the case, LT Piette filed a motion to abate the trial until new learned counsel was detailed to represent Al-Nashiri. AE 389. The military judge denied the motion on October 27, 2017. AE 389F. In the context of denying the motion, the military judge found that there was no good cause to terminate the attorney-client relationship between Al-Nashiri and Senior Defense Counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. This finding primarily was based upon the failure of Senior Defense Counsel and the refusal of the Chief Defense Counsel to provide any justification for their claim that good cause existed beyond the Chief Defense Counsel's letters and its enclosures purporting to relieve counsel as Al-Nashiri's defense attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389F; Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parts III.D, IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   The majority does not explain the manner in which the no good cause finding, relating to an October 2017 abeyance motion, has anything to do with the February 2018 abatement order that would permit the Court under the applicable exacting standard to assert pendent jurisdiction to assess whether there was no good cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Part V.B. Moreover, regardless of whether the military judge was right or wrong in his October 2017 finding, his no good cause ruling has nothing to do with Senior Defense Counsel leaving the case. As noted, when the October ruling was made, they already had told the military judge that they would not continue as Al-Nashiri's defense lawyers. Again, right or wrong, the no good cause finding does not have anything to do with counsel's refusal to return. In contrast, there is a direct correlation between the Senior Defense Counsel and the Chief Defense Counsel refusal to obey the military judge's orders requiring the Senior Defense Counsel to return to the courtroom and represent Al-Nashiri and LT Piette's\n   refusal to accept the ruling that there was no absolute right to learned counsel\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the February 2018 abatement order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Intrusion Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The majority compounds its error regarding pendent jurisdiction by boot strapping a jurisdictional justification to review the intrusion allegations. The Court, without further explanation, says it is necessary to review the military judge's earlier factual finding concerning intrusion to adequately review the no good cause ruling made in denying Al-Nashiri's October 2017 abeyance motion and, further, intrusion was intertwined with the latter ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Part V. Separately, the government asked the Court to review and affirm the military judge's September 20, 2017, ruling denying Al-Nashiri discovery relief based upon his allegations that the United States had intruded into his attorney-client communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 369YYY-AE 369CCCC; Tr. 10,038. The stated purpose of the government's request is to obtain a ruling from this Court that the military judge properly found that there was no intrusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. 1 (Mar. 5, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Neither the theory advanced by the majority nor the request from the government, however, has anything to do with the February 2018 abatement order that brought Al-Nashiri's trial to a halt. Accordingly, there is no compelling reason to address the intrusion allegations. Consequently, there is no pendent jurisdiction that allows the Court to rule upon the military judge's finding in his October 2017 denial of Appellee's discovery motion that there was no intrusion. Nothing in the majority's opinion explains otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Undeveloped Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   The D.C. Circuit cautions, \"[w]e also must be careful not to accept pendent appeals prematurely, without the benefit of an adequate record or before the district court has an opportunity to render a considered decision on the subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilda Marx,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693754,571831\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/675/\">\n    85 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   679 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rendall-Speranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703848,7643550\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/913/\">\n    107 F.3d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating \"the exercise of pendent jurisdiction is disfavored if the court lacks the benefit of an adequate record\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   There is no fully developed commission record regarding the allegation that the United States intruded into Al-Nashiri's attorney-client communications. The military judge's finding that the United States did not intrude is based on the government's representations that the United States did not intrude and the Court's observations that the defense failed to offer evidence challenging those representations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   This comes from the judge's decisions denying Al-Nashiri's discovery motion and his October 16, 2017, abatement motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AE 389F at 5-6; AE 369YYY; Tr. 10,038 (citing AE 369ZZZ);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parts III.D, VII.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   What is appropriately before the Court is not an \"adequate record\" upon which to assess properly the no intrusion finding. This is borne out by the majority's reliance upon a declaration and documents that are not a part of the record below, and for which there is no basis to supplement the appellate record by including them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   The commission record upon which the majority reviews the no good cause finding in the decision denying Al-Nashiri's October 2017 abatement motion similarly is inadequate. The military judge's decision is premised upon a failure of proof. All that\n   was before him was the Chief Defense Counsel's letters and its enclosures approving Senior Defense Counsel's request to leave the case and their refusal to further justify the claim of good cause. AE 389 &amp; Attach. C; AE 389F;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Part III.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Thus, what is properly before the Court, in my judgment, is too sparse a record to review the findings of no intrusion and no good cause, even if the other elements necessary for review based on pendent jurisdiction were present. This is even more so when, as here, those other predicates to pendent jurisdiction are lacking. Assuming jurisdiction, the Court should wait until there is a more developed commission record and substantive rulings based on that record, before the military judge's findings are ripe for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The majority's reliance on a declaration and documents\n   <em>\n    dehors\n   </em>\n   the military commission's record cannot cure the inadequacies in the record properly before the Court. Both parties submitted documents to this Court that are not in the commission record. The government submitted an unclassified appendix with its Merits Brief (Mar. 5, 2018) and a classified appendix with its Reply Brief and Motion to File a Supplemental Classified Appendix (Mar. 20, 2018). The classified appendix consists of the classified declarations of the Commander, Joint Detention Group (JDG) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Deputy General Counsel for Litigation and Investigations. The government moved for permission to file both appendices in this Court. Appellant Mot. to File App. (Mar. 5, 2018); Appellant Br. &amp; Mot. to File Suppl. Classified App. (Mar. 20, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Al-Nashiri submitted more than 300 pages of classified documents with his July 2, 2018, classified Supplemental Brief. He asked the Court to consider them if, absent an evidentiary hearing, the Court addresses the intrusion question presented by appellant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee Br. 2 (July 2, 2018). He did not make a motion to supplement the appellate record with these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   In addition, the government filed in this Court its voluntary response to Al-Nashiri's discovery requests. Appellant Disc. Br. (June 5, 2018). As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit had requested the same information that Al-Nashiri later sought after the D.C. Circuit's request became moot. The government's voluntary response included the May 21, 2018, declaration of Colonel (Col.) John B. Wells and five attachments thereto.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at Ex. 1, Wells Decl. Col. Wells is a senior member of the prosecution. His declaration includes a comprehensive recitation of the government's factual contentions concerning the allegations that the United States had intruded into the privileged conversations between Al-Nashiri and his counsel.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The first attachment (A) to the Wells Declaration is a classified transcript of the proceedings below on July 31, 2017. The second (B) is a two-page unsworn summary of facts as advocated by the government concerning the allegations of intrusion involving Al-Nashiri. That summary also is a part of the appellant's March 5, 2018, brief opposing appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and is a part of appellant's appendix (App. 18-19). The government acknowledges that the summary \"is not of record before the Commission.\" Appellant Br. 5 n.4 (Mar. 5, 2018). The third and fourth (C) and (D) are, respectively, the classified declarations of the JDG Commander and the CIA Deputy General Counsel for Litigation and Investigations. The fifth attachment (E) is an unclassified excerpt from AE 369MM, the government's response to the motion to advise Al-Nashiri of potential intrusions. The two declarations, attachments (C) and\n   (D), also comprise the classified appendix submitted with Appellant's Reply Brief and Motion to File a Supplemental Classified Appendix (Mar. 20, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   The government did not move to supplement the appellate record to include the Wells Declaration or attachment (B), the two-page unsworn factual summary regarding the intrusion allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   It did seek to file the Wells Declaration as part of its opposition to Appellee's Motion for Discovery and Stay (May 31, 2018). It did so to cut off further litigation over \"Appellee's request for 'appellate discovery' \" and to obtain a \"speedy - and just - resolution of this interlocutory appeal.\" Appellant Response to Appellee Motion for Discovery 5-6 (June 5, 2018). This response cannot be construed as a motion to supplement the appellate record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   In an order dated October 11, 2018, the majority admitted into the appellate record all of the documents in the two government appendices, the Wells Declaration and some 300 documents that appellee submitted with his July 2, 2018, classified Supplemental Brief. I concurred in part with, and dissented in part from, this Order, a copy of which is an attachment to this opinion. Regardless of the manner in which the proposed use of these documents in the appellate process is presented to the Court procedurally, the core issues are whether in rendering a decision regarding alleged intrusion the Court may properly supplement the appellate record with them and rely upon them and other documents not in the commission record. In my judgment, it may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   The majority of the documents not in the commission record that the majority admits into the appellate record, including the 300 plus classified pages submitted by Al-Nashiri, and other documents properly admitted into the appellate record are irrelevant to the disposition of the appeal. The same cannot be said for a handful of extra-record documents upon which the majority relies in affirming the military judge's finding that there was no intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   The majority affirms the finding that the United States did not intrude in Al-Nashiri's attorney-client communications based on the government's representations that the United States did not intrude,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court's observations that the defense failed to offer evidence that challenges those representations and the government's factual contentions regarding what did and did not occur. As part of its support for its conclusion, the majority materially relies upon the Wells Declaration, the two-page unsworn fact summary and a March 26, 2018, status report.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Majority Op.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974750\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/552/498/#p509\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parts III.B, III.G, VII.E. None of these documents was in the record before the military judge when he entered the February 16, 2018, abatement order. None is properly before this Court. All of it is hearsay.

Langer, Clerk BY: /s/ Daniel J. Reidy Deputy Clerk</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   <strong>\n    UNCLASSIFIED//FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Appendix B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   1) In 2013, the defense team for Mr. al Nashiri requested accommodation to conduct privileged attorney-client meetings outside of designated meeting locations that are specially configured for that purpose, and used by other detainees in military commissions cases. Joint Task Force - Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO) found a location acceptable to the defense team and approved it for their use. Meetings between Mr. al Nashiri and his attorneys in that location began in April 2014 and continued until June 2017. During this period, Mr. al Nashiri used one specific room at that location for his attorney-client meetings, except when he met with his counsel in several locations in and around the Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC), which is away from the detention facilities entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   2) The new meeting location was not built or specifically designed for attorney-client meetings. Prior to the defense team's request, rooms in this building - including the one ultimately used by Mr. al Nashiri-were configured for detainee interviews. The rooms in the building in April 2014 thus included disconnected, legacy microphones that were not connected to any audio listening/recording device. While it was apparent that this room serving as the new meeting location had been previously configured for interviews, no audio equipment was used while Mr. al Nashiri was in the room. According to routine meeting logs, counsel used this room for meetings with Mr. al Nashiri on more than 50 days during this period, sometimes more than once in a day; the disconnected, legacy microphones in the meeting room were never in use during these meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   3) The new meeting location was previously used for interviews of general-population (non-HVD) detainees as late as 2011. The meeting room is located in a building in a compound that JTF-GTMO exclusively controls. There are no records of the use of the building to conduct interviews after 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   4) Like many buildings that JTF-GTMO maintains, the building housing the new meeting location had not been designed to accommodate privileged attorney-client meetings. With limited funds available to build such facilities over the last decade, repurposing existing structures was often the only feasible option when new requirements emerged. Various court orders and Department of Defense directives to preserve evidence and structures potentially relevant to litigation further limited the JTF's ability and inclination to remove old equipment and confirm that it had been removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   5) In late April 2017, in an entirely separate location not used by Mr. al Nashiri, the JTF Commander learned that attorney-client communications occurring outside of designated locations may have been overheard. After the Commander immediately stopped allowing attorney-client privileged meetings at this location, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) conducted an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the incident. The investigation formally commenced on 10 May 2017. This investigation concluded that a small number of detainees-none of whom were in contested military commission proceedings-were allowed to meet with their attorneys outside of designated meeting locations. This accommodation for the detainee legal teams resulted in attorney-client meetings being unintentionally overheard. The investigation further concluded that no one involved in legal proceedings or the JTF chain of command overheard these communications, and that this incident did not result from the culpable negligence or misconduct of any U.S. Government\n   personnel. JTF-GTMO has implemented safeguards to ensure that this situation cannot reoccur. Again, this incident and subsequent investigation did not involve Mr. al Nashiri, his attorneys, or the meeting location that they used. Mr. al Nashiri has never met with his attorneys at the other location, i.e., the one where attorney-client communications were unintentionally overheard. No intrusions into attorney-client privilege occurred in any meeting between Mr. al Nashiri and his attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   6) Following report of this incident, the Joint Detention Group (JDG) Commander executed a declaration on 30 June 2017, wherein he stated that Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) strictly prohibit any compromise of privacy in attorney-client meetings spaces, and he offered- as his predecessor did in 2013-to allow defense counsel to personally inspect legal meeting rooms. Accepting this offer, Mr. al Nashiri's counsel conducted this inspection on 2-3 August 2017. During that inspection, they located a legacy microphone that, although not in use and not connected to any audio listening/recording device, had not been removed from the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   7) Afterward, the defense team refused to meet in this room with Mr. al Nashiri. The JTF then offered several alternative meeting locations which would meet their needs. Since October 2017, members of Mr. al Nashiri's defense team have conducted their meetings with Mr. al Nashiri in and around the ELC-away from the detention facilities entirely. This was one of the options provided by the JTF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   8) Starting in late October 2017, the JTF removed flooring, walls, and fixtures in the new meeting location. The JTF confirmed that legacy microphones, which were not connected to any audio listening/recording device nor in an operable condition, were removed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
