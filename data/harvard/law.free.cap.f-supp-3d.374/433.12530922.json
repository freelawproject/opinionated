(\"Resco\") (ECF No. 111) (together, \"Defendants\"), asserting that the claims of Plaintiff Peggy Hassell are pre-empted by federal statutes intended to regulate the entire fields of locomotive equipment and train safety, specifically, the Locomotive Inspection Act (\"LIA\") and the Safety Appliance Act (\"SAA\"). Also pending are: motions for judgment on the pleadings by these same Defendants, on the same basis (i.e., pre-emption of Plaintiff's claims) (ECF Nos. 107, 108, and 109), a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion filed by Plaintiff seeking to exclude an expert report and certain testimony of Francis W. Weir, Ph.D. (ECF No. 113), and a motion by Plaintiff seeking leave of court to amend her complaint to add alternative causes of action. (ECF No. 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff initially filed this case in state court in Texas, asserting against various defendants Texas state law claims of negligence and strict liability (as well as loss of consortium) by Peggy Hassell, individually and as personal representative of the estate of Billie Hassell. Plaintiff alleged that Decedent died as a result of occupational asbestos exposure from railway equipment. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on grounds of federal question jurisdiction. It was subsequently transferred to this Court, where it became part of MDL-875. (ECF Nos. 1 and 7-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court dismissed Defendants on the grounds that Plaintiff's claims were pre-empted by the LIA after concluding that the asbestos covered pipes at issue were attached to the locomotive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 70). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated this Court's dismissal order and the case was remanded to this Court for further proceedings. (ECF No. 77);\n   <em>\n    In re Asbestos Prod. Liab. Litig. (No. VI) (\"Hassell\")\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055353\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/125/\">\n    822 F.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016). The\n   Third Circuit's decision pertained to this Court's procedural handling of the motions to dismiss and did not directly or fully address the merits of the motions regarding the pre-emptive effect of the LIA or SAA. Specifically, the Third Circuit held that this Court had converted the motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment but improperly applied the summary judgment standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055353\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/125/\">\n    822 F.3d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third Circuit held that this Court did not view the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and concluded that Plaintiff had properly raised a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the pipes at issue were attached to the locomotive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055353\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, additional limited discovery was conducted (ECF No. 79), and the present motions were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUBSTANTIVE BACKGROUND AND HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Decedent, who worked in Texas as an electrician from 1945 until 1989, was exposed to asbestos from insulation that was incorporated into passenger railcars manufactured by Defendants from 1945 until the mid to late 1970s and then sold to his employer, the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. Mr. Hassell died in May of 2009 from malignant mesothelioma. Plaintiff alleges that asbestos from pipe and \"arc chute\" insulation in the passenger cars manufactured by Defendants was a cause of his mesothelioma and subsequent death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's current complaint asserts Texas state law claims sounding in (1) strict product liability, (2) negligence, (3) loss of consortium, and (4) punitive damages. (ECF No. 9). Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint asserts all of these claims and also proposes a new claim for (5) per se negligence\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (as evidenced by alleged violations of the LIA and SAA). (ECF No. 114-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Specifically, her brief in opposition to summary judgment (1) limits her claims to those arising from steam, water, and air conditioning pipes running underneath the passenger railcars, as well as insulation lining the \"arc chutes\" in the floor of the passenger railcars, wherein the brakes \"pick up\" the generator, and (2) asserts that \"steam generator cars [ (as opposed to steam pipes originating from the locomotive) ] were used for the purpose of passenger car heating on the Santa Fe [Railroad trains].\" (Pl.

However, there is a factual dispute as to the origin of the pipes at issue and whether they connect to the locomotive. Both parties present evidence to back their claims. Given this dispute, at this stage of the proceedings, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact which precludes summary judgment for the Defendants under these circumstances.
