Defendants' contention that the 2001 Site Map identifies all areas where materials are exposed to precipitation and areas of industrial activity, ECF No. 79 at 27, is belied simply by comparing it to the 2017 Amended Site Map, which denotes a log debarker, as well as log storage areas and bark storage areas,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 78-11 at 18.

Given that there is no dispute that SDIF operates the log handling business and is the permittee, the logical conclusion is that the SWPPP's scope should extend to areas over which SDIF exercises operational control. This reading is confirmed by the 2015 General Permit, which defines \"Facility\" as \"[a] collection of industrial processes discharging storm water associated with industrial activity\n   <em>\n    within the property boundary or operational unit\n   </em>\n   .\" 2015 General Permit, Attachment C, at 3. Although \"operational unit\" is not separately defined, the 2015 General Permit's definition of \"Operator\" likewise focuses on practical questions of control. Accordingly, an operator is \"any party associated with an industrial facility\" that either (1) \"has operational control over the industrial SWPPP and SWPPP specifications, including the ability to make modifications to those plans and specifications\" or (2) \"has day-to-day operational control of activities at the facility which are necessary to ensure compliance with a SWPPP for the facility or other permit conditions (e.g. authorized to direct workers at a site to carry out activities directed by the SWPPP or comply with other permit conditions).\" 2015 General Permit, Attachment C, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The 2015 General Permit's accompanying Fact Sheet lends further support to this conclusion.

CAT emphasizes, for instance, that SDIF sometimes pays Schneider Park a wharfage fee for the use of the dock for transferring logs, ECF No. 69-1 at 77-78, and that the use of the dock for transferring logs is a critical component of SDIF's business, ECF No. 67 at 17. Defendants contend that the longshoremen exercise \"exclusive control of the dock,\" ECF No. 79 at 12, albeit without citation to the record. Nonetheless, viewing CAT's evidence of operational control in the light most favorable to Defendants, it does not conclusively establish that the dock is a part of the Facility that needed to be identified on the SWPPP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, CAT argues that SDIF failed to update the 2017 Amended SWPPP to account for storing logs on the City of Eureka lot between June 2018 and November 2018. ECF No. 67 at 18. Defendants counter that an update was unnecessary because this was \"not a significant change in the SDI Facility within the meaning of the General Permit.\" ECF No. 79 at 20. CAT offers no further argument on reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The 2015 General Permit requires permittees to \"[r]evise their on-site SWPPP whenever necessary.\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 X(B)(1). Further, permittees must \"certify and submit ... their SWPPP within 30 days whenever the SWPPP contains significant revisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 X(B)(2).

Reading these provisions together, it is \"necessary\" to revise a SWPPP for both \"significant\" and non-significant changes to the permittee's operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The parties do not provide any further argument on when revisions are necessary, nor do they attempt to articulate a standard for when an operational change and accompanying SWPPP revision are \"significant.\" Given this gap, CAT has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate its entitlement to summary judgment, particularly when viewing the evidence in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Third, CAT contends that SDIF \"stockpile[ed] concrete rubble and debris on the site\" between September 7, 2017, and December 31, 2018, without updating the SWPPP to reflect this activity. ECF No. 67 at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 70-1 at 19. CAT argues that the SWPPP's \"list of industrial materials handled at the facility, and the locations where each material is stored, received, shipped, and handled,\" was therefore incomplete. 2015 General Permit \u00a7 X(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants represent that they acquired this material to fill sinkholes that periodically develop on-site but, for various reasons, will not use it until after the 2019 storm season. ECF No. 79 at 11, 23. Defendants argue that the SWPPP did not need to mention this concrete storage because (1) it was not related to the industrial activities for which they sought coverage under the General Permit and (2) based on the topography of the storage area, storm water is more likely to run onto the area, rather than off. ECF No. 79 at 23. Once again, CAT does not address these contentions in its reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court finds problems similar to those in CAT's previous argument. Neither party has offered any reasoned argument whether Section X(F), which by its terms covers \"industrial materials handled at the facility,\" is limited to materials described\n   in Section X(G)(1)(a), which discusses \"industrial materials used in or resulting from [an industrial] process.\" Moreover, there are disputed factual issues as to the exact setting in which the concrete is stored. Accordingly, the Court finds that CAT has not carried its burden on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, CAT asserts that SDIF \"began to make fundamental changes to the drainage topography of the Schneider Dock facility\" in March 2018 but did not revise the SWPPP to reflect those changes. ECF No. 67 at 18. As a result, CAT reasons, the 2017 Amended Site Map did not contain accurate \"[l]ocations of storm water collection and conveyance systems\" and \"[l]ocations and descriptions of structural control measures that affect industrial storm water discharges.\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 X(E)(3)(b)-(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although Defendants do not directly address these alleged changes, they state that SDIF constructed advanced BMPs between September 2018 and mid-December 2018.

Specifically, CAT asserts that storm water flows from the City of Eureka's adjacent lot, contacts an SDIF berm constructed from bark waste and other industrial material, and then runs off into a municipal storm drain inlet. ECF No. 67 at 21; ECF No. 80 at 12.

Similarly, the Court must determine whether the berm constitutes a \"potential industrial pollutant source[ ]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   for which SDIF had to evaluate exposure pathways. 2015 General Permit \u00a7 X(G)(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendants identify no affirmative support for their interpretation in the record, the General Permit, or the underlying regulatory framework. An examination of the General Permit, moreover, supports CAT's competing position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants do not appear to dispute that the berm is comprised partly of bark waste from their log processing operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67 at 21; ECF No. 69-1 at 94-95.

The 1997 General Permit similarly requires that \"[a]ll storm water discharge locations shall be sampled.\" 1997 General Permit \u00a7 B(5)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that SDIF has never collected storm water samples from Drainage Areas 3 and 4.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67 at 23,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79 at 21-22. But Defendants point to the 2015 General Permit's provisions for \"Representative Sampling Reduction,\" under which the permittee \"may reduce the number of locations to be sampled in each drainage area (e.g., roofs with multiple downspouts, loading/unloading areas with multiple storm drains) if the industrial activities, BMPs, and physical characteristics (grade, surface materials, etc.) of the drainage area for each location to be sampled are substantially similar to one another.\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(C)(4)(a). Defendants note that SDIF submitted a representative sampling justification with the 2017 Amended MIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 78-11 at 13-14. Further, Defendants stress that \"[t]he Regional Water Board may reject the Representative Sampling Reduction justification and/or request additional supporting documentation,\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(C)(4)(d), but that the Board did not do so in this instance. ECF No. 79 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   CAT counters that SDIF's representative sampling justification was improper because that provision of the 2015 General Permit allows the discharger to \"reduce the number of locations to be sampled in each drainage area,\" but still requires a sample from each drainage area. 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(C)(4)(a). Because SDIF identified four separate drainage areas, CAT argues, SDIF was required to sample from each. ECF No. 80 at 13-14. Moreover, CAT disputes as a factual matter the 2017 Amended MIP's assertion that the sampled and non-sampled drainage areas have \"substantially similar\" relevant characteristics, 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(C)(4)(a), noting that Drainage Area 3 houses the log debarker that Defendants identify as the greatest source of potential pollution. ECF No. 80 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendants effectively concede that SDIF did not comply with the 1997 General Permit's requirement to sample \"[a]ll storm water discharge locations.\" 1997 General Permit \u00a7 B(5)(a). Defendants likewise admit that SDIF did not comply with this aspect of the 2015 General Permit until at least September 8, 2017, when SDIF filed the 2017 Amended MIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to the representative sampling justification in the 2017 Amended MIP, the Board's failure to object does not preclude CAT from arguing that this element of the MIP is inconsistent with the General Permit's requirements.

ECF No. 67 at 23. In addition to total suspended solids (\"TSS\"), pH, and oil and grease, the 2015 General Permit requires permittees to monitor for \"[a]dditional parameters identified by the Discharger on a facility-specific basis that serve as indicators of the presence of all industrial pollutants in the pollutant source assessment (Section X.G.2).\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(B)(6)(c).

This is not adequate to rebut CAT's expert report or create a genuine dispute of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that California \"has not seen fit to include other metals as part of the sampling obligations for the applicable SIC Codes for the SDI Facility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the 2015 General Permit,\n   <em>\n    subsection (d)\n   </em>\n   of Section XI(B)(6) requires sampling for \"additional applicable parameters listed in Table 1,\" which are \"dependent on the facility Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since January 3, 2017, Defendants have classified the SDIF Facility for Sawmills and Planing Mills (2421), ECF No. 78-9 at 2, and Table 1 lists only chemical oxygen demand and zinc as additional parameters for that SIC code. 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(B)(10), tbl. 1.

To the extent Defendants contend that a discharger has no obligation to consider pollutant parameters not listed in the applicable portion of Table 1, the Court rejects that interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Cmty.

As Defendants note, the Fact Sheet explains that TSS serves as an indicator of \"the un-dissolved solids that are present in storm water discharge\" because \"[m]any pollutants adhere to sediment particles; therefore, reducing sediment will reduce the amount of these pollutants in storm water discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184697\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/1169/#p1171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the reasons for including a baseline monitoring requirement for all facilities do not erase the general permit's clear command to monitor various \"[a]dditional parameters ... on a facility-specific basis.\" 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(B)(6)(c);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Cmty.

In Defendants' opposition, they asserted that SDIF \"[i]nadvertently ... did not produce records of its visual observations until February 7, 2019,\" ECF No. 79 at 28, and attached evidence that they then produced those records to CAT, ECF No. 78-1 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 78-5 at 2.

Ongoing Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   As previously noted, CAT \"must prove that ongoing violations actually have occurred\" in order for the Court to impose liability for pre-complaint violations.\n   <em>\n    Sw.

Accordingly, CAT has not yet carried its burden to \"prove that ongoing violations actually have occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170318\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/985/#p994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, whether the post-complaint violations are sufficiently related to past violations to be \"ongoing [i]s a finding of fact,\" which the Court cannot yet resolve for similar reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170318\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/985/#p994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170318\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/985/#p994\">\n    at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this failure does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to decide that pre-complaint violations occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544613\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/667/#p671\">\n    853 F.2d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore concludes that the appropriate course is to determinate that pre-suit violations occurred,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Defendants point to no relevant change in their monitoring practices or amendments in the 2017 Amended or 2018 MIP. There is thus no basis to distinguish between pre- and post-September 8, 2017 violations. Accordingly, the Court finds that these violations were ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, as to the MIP Scope claim, the Court also concludes that SDIF was in violation for the entire period. The Court notes that SDIF did not change its underlying sampling practices in the 2017 Amended MIP. Rather, it submitted a representative sampling justification that, if\n   valid, entitles a permittee to sample from fewer discharge locations. 2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(C)(4)(a). Because even a valid representative sampling justification would not have authorized SDIF's post-complaint sampling practices, CAT appears to have violated at least some of the same General Permit sampling requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2015 General Permit \u00a7 XI(B)(4), with the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court observes that the parties have not addressed the legal standard that should guide the factual inquiry whether violations are sufficiently related to be found ongoing. A brief initial review reveals that courts outside of the Ninth Circuit have identified and adopted different approaches. For instance, on remand from the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gwaltney\n   </em>\n   rejected the argument that \"a finding [of] an ongoing violation of the permit\" allowed a court to \"impose penalties for any past violation of any permit\n   <em>\n    parameter\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v.

Accordingly, the court could not impose penalties for wholly past discharges of one pollutant based on ongoing discharges of a different pollutant, where the \"problems were due to distinct equipment and operational failures, and were corrected by distinct engineering solutions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12030764\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/890/690/#p698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the Third Circuit adopted a \"modified by-parameter approach\" that allows a plaintiff to \"establish at trial that violations are continuous or intermittent in either of two ways: first, by proving a likelihood of recurring violations of the same parameter; or second, by proving a likelihood that the same inadequately corrected source of trouble will cause recurring violations of one or more different parameters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1883051\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/2/493/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1883051\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/2/493/#p498\">\n    at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Ninth Circuit does not appear to have expressly addressed the question.

Southwest Marine\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding of ongoing violations, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support its conclusion that a series of incidents violating the SWPPP's \"good housekeeping\" standard \" 'present[ed] a picture of overall inadequacies,' \" not mere \" 'snapshots' \" of discrete events.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170318\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/985/#p994\">\n    236 F.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At least one district court in this circuit has interpreted\n   <em>\n    Southwest Marine\n   </em>\n   as applying a modified by-parameter approach similar to the Third Circuit's test.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.
