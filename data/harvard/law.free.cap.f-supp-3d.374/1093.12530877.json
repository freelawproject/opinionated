The magistrate judge recommends that the Court dismiss plaintiff's state-law medical malpractice claim against defendant Donald Gibson on the ground that it is barred by Colorado's two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 113 at 5. Plaintiff filed a timely objection to the recommendation on August 3, 2018. Docket No. 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   lawsuit on April 26, 2017, asserting constitutional and state-law claims arising out of a series of incidents that occurred at San Carlos Correctional Facility (\"SCCF\") in April 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. As relevant here, plaintiff's second claim for relief asserts that he was placed on a \"mental health watch\" from April 15, 2015 until April 29, 2015, during which time he was placed in ambulatory restraints that made it nearly impossible to sleep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He alleges that, during this time, various individuals, including defendant Donald Gibson, subjected him to \"restraint checks\" every two hours whereby plaintiff was removed from his cell and the tightness of his restraints checked, which had the purpose of punishing plaintiff and depriving him of sleep.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Plaintiff further alleges that defendant Gibson helped to justify plaintiff's continued placement on mental health watch despite knowing that plaintiff was not a danger to himself or others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Plaintiff asserts claims against defendant Gibson for medical malpractice under state law and cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 31, 2017, defendants Raemisch, Travis, Montoya, Eslinger, Collins, Maley, Spearing, Gallardo, Espinoza, Cortez, Shofner, Krakow, Jones, and Sierra moved to dismiss the majority of plaintiff's claims, including the second claim for relief. Docket No. 32. Defendant Gibson did not join in the motion to dismiss because he was not served until January 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 20, 2018, the magistrate judge recommended that the defendants' motion be granted and that plaintiff's second claim for relief be dismissed to the extent that it asserted an Eighth Amendment claim against defendants Maley, Gibson, and Spearing. Docket No. 94 at 31. The magistrate judge determined that the claim had accrued outside of the applicable two-year statute of limitations period and was not subject to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 27, 2018, the Court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendation and dismissed plaintiff's second claim for relief to the extent that it asserted an Eighth Amendment claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Docket No. 103 at 10. In doing so, the Court overruled plaintiff's objection that he was entitled to equitable tolling, concluding that plaintiff had not shown he had made diligent efforts to pursue his claims within the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 103 at 7. Plaintiff's medical malpractice claims were allowed to proceed because defendants had not advanced any argument that those claims were subject to dismissal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 29, 2018, defendant Gibson moved to dismiss the second claim for relief to the extent it asserted a medical malpractice claim against him.

P. 72(b), Advisory Committee Notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because plaintiff is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court construes his objection and pleadings liberally without serving as his advocate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the magistrate judge's recommendation on two grounds. First, he asserts that defendant \"Gibson's complained-of conduct was a continuing injury over the course of a two-week period from April 15, 2015 through April 29, 2015\" and thus \"the full nature of the injury...was [not] immediately cognizable on April 15, 2015.\" Docket No. 114 at 2. Second, plaintiff contends that the Court erred by dismissing his Eighth Amendment claim against defendant Gibson because defendant Gibson did not join in the\n   motion to dismiss plaintiff's constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Medical Malpractice Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the magistrate judge's \"reliance on an accrual date of April 15, 2015 is misplaced\" because, unlike Dr. Richard Maley, who initiated the ambulatory restraints on April 15, defendant Gibson \"continued the [mental health watch] restraints over the course of the...two-week period.\" Docket No. 114 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff appears to be invoking the continuing violation doctrine. Under that doctrine, \"if a defendant has engaged in a series of unlawful acts over an extended period, a plaintiff may be allowed to obtain relief for a time-barred act by linking it with an act that occurs within the limitations period.\"\n   <em>\n    Polk v. Hergert Land &amp; Cattle Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243574\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/5/402/#p405\">\n    5 P.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405 (Colo. App. 2000).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Colorado courts have generally limited the continuing violation doctrine to employment discrimination cases,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243574\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/5/402/#p405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harmon v. Fred S. James &amp; Co. of Colorado, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10344718\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/899/258/#p261\">\n    899 P.2d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261-62 (Colo. App. 1994) (declining to extend continuing violation doctrine to bad faith claim), and plaintiff has not offered any argument or authority for extending the doctrine to medical malpractice claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court finds it unlikely that Colorado courts would extend the continuing violation doctrine to this context. As the Colorado Court of Appeals explained in\n   <em>\n    Harmon\n   </em>\n   , courts have traditionally applied the doctrine in three types of cases: (1) cases involving \"hiring or promotion practices in which the decision-making process takes place over a period of time\"; (2) cases in which an \"employer has an express, openly espoused policy that is alleged to be discriminatory\"; and (3) cases in which an \"employer has covertly engaged in a practice of discrimination which is evidenced only by a series of discrete, allegedly discriminatory, acts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10344718\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/899/258/#p261\">\n    899 P.2d at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These cases illustrate that \"[a] series of unlawful acts can be viewed properly as a continuing violation only if their character was not apparent when they were committed but became so when viewed in the light of the later acts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10344718\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/899/258/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10344718\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/899/258/#p261\">\n    at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Harmon\n   </em>\n   , the court declined to extend the continuing violation doctrine to the plaintiff's bad faith claim because, \"[u]nlike the harassment and hostile environment cases, a claim of bad faith may arise from one episode of unreasonable conduct by an insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10344718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/899/258/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same logic is applicable here. Plaintiff alleges multiple discrete acts, each of which may be independently sufficient to support a medical malpractice claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 29 (alleging\n   that plaintiff was subject to restraint checks every two hours, \"made to exit his cell on threat of force,\" and \"shoved up against the wall\"), 33 (alleging that the defendants \"alternated...in...writing false reports and continuing the ambulatory restraint MH Watch when they knew that it was not justified\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that the continuing violation doctrine does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation could also be construed as asserting that, because defendant Gibson's unlawful conduct continued over the course of the two-week period beginning on April 15, 2015, at least some of his actions fall within the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 114 at 2, \u00b6 7 (noting that \"the Complaint alleges that Dr. Maley initiated the MHW ambulatory restraints on April 15, 2015 as opposed to Gibson, who is contrastingly alleged to have continued the MHW restraints over the course of said two-week period\"). Plaintiff's complaint is not clear on this point. For example, although plaintiff alleges that the defendants \"alternated during [the] two week period in stopping by [plaintiff's] cell, writing false reports and continuing the ambulatory restraint MH Watch,\" he does not allege the specific date on which defendant Gibson purportedly drafted his false report. Docket No. 1 at 9, \u00b6 33. \"A statute of limitations defense may be appropriately resolved on a Rule 12(b) motion when the dates given in the complaint make clear that the right sued upon has been extinguished.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.
