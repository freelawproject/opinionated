TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs MCI Communications Services, Inc. and MCImetro Access Transmission Services, LLC (collectively \"MCI\") bring an action for trespass, negligence, and statutory liability as an excavator against Maverick Cutting and Breaking LLC (\"Maverick\"), who severed two of MCI's fiber-optic telecommunications cables while performing concrete saw cutting at an intersection. MCI seeks damages for repair costs and loss of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Maverick now moves for summary judgment on all of MCI's claims and on loss-of-use damages. Maverick also seeks to exclude portions of MCI expert Ron Peterson's testimony, all of MCI expert Peter Tooley's testimony, and evidence of the rental cost of substitute cables. MCI seeks\n   to exclude Maverick expert Steven Hamilton's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court will grant Maverick's Motion for Summary Judgment in part and deny it in part. The Court will find that MCI is not entitled to loss of use damages and that no genuine disputes of material fact remain as to trespass or as to negligence based on contractual duties or a saw cutter industry standard of care. However, the Court will find that a genuine dispute of material fact remains as to whether Maverick was engaged in excavation under Minnesota statute and the common law. As such, a jury must determine whether Maverick is liable as an excavator under Minnesota statute or in negligence based on an excavator industry standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court will grant Maverick's Motion in Limine in part and deny it in part. The Court will preclude Peterson's testimony on contract interpretation, what Brooks did when installing the Cables, and saw cutter industry standards of care. The Court will also preclude Tooley's testimony and evidence of rental cost of substitute cables because both are irrelevant given the Court's ruling on loss-of-use damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court will grant MCI's Motion in Limine in part and deny it in part. The Court will preclude Hamilton from testifying as to saw cutter industry standards of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the spring of 2015, the City of St. Paul (the \"City\") began construction on a public works project (the \"Project\") to maintain and improve several bridges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Players\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brent Christensen, a civil engineer, was the City's manager of the Project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Aff. of Rachel Beauchamp (\"1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff.\") \u00b6 3, Ex. A (\"Christensen Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5, July 5, 2018, Docket No. 38.) The City hired TKDA to design the Project and provide professional engineering services for the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) TKDA was responsible for compiling information regarding utilities that might be impacted by the Project and coordinating solutions to identified conflicts. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 4, Ex. B (\"Quanbeck Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kraemer North America, LLC, (\"Kraemer\") was the general contractor on the Project. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 8, Ex. F (\"Rosenberry Dep.\") at 14-15.) Kraemer hired Bolander &amp; Sons (\"Bolander\") for excavating and demolition, which included pavement removal and grading for new roadway pavements. (Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 9, Ex. G (\"Caroon Dep.\") at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bolander hired Maverick via oral contract to perform saw cutting for the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Bolander told Maverick where to cut and how deep to cut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Maverick performs about 90% of Bolander's concrete saw cutting work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) According to Bolander, Maverick's work involved only saw cutting, did not involve pavement removal or grading, and did not involve excavating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Maverick asserts that its only job was to cut where Bolander directed and that it did not deal with utilities or their location. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 13, Ex. K (\"Lewis Dep.\") at 4, 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MCI is a telecommunications company that owns and operates underground fiber optic telecommunications cables in and under various streets in the City. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, Apr. 11, 2017, Docket No. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   MCI owned the Cables that Maverick cut. Brooks Fiber Communications (\"Brooks\"), MCI's predecessor-in-interest, originally installed the Cables in 1997 or 1998. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of James J. Proszek (\"Proszek Decl.\") \u00b6 4, Ex. 1 (\"As-Builts\"), July 26, 2018, Docket No. 48; Proszek Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 2 (\"1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   RFA\") at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Preparations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 26, 2013, TKDA sent a Gopher State One Call (\"GSOC\") ticket requesting utility maps in the Project area. (Quanbeck Aff. \u00b6 5.) MCI produced an internal document indicating \"Action Taken\" in response to TKDA's request related to the intersection of Kellogg and Wabasha (the \"Intersection\") on May 1, 2013. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 5, Ex. C; Proszek Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. 7 at 7-9.) MCI alleges that it sent \"as-builts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Intersection but produced no records to show that TKDA received them. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. 7 at 7-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 6, Ex. D (\"Wilfong Dep.\") at 42-43.) TKDA has no record of receiving anything and the GSOC ticket of utility owner responses shows MCI had not responded as of May 20, 2013. (Quanbeck Aff. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 16, 2014, TKDA invited MCI to attend a utility coordination meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The invitation referenced the Project area and attached drawings, which showed the Intersection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MCI did not attend the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 25, 2015, Bolander submitted a GSOC request for a \"meet and locate\" on March 31, 2015, for \"road construction\" at the Intersection. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 10, Ex. H at 3.) The request expired April 14, 2015, at 9:00 a.m. and the duration of the work was listed as 6 months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MCI locator Vince Johnson performed the meet and locate, marking the approximate horizontal locations of MCI's underground cables. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 11, Ex. I (\"Johnson Dep.\") at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Johnson testified that MCI has as-builts available to internal locators that they can refer to if they \"have a question about where the line might possibly run....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) He testified that as-builts might give a depth location or estimate \"if the depth features [of the cables] are unusual....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) But Johnson testified that he typically only consults as-builts when locating in an area with which he is unfamiliar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) He further testified that the \"receiver\" used by locators to find the cables can give you a \"very, very general idea of depth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The depth measurement setting must be separately turned on, but taking such a measurement does not cost anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Johnson testified that locators do not usually give depth readings to contractors because they do not want contractors to rely on them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is no evidence that Maverick or Bolander asked Johnson for depth information or that Johnson was required to mark depth under Minnesota law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216D.04, subd. 3 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   MCI asserts that the contracts between the City and Kraemer and between Kraemer and Bolander required that all subcontractors comply with all the requirements of the City's specifications and drawings for the Project. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. 9 at 7; Proszek Decl. \u00b6 13, Ex. 10 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Proszek Decl. \u00b6 14, Ex. 11 \u00a7\u00a7 III(A)-(B), 1507.) MCI notes that the City's specifications warn that subsurface utility information is of the lowest possible level; thus, information concerning type and location of utilities shown in project drawings are not guaranteed to be accurate\n   or all-inclusive. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 14, Ex. 11 \u00a7 1507.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 14, 2015, Maverick performed saw cutting for Bolander at the Intersection. (Caroon Dep. at 5.) Maverick saw cut with mechanized equipment over locator marks in the concrete and severed the Cables. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8; 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 12, Ex. J (\"Incident Report\") at 1.) The Cables were inside a four inch pipe, the top of which was seven inches down in the 13-inch concrete. (Incident Report at 1-2.) The area Maverick was saw cutting when it severed the Cables consisted of concrete pavement on top of soil. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. 5 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Maverick had no knowledge of the Cables, was \"there at the sole discretion of [Bolander],\" and cut what Bolander told it to cut. (Lewis Dep. at 4.) Maverick had not been in contact with MCI, the City, or Kraemer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Maverick never received plans or as-builts related to the Intersection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Maverick did nothing to determine the location of the Cables and does not provide any training to its employees as to what precautions they should take regarding underground utilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 8, 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The day after Maverick severed the Cables, a meeting was held with the City, TKDA, Bolander, and representatives of MCI. (Christensen Aff. \u00b6 18 &amp; Ex. C.) They discussed cable depth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) MCI was expected to, and did, mark the rest of its cables for depth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MCI also had to relocate conflicting cables at its own cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19; 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 7, Ex. E (\"Bonczkowski Dep.\") at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Cable Repairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Cables were repaired over approximately eight and a half hours. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 14, Ex. L (\"Damages Calculation\") at 1.) Plaintiffs seek $ 52,024.68 in damages for the cost of repairing the Cables. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Loss-of-Use Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While the Cables were being repaired, MCI rerouted traffic to spare capacity in its network on its own established cables. (Wilfong Dep. at 24-26, 28-29, 33.) Nevertheless, Plaintiffs seek $ 859,326.59 in loss of use damages based on how much it\n   <strong>\n    would\n   </strong>\n   have cost to route capacity to a third party and return it back to the network. (Damages Calculation at 1-5.) MCI did not pay third parties but rather used \"dedicated, spare restoration capacity on other cables in MCI's network which MCI reserves for use in emergencies and does not use in the ordinary course of its business....\" (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 16, Ex. N at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   MCI's extra capacity is not located on a separate set of cables but rather on cables that MCI uses in its ordinary course of business, just not to their full capacity. (2d Aff. of Rachel Beauchamp \u00b6 1, Ex. V at 48-49, Aug. 9, 2018, Docket No. 52-1.) Occasionally, MCI rolls traffic over to this spare capacity when it has to perform a \"hot cut,\" which involves \"splic[ing] in another piece of cable to extend the length of [a] cable....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.) MCI provided damage calculations for the total capacity that the severed Cables were capable of carrying but did not distinguish between \"active\" and \"standby\" capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59.) MCI has spent \"a lot of money to make sure that [its] network is resilient\" and to ensure that it has the capacity to move traffic over to other lines in emergencies. (Wilfong Dep. at 51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Disputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standard Cable Depth\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Brent Christensen, manager of the Project, attests that, in his training and experience\n   in civil engineering and project management, he has never experienced telecommunications utilities placed inside poured concrete sections of road pavements. (Christensen Aff. \u00b6 21.) Ronald Quanbeck, a Senior Registered Engineer with TKDA, attested that, in his training and experience, utility lines are expected to be below the pavement. (Quanbeck Aff. \u00b6 14.) Aaron Rosenberry, a corporate representative of Kraemer North America, testified that Kraemer was surprised to learn about MCI's utility running seven inches down from the top of the roadway through concrete, and that he had never seen that done before in his 32 years of experience. (Rosenberry Dep. at 7, 48-49.) He also testified that no one had told Kraemer the depth of the Cables. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50.) John Caroon, Project Manager and Estimator for Bolander, testified that no one ever provided Bolander with an as-built showing that the cable was located seven inches down within the concrete nor did anyone tell Bolander that there was a cable running directly through the concrete. (Caroon Dep. at 2, 9.) He also testified that the industry standard depth for telecommunications cables is 36 inches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Jamen Lewis, Maverick's 30(b)(6) representative, testified that Maverick had no knowledge of the cables and performed work at the sole discretion of Bolander, cutting what Bolander directed it to. (Lewis Dep. at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Vincent Johnson, a Senior MCI Technician, testified that the depth of cables can vary \"significantly,\" but the ideal depth is three to four feet. (Johnson Dep. at 3.) He said that he has encountered cables running less than one foot below ground and through concrete \"at least 30 times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) He has visited approximately 2000 sites per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ron Peterson, MCI's expert witness, agreed that MCI's cables were not placed at a common standard depth or an industry standard depth, stating that 24 or 36 inches are common standards. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 19, Ex. Q (\"Peterson Dep.\") at 1, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Neither the City nor MCI has located a permit or other written authority that would allow MCI's cables to run at seven inches below pavement surface through concrete. (Christensen Aff. \u00b6 12; Wilfong Dep. at 48-50; Bonczkowski Dep. at 8-9.) Nevertheless, MCI asserts that cities generally have inspectors overseeing installation and would have ensured that Brooks installed the Cables in a manner consistent with the construction drawings it submitted. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. 3 (\"Bonczkowski Decl.\") \u00b6 7.) As such, MCI argues that the Cables could not have been installed as they were unless the City had approved such an installation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Brooks's As-Builts for the Cables show that they were encased in steel, 12 inches down, and encased in concrete. (As-Builts at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Possession of the Installation Area\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   MCI alleges that it had a permit from the City, which gave it undisturbed possession of the area in which it installed the cables that Maverick damaged. (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Beauchamp Aff. \u00b6 17, Ex. O at 8.) MCI has not found the referenced permit but argues that ample circumstantial evidence supports its existence. It alleges that, as part of the installation process, Brooks would have obtained a permit from the city that would have required Brooks to submit proposed construction drawings to the City. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   RFA at 13.) MCI points to affidavits and depositions by several employees attesting that, based on their experience, \"it is highly unlikely\" that Brooks could have installed the Cables without getting a permit from the City. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, Ex. 3 \u00b6 5, Ex. 4 \u00b6 5, Ex. 5 at 5, Ex. 6 at 10.) MCI produced a permit and drawings for Brooks' installation of underground cables\n   for another part of the same project. (Proszek Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Christensen attests that the City \"is the local authority that provides legal authority for utilities to run and operate their lines underground within the City of St. Paul right-ofway.\" (Christensen Aff. \u00b6 8.) He attests that, when one of the City's construction projects conflicts with these lines, \"the City reserves the right to require those utility owners with conflicting lines to relocate their lines at their own expense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Stephen Bonczkowski, an MCI employee testifying on behalf of MCI, also testified that the City was the property or right-of-way owner. (Bonczkowski Dep. at 2, 16.) He is \"the designated individual ... capable of giving testimony about installation, ownership and maintenance and rights of use of the telecommunications cables\" in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Bonczkowski also testified consistently with Christensen that, if the City needed to dig up the street in an area where MCI had cables, MCI would have to move the cables at its own cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) But Bonczkowski attested that \"it is highly unlikely\" that Brooks could have installed the Cables without a permit. (Bonczkowski Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EXPERT TESTIMONY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. MCI's Expert: Ron Peterson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   MCI's proffered Expert, Ron Peterson, gave the following relevant opinions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   4. Maverick was performing excavation activities as defined in Minnesota State Law Chapter 216D. Any point at which the blade moved dirt would constitute excavation under the law. Pictures provided clearly show dirt under the concrete. Because concrete depths vary on sites, there is little doubt that the blade was moving dirt at points during the operation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   6. Maverick should have utilized safe practices to prevent damage to MCI's fiber optic cables. This would include exposing the accurately marked lines by safe and acceptable means prior to crossing the line. This could have easily been accomplished by chipping away the concrete beginning at the edge of the tolerance zone and working toward the marks. This is a commonly used practice to expose utility lines under concrete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   7. Maverick could and should have utilized GPR [Ground Penetrating Radar] to check for obstructions along the proposed path of the saw cut. This is an industry best practice and would have identified the embedment that was the 4? pipe at the base of the concrete. The presence of the marks directly over the location would have been a further indicator that the MCI lines were there....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   9. Bolander and Maverick were required to comply with the provisions of the contract between Kraemer and the City as well as the contract between Kraemer and Bolander. These contracts require the contractor and their subcontractors to also follow all laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   10. Bolander's Project Manager John Caroon, had no understanding of what ASCE 38-02 was and no idea what Quality Level D indicated on the plans and in the contract documents. QL D is the least dependable and least accurate level of subsurface utility depiction on plans. This means that utility locations on plans should not be relied upon and\n   further backs the requirement that utility locations must be verified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   11. Bolander and Maverick either ignored or didn't understand statements on the project plans. In numerous locations, the plans specify that utility depictions are of a quality level D, that the accuracy of the plans was not guaranteed and that the contractor must verify the exact locations of utility lines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   12. Bolander and Maverick also either ignored or didn't understand the same statements regarding quality level D which can be found in the contract documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   13 Bolander and Maverick should have been alerted by the presence of the Brooks Manhole Cover and the marks extending from it into the dig location. The fact that no utility lines are shown on the plans at this location should have given clear indication that the MCI fiber optic cables were present and caused them to investigate further prior to cutting the pavement directly across the marks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   14. Regardless of any direction provided by Bolander, Maverick had a responsibility to follow safe practices and industry standards to safely perform their work....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   16. Brooks followed industry standards and practices when it placed the fiber optic cables along Kellogg Blvd. When they were forced to place the line in a shallow location, they encased the cables in a steel pipe and surrounded it with concrete. This is a commonly used and accepted practice in the industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   17.

MCI argues that its spare capacity is maintained solely for emergencies; thus, it is the equivalent of a spare boat reserved for emergencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Courts have applied the spare boat rule to telecommunications cases with varying results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, however, the outcome depends on state law. The Court is not aware of any cases applying the spare boat rule to telecommunications disputes under Minnesota law. The Court finds that the spare boat rule does not allow for damages in this case because Minnesota law requires a plaintiff to mitigate damages, which MCI did. To allow MCI to recover under the spare boat line of cases would obviate Minnesota's requirement of mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Even if the spare boat rule could be applied under Minnesota damages law, it would not allow MCI to recover for loss-of-use damages. While MCI claims that it maintains extra capacity for emergency purposes only, it does not dispute that it has not installed independent, spare cables. MCI also does not dispute that it uses this spare capacity when it needs to shut down a cable to perform a \"hot cut.\" As such, MCI's spare capacity is not the equivalent of a spare boat maintained in reserve for emergencies only because it is also used for its own non-emergency business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Furthermore, a determination of loss-of-use damages based on rental of a substitute would be speculative because a\n   rental market for spare cable capacity does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, public policy favors this outcome. As noted by the Supreme Court of Georgia in\n   <em>\n    CMES\n   </em>\n   , the \"underlying principle of compensatory damages law is not triggered here....\" 728 S.E.2d at 652. MCI's spare capacity is a necessary investment to remain competitive in the telecommunications industry. It has \"inherent value ... apart from its value in emergencies, and MCI has not shown that the costs of such infrastructure have not been in some way charged back to its customers by way of, for example, higher rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Allowing MCI to recover loss-of-use damages here would place MCI \"in a position significantly better than it would have been without the severance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Public policy weighs against awarding loss-of-use damages in these circumstances, because to do so would allow corporations to receive windfalls for losses they never suffered and would compensate them for investments otherwise necessary to make them competitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

MCI's expert, Peterson, offers several opinions as to industry best practices for saw cutters.

In the present case, Peterson's testimony does not distinguish between industry best practices and industry standards of care, does not reference industry practices or guidelines specific to a saw cutter's duty, and seems to be based mostly - if not only - on his own view of best practices for saw cutters. This testimony does not establish saw cutter industry standards of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pond Hollow Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089661\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/779/920/#p923\">\n    779 N.W.2d at 923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant summary judgment for Maverick on MCI's negligence claim to the extent that it is based on Maverick's duty as a saw cutter.

Furthermore, Maverick argues that its work did not \"disturb[ ] the soil\" as that phrase should be interpreted in this statute. Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest that Maverick set its saw cutter to cut past the\n   depth of the concrete, and it is undisputed that the concrete sat atop dirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Both parties argue that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \"disturbs\" should guide this action.

However, it is a question of fact whether Maverick \"disturbed\" the soil under the plain meaning of that word, and there are facts supporting either conclusion.

Maverick's Motion In Limine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Maverick seeks to exclude portions of MCI expert Ron Peterson's testimony, all of MCI expert Peter Tooley's testimony, and all evidence of rental costs for substitute cables. The Court will grant Maverick's Motion in Limine in part and deny it in part. The Court will preclude Peterson from testifying regarding contract interpretation, what Brooks did when installing the Cables, and saw cutter industry standards of care. The Court will also exclude Tooley's testimony as well as evidence of rental value because both are irrelevant given the Court's ruling on loss-of-use damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Peterson's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Maverick moves to exclude the portions of Peterson's testimony relating to disputed questions of material fact, legal standards and obligations, contract formation and contract terms, GPR, and excavation industry standards of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   First, Maverick seeks to preclude Peterson from testifying to disputed facts. An expert may give an opinion \"based upon factual assumptions, the validity of which are for the jury to determine;\" however, an expert may not testify \"that a disputed fact actually occurred or that one witness is more credible than another....\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Barze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070082\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/1040/#p1059\">\n    57 F.Supp.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1059 (D. Minn. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Richman v. Sheahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72800\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/415/929/#p942\">\n    415 F.Supp.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 (N.D. Ill. 2006) ). As such, Peterson may offer statements of fact as the basis for his opinions and conclusions but may not opine on their veracity or on the testifying witnesses' credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, Maverick argues that Peterson's testimony that Maverick should have been alerted to the presence of the underground cable while saw cutting has no factual foundation and is based on inconsistent testimony. But Maverick does not argue that Peterson is unqualified to give such an opinion. Furthermore, there are facts in the record that could lead a jury to agree with Peterson's opinion. Peterson may offer this opinion, and any inconsistencies may be explored in cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Third, Maverick seeks to exclude Peterson's testimony that Brooks followed industry standards of care when placing cables along Kellogg Boulevard. Peterson has no personal knowledge of what Brooks did or of any alleged permit. As such, he may not testify as to Brooks's actions or as to whether they complied with a permit. Peterson does, however, opine that encasing cables in a steel pipe surrounded with concrete is a commonly used and accepted practice in the industry. Peterson may offer this opinion and may testify as to whether the placement of the Cables appeared to comply with this practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Fourth, Maverick seeks to preclude Peterson from offering testimony regarding saw cutter industry standards of care. Because the Court will grant summary judgment for Maverick on MCI's negligence claim based on saw cutter industry standards of care, this testimony is irrelevant and may not be offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Fifth, Maverick seeks to exclude Peterson's testimony regarding what Maverick \"should have done.\" Maverick argues that these conclusions should be left to the jury, and that Peterson's testimony should be limited to describing standard practices\n   within the industry. \"An expert witness may give opinion testimony if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. Such opinion testimony is not inadmissible merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson Grp. v. Beecham, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867517\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/1005/#p1007\">\n    952 F.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (8th Cir. 1991) (internal citations omitted). As such, Peterson may testify about what Maverick should have done according to standard practices within the industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Sixth, Maverick seeks to exclude Peterson's testimony regarding excavation industry standards of care because the testimony rests on the faulty conclusion that Maverick was engaged in excavation. As noted above, it is a question of fact for the jury whether Maverick disturbed the soil. Peterson may thus testify as to excavation industry standards of care, which will be relevant to the negligence claim if the jury finds that Maverick was an excavator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Finally, Maverick argues that Peterson must be prohibited from offering testimony or opinions regarding Maverick's contractual duties. Because Peterson does not purport to be an expert on contract interpretation, and because Maverick is not bound by contracts to which it was not a signatory, Peterson may not testify regarding any contractual duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Tooley's Testimony and Evidence of Rental Value\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Because MCI is not entitled to loss-of-use damages, neither Tooley's testimony nor evidence of rental value is relevant. The Court will exclude this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    C. MCI's MOTION IN LIMINE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   MCI seeks to exclude Hamilton's opinions on: (1) the depth of the Cables; (2) saw cutter industry standards of care and whether they were followed; (3) Maverick's responsibilities with regard to utility locating; (4) the implications of Bolander being a \"low-bid\" contractor; and (5) what MCI's locator should have done to determine depth of the Cables. MCI argues that Hamilton may not offer opinions on these issues because he does not have knowledge, skills, experience, training, or education related to underground utilities, saw cutting, or the industry standards or practices for either of these industries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court will grant MCI's Motion in Limine in part and deny it in part. The Court will preclude Hamilton from testifying as to the saw cutter industry standards of care but will allow him to testify as to the other opinions contained in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Hamilton's Expertise Related to Underground Utilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   MCI argues that Hamilton's only experience related to underground utilities is his work on one project, the Green Line, and that he has never been personally responsible for locating or relocating existing utility facilities. Furthermore, he has never performed saw cutting in the field and was not aware of what industry standards of care would apply to saw cutting. But Hamilton has expertise in installing underground utilities for the light rail system. (2d Proszek Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 2 (\"Hamilton Dep.\") at 15-16.) Hamilton worked on the Green Line for approximately seven years, on the Blue Line for five years, and on a Denver light rail project for approximately four years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) For the Green Line project, Hamilton was responsible\n   for identifying conflicts with existing utilities and developing standards for the placement of new utilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 10.) While Hamilton acknowledged that he was not responsible for developing standards or specifications for how the contractors working on the project were to locate and protect\n   <strong>\n    existing\n   </strong>\n   utilities, he was \"aware of the basic procedures that they followed,\" including utility coordination meetings, working with the GSOC, identifying existing utilities, and relocating them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Hamilton was also responsible for identifying conflicts with existing utility facilities in his work for the Blue Line and for the Denver light rail project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 13.) The Project at issue in this case was similar in scale and process to the Green Line project that Hamilton worked on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Hamilton has enough experience to testify regarding underground utilities and their location/relocation. However, Hamilton has no experience with saw cutting industry standards of care, and those standards are made irrelevant by the Court's ruling on the negligence claim. As such, Hamilton may offer testimony regarding underground utilities and their location/relocation but may not offer opinions regarding saw cutter industry standards of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hamilton's Expertise Related to Low Bid Contractors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   MCI argues that Hamilton is not an expert with regards to low bid contractors because the only support he provided for his opinion was an article that he reviewed specifically in preparation for the work he had done on this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) However, Hamilton also testified that he was previously aware of the distinction between industry standard of care and industry best practice because it was a topic that came up on occasion during his work with the light rail, but he \"wanted to find an article that talked about it ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hamilton also had personal knowledge of the distinctions between low-bid versus best value projects because he reviewed all contractor bids on the Green Line project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 33.) Indeed, Hamilton testified that the bulk of the Green Line project was a low-bid project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Hamilton has enough experience to testify regarding low-bid and best-value contracts. He also has enough experience to testify about the distinction between industry standard of care and industry best practice. He may offer testimony on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reliability of Hamilton's Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   MCI argues that various opinions offered by Hamilton are unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   First, MCI argues that Hamilton's opinion that Maverick's contract was a \"low-bid\" contract and was therefore only subject to industry standards of care, not industry best practices, is unreliable because it was equivocal. Any deficiencies in this testimony go to weight, not admissibility, and can be explored on cross examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Second, MCI seeks to exclude Hamilton's opinions as to the depth of the Cables, and whether that depth was unusual, as unreliable because the basis for his conclusion was the Minnesota Administrative Code, which Hamilton had not encountered before being hired as an expert. MCI also argues that the code includes language allowing for other depths of placement on a case-by-case basis. But Hamilton has industry experience to support his view that seven inches was an unusual depth. Ultimately, any deficiencies in these opinions go to weight, not admissibility, and may be explored on cross examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Finally, MCI argues that Hamilton's opinion that MCI would have been obligated to notify and work closely with Bolander or Maverick per City code because the\n   Cables were less than twenty inches deep is unreliable because Hamilton was not personally aware of this requirement before being hired as an expert. Again, these deficiencies go to weight, not admissibility, and can be addressed by cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Usefulness of Hamilton's Opinions/Province of the Jury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   MCI also argues that most of the opinions and conclusions that Hamilton sets forth in his report are simply statements of fact based on his review of various documents and that such testimony is not helpful to the jury. Hamilton may offer statements of fact to explain the basis of his opinions but may not testify to the veracity of disputed facts or the veracity of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070082\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/1040/#p1059\">\n    57 F.Supp.3d at 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   1.

I at 3.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    MCI argues that this interpretation of Minnesota law is contrary to Section 928 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which allows for loss-of-use damages and which Minnesota cases have adopted, because Comment B of Section 931 states that a plaintiff may recover the rental value of a chattel even if the plaintiff uses his or her own substitute. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 928 ; \u00a7 931, cmt. b. But, while Minnesota cases have explicitly adopted Section 928, they have not explicitly adopted \u00a7 931. Indeed, cases citing Section 928 support the conclusion that Minnesota has not adopted Section 931. For example, in\n    <em>\n     In re Commodore Hotel Fire and Explosion Cases\n    </em>\n    , the Minnesota Supreme Court cited Section 928 and found that a hotel owner could recover loss-of-use damages in the form of lost revenues to cover fixed unabatable costs incurred during the period the property could not be used.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10673740\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/324/245/#p251\">\n     324 N.W.2d 245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 251 (Minn. 1982). Had the court also intended to adopt Section 931, the plaintiff could have recovered the fair rental value of a substitute hotel during that time and not just the costs incurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Furthermore, Comment C of Section 931 appears to qualify Comment B, clarifying that when a plaintiff uses his or her own substitute, the plaintiff is entitled to the reasonable rental value of the substitute used. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 931, cmt. c. Here, MCI has not provided the reasonable rental value of its own spare capacity; rather it calculated damages based on the rental value of third-party capacity, as well as the cost of rerouting the traffic.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Cases allowing telecommunications companies to recover loss-of-use damages in similar circumstances include:\n    <em>\n     Level 3 Communications, LLC v.
