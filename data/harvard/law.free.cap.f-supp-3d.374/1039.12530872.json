Leighton, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Adaptics Limited's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Dkt. ## 317, 321. The underlying patent dispute in this case concerns two products that enable a user to make food and mix drinks using weight-based measurements. Both products achieve this via an electronic scale that communicates with an app.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Perfect Company initially sued Adaptics on December 12, 2014, alleging that Adaptics' Drop Kitchen Connected Scale and Drop Kitchen Recipe App infringed its Patent No. 8,829,365. Three months later, Perfect joined Apple as a co-defendant. Perfect alleged that Apple infringed its patent by selling Adaptics' iOS-configured products via the App Store and at its brick-and-mortar locations. Perfect also alleged that Apple induced its customers to infringe Perfect's patent by selling Adaptics' products. Perfect later sued under its patent no. 9,772,217, which claims priority to the '365 patent, resulting in the two cases being consolidated. Dkt. # 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 25, 2015, Perfect settled with Apple and agreed not sue Apple or any of its customers, affiliate, suppliers, and others for infringement of the '365 patent or others claiming priority to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 322, at \u00a7\u00a7 1.1-1.2, 2.1-2.2. The settlement covers all products sold by Apple, past and future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 2.1-2.2. However, the settlement contains a \"carve out\" that specifically excludes infringement claims against Adaptics and any other entity that designs or manufactures products or services that infringe Perfect's patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.7. The covenant not to sue references the carve out section, thus excluding Adaptics from the broad covenant and release of Apple's affiliates and suppliers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Adaptics argues that this settlement functions as an authorization for Apple to sell any and all Adaptics products utilizing the iOS system. Applying the doctrine of patent exhaustion, Adaptics contends that Perfect extinguished its right to sue Adaptics or any other party for infringement with respect to the products it authorized Apple to sell. Under Adaptics' conception of patent exhaustion, as soon as a patentee authorizes the sale of a particular type of product, that product passes outside the patent monopoly and cannot be the object of a lawsuit. Adaptics argues that, if Perfect's patent rights were not exhausted by the Apple authorization, Perfect would be able to collect twice on the value of its patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Perfect vigorously resists this characterization of patent exhaustion. According to Perfect, patent exhaustion only applies to subsequent, downstream purchasers after an initial authorized sale. Consequently, because Apple is not the initial manufacturer and seller, the settlement did not trigger patent exhaustion. Perfect also argues\n   that \"[t]he Settlement Agreement agreed to dismiss Apple as a defendant, but did not actually immunize Apples [sic] activities to the extent they relate to Adaptics' infringing conduct.\" Dkt. # 331, at 10. Perfect goes on to assert that the Supreme Court has held that settling with one defendant does not immunize another and that such a settlement does not provide a double recovery. Finally, as a side note, Perfect also points out that Adaptics failed to plead patent exhaustion as an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Patent Exhaustion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties focus much of their attention on the extent to which the settlement authorizes Apple to sell the same products that Perfect is also suing Adaptics over. However, the success or failure of Adaptics' Motion hinges on one legal issue: whether an authorized sale of a product exhausts all patent rights in that type of product against both downstream and upstream parties in the chain of commerce. Adaptics largely takes for granted that it does, but the case law suggests otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Supreme Court recently provided a refresher on the patent exhaustion doctrine in\n   <em>\n    Impression Products, Inc. v.

Dkt. # 321, at 1, 6. According to the Court's description of patent exhaustion, \"when a patentee sells one of its products ... [t]he purchaser and all\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   owners are free to use or resell the product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1529 (emphasis added). The Court then applied this principle in a straightforward manner by holding that the patentee's own initial sale moved its product \"outside the patent monopoly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1533. This description and application of patent exhaustion is limited to transactions downstream of the authorized sale and says nothing about whether a patentee's rights against upstream parties are exhausted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Adaptics is not a subsequent purchaser, but rather the original designer, manufacturer, and supplier of its products to Apple, making exhaustion inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Adaptics points to the Court's explanation that an authorized sale by any third party is tantamount to the patentee making the sale themselves, resulting in the sale \"exhaust[ing] the patentee's rights in\n   <em>\n    that item.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1535 (emphasis added). But the Court's use of the term \"that item\" was not, as Adaptics wishes, a reference to that type of product universally, or even that particular item with respect to transfers that may have taken place prior to the authorized sale. Rather, the patentee only loses the right to enforce \"post-sale restrictions on\n   <em>\n    purchasers.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Their rights against the original manufacturer or designer (if it is not the patentee themselves) are unaffected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Keurig, Inc. v. Sturm Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , cited by Adaptics, also did not expand patent exhaustion to apply directly upstream.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710075\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1370/\">\n    732 F.3d 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

In\n   <em>\n    Keurig\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the patentee exhausted its patent rights in its brewers after selling them without conditions to consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710075\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710075\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1370/\">\n    at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It therefore could not enforce its method patent rights against Sturm, which sold cartridges compatible with Keurig's brewers, because to do so would allow Keurig to control its brewers post-sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710075\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, in contrast, Perfect is not attempting to exert control over how products already sold by Apple may be used or re-sold. Instead, Perfect is exercising its right to hold Adaptics accountable for independent infringement, which necessarily occurred prior to any authorized sales by Apple for each product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The few cases that have contemplated Adaptics' upstream patent exhaustion arguments have rejected them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crossroads Sys., Inc. v.

Only the manufacturer would be exposed to liability while those who purchased from the distributor would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Adaptics' position also cuts against the purpose of ensuring patentees recover only the fair value of their patent and would make patent litigation less efficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604319\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1523/#p1532\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When a patentee settles with an infringing manufacturer the settlement theoretically accounts for the patent's full value, including any subsequent unforeseeable transfers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Princo Corp. v.

If a patentee wishes to retain their right to sue a particular distributor, they may include such a restriction in the license granted to the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Impression Prod.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604319\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1523/#p1532\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, there is no corresponding method for a patentee to settle with a downstream distributor in a way that allows them to sell the product but restricts them from obtaining the product from the manufacturer. Such a restriction would negate the license to sell the product, since the manufacturer is the product's sole source.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If patent exhaustion applies upstream as Adaptics suggests, there would be no way to enforce a patent against multiple infringers unless the parties settled simultaneously, a requirement that would senselessly impede efficient dispute resolution.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Interdigital Tech.

Pa. 1994) (holding that settlement with one alleged infringer did not bar litigation against a second and recognizing that any other outcome would discourage settlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, allowing a patentee to exhaust their rights against a distributor and its customers while maintaining them against the manufacturer does not present the threat of allowing a patentee to over-collect on their patent. When a patentee settles with a downstream distributor, both parties must necessarily be aware of the infringing manufacturer's existence and account for this by limiting the settlement to less than the patent's full value. This is all the more true when the patentee sues the manufacturer and the distributor together, a lawsuit that presupposes that each party bears a distinct portion of liability for their own infringement. A final recovery against one defendant thus may be offset by a prior settlement, but it\n   makes no sense to say that a patent's value must be limited to the recovery for just one defendant's liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aro Manufacturing Co. v.

Dkt. # 321, at 8. Section 2.2 of the settlement agreement states that Perfect \"forever discharges Apple ... from any and all actions ... whether known or unknown, arising out of the facts, events or occurrences underlying ... the allegations in this lawsuit.\" Dkt. # 322, at \u00a7 2.2. Consequently, Adaptics argues that it cannot be liable for infringement for the same exact products that Apple sold with authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is unclear whether an unconditional release retroactively authorizes past sales. Some courts have held that it can.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canon Inc. v. Tesseron Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265841\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/568/#p577\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    PSN Illinois, LLC v.

Ill. 2014). In any case, the Court need not decide whether the settlement retroactively authorized Apple's past sales because even a prior authorized sale only exhausts the patentee's rights with respect to the seller and any downstream purchasers. It does not exhaust rights against the original manufacturer, designer, and provider of the goods. Here, that is Adaptics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Adaptics' offhand assertion that only Apple sells its products also does not change the outcome. With respect to the Drop Scale, Adaptics' statement is simply wrong because that product can be purchased from Amazon.com and presumably elsewhere. With respect to the Drop App, Apple's privilege as the sole distributor is contingent on its monopoly control of the iOS ecosystem and marketplace. In any case, the fact that no other party directly sells the app to consumers is irrelevant. Unless Adaptics and Apple are the same company, there must necessarily have been an initial agreement between them for Adaptics' App to be available on the App Store. Because that agreement is antecedent to Apple providing the app to consumers, Adaptics is an upstream party subject to Perfect's patent rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the above reasons, Adaptics' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Dkt. ## 317 &amp; 321] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Actually, the settlement in\n    <em>\n     TransCore\n    </em>\n    was less clearly an authorization to sell because it only stated that the patentee would not sue \"for future infringement\" without specifying which actions the defendant could take.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236773\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/1271/#p1273\">\n     563 F.3d at 1276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
