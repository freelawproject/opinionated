Plaintiffs were protesting President Erdogan's policies when they allege that they were attacked by Defendants who include the Republic of Turkey, Turkish security forces, and civilian Defendants. As is relevant to this Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs have filed five claims against civilian Defendants Eyup Yildirim, Sinan Narin, and Alpkenan Dereci: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, hate crimes under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-3704\">\n    D.C.

Plaintiffs' claims arise out of a May 2017 visit by Turkish President Erdogan and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Their trip included a planned visit to the White House.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon learning that President Erdogan would be visiting the White House, leaders of the local Kurdish community planned a protest and applied for and were granted a permit to protest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. The Kurdish leaders intended to protest President Erdogan's treatment of the Kurdish ethnic minority in Turkey and other allegedly repressive practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During President Erdogan's White House visit, Plaintiffs and other individuals gathered in front of the White House \"to express their opposition to the repression and abuses of the Erdogan regime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. Also at the White House was a group that supported President Erdogan. But, the two groups remained separated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his White House visit, President Erdogan planned to go to the Turkish Ambassador's Residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. A group of anti-Erdogan protesters, including Plaintiffs, also went to the Ambassador's Residence in order to continue the protest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. When they arrived, a\n   group of pro-Erdogan civilians, Turkish security officials, and individuals who appeared to be staff members from the Turkish delegation were already at the Residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Plaintiffs allege that this group included people who had accepted the Turkish Ambassador's invitation to come to the District of Columbia to show support for President Erdogan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A. Dereci were civilian members of the pro-Erdogan group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Members of the pro-Erdogan group carried Turkish flags, while the protesters carried signs pertaining to Kurdish rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60, 62, 63. The protesters were outnumbered by the pro-Erdogan group and gathered on the sidewalk across from the Residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. Plaintiffs allege that the pro-Erdogan group yelled threats and anti-Kurdish slurs at the protesters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. However, the pro-Erdogan group and the protesters were separated by Metropolitan Police Department officers and United States Secret Service officers who stood between the two groups, facing the pro-Erdogan group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite the presence of the law enforcement officers, Plaintiffs allege that members of the pro-Erdogan group pushed past the officers and physically attacked the protesters. The attackers allegedly repeatedly hit, punched, and kicked the protesters, including Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A. Dereci each participated in the attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68. Plaintiffs specifically allege that during the first attack Defendant A. Dereci repeatedly punched Plaintiff Kheirabadi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant E. Yildirim threatened and physically beat Plaintiff Kheirabadi during this first attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the first attack ended relatively quickly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. Following the first attack, law enforcement allegedly created a cordon to keep the pro-Erdogan group on the sidewalk and away from the protesters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. Despite this cordon, Plaintiffs allege that the pro-Erdogan supporters continued to attempt to bypass the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. During this time, Plaintiffs also allege that the pro-Erdogan group continued to yell ethnic slurs and make threats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that the pro-Erdogan group played a Turkish nationalist song over a loud speaker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the first attack, one of the Defendants allegedly told a law enforcement officer, \"we are waiting [for] you to take them out, because President [Erdogan] is coming. If you don't take ... I will take.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. Plaintiffs further claim that the Turkish Ambassador to the United States told a law enforcement officer, \"I am the ambassador. You cannot let this ... you cannot touch us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75. And, Defendant E. Yildirim allegedly yelled at a law enforcement officer warning of potential violence if the protesters continued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. Defendant E. Yildirim also allegedly called the protesters \"dirty bastards\" and yelled \"shut the fuck up, bitch!\" to a protester.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs further claim that Defendant Narin called on the pro-Erdogan group to line up in the street, ignoring the commands of law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. Defendant Narin explained that he was ignoring law enforcement's orders because \"[m]y President is coming, I don't want them to be over there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At some point during or shortly after the first attack, Plaintiffs allege that President Erdogan arrived at the Residence. President Erdogan remained in his car in the driveway of the Residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Plaintiffs allege that President Erdogan's head of security, Mushin Kose, leaned into President Erdogan's car to confer with the President.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that President\n   Erdogan ordered a second attack on the protesters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. According to Plaintiffs, after speaking with President Erdogan, Mr. Kose communicated with other Turkish security officials both in person and through an electronic communication device. Those Turkish security officials then hurried toward the protesters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moments later, Plaintiffs allege that Turkish security officials and civilian Defendants broke through the law enforcement cordon in a \"coordinated\" fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the second attack was longer and more violent than the first.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Turkish security officials and civilian Defendants bypassed the law enforcement cordon and chased, kicked, punched, and grabbed protesters. Plaintiffs allege that the violence was unrelenting and that the attackers surrounded and kicked protesters who had fallen onto the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the attack, Plaintiffs claim that the attackers yelled anti-Kurdish slurs and threats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. Plaintiffs further claim that United States law enforcement officers attempted to stop the attack, but the attackers would not listen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that during the second attack Defendants E. Yildirim and Narin attacked Plaintiff Elif Genc by repeatedly kicking her and threatening her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 160. Plaintiffs further assert that Defendant E. Yildirim kicked Plaintiff Murat Yasa in his body and threatened Plaintiff Yasa by telling him that he would make life miserable for the Kurds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 188, 191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Eventually, law enforcement officers were able to stop the attack. Following the attack Plaintiffs claim that Defendants tore up and threw the protesters' signs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89. Plaintiffs contend that Defendant E. Yildirim stomped on one of the protester's flags.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the days after the attack, multiple members of the United States government condemned the attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 196-207. In June 2017, the United States Attorney's Office charged Defendant Narin with aggravated assault and assault and Defendant E. Yildirim with aggravated assault and assault with significant bodily injury, all committed based on the actual or perceived race or ethnicity of the victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208. Defendants E. Yildirim and Narin later pled guilty to assault with significant bodily injury, and Defendant E. Yildirim pled guilty to assaulting Plaintiff Yasa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212. In August 2017, a District of Columbia grand jury indicted 19 individuals for their role in the attacks. These individuals included fifteen Turkish security officials and four civilians.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 209. It is not clear from the Complaint whether or not Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A. Dereci were included among those civilians indicted. However, if they were ever indicted, the charges against them were later dropped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 11, 2018, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, bringing seven claims in total, but only five of which are against the civilian Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 16, 2018, Defendants E. Yildirim and Narin filed a joint partial motion to dismiss. And, on August 24, 2018, Defendant A. Dereci also filed a partial motion to dismiss. The majority of the arguments in Defendants' motions to dismiss are the same. Accordingly, the Court will address both motions in this Memorandum Opinion. The discussion in this Memorandum Opinion pertains to only Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A.

Accordingly, Defendants contend that they did not put Plaintiffs in apprehension of harmful or offensive contact. Defendants explain that Plaintiffs are unlawfully attempting to hold them liable for assault based on their mere presence at the crime scene. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that, during the first attack, \"members of the pro-Erdogan group pushed past the police and physically attacked the Protesters.

Plaintiffs further allege that \"all five individual Defendants in this action participated in the first attack.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. During the second attack, Plaintiffs explain that \"[m]ultiple Turkish security officials and civilian Defendants beat and attacked protesters, who were outnumbered by the attackers. ...

For example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant E. Yildirim yelled at an officer, warning him of violence if Plaintiffs continued their protest and that Defendant E. Yildirim physically attacked at least three Plaintiffs during the first and second attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 76, 160, 166, 171, 188, 191.

According to Plaintiffs' Complaint, the three Defendants attacked Plaintiffs at least twice, placing each Plaintiff in reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact. An assault does not require actual physical contact, so it is irrelevant that each Defendant did not actually touch each Plaintiff. What matters is that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that each Defendant took an intentional action which placed each Plaintiff in reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants point out that the majority of Plaintiffs' allegations on assault relate to all five civilian Defendants, referring to them as \"civilian Defendants,\" or to all Defendants generally. Despite this group\n   naming, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A. Dereci intentionally participated in the attacks.

In order to be liable for aiding and abetting, Plaintiffs must have alleged that (1) the party or parties Defendants aided committed battery, (2) Defendants were generally aware of their role in the tortious activity, and (3) Defendants knowingly and substantially assisted in the battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n    705 F.2d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to allege that Defendants provided any assistance or that such assistance was knowing and substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court disagrees and concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a claim for aiding and abetting battery. Plaintiffs allege that all Defendants participated in the first attack on Plaintiffs in which Defendants \"pushed past the police and physically attacked the Protesters. Turkish security officials and civilians repeatedly hit, punched, and kicked protesters.\" Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 67. Similarly, during the second attack, Plaintiffs allege that the three Defendants \"beat and attacked the protesters. ... The violence was unrelenting: the attackers surrounded and kicked the protesters ... who had fallen and were defenseless on the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81. The Court concludes that these allegations are sufficient to sustain a claim for aiding and abetting battery as they demonstrate that Defendants intentionally helped to create a dangerous and injurious atmosphere which assisted other Defendants in committing battery on Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit Court noted that students' group action could be sufficient to make even a minimally-involved participant liable because of the group's \"creation of a free-for-all[ ] was both dangerous and ultimately injurious.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n    705 F.2d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regardless of whether or not Defendants initiated the attack, they each played a role in breaking through the law enforcement line to attack Plaintiffs and in creating an environment in which all Plaintiffs were vulnerable to injury. Moreover, Plaintiffs have alleged that the second attack was \"coordinated,\" which at a minimum creates the inference that Defendants were knowingly and intentionally providing this assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the above analysis, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a claim for aiding and abetting battery against Defendant A. Dereci. But, the Court notes that the case is even stronger as to Defendants E. Yildirim and Narin. In addition to the allegations already explained, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant E. Yildirim further contributed to the \"free-for-all\" atmosphere by yelling at law enforcement, warning them of potential violence, as well as by yelling at Plaintiffs. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 76. Similarly, Defendant Narin yelled at law enforcement not to touch the Turkish security forces. Defendant Narin also allegedly called on the pro-Erdogan group to line up in the street, ignoring commands from law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Taking the allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint as true, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a claim of aiding and abetting battery against Defendants. As an initial matter, based on\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that aiding and abetting is a source of liability under District of Columbia law. The Court further concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants knowingly and intentionally provided substantial assistance to others in committing battery on Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants are liable for battery under a conspiracy theory. In order to prove a civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must show \"(1) an agreement between two or more persons (2) to participate in an unlawful act, and (3) an injury caused by an unlawful overt act performed by one of the parties to the agreement pursuant to, and in furtherance of, the common scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Blakeney v.

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants agreed with anyone to do anything. According to Defendants, there are no allegations of a prior relationship, communications, or contact other than merely being in the same place at the same time, which is insufficient to establish the existence of an agreement. The Court concurs with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The existence of an agreement between two or more people is the \"essential element of a conspiracy claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Graves v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360494\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/961/314/#p320\">\n    961 F.Supp. 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320 (D.D.C. 1997). To establish the existence of an agreement, the \"plaintiff must set forth more than just conclusory allegations of [the] agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Livingood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9177756\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/360/94/#p104\">\n    360 F.Supp.2d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (D.D.C. 2004). While Plaintiffs generally allege the existence of\n   an agreement, they provide no facts to support its existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As support for the existence of an agreement, Plaintiffs point to the facts that the Defendants broke through the police cordon in a \"coordinated\" fashion, that Defendants stood together shouting similar slurs, that Defendant Narin called on the pro-Erdogan group to line up in the street, and that Defendants had the same goal in attacking the protesters. The Court concludes that these factual allegations fail to establish the existence of an agreement. Instead, Plaintiffs merely pled \"parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While Courts can infer a conspiracy from indirect evidence, Plaintiffs have not pled facts that would reasonably allow the Court to make such an inference. Plaintiffs' claims that the Defendants broke through the police cordon in a \"coordinated fashion\" and that Defendants had a common goal are conclusory allegations, insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. The closest that Plaintiffs come to providing any factual allegation that would allow the Court to infer the existence of an agreement, implicit or explicit, is that Defendant Narin asked other Defendants to join him in the street, violating the orders of law enforcement. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 77. But, Plaintiffs present no evidence that any of the other Defendants actually joined Defendant Narin in the street. Accordingly, this allegation fails to establish any sort of agreement among Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, based on the facts alleged, it is not clear to the Court when Defendants would have had the opportunity to form an agreement. Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants knew each other before the event. Plaintiffs also do not allege that Defendants in any way communicated with each other prior to or during the event in question, possibly providing the opportunity to form an agreement. Without any allegations of communication, explicit or implicit, among the Defendants, Plaintiffs' allegations of parallel conduct are not \"placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on Plaintiffs' Complaint, the Court does not foreclose the possibility that a conspiracy to attack the protesters was formed; however, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the three Defendants at issue in this Memorandum Opinion were part of that conspiracy. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that President Erdogan ordered the second attack. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 80. Following President Erdogan's order, Plaintiffs allege that Turkish security officials conferred amongst themselves and soon thereafter attacked the protesters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the civilian Defendants were involved in these conversations or agreed to any \"plan\" prior to the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Taking the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint to be true, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not pled a conspiracy to commit battery. Plaintiffs fail to allege facts which allow the Court to infer the existence of an agreement to commit battery on Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants' motions and DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiffs' battery claims insofar as they rely on conspiracy allegations. But, for the reasons explained above, the Court also DENIES IN PART Defendants' motions and concludes that Plaintiffs may proceed with their battery claims on an aiding and abetting theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count 4- Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Count 4 of the Complaint, twelve Plaintiffs bring intentional infliction of\n   emotional distress claims against each Defendant. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 245-50. Defendants argue that these claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Defendants have two grounds for dismissal. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because they fail to meet the high standards for extreme and outrageous conduct. Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants took intentional actions directed at inflicting emotional distress on each individual Plaintiff. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In order to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege \"(1) extreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant which (2) intentionally or recklessly (3) causes the plaintiff [to suffer] severe emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortberg v.

The Court disagrees.

Plaintiffs allege that each of the three Defendants \"pushed past the police and physically attacked the Protesters\" during the first attack. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs present no facts supporting that an agreement was made between civilian Defendants, and Plaintiffs present no facts which would allow the Court to infer that civilian Defendants had the opportunity to form an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livingood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9177756\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/360/94/#p104\">\n    360 F.Supp.2d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing conspiracy claim where the plaintiff \"put[ ] forth no facts suggesting that the defendants were acting in concert in furtherance of a shared goal of discriminating against him\"). In the absence of such facts supporting the existence of an agreement, Plaintiffs' Complaint \"boils down to a conclusory and purely speculative assertion that Defendants entered into a conspiracy,\" which is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McManus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5542979\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/530/46/#p74\">\n    530 F.Supp.2d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs also generally argue that \"Defendants had the common goal of beating protesters to end the protest and curtail Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, which they ultimately did.\" Pls.'

This conclusory argument is speculative and provides no additional support for the existence of an agreement. A common goal, never discussed explicitly or implicitly among the Defendants, does not constitute an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that an agreement is not sufficiently alleged by \"parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action\"). Moreover, Plaintiffs provide no support for the conclusory allegation that the aim of the conspiracy was to curtail Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, as opposed to the aim being simply to attack Plaintiffs out of prejudice, anger, or retribution. It is not sufficient that the alleged conspiracy had the effect of curtailing Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. Instead, the conspiracy must have been consciously aimed at impairing those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/\">\n    506 U.S. at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A conspiracy is not 'for the purpose' of denying equal protection simply because it has an effect upon a protected right.\").

State action is required for claims under the deprivation clause, and Plaintiffs do not allege any state action. Even if the Court assumes for purposes of this Memorandum Opinion that state action is not required for claims under the prevention clause, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege the existence of a conspiracy between civilian Defendants to curtail Plaintiffs' First Amendment free speech rights. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motions as to these claims and DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the claims as to Defendants E. Yildirim, Narin, and A.

However, the Court gives Plaintiffs leave to file an Amended Complaint setting out facts supporting Plaintiff Kheirabadi's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress if they are so able. The Court otherwise DENIES Defendants' motions, concluding that Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated claims for which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    \u2022 Defs.
