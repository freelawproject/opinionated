No. 91\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   NATHANAEL M. COUSINS, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Plaintiffs are young immigrants seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile (\"SIJ\") status. They allege that defendants-the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), and individual officers in charge of those departments-adopted an unlawful policy that prevents them from obtaining that status. The Court previously granted Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and motion for class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 49, 112. Defendants now move to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing that they complied with the Administrative Procedure Act, did not violate due process, and the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 24, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Defendants from denying SIJ status on the grounds that California Probate Courts do not have jurisdiction to issue SIJ guardianship orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

According to Defendants, SIJ petitioners must establish that the juvenile court issuing a guardianship order have the authority make the required determination that family reunification is no longer viable. To have that authority, Defendants reason, the juvenile court must have jurisdiction to determine whether a parent could regain custody and to order reunification if warranted. This is so because the state court guardianship order will permanently deprive the parent of their custodial rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Defendants' interpretation is not reasonable. As a threshold matter, the Court notes that the SIJ regulations are outdated and parts of it are no longer good law. As explained in the Court's prior orders, Congress amended the SIJ statute in 2008 with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pub. L.

California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 155(a) states: \"[a] superior court has jurisdiction under California law to make judicial determinations regarding the\n    <em>\n     custody\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     care\n    </em>\n    of children within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act ... which includes, but is not limited to, the juvenile, probate, and family court divisions of the superior court.\" California law further authorizes its probate courts to find that the SIJ petition was \"[l]egally committed to, or placed under the custody of, a state agency or department, or an individual or entity appointed by the court.\" Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 155(b)(1). And California Probate Code \u00a7 1510.1 authorizes California Probate Courts to \"appoint a guardian of the person for an unmarried individual who is 18 years of age or older, but who has not yet attained 21 years of age\" if the petitioner consents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Defendants maintain that these statutory grants of jurisdiction are not enough because California law only permits its courts to make factual findings regarding reunification.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 115 at 14. It is not clear, however, why the reunification finding must be a legal conclusion. As the California Supreme Court recently explained, a reunification finding is inherently factual because it does not \"grant ... parental rights or to order [the parent] to fulfill parental responsibilities.\"\n    <em>\n     Bianka M. v.
