NYU advanced five claims for declaratory relief, seeking to define certain relevant provisions of the Policy, and an additional claim for breach of contract based on FM's allegedly wrongful denial of coverage. In response to NYU's complaint, FM filed two counterclaims, seeking a declaratory judgment or, alternatively, reformation of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are FM's motion for summary judgment and NYU's cross-motion for partial summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, FM's motion is granted in all material respects, while NYU's motion is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts and procedural course of this case are set out in great detail in the Court's March 27, 2018 Memorandum and Order denying NYU's motion for leave to amend its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York Univ. v.

The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Policy, which is the focus of this dispute, was effective from July 1, 2011 through July 1, 2013. It generally insured NYU against physical loss or damage to certain real and personal property, subject to an overall coverage limit of $ 1.85 billion and other specified limits of liability and exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beyond covering physical loss or damage itself, the Policy provided coverage for associated time element losses. Such losses, \"[s]ometimes known as business interruption loss[es],\" are \"loss[es] resulting from the [insured's] inability to put damaged property to its normal use.\" ECF No. 113 at 5 n.17 (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 129 at 2, 6. Specifically, the Policy's \"Time Element Coverages\" granted NYU \"the option to make [a] claim\" for either lost gross earnings or lost gross profits \"directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured\" under the Policy. ECF No. 116, Ex. 7 at NYU033551-033552. The Policy also contained certain \"Time Element Coverage Extensions,\" which granted coverage for time element losses resulting from, inter alia, \"the interruption of incoming\n   [or outgoing]\" utility services, \"an order of [a] civil or military authority prohibit[ing] access to [an] insured location provided such order is the direct result of physical damage of the type insured,\" or \"the failure of the Insured's electronic data processing equipment or media to operate, provided that such failure is the direct result of a malicious act directed at the [insured].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033562\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Under the express terms of the Policy, however, recovery for \"TIME ELEMENT loss as provided in the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES and TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSIONS ... is subject to the applicable limit of liability that applies to the insured physical loss or damage but in no event [can it be] for more than any limit of liability that is stated as applying to the specific TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE and/or TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSION.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to its general coverage of physical loss or damage and (to the extent applicable) associated time element losses, the Policy provided certain \"Additional Coverages,\" including coverage for (1) \"accidental interruption of services,\" defined to be \"physical damage resulting from changes in temperature or relative humidity ... when such changes in temperature or relative humidity result from the interruption of services consisting of electricity, gas, fuel, steam, water or refrigeration by reason of any accidental event, other than insured physical loss or damage\"; (2) \"debris removal\"; (3) \"demolition and increased cost of construction,\" defined to be \"the reasonable and necessary costs incurred ... to satisfy the minimum requirements of the enforcement of any law or ordinance regulating the demolition, construction, repair, replacement or use of buildings, structures, machinery or equipment at an insured location\"; (4) \"patient and tenant relocation expense\"; (5) \"protection and preservation of property,\" defined to be \"reasonable and necessary costs incurred for actions to temporarily protect or preserve insured property\"; and (6) \"service interruption property damage,\" defined as \"physical loss or damage to insured property at an insured location or as MISCELLANEOUS PERSONAL PROPERTY when such physical loss or damage results from the interruption of incoming services consisting of electricity, gas, fuel, steam, water, refrigeration or from the lack of outgoing sewerage service or from the lack of transmission of incoming or outgoing voice, data or video service.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033528\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Much like the section of the Policy addressing coverage for time element losses, the section addressing these additional coverages stated that such coverages \"are subject to the applicable limit of liability\" and \"applicable exclusions and deductibles, ... as shown in [the additional coverages section] and elsewhere in th[e] Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033528.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A separate section at the very beginning of the Policy -- under the heading \"LIMITS OF LIABILITY\" -- set forth the Policy's overall coverage limit of $ 1.85 billion and, under the sub-heading \"Applicable Limits of Liability/Time Limits,\" a list of 52 subsidiary limits that were \"part of, and not in addition to,\" the overall coverage limit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033511\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   For example, the Policy provided a limit of liability of \"USD5,000,000 in the aggregate during any policy year\" for loss attributable to \"TERRORISM.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033514.

Physical loss or damage from flood associated with a storm or weather disturbance whether or not identified by name by any meteorological authority, is considered to be flood within the terms of this Policy.

Superstorm Sandy And Its Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy struck New York City, causing significant damage to several NYU properties that both parties agree were covered under the Policy. The parties dispute the extent of that coverage, as well as whether (and the extent to which) \"faulty workmanship\" contributed to NYU's losses. ECF No. 113 at 33. But the parties agree that NYU sustained substantial time element losses as a result of the damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The dispute that gave rise to the instant litigation primarily concerns the scope and proper application of the clause in the Policy that provides for a $ 250 million limit of liability for damage caused by flood (\"the flood limit\") and a subsidiary limit of $ 40 million in coverage for flood damage at certain specified locations (\"the flood sublimit\"). In particular, the parties disagree as to how that clause impacts the amount of coverage that is provided in the Policy for the losses that NYU sustained at (and in relation to) the complex of buildings -- all associated with NYU's hospital or medical school -- located between First Avenue, 34th Street, FDR Drive, and 30th Street in Manhattan (\"the superblock\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Citing the flood sublimit, FM capped its payments to NYU for all superblock damages at $ 40 million. NYU, advancing a different interpretation of the flood sublimit and its interaction with other provisions in the Policy, claimed entitlement to substantially more money -- potentially extending to the overall coverage limit of $ 1.85 billion. With the parties unable to reach an agreement, NYU initiated this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 29, 2015, NYU filed the operative initial complaint, asserting six causes of action against FM. Five seek declaratory relief, including declarations that (1) the flood sublimit applies only to those buildings within the address range specified in the sublimit (\"550-580 First Avenue, 401 &amp; 435 E 30th Street, 317 &amp; 400 E. 34th Street and 3010 [FDR] Drive, New York, NY\"), rather than to all of the buildings located on the superblock; (2) the flood limit does not apply to time element losses; (3) the flood sublimit does not apply to time element losses; (4) the flood sublimit does not apply to additional coverages and time element coverage extensions; and (5) the coverage limits for flood damage do not apply to damage that would not have occurred but for faulty workmanship. NYU's sixth cause of action -- for breach of contract -- alleges that FM wrongfully denied NYU coverage, based on its construction of the aforementioned provisions of the Policy. FM, for its part, asserted two counterclaims, seeking (1) a declaration that the flood sublimit applies to all of the buildings located on the superblock, and (2) alternatively, reformation of the flood sublimit to the extent that it can be read as applying only to those buildings encompassed in the address range specified therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After more than a year of discovery, NYU moved for leave to amend its complaint, which motion was denied by the Court in a March 27, 2018 Memorandum and Order on the ground that all \"of the claims that NYU [sought] to add [were] untimely and ... merit[less],\" rendering amendment \"futile.\"\n   <em>\n    New York Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201737745\">\n    2018 WL 1737745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18. Following that Memorandum and Order, the parties each filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   FM's motion seeks summary judgment on all six of NYU's claims as well as on both of its counterclaims. NYU's cross-motion seeks summary judgment on both of FM's counterclaims as well as on all five of its claims for declaratory relief; as to its claim for breach of contract, NYU merely opposes FM's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Hewlett-Packard policy's provision that \"[t]he maximum limits of liability indicated above apply blanket,\" which\n   <em>\n    precedes\n   </em>\n   the specific sublimits of liability upon which the Hewlett-Packard court relied, is also not a comparable provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.10 (emphases in original) (citations omitted).

That policy provided: \"When a limit of liability is shown ... the Insurer's maximum limit of liability will not exceed such limit during any policy year regardless of the number of locations, coverages or occurrences involved.\" ECF No. 127, Ex. 73 at 14.

Any doubt -- including any doubt as to whether the flood limits apply to time element coverage extensions -- is unequivocally resolved in FM's favor by language in the time element section of the Policy plainly stating that recovery for \"TIME ELEMENT loss as provided in the TIME ELEMENT COVERAGES and TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE EXTENSIONS ... is subject to the applicable limit of liability that applies to the insured physical loss or damage.\" ECF No. 116, Ex. 7 at NYU033551. Here, the \"Applicable Limit[ ] of Liability[ ]\" (as indicated by the sub-heading in the limits of liability section) that applies to the insured physical loss or damage is the flood limit, as qualified by its sublimit; time element claims arising from flood damage are thus expressly subject to those limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In view of the Policy's unambiguous language on this point, FM is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Thus, in the event that NYU incurred costs \"to remove debris from an insured location\" (one of the Policy's additional coverages) as a direct result of a flood, the Policy would cover those costs up to the overall coverage limit of $ 1.85 billion, notwithstanding the Policy's $ 250 million limit of liability for damage from flood, because that limit does not specify that it applies to debris removal. ECF No. 116, Ex. 7 at NYU033535. For support, NYU submits that in view of the provision's use of the plural word \"limits,\" it cannot be that one limit of liability applies to all of the coverages involved in an occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The pluralization of the word \"limits\" cannot bear the weight that NYU attempts to place on it. NYU ignores the obvious reason that \"limits\" is pluralized: it precedes a list of 52 limits of liability. It is far more natural to read \"limits\" this way than to read it as effectively transforming the phrase \"all coverages involved\" into the phrase \"all coverages explicitly specified in each respective limit.\" \"Where the provisions of the policy 'are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and courts should refrain from rewriting the agreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Horowitz v.

The Address Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Judging from the parties' briefs and oral argument presentations, the central dispute in this case concerns the proper construction of the address portion of the flood sublimit. That provision set forth \"a USD40,000,000 limit in the aggregate during any policy year for property located at the NYU Hospital Center and School of Medicine located at 550-580 First Avenue, 401 &amp; 435 E 30th Street, 317 &amp; 400 E. 34th Street and 3010 [FDR] Drive, New York, NY[.]\" ECF No. 116, Ex. 7 at NYU033513. While FM contends that the sublimit applies to all ten of the physically-interconnected buildings located on the superblock bounded by First Avenue to the West, 34th Street to the North, FDR Drive to the East, and 30th Street to the South -- all of which are associated with NYU's hospital or medical school -- NYU insists that it applies only to buildings bearing the specified addresses. The parties thus disagree as to whether the sublimit applies to Skirball Institute, Smilow, and HCC -- the three buildings on the superblock with First Avenue addresses that fall either partially or wholly outside the 550-580 range stated in the provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   FM argues that the address portion of the flood sublimit should be read as \"a\n   reference point telling the reader where to find\" the single complex of interconnected buildings that the provision calls the \"NYU Hospital Center and School of Medicine,\" ECF No. 113 at 19, as buildings associated with NYU's hospital and medical school \"can be found throughout Manhattan and beyond,\" ECF No. 129 at 11, and if the parties had really intended to single out three buildings from the superblock complex for an additional $ 210 million in flood coverage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   they would have \"state[d] that [the limit] only applies to '\n   <em>\n    those\n   </em>\n   NYU Hospital Center and School of Medicine\n   <em>\n    buildings\n   </em>\n   located at [the specified addresses],' \" ECF No. 113 at 19 (emphases in original).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Tech.

Viewing the provision in the context of other provisions in the Policy, its ambiguity becomes apparent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Of particular relevance is the schedule of locations appended to the Policy (and incorporated therein), which listed insured locations alongside their addresses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the entries for Smilow and HCC disclose nothing of note, reporting their addresses as 522 First Avenue and 530 First Avenue, respectively, the two separate entries for Skirball Institute -- one in the section listing \"NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PROPERTIES\" and one in the section listing \"NYU HOSPITALS CENTER PROPERTIES\" -- sow considerable confusion. ECF No. 116, Ex. 7 at NYU033595, NYU033598. Specifically, the former entry listed the insured location \"SKIRBALL INSTITUTE 564 FIRST AVENUE\" as having four separate addresses: \"540, 562, 564, [and] 584 First Avenue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692125\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/180/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033595. The latter entry listed the insured location \"SKIRBALL INSTITUTE\" as having three separate addresses: \"540, 562, [and] 584 First Avenue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692125\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/180/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033598. Adding to the confusion is a third entry, in the \"NYU HOSPITALS CENTER PROPERTIES\" section, that listed the insured location \"Resident/Staff\" as having the address \"564 FIRST AVENUE.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692125\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/17/180/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at NYU033599.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The schedule of locations thereby exposes a glaring ambiguity in the address portion of the flood sublimit: one must necessarily refer to the schedule to determine which buildings correspond to the addresses listed in the sublimit, yet it is impossible to determine on that basis whether or not Skirball Institute falls within the list. That is because Skirball Institute's multiple addresses simultaneously place it both in and out of the 550-580 First Avenue range stated in the sublimit. This lends credence to FM's (otherwise questionable)\n   <em>\n    referential\n   </em>\n   reading of the address list while casting doubt on NYU's (otherwise sensible)\n   <em>\n    literal\n   </em>\n   reading of the same. But at bottom, it demonstrates that the operative provision, \"read [in the context of the contract] as a whole, fails to disclose its purpose and the parties' intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Universal Am. Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320437\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/675/#p680\">\n    25 N.Y.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320437\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/675/#p680\">\n    16 N.Y.S.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320437\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/675/#p680\">\n    37 N.E.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). Though one can certainly conceive of explanations that would square the apparent incongruity with either party's reading of the provision, no such explanation can be found within the four corners of the contract. The provision is therefore ambiguous, and resort must be made to the parties' extrinsic evidence to shed light on its meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   FM begins by setting forth unrebutted evidence that -- in several contexts -- NYU internally understood the buildings on the superblock to comprise a single complex (variously referred to as \"Langone Medical Center,\" \"the medical center,\" or \"the Main Campus\") and that the address \"550-580 First Avenue\" was commonly used to refer to it in its entirety, even though several buildings in the complex either had First Avenue addresses outside that range or lacked First Avenue addresses altogether. For example, FM notes that NYU's Associate Director of Insurance Deborah DiGiacomo admitted that she had \"seen the address 550-580 First Avenue used to describe the entire medical center\" by \"people\" at NYU. ECF No. 122 at 60 (internal quotation marks omitted). DiGiacomo's predecessor, Paulette Prawl, likewise testified that she had \"seen or heard people within NYU use 550-580 First Avenue to describe the Medical Center.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320437\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/675/#p680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). FM next demonstrates that -- at least in some respects -- this internal understanding was unquestionably imported\n   into NYU's dealings with FM. FM cites several insurance-related documents exchanged by the parties in which the \"Medical Center\" is described as located at 550-580 First Avenue. Among them are \"[a]t least five separate risk reports prepared by FM Engineering and sent to NYU between 2006 and 2012,\" which \"included a cover page listing '550-580 1st Ave' as the address for the Medical Center,\" and which \"addressed each of the Medical Center buildings, including HCC, Skirball, and Smilow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. Finally, FM seeks to prove that this convention was incorporated directly into the flood sublimits contained in the series of policies -- including the Policy -- that the parties executed in the years preceding Sandy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoyt v. Andreucci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881125\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/320/#p332\">\n    433 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasizing the relevance of extrinsic evidence of the parties' course of dealing to the construction of an ambiguous contractual provision). The evidence establishes the following sequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The 2006 version of the parties' policy for the first time introduced a flood sublimit, which provided \"USD10,000,000 for New York University Medical Center Properties, Index 21374.00.\" ECF No. 122 at 47 (internal quotation marks omitted). By the 2008 policy, the flood sublimit contained additional coverage and slightly different wording; it provided that \"[a] USD25,000,000 limit applies at the following Location: [ ] New York Medical Center properties, Index 21374.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (internal quotation marks omitted). The next year, in 2009, the flood sublimit for the first time included an address description, providing that \"[a] USD25,000,000 limit applies at the following Location: [ ] NYU Hospitals Center and School of Medicine located at 550-580 First Ave., 401 &amp; 435 E 30th Street, 317 &amp; 400 E 34th Street, and 3010 FD Roosevelt Dr., New York, NY Index No. 21374.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). And by endorsement effective July 1, 2010, the flood sublimit was again amended slightly to provide \"a USD40,000,000 limit in the Aggregate During Any Policy Year for property located at NYU Hospitals Center and School of Medicine located at 550-580 First Ave., 401 &amp; 435 E 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, 317 &amp; 400 E 34th Street, and 3010 [FDR] Drive, New York, NY Index No. 21374.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 116, Ex. 83. NYU has admitted -- in response to a request for admission -- that each of the aforementioned sublimits applied to all of the buildings on the superblock, including Skirball Institute, Smilow, and HCC.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 122 at 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Policy, which went into effect in 2011, introduced the operative sublimit. The only difference between that sublimit and the 2010 version it replaced -- which undisputedly applied to the entire superblock -- is the omission of the index number 21374.00, which had appeared in each iteration of the sublimit since its inception in 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meanwhile, that index number continued to designate all of the buildings on the superblock in the Policy's schedule of locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   FM argues that the removal of the index number from the sublimit did not suddenly transform the address range, which the parties had apparently understood to reference the entire superblock in the 2010 policy, into a literal, exhaustive description of the buildings covered. NYU counters that no transformation was necessary; it disputes that the \"address [range] in [the] prior policies applied to all [superblock] locations\" and contends instead that \"it was the ... index number ... that\" extended the sublimit in that way, as \"all\n   [superblock] locations\" were designated by that index number in each policy's schedule of locations. ECF No. 129 at 17-18. NYU's reading of the earlier sublimits, however, eschews basic principles of contract interpretation, as it would render the address range and index number -- which stood side-by-side in each sublimit -- irreconcilably contradictory. Thus, in view of the parties' well-established course of dealing, NYU's preferred construction of the operative sublimit may carry the day over FM's only if NYU can point to evidence showing that the removal of the index number reflected an intent on the part of the parties to -- for first time -- except three superblock buildings from the sublimit and thereby provide them with an additional $ 210 million in flood coverage. NYU cannot make such a showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   NYU's proffered explanation for the removal of the index number would strain the credulity of any reasonable trier of fact: relying on evidence that Marsh (NYU's broker) requested an increase to the $ 40 million sublimit prior to the execution of the Policy in June 2011, NYU reasons that FM's subsequent removal of the index number, which left only the address range to control, was intended as a \"partial[ ] accommodat[ion]\" of that request, as it kept in place the $ 40 million limit for most superblock buildings \"while at the same time ... increase[ing] the limit for HCC, Smilow and Skirball Institute\" to $ 250 million. ECF No. 129 at 17, 19 n.20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. This inferential leap, which smacks of post-hoc rationalization approaching desperation, finds no support in the record\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and suffers from several cumulatively-fatal flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, NYU's request for additional coverage was directed at the entire superblock\n   complex; NYU never sought to carve out particular buildings from the sublimit, let alone the three buildings it claims were carved out. Second, the additional coverage that NYU actually requested -- an extra $ 10 million for the entire superblock complex -- is staggeringly modest compared to the $ 210 million that NYU claims FM granted it for the three disputed buildings, without so much as a discussion between the parties about a concomitant increase to NYU's premium. Third, the supposed selection of Skirball Institute, Smilow, and HCC for additional coverage would appear entirely arbitrary; the buildings are neither directly adjacent to one another nor categorically subject to a lesser risk of flood than the other buildings on the superblock. Fourth, carving out three of the interconnected superblock buildings from the sublimit -- including only part of the single structure depicted or described in various documents as Skirball Institute -- would have violated FM's internal guidelines, which instruct underwriters not to \"apply separate flood limits to buildings within one location (index number) as flood analysis is not that precise and interdependencies may exist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally -- and perhaps most damning to NYU -- there is not a shred of evidence (documentary or otherwise), that FM ever so much as mentioned (internally or otherwise) substantially increasing NYU's flood coverage (in the manner suggested by NYU or otherwise). Indeed, there is no evidence that NYU even acknowledged the dramatic increase in coverage it claims to have received or that its broker, Marsh, ever sought to claim credit for what would have been a job very well done. NYU thus asks that a jury be permitted to conclude that FM provided a coverage increase in the hundreds of millions of dollars\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   , without NYU or its broker deeming it worthy of their comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   No reasonable jury could do so, particularly in view of the affirmative evidence of the parties' contrary understanding: in the exhaustive summary of the Policy prepared for NYU in 2011, the very broker who had negotiated with FM for an increase to the sublimit reported that the flood coverage had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in fact been changed from the prior year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ribacoff v.

For example, NYU asserts that the company \"removed a ramp leading to a loading dock ... and in doing so uncovered and widened the opening to the ventilation shaft for a generator located in [the] basement [of an NYU building],\" which contributed to \"approximately eleven million gallons of water enter[ing] [the building]\" during the storm.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18.

NYU asserts that Skirball Institute's true address is \"540 First Avenue,\" ECF No. 129 at 5 n.4 ; that \"562 and 584 First Avenue [are] not correct addresses for [it],\" ECF No. 122 at 60 (internal quotation marks omitted); and that \"564 First Avenue [is actually] a separate location from Skirball Institute,\" ECF No. 129 at 12 n.11. However, overwhelming documentary evidence tells a different story. For example, a map of the superblock created by NYU's Real Estate Development &amp; Facilities group depicts Skirball Institute as a single structure and designates its addresses as \"540, 562, 564 and 584 First Ave.\" ECF No. 116, Ex. 13 at NYU081808 (footnote omitted). Another map, also created by NYU, likewise depicts a single structure labeled \"Skirball/MUB\" and designates its addresses as \"540\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    564 1st Ave.\" ECF No. 127, Ex. 56 at NYU111088 (emphasis in original). Additionally, the certificate of occupancy for the property, issued by the City of New York, lists its address as \"540 FIRST AVENUE AKA 564 FIRST AVENUE,\" ECF. No. 137, Ex. 129 at NYU161851, and a separate document concerning NYU's insurance coverage describes a single \"Insured Location\" as \"540-562 1ST AVE,\" ECF No. 137, Ex. 155 at NYU122726. There is therefore no basis for accepting NYU's claim that \"the proper address for Skirball Institute [is] '540' First Avenue,\" that it is distinct from any property addressed 562, 564, or 584 First Avenue, and that it is therefore unequivocally outside the 550-580 First Avenue range stated in the sublimit. ECF No. 122 at 62.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The Court notes that the 2011 and 2010 sublimits have certain additional differences -- principally, differences in capitalization, punctuation, abbreviation, and pluralization -- that are mentioned by neither party and that are immaterial as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The two pieces of evidence on which NYU relies do not actually support its position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    First, NYU points to evidence that in 2012, it procured excess flood insurance (from a different insurer) for fewer than all of the buildings in the superblock complex. As NYU frames it, this excess insurance covered \"only those First Avenue buildings with addresses in the 550 to 580 range.\" ECF No. 122 at 136. NYU thus seeks the inference that it understood the First Avenue buildings\n    <em>\n     outside\n    </em>\n    the 550-580 range to have already received $ 210 million in additional coverage by dint of the index number's removal from the 2011 sublimit. But as FM points out, while Smilow and HCC were concededly not covered by the excess insurance that NYU procured, Skirball Institute\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    so covered -- despite having two First Avenue addresses (540 and 584) outside the 550-580 range. No reasonable trier of fact could credit NYU's entirely speculative explanation for this defect in its reasoning -- that in procuring excess insurance from a different insurer, NYU's sophisticated broker, whose client insists in this litigation that Skirball Institute has a clearly delineated address outside the 550-580 range, \"simply relied on the incorrect addresses supplied for Skirball[ ] by FM.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594899\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/574/#p580\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The other piece of evidence that NYU deems supportive is the deposition testimony of Marsh employee Ian Anderson, who stated that after he \"noted\" the removal of the index number in a conversation with an FM employee, the FM employee responded \"angr[ily]\" and \"just shouted it is what is is, okay.\" ECF No. 122 at 124. Insofar as NYU argues that this testimony gives rise to the inference that Marsh believed that the removal of the index number had increased the flood coverage for Smilow, HCC and Skirball Institute, that inference is squarely negated by Marsh's unambiguous summary of the Policy, discussed\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n    Insofar as NYU argues that this testimony gives rise to the inference that the FM employee responded angrily because he \"did not want to have to explain that Smilow, HCC and Skirball Institute were removed from the [flood] [ ]sublimit because they were not high flood risk locations and should never have been included in the first place,\" that inference is unreasonably speculative as a matter of law. ECF No. 129 at 19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Issues of credibility thus have no bearing on the sufficiency\n    <em>\n     vel non\n    </em>\n    of NYU's evidence. Even accepting NYU's recitation of the facts and the veracity of the cited witness testimony, the implausibility of the\n    <em>\n     inferences\n    </em>\n    on which NYU relies dooms its case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    As a technical matter, so much of FM's motion that seeks summary judgment on its counterclaim for reformation is denied as moot in light of the Court's grant of summary judgment for FM on its counterclaim for declaratory relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
