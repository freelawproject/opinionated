Bade, United States District Judge\n   Defendant Kingman Hospital, Inc., d/b/a Kingman Regional Medical Center (\"KRMC\") moves for summary judgment on the following claims in the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"): (1) discriminatory termination in violation of Title VII-Religion (Count Two); (2) discriminatory termination in violation of the ADEA (Count Three); and (3) retaliation in violation of Title VII and the ADEA (Count Five).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion is fully briefed. (Docs. 67, 74.) For the reasons below, the Court grants the motion, in part, and denies it, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   KRMC is a non-profit regional trauma center based in Kingman, Arizona. (DSOF \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is an ear, nose and throat physician and surgeon (\"ENT\"). (PSSOF \u00b6 1.) On November 1, 2008, Plaintiff entered into a three-year employment contract with KRMC (the \"first agreement\"). (DSOF \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff's base salary was $ 434,693 and was later increased to $ 550,000, with a bonus based on revenue generated from physician-related services. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Ramirez Decl., Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During September 2012, Plaintiff and KRMC began discussing a new employment contract. (PSSOF \u00b6 48.) On July 31, 2013, Plaintiff entered into a new three-year contract (\"Agreement\") with KRMC. (DSOF \u00b6 3; PSSOF \u00b6 50.) Plaintiff's base salary remained $ 550,000. (DSOF \u00b6 3, PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 57-60.) Schedule A of the Agreement provided for a potential bonus based on Plaintiff's work relative value units (\"RVUs\"). (DSOF \u00b6 3; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.) Schedule A of the Agreement also provided that if Plaintiff's total RVUs in any given fiscal year were less than the 7,500 RVUs required to cover Plaintiff's base salary, his base salary would \"be reduced by an amount proportionate to the deficit in work RVUs required to cover\" his base salary and the RVUs produced. (DSOF \u00b6 3, DSOF, Ex. 21; PCSOF \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that when he signed the Agreement he thought that his bonus remained a \"collections bonus\" that was based on revenues from all physician-related services, as it had been in Schedule A of the first agreement. (PSSOF \u00b6 60.) Plaintiff alleges that at the time he signed the Agreement, Tim Blanchard, KRMC's CFO, did not tell him that the first agreement's \"Schedule A\" collections bonus had been replaced by a new \"Schedule A\" that was attached only to the signed original Agreement that Blanchard kept for his file. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.) Plaintiff alleges that he would not have signed the Agreement if he had been told about the new Schedule A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67-69.) Plaintiff asserts that Schedule A was not attached to the signed original of the Agreement that he was provided. (PSSOF \u00b6 62.) Plaintiff asserts that he did not notice that Schedule A was missing from his copy of the Agreement because Blanchard had not mentioned the change to the bonus structure during their negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-75). During his\n   deposition, Blanchard stated that he does \"not recall\" telling Plaintiff about the new Schedule A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64; Blanchard Depo. at 25.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that KRMC is a \"Mormon-run\" hospital that is controlled by CEO Brian Turney, a Mormon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 170-94.) Plaintiff alleges that his immediate supervisor, Stacy McDaniel (now Stacy Merritt), also had \"deep ties to the Kingman area Mormon Church and community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 172-74.) Plaintiff alleges that Turney and Merritt cultivated a \"Mormon Mafia\" culture and power structure that favored Mormons over non-Mormons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 175-84.) Plaintiff asserts that he is Christian and that he regularly complained to Merritt about the Mormon culture and power structure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 183-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant states that in January 2014, Blanchard and Merritt, who was then Director of Surgical Specialties, decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment based on Plaintiff's poor job performance and bad attitude. (DSOF \u00b6 4.) Blanchard and Merritt informed Turney of their decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, and Turney supported that decision. (DSOF \u00b6 5; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 99-109.) On January 31, 2014, KRMC terminated Plaintiff's employment pursuant to the \"without cause\" clause of the Agreement. (DSOF \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff was the only physician terminated for \"performance reasons\" between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. (PSSOF \u00b6 117; Turney Depo. at 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he was \"blindsided\" by his termination because he had not been warned, disciplined, or informed that any serious issues related to performance or other issues might put his job at risk. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 17, 90, 108; Turney Depo. at 102, 105, 114, 162-63; Blanchard Depo. at 33-35, 42, 64-65; Merritt Depo. at 31-22;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Merritt Depo. at 37.) Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has a policy of documenting disciplinary or important meetings with physicians. (PSSOF \u00b6 18; Turney Depo. at 104-05; Blanchard Depo. at 34;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Merritt Depo. at 32-33.) Turney testified the he deferred to KRMC's human resources officer on the issue of KRMC's policy, but that his \"recollection of the policy\" was that anything \"disciplinary in nature\" \"should be documented and kept on file.\" (Turney Depo. at 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Turney stated that he had discussions with Plaintiff about his productivity, but he was not aware of any written warning that had been issued to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105.) Blanchard testified that KRMC had a policy of documenting conversations with doctors about \"employment problems.\" (Blanchard Depo. at 34.) Blanchard testified that he talked to Plaintiff about his RVUs and told Plaintiff that his productivity needed to increase to match his compensation, but Blanchard stated that he did not tell Plaintiff that there would be any \"consequences\" or that Plaintiff \"was subject to termination if he did not improve his RVUs.\" (Blanchard Depo. at 36, 63-65.) Blanchard stated that he did not document his meetings with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 63-64.) Blanchard stated that, other than Plaintiff's productivity, he did not discuss any issues with Plaintiff before his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.) Merritt testified that she was unaware of a KRMC policy that required documentation of meetings with physicians regarding performance or disciplinary matters. (Merritt Depo. at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, who was 60 years old in October 2013, alleges that KRMC hired Dr. Bernadette Braze, a much younger physician, to replace him. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 77-85.) Dr. Braze was between 42 and 45 years old when she was hired. (DSOF \u00b6 85, PSSOF, Ex. G.) Dr. Braze began working at KRMC in December 2013. (Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 52.) Plaintiff alleges that KRMC stated that Dr. Braze was hired to help with his clinical patient workload, but she did not help and instead used \"his office equipment and staff and otherwise ignored him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During proceedings before the EEOC, KRMC initially stated that Dr. Braze was hired to replace Plaintiff. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 81, 83; PSSOF, EX. G.) In a subsequent letter to the EEOC, KRMC stated that because Plaintiff was not terminated until 2014 (effective March 31, 2014), Dr. Braze, who was hired in 2013, was not hired to replace him. (PSSOF, Ex. H.) KRMC states that it has not hired an ENT doctor to replace Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As set forth below, Defendant provides several reasons for terminating Plaintiff, which the parties dispute. (Doc. 56 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's Stated Reasons for Terminating Plaintiff's Employment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Productivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asserts that in 2013, based on a \"pool of data of similarly situated ENT doctors in similar practices from the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA),\" Blanchard discovered that Plaintiff generated less revenue than most doctors in the pool. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10.) Based on a review of KRMC's physician's RVUs, Blanchard discovered that Plaintiff's productivity fell beneath his compensation level. (DSOF \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff alleges that Blanchard had no reason to scrutinize his productivity and had not done so in the past. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) Plaintiff asserts that Blanchard did not tell him that he was compiling this data to compare it to Plaintiff's RVU numbers and salary. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 32-37, 42-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant asserts that starting in late 2012 Blanchard and Plaintiff \"met multiple times to discuss his productivity.\" (DSOF \u00b6 11.) In his deposition, Plaintiff admits that during two meetings in late 2013 Blanchard informed him that his salary needed to be reduced, but Plaintiff refused to accept a reduction in his pay. (DSOF \u00b6 12; Ramirez Depo. at 277-78.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Blanchard testified that he talked to Plaintiff about his RVUs and told Plaintiff that his productivity needed to increase to match his compensation, but Blanchard did not tell Plaintiff that there would be any \"consequences\" or that Plaintiff \"was subject to termination if he did not improve his RVUs.\" (Blanchard Depo. at 36, 63-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Use of Operating Room Block Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant asserts that in December 2013 it learned that more than twenty percent of the time Plaintiff was starting late in his morning operating room (\"OR\") block time. (DSOF \u00b6 15; DSOF, Exs. 23, 29.) KRMC revoked Ramirez's morning block time. (DSOF \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff denies this assertion and asserts that KRMC falsely stated that he referred to himself as a \"chronic late starter.\" (PSOF \u00b6 15; PSSOF \u00b6 168.) Plaintiff, however, does not offer any evidence disputing that he started late in his OR block time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Resistance to KRMC's Implementation of Electronic Medical Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By January 1, 2014, KRMC was required to meet a federal mandate that required medical institutions and physicians\n   to use electronic medical records (\"EMR\") or incur financial penalties. (DSOF \u00b6 16; PCSOF \u00b6 16.) KRMC implemented an EMR system called NextGEN. (DSOF \u00b6 17; PCSOF \u00b6 17.) Defendant asserts that it terminated Plaintiff because of his resistance to KRMC's implementation of EMR. (Doc. 56 at 2; Turney Depo. at 146; Merritt Depo. at 37-39; Ex. I.) In a June 2012 email to Merritt, Plaintiff stated that it was after 6:00 p.m., but he still had several hours of charting to complete. (DOSF, Ex. 8.) Plaintiff stated that \"my contract needs to be renegotiated considering I will be working 12 hours continuously.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ramirez Depo. at 223-25 (agreeing that physicians should be paid for time spent using NextGEN).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff admits that he was critical of NextGEN based on his belief that it was inefficient. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 127, 130-36.) In his deposition, Turney testified that NextGEN was difficult to implement and to use and negatively impacted physicians' productivity. (Turney Depo. at 146, 149.) KRMC approved Plaintiff's use of Dragon Medical, a scribe and voice-recognition software and provided him with a home computer to assist with implementation of NextGEN. (DSOF \u00b6 19; PCSOF \u00b6 19.) Other physicians reported difficulty using NextGEN. (Turney Depo. at 146; Merritt Depo. at 38 (stating that she thought the \"majority of doctors\" did not like using EMR).) KRMC permitted physicians to use a hybrid system of NextGEN and paper charts. (Turney Depo. at 146-47; Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 68.) Plaintiff asserts that he did not think that the use of NextGEN was mandatory based on KRMC's approval of a hybrid EMR and paper chart system that it permitted Plaintiff and other physicians to use. (PCSOF \u00b6\u00b6 17; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 119-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant asserts that in an email to the Chief Medical Officer, Plaintiff stated that he would not use NextGEN. (DSOF \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff disputes that assertion. (PCSOF \u00b6 20; DSOF, Ex. 8 (August 31, 2012 email).) However, in an August 31, 2012 email to Merritt and several other physicians, Plaintiff wrote that NextGEN \"ha[s] to go!\" (DSOF, Ex. 8.) Plaintiff described the inefficiencies of using NextGEN and wrote that he would \"NOT WORK ON NEXTGEN EVER AGAIN.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later in 2012, Plaintiff and other physicians went to Tucson to observe the Arizona Community Surgeons use of the NextGEN system. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 127-28.) In a November 27, 2012 email, Plaintiff suggested to Turney that KRMC purchase the newer version of NextGEN that he had observed in Tucson. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 128-27; Turney Depo. at 150-51, 154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a May 2013 email, Plaintiff stated that NextGEN was inefficient and suggested that KRMC bring in Gabriel Choza, \"a proven leader at Tucson Surgical,\" to help them optimize NextGEN, which Plaintiff stated was created for primary care doctors, not for surgeons. (DSOF, Ex. 8.) In response, Dr. Jeffrey Lynn stated that he appreciated Plaintiff's perspective, but that NextGEN was approved by the \"highest levels\" and that KRMC needed a solution that was good for the aggregate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He noted that some physicians had refused to use NextGEN but stated \"that will not continue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's use of the \"hybrid system\" and his refusal to use NexGen, and his attitude about using NextGEN, were among the reasons for terminating Plaintiff. (Turney Depo. at 154; Blanchard Depo. at 68-69; Merritt Depo. at 39.) At the time of Plaintiff's termination in January 2014, other KRMC physicians were still using the hybrid system and as of 2018 there was not \"100 percent\" usage of NextGEN. (PSSOF \u00b6 136-36; Kjelgaard Depo. at \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, 142; Merritt Depo. at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiff's Use of Tylenol with Codeine for Pediatric Patients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant stated that another reason for Plaintiff's termination was his refusal to stop prescribing Tylenol with Codeine after the June 2013 death of pediatric patient, M.G., following a tonsillectomy that Plaintiff performed. (DSOF \u00b6 22; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 150-67.) On May 5, 2014, M.G.'s parents and his estate sued KRMC and its physicians, including Plaintiff, for wrongful death and medical negligence (the \"M.G. Lawsuit\"). (DSOF \u00b6 23; PCSOF \u00b6 23.) It was alleged that M.G.'s death resulted, in part, from Plaintiff's decision to prescribe Tylenol with Codeine to him after his surgery. (DSOF \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff states that, \"as was his usual practice,\" he had prescribed Tylenol 3 with codeine for pain. (PSSOF \u00b6 152.) The use of Tylenol with Codeine was contrary to the FDA's black box warning in effect at the time, which warned against administering it to pediatric patients post-surgery (\"Box Warning\"). (DSOF \u00b6 24, PCSOF \u00b6 24.) At the time of M.G.'s death, Plaintiff did not know about the Box Warning, which the FDA sends out by mail because he did not open his mail. (DSOF \u00b6 26; PSSOF \u00b6 157; Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 87; Ramirez Depo. at 143-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff admits he became aware of the Box Warning after M.G. died. (DSOF \u00b6 26; PCSOF \u00b6 26; Ramirez Depo. at 143-45, 265-66.) During his deposition, Plaintiff testified that after M.G.'s death, he prescribed Tylenol with Codeine\"a few times\" but after he read the Box Warning he started prescribing Lortab instead. (Ramirez Depo. at 144, 147-48.) Plaintiff later explained that he had prescribed Tylenol with Codeine for twenty-five years without a problem and he thinks that after M.G.'s death he prescribed Tylenol with Codeine to a \"handful of patients\" and then switched to Lortab\"eventually when [he] read the Black Box Warning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's medical assistant (\"MA\"), Melissa Kjelgaard, who was responsible for calling in prescriptions for surgery patients, testified during her deposition that Plaintiff continued to prescribe Tylenol with Codeine to pediatric patients until his termination from KRMC in 2014. (DSOF \u00b6 28; Kjelgaard Depo. at 89, 90, 102-03.) Plaintiff disagrees with this characterization of her testimony. (PCSOF \u00b6 28.) However, the record reflects that Kjelgaard testified that she called in the prescriptions for M.G. (Kjelgaard Depo. at 89, 90.) She also testified that \"after M.G.,\" Plaintiff \"usually stuck with Tylenol with Codeine or Lortab... until he left.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant asserts that on December 20, 2013, KRMC asked Plaintiff to provide his standard post-op orders for pediatric patients and that, in response, Plaintiff confirmed that he \"used Tylenol with Codeine for moderate pain\" in his pediatric post-op orders. (DSOF \u00b6 29; DSOF, Exs. 28, 30.) Plaintiff disputes this assertion and states that the referenced email, DSOF, Ex. 28, does not support it. (DSOF \u00b6 29.) However, in response to a January 3, 2014 email that asked Plaintiff to indicate his pediatric post-op procedure, Plaintiff stated that he used \"Tylenol with Codeine for moderate pain.\" (DSOF, Ex. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant asserts that Blanchard's notes from Plaintiff's January 31, 2014 termination meeting reflect that, at that meeting, Plaintiff \"stated he would continue to prescribe [Tylenol with Codeine] to children.\" (DSOF \u00b6 30; DSOF, Ex. 32.) Plaintiff denies this assertion and the \"authenticity\" of Blanchard's purported notes. (DSOF \u00b6 30.) During his deposition, Plaintiff stated that he did not recall telling anyone that he would continue prescribing\n   Tylenol with Codeine for pediatric patients. (DSOF \u00b6 31; PCSOF \u00b6 31; Ramirez Depo. at 144-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Plaintiff's Failure to Respond to ER while On-Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   KRMC is subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (\"EMTALA\"), which creates liability if a physician fails or declines to respond to a call from a hospital's emergency department. (Doc. 56 at 5.) On December 4, 2013, Plaintiff was listed as the ENT on-call for the emergency room (\"ER\"). When the ER received a patient who needed ENT services, it called Plaintiff repeatedly without response. (DSOF \u00b6 37; PCSOF \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff eventually notified KRMC that he was in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not dispute he was listed on-call that day, or that he was unavailable to take the call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rather, Plaintiff asserts that in November 2013 he made plans to attend a medical conference in New York City and that, a week before the conference, he told KRMC's on-call scheduler, Suzie Frisbie, not to schedule him for on-call duty during the dates of the conference. (PSSOF \u00b6 142.) Plaintiff asserts that Frisbie mistakenly put him on the on-call schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143; Kjelgaard Depo. at 86-89; Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 78; Ramirez Decl., Ex. 4.) Consistent with that assertion, during his deposition, Plaintiff asserted that staff failed to notify the ER that he was unavailable on the assigned on-call date. (Ramirez Depo. at 362-63.) In a November 2, 2014 letter, Frisbie stated that on December 2, 2013, Plaintiff informed staff members that his airline itinerary for his trip to New York had changed and asked them to reschedule the afternoon of December 4, 2013. (Ramirez Decl., Ex. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The EEOC Charge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On September 21, 2014, Plaintiff filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") a charge of discrimination alleging discrimination based on religion, age, and national origin (the \"EEOC Charge\"). (PSSOF, Ex. J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The M.G. Lawsuit Settlement and the Medical Board Inquiry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The M.G. Lawsuit settled in November 2015. Plaintiff objected to the settlement. (DSOF \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff states that only one physician who had been sued, Dr. Burton, was allowed to \"get out of the case before it was dismissed.\" (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 198-99.) Plaintiff states that he requested the same courtesy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 200.) Once a settlement was reached, federal law obligated KRMC to report Plaintiff to the National Practitioner Data Bank (\"NPDB\") for monies paid and attributed to him. (DSOF \u00b6 33.) This report led to an Arizona Medical Board (\"AMB\") inquiry, which required Plaintiff's participation. Plaintiff ultimately consented to the entry of an order by the AMB finding that Plaintiff engaged in \"unprofessional conduct when he departed from the standard of practice in his care and treatment of [M.G.]\" by failing to admit M.G. overnight and by treating M.G. with Tylenol with Codeine. (DSOF \u00b6 36.) The AMB placed Plaintiff on probation for six months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asserts that KRMC settle the M.G.

The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff's termination is an adverse employment action. Thus, Plaintiff has established the first element of his prima facie case for his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, on the second element, Plaintiff presented enough evidence to create a genuine dispute regarding whether his job performance was satisfactory at the time of his termination. As set forth above in Section I.A, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's job performance was unsatisfactory because Plaintiff's productivity fell below his compensation level, he started late for his morning OR block time, he resisted or had a bad attitude about NextGEN, he continued to prescribe Tylenol with Codeine to pediatric patients after the 2013 death of a pediatric patient, and he was unavailable when he was \"on call\" in December 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.A.1-5. However, there are genuine disputed issues of fact on at least some of these asserted areas of job performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For example, while Plaintiff admits that he used a hybrid system of NextGEN and paper charts, Defendant admits that it permitted physicians to use that system. (Turney Depo. at 146-47; Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 68;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section I.A.3.) Additionally, there is evidence that at the time of Plaintiff's termination in January 2014, other KRMC physicians were still using the hybrid system and, as of 2018, the usage of NextGEN was not \"100 percent.\" (Kjelgaard Depo. at 59-60, 142; Merritt Depo. at 39.) Additionally, the evidence regarding Plaintiff's continued prescription of Tylenol with Codeine is disputed. During his deposition, Plaintiff testified that he continued to prescribe Tylenol with Codeine to pediatric patients \"a few times\" after the death of the pediatric patient, but other evidence indicates that Plaintiff continued to prescribe that medication until he was terminated in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.A.4. Additionally, although Plaintiff admits he was unavailable when he was on-call on December 4, 2013, he provided a reasonable explanation for his unavailability that is supported by other evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.A.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the third element of his prima facie case of disparate treatment claim, Plaintiff must present some additional evidence to support the inference that the employment actions were taken because of a discriminatory motive based upon his failure to hold or follow his employer's religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Shapolia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11962409\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/992/1033/\">\n    992 F.2d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the Court separates the categories of evidence in the interest of clarity, the Court considers the evidence cumulatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff did not the Share Religious Beliefs of his Employers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff, who identifies himself as Christian, asserts that KRMC is a Mormon-run hospital. (Doc. 67 at 7.) It is undisputed that the CEO Turney is Mormon and has connections to the Mormon community. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 170-94; DSOF \u00b6 49; Turney Depo. at 29-37.) The majority of the KRMC board of directors is Mormon. (Turney Depo. at 28.) Defendant states that in January 2014 Blanchard and Merritt decided to terminate Plaintiff. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5.) Merritt is Mormon, but Blanchard is not. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 54, 55; PCSOF \u00b6\u00b6 53, 54.) In his deposition, Turney testified that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was a \"group decision,\" and he \"supported the decision.\" (Turney Depo. at 46-47, 66; Blanchard Depo. at 88-89.) Considering the role of Turney and Merritt in the decision to terminate Plaintiff, there is undisputed evidence that Plaintiff did not share the religious beliefs held by some individuals involved in the decision to terminate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mormon Culture and Favoritism at KRMC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that he was terminated because he was a \"disfavored non-Mormon.\" (PSSOF at\u00b6 194.) However, Plaintiff admits that no one at KRMC asked him about his own religion, including during the \"onboarding or recruiting process.\" (DSOF \u00b6 55; PCSOF 55.) As evidence that his termination was motivated by his failure to share the religious beliefs of his employer, Plaintiff argues that Turney and \"like-minded Mormons regularly socialize,\" know which employees at KRMC are Mormon and which are not, and favor Mormons. (Doc. 67 at 7; PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 175-84 (citing Ramirez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 97-98, 100; Turney Depo. at 28-29, 121-22, 174; Merritt Depo. at 16-19, 22-23; Kjelgaard Depo. at 118-19, 134-36, 145-56).) Plaintiff also asserts that he complained about the \"Mormon culture and power structure\" at KRMC to his supervisor Merritt and that Turney knew of his complaints. (PSSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 183-84 (citing Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 101; Merritt Depo. at 16-19; Turney Depo. at 174).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   During his deposition, Turney stated that \"over time\" he could \"figure ... out who was Mormon.\" (Turney Depo. at 29-30, 32, 33.) Turney stated that he had not heard from any KRMC employee that there was a perception that Mormons were favored over non-Mormons, but he would not have been shocked if someone said that because people said \"a lot of things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121-22.) Turney also stated that, since Plaintiff's termination, he had heard \"chatter\" that KRMC employees thought Mormons were in \"power,\" and that he was aware that Plaintiff had \"made a couple of comments before he left,\" but did not know Plaintiff had that \"degree of animus toward\" Mormons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   During her deposition, Merritt testified that she had heard Plaintiff use the term \"Mormon mafia,\" and that he complained about the hospital being run by Mormons. (Merritt Depo. at 16-17.) Merritt testified that she and Turney talked about church activities, such as choir practice, at work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) Merritt stated that her conversations about her faith with Plaintiff consisted of him asking about who the Mormons were at KRMC.

She did not, however, describe any instance of favoritism toward a Mormon employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-119, 136-37.) Kjelgaard, who identified herself as Catholic, testified that she did not recall being asked about religion at work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119-20.) She stated that KRMC employees talked about their religion in the context of their children's or family's activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120.) Kjelgaard stated that no administrators or doctors talked to her about religion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She testified that she had heard rumors that there were a lot of Mormons in the KRMC administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136, 147.) She also testified that she had heard the term \"Mormon mafia\" \"around the community\" and that it was common knowledge in the Kingman area that \"Mormons run KRMC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137, 139, 145, 148.) Kjelgaard testified that she did not discuss religion, \"Mormon culture,\" or the \"Mormon mafia\" at KRMC because she wanted to \"make sure nobody was upset and/or felt it was necessary to be upset with her and possibly ... risk [her] job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146.) She also testified that she had no reason to believe that her faith or religion would negatively impact her job, and that she avoided conversations about faith or religion because she felt people should not be judged based on that issue.

Knievel, Taylor, Oldham, and Oldham's partner) to use paper charts after KRMC transitioned to the NextGEN/EMR system. (DSOF \u00b6 60; PCSOF \u00b6 60.) Plaintiff admits that this allegation is not based on his first-hand knowledge or information from KRMC management but is based on what Kjelgaard told him. (DSOF \u00b6 63; PCSOF \u00b6 63.) Plaintiff admits that he did not \"do anything to verify whether or not [the] doctors were indeed permitted to continue to use the paper charting,\" and does not know for how long the doctors were allowed to use paper charts, or if the doctors used the paper charts as part of a hybrid system, like the hybrid system KRMC permitted Plaintiff to use. (DSOF \u00b6 64; PCSOF \u00b6 64.) Additionally, Plaintiff admits that KRMC permitted him to use a hybrid system of paper charting and EMR after the implementation of NextGEN.

However, Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that this comment was not directed to, or about, Plaintiff. (Doc. 74 at 5; DSOF; Ex. 1, Ramirez Depo. at 164-65.)

Additionally, in response to the motion for summary judgment Plaintiff generally asserts that KRMC had \"Well-Known Discriminatory Employment Practices,\" however, Plaintiff does not dispute that he has failed to identify any specific employment practices or selection criteria that caused an adverse disparate impact on non-Mormons.

Although Dr. Braze was in the protected class for purposes of the ADEA, that does not defeat Plaintiff's claim of age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744659\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/308/#p313\">\n    517 U.S. at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744659\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/308/#p313\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the fact that \"one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Plaintiff was 56 years old at the time of his termination and Dr. Braze was no older than 45 years old. (Doc. 67 at 8; DSOF \u00b6 85, PSSOF, Ex. G.) Thus, the age difference between Plaintiff and Dr. Braze is sufficient to state a prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Replaced Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff cannot make a showing at the fourth element of the prima facie case because there is no evidence that Dr. Braze replaced Plaintiff because she was hired several months before Plaintiff was terminated. (Doc. 56 at 14.) Defendant states that three months before Plaintiff's termination, it hired Dr. Braze to service new patients in KRMC's ENT practice. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 81-86.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not believe that Dr. Braze \"[took] over [his] practice\" and admitted that they did not share patients during the several months they worked together. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-87.) Additionally, Dr. Braze hired her own medical assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant admits that it\n   did not hire a second ENT doctor after Plaintiff's termination but claims it was not necessary because Dr. Braze had improved the efficiency of the ENT practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Braze did not help with his patient work load, but rather used \"his office equipment and staff and otherwise ignored him.\" (Ramirez Decl. \u00b6 52.) Furthermore, as Plaintiff argues, in its communications with the EEOC, KRMC initially stated that Dr. Braze was hired to replace Plaintiff in a response to the EEOC's request for information, but later retracted that statement. (PSSOF \u00b6\u00b6 81, 83; PSSOF, Exs. H, G.) Although Dr. Braze was hired before Plaintiff was terminated, Defendant initially stated to the EEOC that Dr. Braze was hired to replace Plaintiff, Dr. Braze did not work with Plaintiff in KRMC's ENT practice, and Defendant did not hire an ENT doctor after terminating Plaintiff. Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to state a prima facie case on the \"replacement\" aspect of the fourth element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Inference of Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendant further argues that Plaintiff cannot establish the fourth element of the prima facie case because he was not terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination.

(Doc. 67 at 8-11, 13, 15-16.) Plaintiff relies on the same evidence to establish pretext that he relied on to state a prima facie case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he can meet this burden because KRMC deviated from its policy.

In his discussion of pretext, Plaintiff does not specifically identify the policy from which KRMC deviated. (Doc. 67 at 13.) However, in support of his statement of facts, Plaintiff cites evidence that KRMC had a policy of documenting disciplinary or important meetings with physicians and that Turney and Blanchard did not document meetings with Plaintiff regarding his productivity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Riddle v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DSOF, Exs. 21, 31.) In a December 2014 position statement with the EEOC, Defendant stated that it terminated Plaintiff's employment contract without cause. (PSSOF, Ex. F.) In the portion of its EEOC position statement discussing the legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's termination, Defendant stated that it terminated Plaintiff due to his \"utter lack of productivity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 68-1 at 365.) Defendant stated that it gave Plaintiff the opportunity to keep his job by improving his productivity or by decreasing his salary to reflect his low productivity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a section of its EEOC position statement describing Plaintiff's \"poor productivity,\" Defendant discussed ways in which Plaintiff had \"cost KRMC money\" including his failure to generate sufficient RVUs compared to his compensation, inefficient use of OR block time, referral of patients to outside clinics, refusal to collect co-pays from patients, and a failure to comply with EMR protocols, which cost KRMC because it led to bills not being collected. (PSSOF, Ex. F.) In its EEOC position statement, Defendant cast these productivity issues as financial burdens to KRMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In this proceeding, Defendant has stated that it terminated Plaintiff because of his \"multiple concerns\" about his \"performance and attitude.\" (DSOF \u00b6 4; Blanchard Depo. at 66-69, 88-89; Merritt Depo. at 39, 88-89; Turney Depo. at 154.) In addition to the reasons provided in its EEOC position statement, Defendant asserts that that it terminated Plaintiff based on his \"attitude,\" his continued prescription of Tylenol with Codeine after the death of pediatric patient in June 2013, and a potential EMTALA violation. (DSOF \u00b6 4; Doc. 56 at 4-5, 7-8.) Evidence that Defendant offered at least some reasons for Plaintiff's termination in this proceeding that it did not include its EEOC position statement is sufficient to create a triable issue on pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiff has shown a material issue of fact regarding whether Defendant's proffered reasons for his termination were pretextual.

Plaintiff does not provide any argument that his retaliation claims are like or reasonably related to the allegations in his EEOC charge. (Doc. 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's retaliation claims do not meet this standard. (Doc. 74 at 10.) The Court agrees. Plaintiff's relation claims relate to the M.G. Lawsuit and the AMB inquiry and are unrelated to the allegations of discrimination related to his termination. The allegations in the EEOC charge of discrimination relate to Plaintiff's termination and KRMC's alleged discriminatory hiring and firing practices, and do not mention retaliation. Additionally, the events alleged in the charge of discrimination occurred between late 2012 and January 2014, well before Defendant resolved the M.G. Lawsuit in November 2015, and considered Plaintiff's request for legal counsel associated with the AMB inquiry in December 2015. Thus, the EEOC could not have been reasonably expected to investigate Plaintiff's allegations of retaliation as related to the allegations in the EEOC charge. Plaintiff did not exhaust his retaliation claims and those claims are not \"like or reasonably related to\" the claims he exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \"[S]ubstantial compliance with the presentment of discrimination complaints\n   to an appropriate administrative agency is a jurisdictional prerequisite.\"\n   <em>\n    Sommatino v.

When an employee entirely fails to exhaust a claim and the claim is not \"like or reasonably related to\" one that has been exhausted, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088699\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/704/#p708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088699\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/704/#p708\">\n    at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[i]n cases where the plaintiff has never presented a discrimination complaint to the appropriate administrative authority, the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\").
