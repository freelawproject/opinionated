It appeared that appellant\u2019s attorney did hand the agreed case to such clerk within time, and received from him a copy, which the clerk certified to be a true copy of the original then on file in his office. Such copy was sent to the clerk of the Supreme Court, and the original was then borrowed for the use of the printer, and was inadvertently not returned to the clerk of the Circuit Court until about two months afterwards, when he marked it filed, having omitted to do so before.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">This court, in refusing the motion, said :</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The facts are undisputed. The appellant\u2019s attorneys in two days after the agreement of the case between appellant and respondent\u2019s attorneys, carried the case to the clerk\u2019s office for the purpose of filing the same and left it there, supposing it had been marked filed. The appellant\u2019s attorneys certainly did their duty in the premises, and were not in default. As far as they are concerned, the \u201cCase\u201d was practically filed. Whether the clerk violated his duty in not marking the \u201cCase\u201d filed, or in allowing the \u201cCase\u201d to be taken from his office, is not in question now. The ease of <em>Sternberger </em>v. <em>McSween </em>(14 S. C., 36), cited by respondent\u2019s attorneys, does not apply. The paper in that case was an agricultural lien, which was not required to be spread upon the records, and therefore should have been left in the clerk\u2019s office to advertise purchasers and creditors what property was covered by the lien. The motion is dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARWy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>Gfraydon $ Gfraydon, </em>for the motion. <em>Benet $ Oason, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
