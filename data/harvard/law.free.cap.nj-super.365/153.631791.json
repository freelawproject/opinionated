The UIM carrier contends that it still could avail itself of the arbitration clause contained in the contract of insurance. We disagree and hold that the contract arbitration clause is unenforceable under <em>Zirger v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996). The judgment entered as a result of the confirmation award is, therefore, valid and enforceable since the UIM carrier fully participated as a party to the previous arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The facts which are not in dispute may be summarized as follows. Plaintiff, Carol Wylie, was in an auto accident with an auto driven by defendant, Christopher Hamilton, on November 4, 1998. Plaintiff was idling in traffic on the Tacony Palmyra Bridge in Palmyra when defendant rear-ended her with his vehicle. According to defendant, while traveling behind plaintiff, traffic came to a sudden stop and despite applying his brakes, he was unable to stop in time to avoid an accident with her. As a result of being hit by defendant, plaintiff then struck the vehicle in front of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>At the time of the accident, Hamilton maintained auto insurance through American Independent Insurance Company with split policy limits of $15,000/$30,000 and $5000 in property damage. Plaintiff maintained auto insurance through defendant CNA Insurance Company (CNA) with UM/UIM limits of $100,000. By letter dated December 3, 1998, plaintiff notified CNA of her intention to file a UIM claim since her injuries exceeded Hamilton\u2019s minimum insurance coverage. On October 10, 2000, plaintiff filed suit against Hamilton in the Law Division, Burlington County. CNA filed a motion to intervene in the suit pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:33-1, which was granted on April 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On January 25, 2002, plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability was granted. CNA submitted its own set of interrogatories to plaintiff, took plaintiffs deposition, served subpoenas for plaintiffs medical and employment records, and had plaintiff examined by an orthopedist. On May 1, 2002, Wylie, Hamilton, and CNA attended mandatory, non-binding arbitration pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1 to -6. The arbitrator attributed 100% liability to Hamilton and entered an award in favor of plaintiff for $118,000. After obtaining consent from CNA, plaintiff settled with Hamilton for his policy limit of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">CNA did not move under <em>Rule </em>4:21-6 to reject the award and demand a trial <em>de novo </em>within thirty days after filing of the arbitration award. When CNA failed to file for a trial <em>de novo, </em>plaintiff moved to confirm the arbitration award as to CNA pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Opposing the motion, CNA argued it was unnecessary to file for a trial <em>de novo </em>since CNA was not a defendant in the action, and the next appropriate step for the UIM claim was arbitration in accordance with the contract of insurance. Assignment Judge Sweeney ruled that CNA as an intervenor was bound to the arbitration award under the holding of <em>Zirger, supra. </em>Barred from enforcing the arbitration provision of the UIM policy, the court found <em>Zirger </em>required CNA to file for a trial <em>de novo </em>to protect its interests in the litigation. Not having done so, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Sweeney confirmed the arbitration award against CNA in the amount of $85,000, constituting the difference between the UIM policy limit of $100,000 and the $15,000 received from Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On appeal, CNA raises the following issues for our consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\n<em>POINT i.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">THE TRIAL COURT WAS IN ERROR WHEN IT ENTERED JUDGMENT AGAINST CNA INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE THE INSURANCE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES REQUIRES THAT THIS UIM CLAIM PROCEED TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND THIS MATTER IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE EXCEPTION TO REQUIRED UIM ARBITRATION SET FORTH IN <em>ZIRGER V. GENERAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\n<em>POINT II.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">THE TRIAL COURT WAS IN ERROR WHEN IT ENTERED JUDGMENT AGAINST CNA INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE CNA INSURANCE COMPANY WAS NOT A NAMED DEFENDANT IN THIS LITIGATION RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT HAMILTON, AND <em>R. </em>4:21A-1 <em>ET SEQ. </em>WAS CLEARLY NEVER INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS UM/UIM CARRIERS IN THAT SUPERIOR COURT ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\n<em>POINT III.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">THE TRIAL COURT WAS IN ERROR WHEN IT ENTERED JUDGMENT AGAINST CNA INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE AFTER PLAINTIFF SETTLED THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION CNA INSURANCE COMPANY COULD NOT PREVENT PLAINTIFF PROM ENFORCING THE MANDATORY UIM ARBITRATION PROVISION AGAINST CNA UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICY, AND SIMILARLY PLAINTIFF SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT CNA FROM ENFORCING THE UIM ARBITRATION PROVISION OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AGAINST PLAINTIFF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">CNA argues in Points I and III that the trial court erred in refusing to allow it to proceed to UIM arbitration as spelled out in the insurance contract, instead determining it was bound under <em>Zirger, supra, </em>by the award made in the Superior Court arbitration. The thrust of CNA\u2019s argument is that the public policy concern in <em>Zirger </em>of avoiding repetitious litigation does not apply to the present case since no trial took place as it did in <em>Zirger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The starting point for discussion begins quite naturally with the <em>Zirger </em>opinion. <em>Zirger </em>involved an automobile collision between defendant Joseph Filsaime, who had minimum liability coverage of $15,000, and plaintiff Zirger who maintained UIM coverage of $1,000,000 issued through defendant General Accident Insurance Company (General Accident). <em>Id. </em>at 330, 676 A.2d 1065. The UIM contract contained a standard arbitration clause used in the industry. <em>Ibid. </em>Although General Accident granted plaintiffs request to settle with Filsaime for his policy limit of $15,000, the settlement was never finalized with the case instead proceeding to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 676 A.2d 1065. A jury found Filsaime liable for plaintiffs injuries, awarding plaintiff $400,000. <em>Id. </em>at 331-32, 676 A.2d 1065. Plaintiff demanded $385,000 from General Accident, representing the jury verdict less Filsaime\u2019s policy limit of $15,000. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Zirger filed suit against General Accident after it refused to pay the claim. <em>Ibid. </em>The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court granted Zirger\u2019s motion, concluding General Accident consented to the litigation of Zirger\u2019s claim against Filsaime and therefore waived its contractual right to arbitration. <em>Ibid. </em>This court reversed, determining General Accident\u2019s consent was not sufficiently clear to constitute a waiver of its right to arbitrate. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In reversing this court, our Supreme Court found the legislative goal of preventing unreasonable delay in payment of UIM claims precluded \u201can insurance policy provision that would require an insured to litigate to conclusion the issues of liability and damages in a personal-injury action against the tortfeasor, on notice to the UM/UIM carrier, only [to require the insured] to relitigate those same issues in an arbitration proceeding with the UM/UIM carrier----\u201d <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 343-44, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Recognizing that the language in the insurance contract should ordinarily govern UM/UIM disputes, the Court observed that mandatory availability of UM/UIM coverage in New Jersey reflects a strong public policy interest in insuring adequate eompen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>sation for injuries sustained by New Jersey motorists in accidents with uninsured motorists. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 676 A.2d 1065. Examining cases from sister states, the Court noted that courts in a significant number of states often refused to enforce standard arbitration clauses in UM/UIM contracts, especially where the insured has already litigated the damage claim against the tortfeasor. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Explaining the basis for its holding, the Supreme Court had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">The advantages of arbitration evaporate when arbitration is used not as a substitute for litigation, but as a supplement to litigation. Used in that manner, a procedure designed to expedite dispute resolution is transformed into a mechanism for delaying and obstructing final resolution of disputes____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">We invalidate the contractual arbitration clause only to the extent that it requires an arbitration proceeding that duplicates the underlying litigation of the tort claim. For example, if the underlying tort claim does not result in an adjudication of damages, as is often the ease, the arbitration clause in the UM/UIM policy will be given full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\"><em>[Id </em>at 343, 676 A.2d 1065].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">CNA argues the present case does not fall within the <em>Zirger </em>exception to the general rule that the insurance contract governs resolution of disputes arising over UM/UIM coverage. CNA urges us to read the holding in <em>Zirger </em>narrowly, prohibiting UM/UIM carriers\u2019 invocation of arbitration only in cases where a jury trial occurred on the issue of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability. Such an interpretation, according to CNA, is most consistent with the public policy concerns of the <em>Zirger </em>Court in avoiding duplicative litigation which delays an injured party\u2019s receipt of UM/UIM benefits. Since \u201can informal Superior Court arbitration proceeding before one attorney who is hearing numerous cases that day is simply not a Law Division trial,\u201d CNA claims that proceeding to UIM arbitration would not amount to supplemental litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Plaintiff contends the facts in <em>Zirger </em>parallel those here. Plaintiff asserts that permitting CNA to proceed to UIM arbitration would be tantamount to giving UM/UIM insurers \u201ctwo bites at the apple\u201d if, as here, CNA has fully participated in Superior Court arbitration. Plaintiff points out that this second arbitration will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>cause unnecessary delay in payment of UIM benefits to her for an accident which occurred more than five years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The precise issue of whether the <em>Zirger </em>holding compels a court to bind a UM/UIM carrier to an award made during a mandatory, non-binding Superior Court arbitration in which the carrier has fully participated has not been addressed by our courts. Other <em>post-Zirger </em>decisions of this court shed illumination on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In <em>Vaccaro v. Pa. Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 144, 793 A.2d 82 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>40, 803 A.2d 635 (2002), this court upheld a UM carrier\u2019s right to arbitrate where, unlike the trial which occurred in <em>Zirger, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 damages had been determined in an uncontested proof hearing following the uninsured driver\u2019s default. The uncontested proof hearing resulted in a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $305,710.62. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 793 A.2d 82. Plaintiffs\u2019 UM carrier, Pennsylvania National, never received notice of this hearing, and refused payment to the plaintiffs. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Plaintiffs initiated suit against Pennsylvania National, alleging the default judgment entered against the uninsured motorist was binding on Pennsylvania National under <em>Zirger </em>since the insurance company had failed to intervene in the action. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 793 A.2d 82. Rejecting this argument, we commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhD\">Essentially, <em>Zirger </em>was concerned with the \u2018avoidance of redundant litigation\u2019____We are satisfied that <em>Zirger </em>contemplates a contested damages trial to bind the UM/UIM carrier. An uncontested proof hearing that fixes damages is not the equivalent of an adjudication of damages so as to invalidate the contractual arbitration clause. To bind the UM/UIM carrier, there must be notice to the carrier and an adversarial proceeding that determines damages____ Here, the arbitration is a substitute for the litigation of damages, because no real litigation of that issue occurred in the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">[Id. at 143-44, 793 A.2d 82 (quoting <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 676 A.2d 1065).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Another relevant case is <em>Habick v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 727 A.2d 51 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>149, 735 A.2d 574 (1999), which addressed issue preclusion resulting from a PIP arbitration. In <em>Habick, </em>the plaintiff allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>suffered from TMJ and a right knee injury following a 1992 automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 727 A.2d 51. Her PIP carrier, defendant Liberty Mutual, paid for treatment of the TMJ and arthroscopic surgery for her knee, but refused to pay for a knee replacement. <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff consequently filed both for arbitration of her PIP claim and coverage under her UM/UIM policy. <em>Ibid. </em>The PIP arbitrator denied plaintiffs claim for additional TMJ treatment and for the knee replacement, finding neither treatment was necessary since plaintiff sustained only \u201cminor soft tissue injuries\u201d from the accident. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Plaintiff then filed a complaint in the Law Division seeking to vacate the arbitration determination, or at least limit its scope to reflect that it was without prejudice to her UM/UIM claim. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 727 A.2d 51. We upheld the decision of the trial court denying relief to the plaintiff, holding the PIP arbitration barred relitigation of medical causation in plaintiffs anticipated UM claim since, consistent with <em>Zirger, </em>plaintiff had \u201ca full opportunity to be heard in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 727 A.2d 51. We noted, however, that where a UM arbitration allocated partial fault to an insured driver who was unrepresented in the arbitration, the arbitration award could not bind the insured driver in a subsequent action. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Riccio v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>493, 498, 531 A.2d 717 (1987)). The \u201ckey factor\u201d in according preclusive effect to an arbitration award is whether the party had \u201cthe opportunity once to be heard fully.\u201d <em>Habick, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255, 727 A.2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Both <em>Vaccaro </em>and <em>Habick </em>recognize, as did <em>Zirger, </em>that a party\u2019s opportunity to litigate an issue will bar relitigation of the same issue in a different forum. This is consistent with a key underpinning of <em>Zirger </em>of avoiding repetitious litigation and delays in a plaintiffs receipt of UM/UIM benefits. CNA argues that UIM arbitration would not be repetitious litigation here since the underlying tort action settled before proceeding to a jury trial and verdict. That argument sidesteps the issue. CNA consented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the settlement of the other driver\u2019s minimum policy limits after having had an opportunity to fully participate as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">CNA actively involved itself in the discovery process leading up to the arbitration. CNA then fully participated in the arbitration along with Wylie and Hamilton. CNA\u2019s role contrasts sharply with the facts of <em>Vaccaro </em>where the damages award was made at an <em>uncontested </em>proof hearing following the tortfeasor\u2019s default. <em>Vaccaro, supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 137, 793 A.2d 82. Indeed, CNA already had been given the opportunity to be heard fully during the first arbitration. <em>Habick, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255, 727 A.2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Although we were never provided with a copy of the UIM contract, it was represented at argument to be a standard contract widely used in the industry, containing an arbitration clause. A standard arbitration clause in UIM contracts such as the following have previously been the subject of dispute before this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">If we [the insurer] and a covered person do not agree: (1)[w]hether that person is legally entitled to recover damages under this part [entitled Uninsured Motorists Coverage]; or (2)[a]s to the amount of damages; either party may make a written demand for arbitration. In this event, each party will select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will select a third. If they cannot agree within 30 days, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">A decision agreed to by two of the arbitrators will be binding as to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">1. Whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">2. The amount of damages. This applies only if the amount does not exceed the minimum limit for liability specified by the financial responsibility law of New Jersey. If the amount exceeds the limit, either party may demand the right to a trial. This demand must be made within 60 days of the arbitrators\u2019 decision. If this demand is not made, the amount of damages agreed to by the arbitrators will be binding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\"><em>[Duerlein v. N.J. Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>634, 639, 619 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1993); <em>Derfuss v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 128, 666 A.2d 599 (App.Div.1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The UIM contract here presumably duplicates the above, as we were advised that the arbitration is binding only where the amount of the award is less than or equals the minimum limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. If the award exceeds the minimum limits, either party to the arbitration could file for a <em>de novo </em>trial. Three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>bites of the apple is thus a realistic prospect: court sponsored arbitration, contract arbitration and a trial <em>de novo. </em>The legislative goal of eliminating unreasonable delays in payment of UM/ UIM benefits would be stymied. CNA and plaintiff already participated in an adversarial proceeding which resulted in an adjudication of damages so as to invalidate the UIM arbitration clause under <em>Zirger. Vaccaro, supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143, 793 A.2d 82. CNA should not now be permitted to proceed to a second arbitration because it did not like the results of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">CNA argues the trial court improperly penalized it for failing to file for a trial <em>de novo, </em>because CNA was unable to do so since <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1 to -6 does not encompass UM/UIM carriers. CNA first contends it was both unnecessary and impossible for it to file for a trial <em>de novo </em>because it had not filed an answer, was not a named defendant in the case, and was never given notice of the arbitration. CNA asserts that once plaintiff settled her claim with Hamilton, the case was \u201cno longer under the jurisdiction of the court system\u201d and the only proper avenue of relief for the UIM claim was arbitration. Second, CNA maintains that the court rules governing arbitration, specifically <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1 to -6, were never intended to apply to UM/UIM contract claims but rather govern only the underlying tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">There is no basis for CNA\u2019s argument that it lacked standing as an intervenor to file for a trial <em>de novo. </em>CNA fails to cite a single case in support of its argument that the arbitration rules under <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1 to -6 do not apply to UM/UIM carriers. To the contrary, CNA, as an intervenor, was a party to the case, fully participating in the discovery process and the Superior Court arbitration. Whether CNA was a \u201cnamed defendant\u201d is irrelevant; CNA, as plaintiffs UM/UIM carrier, had a right to intervene in the underlying tort action pursuant to the holding in <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 676 A.2d 1065 (asserting \u201cUM/UIM carriers ordinarily may intervene in their insured\u2019s action against the third-party tortfeasor\u201d). CNA fully participated in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ceeding and signed the arbitrator\u2019s award. The claim that it did not receive effective notice is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">CNA\u2019s contention that the ease was \u201cno longer under the jurisdiction of the court system\u201d following the settlement between plaintiff and defendant, and that the only proper avenue of relief for the UIM claim was arbitration, is likewise rejected. <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(1). allows a party to an automobile negligence arbitration to reject the arbitration award within thirty days of its filing and demand a trial <em>de novo. </em>A trial <em>de novo </em>will then be held within ninety days of the request. <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(c). CNA is a \u201cparty\u201d to this action as an intervenor. The court rules explicitly provide a method of relief from the arbitration award which CNA, as a party to this action, could have followed. CNA did not lose its right to file for a trial <em>de novo </em>simply because plaintiff and defendant settled with CNA\u2019s consent. Simply stated, CNA cannot now argue the trial court lacked jurisdiction to conduct a trial <em>de novo </em>because CNA failed to file for one.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
