He pled guilty on June 15, 1998, to sexually assaulting a nine-year-old girl and was sentenced the following day to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (\u201cADTC\u201d) for a term of five years. In addition to the custodial term, defendant was subject to the requirements of Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -11, and he was accordingly sentenced to community supervision for life (\u201cCSL\u201d). We affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for second-degree sexual assault. <em>State v. Bond, </em>A-6965-98T4 (March 6, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">In conjunction with his impending parole from imprisonment on that sentence, defendant signed a document on May 1, 2000, setting forth the conditions for CSL, as was required for his release on parole. The document stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Among these conditions, he was required \u201cto obey all laws\u201d and to \u201crefrain from the purchase, use, possession, distribution or administration of any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance ... or any paraphernalia related to such substances except as prescribed by a physician\u201d and \u201csubmit to drug or alcohol testing at any time as directed by the assigned parole officer.\u201d The form further stated, \u201cI understand that I will be under the supervision of the Bureau of Parole of the Department of Corrections until I am released from community supervision by the Superior Court.\u201d By his signature, defendant acknowledged \u201cthat a violation of a condition specified above without good cause constitutes a crime of the fourth degree.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>I understand that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 my sentence includes a special sentence of community supervision for life.

Defendant pled guilty to the charge of violating the conditions of CSL on December 14, 2000, and on January 26, 2001, defendant was sentenced to a three-year term of probation which included the following conditions: (1) 193 days in county jail (time served), (2) compliance with the conditions of Megan\u2019s Law, including CSL, and (3) maintenance of full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Defendant tested positive for the use of cocaine on March 7, 2001, and on May 25 he was charged with fourth-degree violation of CSL for such use, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4, under indictment No. 01-05-0954. Defendant moved to dismiss that indictment, asserting that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 was unconstitutionally vague and over-broad and was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. After arguments on the motion to dismiss, defendant pled guilty on November 9, 2001, for violating the terms of the three-year probation imposed for the charges contained in indictment No. 00-11-1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">These violations were charged based on his having failed to report to his parole officer and tested positive for cocaine use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>That same day, Judge Michael D. Farren sentenced defendant to a custodial term of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On April 3, 2002, Judge Farren issued a letter opinion denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss indictment No. 01-05-0954, finding that defendant was on notice that illegal drug use was prohibited under the conditions of CSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On April 8, 2002, defendant pled guilty to the fourth-degree offense of violating the conditions of CSL, as charged in indictment No. 01-05-0954. On April 11, 2002, Judge Farren sentenced defendant to a custodial term of thirteen months, concurrent to the term he was currently serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">On April 24, 2002, defendant was released from custody on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Defendant\u2019s brief contends as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\"><em>POINT I: </em>THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD HAVE GRANTED MR. BOND\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT BECAUSE <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4d IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE. <em>(U.S. CONST., </em>AMENDS. IV AND V; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>(1947) ART. I, PAR. 1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\"><em>POINT II: </em>IN FAILING TO (1) DEFINE THE \u201cSPECIAL SENTENCE\u201d OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION FOR LIFE, (2) DEFINE THE CRIME OF BREACHING ANY CONDITION OF THAT SPECIAL SENTENCE, AND (3) IDENTIFY WHICH AGENCY SHALL ADMINISTER IT, THE LEGISLATURE UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EITHER ABDICATED ITS POWER TO DEFINE CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS, OR DELEGATED IT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITHOUT IMPOSING NECESSARY CONSTRAINTS ON THE LATTER\u2019S DISCRETION. <em>(N.J. </em>Const. (1947), Art. III, par. 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">b. The special sentence of community supervision required by this section shall commence upon completion of the sentence imposed pursuant to other applicable provisions of the Code of Criminal Justice. Persons serving a special sentence of community supervision <em>shall he supervised as if on parole </em>and subject to conditions appropriate to protect the public and foster rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">d. A person who violates a condition of a special sentence of community supervision <em>witkout good cause </em>is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">[ (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">We address first the argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4 is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to (1) adequately describe what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>conduct it proscribes and (2) define what comprises \u201cgood cause.\u201d Defendant also asserts that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4 is facially vague because it prohibits no specific conduct whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In his letter opinion dated April 3, 2002, Judge Farren explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4 states \u201c... Persons serving a special sentence for community supervision for life shall be supervised <em>as if on parole.\u201d N.J.S. </em>30:4-127.59<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cthe conditions of parole shall include ... a requirement that the parolee refrain from the use, possession or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance ... as defined in <em>N.J.S. </em>20:35-2 and <em>N.J.S. </em>20:35-11...\u201d Therefore, the Legislature, not the Parole Board, has set the condition prohibiting the use of a controlled dangerous substance by a parolee or one under community supervision for life. The defendant received notice that he was not to use controlled dangerous substances while under community supervision for life. Based upon the foregoing, this Court finds no merit to the defendant\u2019s arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Defendant argues that the court erred by relying upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59 to show that CDS use was prohibited under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4 because (1) \u201ccommunity supervisees\u201d are not parolees, (2) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 does not state that \u201ccommunity supervisees\u201d are subject to the \u201cGeneral Conditions of Parole\u201d and that violations thereof constitute a fourth-degree offense, and (3) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 itself does not provide adequate notice. As we understand it, the principal thrust of defendant\u2019s contentions is a lack of notice, and therefore lack of due process, which he asserts results from a person on CSL not knowing what conduct would trigger a CSL violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">We conclude, however, that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4, when read in conjunction with the Parole Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59b, and the CSL regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11, provides adequate notice that use of a CDS by a person subject to CSL is prohibited. Moreover, defendant received full written notice of the conditions of CSL, one of which proscribed the use of a CDS. The three-page document that defendant signed on May 1, 2000, prior to his release on parole also indicated that he would be under \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>supervision of the Bureau of Parole of the Department of Corrections ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A statute is deemed constitutionally vague when its terms do not enable a person of common intelligence to understand whether the contemplated conduct is lawful. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985). This determination must be made in light of the contextual background of the particular statute while being mindful of its objectives. <em>Ibid. </em>In order for a statute to be facially vague, it must be vague when applied under any circumstances. <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>536, 563, 645 A.2d 1165 (1994). The requirement that criminal statutes be clear and understandable serves two important goals: one is providing notice of illegality and the other is creating clear standards for enforcement. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 645 A.2d 1165. Criminal statutes are subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny for vagueness due to the potential severity of their ramifications. <em>Ibid. </em>While criminal statutes are more critically scrutinized for vagueness than are civil laws, \u201cprecise definition\u201d is not required. <em>State v. Lee, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>156, 166, 475 A.2d 31 (1984). In any event,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">A criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give notice of the required conduct to one who would avoid its penalties, and to guide the judge in its application and the lawyer in defending one charged with its violation. But few words possess the precision of mathematical symbols, most statutes must deal with untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations, and the practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions. Consequently, no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded. Nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\"><em>[State v. Saunders, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 521, 695 A.2d 722 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>470, 700 A.2d 881 (1997) (quoting <em>Boyce Motor Lines v. United States, </em>342 <em>U.S. </em>337, 340, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>329, 330-31, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>367, 371 (1952)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b is facially vague is without merit. The statute requires persons subject to CSL be treated in accordance with the laws and regulations pertaining to paroled persons. This is the only reasonable construction of the language that they \u201cshall be supervised as if on parole----\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b. As the trial court observed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the Parole Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59b, prohibits the use of a CDS by a person subject to its terms. It requires that each person, subject to its terms,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">agree, as evidenced by his signature to abide by specific conditions of parole established by the appropriate board panel which shall be enumerated in writing in a certificate of parole and shall be given to the parolee upon release. Such conditions shah include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee conduct himself in society in compliance with all laws and refrain from committing any crime ... a requirement that the parolee refrain from the use, possession or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or imitation controlled dangerous substance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59b]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11, entitled \u201cCommunity Supervision for Life,\u201d provided even more direct notice of illegality to defendant. This regulation, which effectuates the purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">The special sentence of community supervision for life shall commence pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4(b) upon the completion of the sentence imposed pursuant to the Code of Criminal Justice, N.J.S.A. 2C:1-1 et seq. An offender serving a special sentence of community supervision for life shall be supervised by the Division of Parole as if on parole and subject to any special conditions established by the appropriate Board panel and to the following general conditions. The offender shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">1. Obey all laws and ordinances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">10. Refrain from the purchase, use, possession, distribution or administration of any narcotic or controlled dangerous substance, controlled dangerous substance analog, imitation controlled dangerous substance or any paraphernalia related to such substances except as prescribed by a physician;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">13. Submit to drug or alcohol testing at any time as directed by the assigned parole officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">18. Permit the assigned parole officer to visit the offender at any time at home or elsewhere and permit confiscation of any contraband observed in plain view by the parole officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59b and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 serve to accomplish the legislative purpose behind <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b. Moreover, the CSL conditions defendant agreed to upon his release were mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59b. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>statute provided defendant with sufficient notice of the illegality of his conduct and is not unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We next consider defendant\u2019s contentions that the Legislature failed to: (1) define the \u201cspecial sentence\u201d created by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b, (2) define the fourth-degree offense of violating conditions of CSL, and (3) delegate to any specific governmental agency the authority to promulgate the conditions of CSL, and that as a result the Parole Board, an agency of the Department of Corrections within the Executive Branch, unconstitutionally assumed rule-promulgating authority. In the alternative,, defendant contends that in the event the statutes and regulation implicitly authorize the Parole Board to administer the conditions of CSL, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b is still unconstitutional because constraints on the Parole Board\u2019s discretion are lacking. He asserts that this constitutes a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendant\u2019s first contention, primarily addressed above, is without merit. It ignores the correlation between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b and the CSL conditions set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11. As the State correctly contends, these conditions \u201cmirror ... the statutory and administrative regulations governing parole.\u201d Additionally, it disregards our determination that in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b the Legislature vested the Parole Board with supervisory authority over those persons subject to CSL. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 92, 775 A.2d 727 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>207, 785 A.2d 435 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Finally, defendant argues that the Legislature\u2019s delegation of authority over persons subject to CSL violates the doctrine of separation of powers. This doctrine is set forth in the New Jersey Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">The powers of the government shall be divided among three distinct branches, the legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons belonging to or constituting one branch shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as expressly provided in this Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\"><em>[N.J. Const, </em>art. III, \u00b6 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The purpose of the separation of powers is to create a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government. <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 370, 375 A.2d 607 (1977). It is not intended, however, to create an absolute division of powers among the three branches of government, thereby preventing cooperative action among them. <em>Ibid. </em>Only when the challenged statute impairs the integrity among the branches should the doctrine\u2019s effect on a branch\u2019s constitutional limits be recognized. <em>Bullet Hole, Inc. v. Dunbar, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 574, 763 A.2d 295 (App.Div.2000). We have observed that \u201c[t]he separation of powers prevents any one branch from aggregating unchecked power, which might lead to oppression and despotism.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Here, defendant argues that the Parole Board\u2019s promulgation of CSL conditions as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 violates the separation of powers doctrine. Administrative regulations are presumed to be valid. <em>N.J. State League of Municipalities v. Dept. of Community Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999). The party challenging the validity of administrative regulations bears the burden of demonstrating that they are either arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or exceed the agency\u2019s delegated authority. <em>In re Amendment of N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.31, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>531, 543-44, 575 A.2d 481 (1990). The Supreme Court has recognized that a grant of decision-making authority to an agency should be liberally construed in order for the agency to accomplish its statutory mandate and, therefore, \u201ccourts should readily imply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>such incidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 223, 729 A.2d 21 (quoting <em>N.J. Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 562, 384 A.2d 795 (1978)). Accordingly, the determination of an administrative agency is accorded substantial deference and the courts will \u201cact only in those rare circumstances when it is clear that the agency action is inconsistent with its legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Williams v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>102, 108, 561 A.2d 244 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Defendant has failed to show that that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 constitutes an unacceptable incursion on the separation of powers. The Legislature granted authority to the Parole Board to supervise persons subject to CSL in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b. <em>Williams, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92, 775 A.2d 727. Courts should \u201clook beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to the statutory policy sought to be achieved by examining the entire statute in light of its surroundings and objectives.\u201d A.A. <em>Mastrangelo, Inc. v. Commissioner of Dept. of Envtl. Protection, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>666, 683, 449 A.2d 516 (1982). Here, the Legislature\u2019s use of the language \u201cshall be supervised as if on parole\u201d can be reasonably viewed as enabling the executive branch to promulgate rules and regulations to further this purpose. Moreover, we should take into consideration the executive\u2019s \u201cspecialized expertise\u201d in these matters. <em>See League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Defendant\u2019s assertion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b fails to set forth an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d is wide of the mark, as is his reliance upon this Court\u2019s observation in <em>Williams </em>that persons subject to CSL are \u201cnot actually on parole.\u201d As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Cammarata v. Essex County Park Commission, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>404, 410, 140 A.2d 397 (1958), \u201c[i]t is settled beyond controversy that the Legislature may enact statutes setting forth in broad design its intended aims, leaving the detailed implementation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the policy thus expressed to an administrative agency.\u201d Here, the Legislature\u2019s intent to create a policy whereby CSL would mirror the conditions of parole is clear, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b plainly comports with the principle expressed in <em>Cammarata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We do not determine in a factual vacuum whether a violation of the separation of powers doctrine has occurred, but instead must consider the accompanying \u201csurroundings and objectives.\u201d <em>A.A. Mastrangelo, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 683, 449 A.2d 516; <em>New Jersey Guild, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 384 A.2d 795. The Legislature necessarily was fully aware of the Parole Board\u2019s supervisory scheme when it delegated authority to the Board to set forth the conditions of CSL. It follows then that defendant\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b failed to provide the proper guidelines is unpersuasive. In our view, a reasonable interpretation of the legislative purpose behind the statute is that the Legislature took notice of a pre-existing supervisory scheme. In this context, as the State contends, the CSL conditions set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.11 are consistent with the general parole conditions found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-6.4. In short, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4b does not constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and defendant\u2019s contentions to that effect are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> It appears the court was referring to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> The decision whether to quash a grand jury indictment is reserved to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. McCrary, 91 N.J. 132, 144, </em>478 A.2d 339 (1984). It will be reversed only if a clear abuse of discretion has occurred. <em>State v. Warmbrun, 211 N.J.Super. </em>51, 59, 648 A.2d 1153 (App.Div. 1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. 211, </em>658 A.2d 300 (1995). The trial court's authority to dismiss should only be exercised on the clearest and plainest of grounds, and thus an indictment should stand unless it is manifestly deficient or palpably defective. <em>State v. Hogan, 144 N.J. </em>216, 228-29, 676 A.2d 533 (1996). We conclude that defendant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing defendant's indictment to stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
