Robins Co., Inc. (\u201cnew Robins\u201d or \u201cRobins II\u201d), successor through merger and bankruptcy reorganization of A.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Robins Inc. (\u201cold Robins\u201d or \u201cRobins I\u201d), appeals from the Tax Court\u2019s order of February 25, 2002, granting summary judgment to defendant, Director of the Division of Taxation, and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claims for the refund of \u201cnet operating losses\u201d (\u201cNOLs\u201d) that were transferred to plaintiff <em>from </em>the predecessor corporation as part of the bankruptcy reorganization. <em>See A.H. Robins Company, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>20 <em>N.J. Tax </em>338 (2002). Plaintiff argues that it is entitled to the NOLs for the period 1989-1994 because (1) it was \u201ccreated solely to reorganize Robins I and neither changed the Robins I line of business nor brought with it any business of its own,\u201d and (2) this was a \u201csingle entity bankruptcy reorganization\u201d and, therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>523, 659 A.2d 1360 (1995), and its interpretation of the regulation involved in that case, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13, do not apply here. Plaintiff also argues that the regulation of state tax law cannot preclude use of the net loss carryover because \u201cthe Bankruptcy Court ... already determined what had been the central issue in <em>Richard\u2019s </em>\u2014 whether New Jersey law would allow the transfer of NOLs from a company merged out of existence to the merger survivor,\u201d and ordered that the NOLs be transferred to the new Robins.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In its original brief filed on this appeal, plaintiff specifically argued that <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>\u201cdid not address a single entity bankruptcy reorganization\u201d and that <em>\u201cN.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b) is invalid here,\u201d and that \u201cthe Tax Court\u2019s decision contravenes the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s prior plan and order.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>rector responded by indicating that <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>held that the survivor of a corporate merger may not utilize the pre-merger net operating losses of the merged corporation and that the regulation is applicable here notwithstanding the Bankruptcy Court order, that \u201cthere is no preemption because there is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code which explicitly or inferentially indicates a Congressional intent to preempt State tax laws after a reorganization has been concluded, nor does the disallowance of the NOLs conflict with the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, defendant Director insisted that the Bankruptcy Court expressly declined to pass upon state tax court implications of the merger and left that to the state courts. <em>See In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>251 <em>B.R. </em>312, 321-22 (Bankr.E.D.Va.2000). In any event, the defendant argued that the reorganization plan, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, did not address state (as opposed to federal) use of the net operating losses and that New Jersey had no obligation to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings in order to challenge a plan which did not purport to affect the impact of NOLs under state law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">While this appeal was pending, we granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand the matter to the Tax Court for reconsideration after adoption of the Business Tax Reform Act (\u201cBTRA\u201d), <em>P.L. </em>2002, c. 40, which was enacted and became effective on July 2, 2002. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the remand, the Tax Court found that the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5, as part of the BTRA, \u201cmerely codifies that which was the applicable law set forth under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(k)(6), as specifically described by the Supreme Court in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City ... </em>and [as] interpreted in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b),\u201d and made no change to New Jersey law regarding the carryover of NOLs.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In its remand opinion of May 21, 2003, the Tax Court restated and adhered to its original holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">This court determined that the appellant (taxpayer) was not entitled to carry over net operating losses (NOL) for the following reasons: 1) nowhere in New Jersey law does it state that NOL carryovers may be utilized when they emanate from a merged corporation; 2) there is nothing in the United Stales Bankruptcy Code that indicates a Congressional intent to preempt state taxing statutes with regard to post-reorganization income tax liabilities of a non-debtor entity; 3) the case at bar does not fit under the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s exemption provided in 11 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1446(d) that certain transfers made pursuant to a reorganization would be exempt from state taxation; and 4) the Director\u2019s regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b), and the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>523, 659 A.2d 1360 (1995), prohibit the carryover of NOL for use by a corporation other than the corporation which incurred the losses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In the remand opinion, the Tax Court supplemented its original order by additionally holding that, because the new statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5, merely \u201crestates existing law,\u201d and \u201cis not retroactive,\u201d its application is not unconstitutional as applied in this case. For this reason, the court rejected the \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cseparation of powers\u201d argument. The court further concluded there was a \u201crational basis\u201d \u201cto codify existing law\u201d and \u201cto limit NOL carryovers\u201d even if the statute is retroactive. The court also concluded the new Act was not \u201cdirected at the plaintiff or other similarly situated taxpayers, and, therefore, is not special legislation\u201d or violative of the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d doctrine. The Tax Court therefore adhered to its original order granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In its supplemental brief to us, plaintiff relies on its original arguments and further contends \u201cthat the Tax Court erred in failing to hold that: (1) the retroactive enactment of NOL legislation is unconstitutional; (2) the retroactive amendment of the law applicable to this case evidences that prior law did not support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>defendant\u2019s flawed position and (3) plaintiff must be permitted to conduct discovery into the intent of the New Jersey Legislature in adopting retroactive changes to the NOL law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The plaintiff acknowledges that it cannot prevail if the new BTRA controls, which it says \u201ccontains a completely new prohibition on the carryover of NOLs following reorganizations.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that section 33 of the BTRA makes section 27 retroactive to affect this case and that \u201cthe 18 year retroactivity provision found in section 33 must be excised from the BTRA, and section 27 applied prospectively only.\u201d On the premise that the new BTRA is unconstitutional or is otherwise inapplicable, plaintiff asserts that the prior statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(k)(6)(D), did not prohibit NOL carryovers by a surviving corporation following a merger, and that the regulation, which is still in effect,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cannot be deemed applicable or dispositive to prevent them here because here, unlike in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City, </em>the plaintiff did not change the business of Robins I which suffered the NOLs. Generally stated, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(k)(6)(D), there could be no NOL carryover when there was a change in more than 50% of the corporate ownership by sale or redemption of stock and \u201cthe corporation changes the trade or business giving rise to the loss\u201d or \u201cthe corporation was acquired ... for the primary purpose of the use of its net operating loss carryover.\u201d According to plaintiff, the new statute cannot be applied here, the old statute permitted the NOL carryover, and the regulations cannot be utilized to limit or prevent application of the former statute in effect for the tax years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Chapter 40 of the Laws of 2002, the BTRA, amended the Corporation Business Tax Act (\u201cCBTA\u201d). Section 33 of the BTRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>provides that the Act \u201cshall take effect immediately and apply to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, provided however that section 26 shall apply to privilege periods ending after June 30, 1984.\u201d <em>See P.L. </em>2002, c. 40, \u00a7 33; 2002 <em>Session Law Service </em>at 203. While section 33 refers only to section 26 in terms of retroactivity, and not to section 27, which became <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5, the parties refer to the legislative history and, in any event, agree that section 27 was made retroactive. In light of the language of section 27, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5, there can be no doubt of that fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That section, which was added to the CBTA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (k) of section 4 of P.L.1945, c. 162 (C.54:10A-J) or of the federal Internal Revenue Code, including but not limited to 26 U.S.C. s.381 or any successor or equivalent provision, that permits a corporation to use the net operating losses of another for federal income tax purposes following certain transactions, including but not limited to those qualifying as reorganizations under the provisions of subparagraphs (A), (C), (D), (F) or (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 368 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.368, a net operating loss for a privilege period ending after June 30, 1984, may be carried over and allowed as a deduction only by the corporation that sustained the loss; provided however, that in the case of a merger of two or more corporations pursuant to statute of this State or any other jurisdiction, the net operating loss may be carried over only by the corporation that sustained the loss and that is also the surviving corporation following the merger. The net operating loss may not be carried over by a taxpayer that changes its state of incorporation. No net operating loss shall be allowed as a deduction by a corporation resulting from a consolidation pursuant to statute of this State or of any other jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">It is clear that the statute is modeled after <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">[TJhe net operating loss may only be carried over by the actual corporation that sustained the loss. The net operating loss may, however, be carried over by the corporation that sustained the loss and which is the surviving corporation of a statutory merger. The net operating loss may not be carried over by a taxpayer that changes its state of incorporation or is a part of a statutory consolidation. Section 4(k) of the Act defines entire net income in terms of a specific corporate franchise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s disposition of the Supremacy Clause \u2014 preemption issue, substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Roger Kahn\u2019s opinion of February 21, 2002. <em>A.H. Robins Co., Inc., supra, </em>20 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 344-48. We recognize that the Tax Court made no detailed analysis of the plan of reorganization and that the Robins Bankruptcy Court has noted that \u201cthe interpretation and application of State Tax laws\u201d \u201cmust be determined by the State courts,\u201d and that, after so doing, \u201cit will be necessary for those courts to assess whether their respective interpretations of State tax laws, as applied to the NOL, are in conflict with the property rights which Robins II obtained under the Plan and Confirmation Order.\u201d The Bankruptcy Court, upheld by the District Court, further stated that the interpretation and application of State law may ultimately \u201cbe appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d because of the federal jurisdiction \u201cto review the decision of the State taxing authorities to determine whether, in applying State tax law, the taxing authorities properly deferred to the now-incontestable results of the Confirmation Orders and the Plan.\u201d <em>In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., supra, </em>251 <em>B.R. </em>at 321-22. We are satisfied that the Tax Court\u2019s analysis of the Supremacy Clause and preemption issues recognized its proper obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We therefore must decide the state tax law issue involved in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">There is much merit in the Tax Court\u2019s original disposition of the matter under <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b), and notwithstanding the contest as to their application on the merits, there is no dispute that the case can be disposed by reference to them if the new statute would be unconstitutional if applied retroactively or is read to be prospective only. However, the parties agree that if the statute can constitutionally be applied retroactively, the contest will come to an end on statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>grounds, and that other cases await the result. Moreover, the parties also appear to agree that, unless unconstitutional, that statute is now dispositive. Therefore, and because contests on returns now being prepared and processed should be kept to a minimum, and some finality brought to the issue which can affect carryovers on returns for the next several years, we address the statutory issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As already developed, the \u201cBTRA\u201d added a new provision to the CBTA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5, regarding the deduction of net loss carryovers for privilege periods or tax years after June 30,1984, a subject previously limited by the regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.13(b). The first question is whether the new statute and the old regulation are consistent, because if they are, there would be no retroactive change in the law as a result of the new statute, thereby avoiding a question of the constitutionality in terms of its retroactive application to losses which accrued prior to the new enactment. A related question, therefore, is whether <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>controls the interpretation of the regulation as related to the facts of this case because of its impact on the question of retroac-tivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We reject the constitutional attack on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5 and its application to the order under review in this case, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Kahn in his unpublished opinion on the remand proceedings we ordered following adoption of the BTRA, and for the reasons developed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u201cA statute does not operate \u2018retrospectively\u2019 merely because it is applied in a ease arising from conduct antedating the statute\u2019s enactment ... or upsets expectations based in prior law.\u201d <em>Landgrafv. USI Film Products, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>244, 269,114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1483, 1499,128 L.Ed.2d 229, 254-55 (1994). \u201cRather, the court must ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to event completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>at 269-70, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1499, 128 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 254-55. If so, statutes with retroactive provisions are subject to scrutiny under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, par. l.of the New Jersey Constitution, and can be enforced only if supported by a \u201crational basis.\u201d <em>Nobrega v. Edison Glen Associates, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>520, 539, 544, 772 A.2d 368 (2001). Independently, we must determine \u201c[wjhether the affected party relied, to his or her prejudice, .on the law that is now to be changed as a result of the retroactive application of the statute, and whether the consequences of this reliance are so deleterious and irrevocable that it would be unfair to apply the statute retroactively\u201d. <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 523-24, 432 A.2d 80 (1981). <em>See also Nobrega, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 545-46, 772 A.2d 368 (applying the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard); <em>Edgewater Inv. Assoc. v. Borough of Edgewater, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>227, 239, 510 A.2d 1178 (1986) (analyzing the statute under the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City, </em>the Supreme Court held that because <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:5-7.13(b), adopted effective February 3, 1986, was consistent with the provisions of the governing statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(k)(6), as it provided from the time of adoption in 1985, see 140 <em>N.J. </em>at 529, 659 A.2d 1360, \u201cthe regulation applie[d] retroactively to the effective date of the statute\u201d and applied to any tax year commencing after June 30, 1984. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 659 A.2d 1360. Hence, from the effective date of the statute, April 22, 1985 (see <em>id. </em>at 533, 659 A.2d 1360), net operating loss carryovers could be taken only \u201cby the actual corporation that sustained the loss\u201d and not, independently, by one that, as here, \u201cchanges its state of incorporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 659 A.2d 1360; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-5.3(b). While we recognize, as Robins argues, that <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>did not expressly consider the state of incorporation provision of the regulation, we can find nothing in that opinion to suggest that portion of the regulation would be invalid. Moreover, we can find nothing in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City, </em>in which two separate entities were merged and the survivor corporation was not the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that had sustained the pre-merger losses, to suggest, as does Robins, that the result would be different where only one entity existed before the merger or reorganization, and the survivor, a new entity, continued the business of the former corporation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The CBTA, as amended by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5 in 2002, therefore codifies the same rule that applied since the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4(k)(6) in 1985. There is no substantive difference in any of the language, and so long as the interpretation is consistent, there is no legitimate issue of retroactivity which flows from the adoption and application of the amended statute. Hence, there is no constitutional or due process concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Moreover, there is no \u201cvested right\u201d in the old law and no due process problem on that ground, given the \u201crational basis\u201d for any retroactive application, <em>Nobrega, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 772 <em>A.</em>2d 368; <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 620, 608 A.2d 895 (1992); <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 563-70, 494 A.2d 294 (1985), and the regulation in effect during the time of the bankruptcy proceedings which commenced in 1985,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when New Robins was incorporated in 1987, when the bankruptcy plan was approved in 1988, and on the effective date of the reorganization in 1989, <em>see A.H. Robins Co., Inc., supra, </em>20 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 341, 348, provided notice of the impact of New Jersey law. <em>See Richard\u2019s Auto City, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 543, 659 A.2d 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Nor can <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-4.5 be deemed special legislation in violation of art. IV, section 7 par. 9 of the New Jersey Constitution or a violation of the separation of powers clause. <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. III, \u00a7 1; <em>Plant v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>211, 224-27, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1447, 1455-57, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 345-17 (1995); <em>Newark Superior Officers Ass\u2019n v. Newark, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>212, 222-26, 486 A.2d 305 (1985); <em>Vreeland v. Byrne, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>292, 298-301, 370 A.2d 825 (1977). The statute applies to all corporations which seek to carryover net operating losses and not merely to plaintiff and the other corporations whose cases were before the courts at the time of adoption, including those corporations whose appeals have been stayed pending this appeal. Moreover, particularly given the impact of the regulation interpreted in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City </em>and employed by the Tax Court in this ease, it is hard to accept an argument that the statute, enacted over four months after the Tax Court\u2019s adverse decision, was designed to affect this case. <em>See Nobrega, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 538-39, 772 A.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> Plaintiff also argued that \u201cthe Director's concession [in the Tax Court] that the Robins I NOLs were transferred to Robins II leaves no basis for denying deductibility.\" The Director asserts that the concession was for purposes of the summary judgment motion and recognizes that the NOLs were transferred to Robins II and did become its property. <em>See In Re A.H.
