That method replaces \u201cthe past, species, sighting-specific \u2018areas of documentation\u2019 with the species population/habitat complex Landscape Maps.\u201d Under this method, wetlands which contain habitat characteristics that endangered or threatened species use and require for breeding, resting and feeding are classified as wetlands of exceptional.resource value. Builders argues that the governing statute limits identification of wetlands of exceptional value to habitats of present sighted endangered or threatened species or a documented presence of an endangered or threatened species. Therefore, it claims, a method such as the Landscape Project method which broadens the focus of the habitat classification process to encompass not only actual sightings but habitat characteristics needed and required for an endangered or threatened species\u2019 population, exceeds the statutory mandate. We do not view the enabling statute to be so restrictive and affirm DEP\u2019s amendment to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-2.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Prior to enactment of the FWPA, freshwater wetlands in New Jersey were regulated through a permit program administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to section 404 of the \u201cFederal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972\u201d as amended by the \u201cClean Water Act of 1977.\u201d 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344.

It is the category of \u201cexceptional resource value\u201d freshwater wetlands that is at issue here. As defined by the FWPA such wetlands are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Those which are present habitats for threatened or endangered species, or those which are documented habitats for threatened or endangered species which remain suitable for breeding, resting, or feeding by these species during the normal period these species would use the habitat.

The FWPA does not define habitat. The concept of habitat is rather broad. As normally defined habitat is \u201cthe environment in which an organism or biological population usu[ally] lives or grows.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary, </em>497-98 (1999). A documented habitat is one for which DEP \u201cmakes a finding that the habitat remains suitable for use by the specific documented threatened and endangered species, based upon information available to it----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7(a)(2). <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.4(b)(2),(3); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-1.4. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.4(c) currently provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">[DEP] identifies present or documented habitat for threatened or endangered species for purposes of <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A 2.4(b) ] using the Landscape Project method, which focuses on habitat areas required to support local populations of threatened or endangered wildlife species.

It was then assumed that each individual species sighted was located in the middle of its home range. As a result of that assumption, DEP mapped as habitat for that species a polygonal-shaped area surrounding the location of the sighted species. This methodology mapped polygons around each sighted species as habitat, regardless of whether the entire mapped area contained the vegetation, topography, water resources, or other landscape features that the species actually would use or require. For example, by using this methodology, if a threatened or endangered species were sighted at a particular location, the resulting habitat map would include that location and its environs, regardless of whether the environs were forested, developed, paved or in agricultural use, and regardless of whether these land covers and uses would provide suitable or unsuitable habitat for the sighted species. Thus, the prior mapping was not based on the particular habitat needs of the sighted species, but only on the species\u2019 given location at a particular point in time. In addition, the former mapping method focused only on each individual species sighted or on its immediate family, rather than on the habitat needs of the species in its entirety. This mapping method protected random, fragmented habitat patches, rather than the contiguous habitat area that many threatened and endangered species require for long-term survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In contrast, the Landscape Project method identifies as suitable habitats, sighted areas and those contiguous areas which populations of threatened and endangered species can be expected to use. Thus, the Landscape Project methodology uses species sightings in conjunction with their known habitat characteristics, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>focusing upon actual land cover and land use to generate habitat mapping. As explained by DEP in its 2002 manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">In the first edition of the FWPA Protocols (DEP 1995), the Department largely focused on protecting only those habitats known to be occupied and suitable for use by an individual or local population of a particular species. Suitable habitat outside of the estimated area of use by these animals was not considered to be a \u201cdocumented habitat\u201d and therefore not considered to be endangered or threatened species habitat whether or not that habitat was contiguous with the \u201cdocumented\u201d habitat. At that time, the Department felt that this strategy was the best applied approach to (1) ensure appropriate natural resource protection, and (2) provide for consistency and predictability in the regulatory process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">However, changes to New Jersey\u2019s landscape over the last 10-15 years and the evolution of landscape based habitat protection theories have led the Department to re-evaluate this protection strategy. The rapid suburbanization of our landscape has led to the loss and degradation of critically important wildlife habitats, and the fragmentation and isolation of the habitats that remain. Many rare species populations require large contiguous blocks of habit to survive. Small patches of fields, forests and wetlands interspersed with development provide habitat for some common species, but do not provide the necessary habitat for the long-term protection of most of our endangered or threatened animal species. Examples of these conditions include the loss of 40 percent of the remaining critical migratory bird stopover habitat on the lower third of the Cape May Peninsula and approximately 50 percent of the slate\u2019s bog turtle habitat during the last three decades. In addition, recent studies conducted to assess the status of the state-listed raptors in south Jersey have raised questions about the long-term stability of their populations (Sutton and Dowdell 2001). As a result, the Department conducted a re-assessment of its regulatory efforts under the FWPA to see if the above objectives were being met and determined that a change in approach was necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">To this end, the Department sought to establish a more population driven parameter of habitat protection which would best ensure the continued, long-term existence of a particular documented species or population in an identified wetland habitat. As a solution, the Department has decided to replace the past, species, sighting-specific \u201careas of documentation\u201d with the species population/habitat complex Landscape Maps to improve upon both the predictability and quality of the habitat protection provided under the FWPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The Landscape Project method, then, provides more flexibility in the classification process by broadening the field of inquiry beyond \u201csighting-specific\u201d areas to contiguous wetlands containing the sighted species\u2019 habitat characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Agency regulations are presumed valid and are accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>New Jersey State League of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Municipalities v.

Deference to an administrative agency is especially appropriate when new and innovative legislation is being put into practice, or when the agency has been delegated discretion to determine the specialized and technical procedures for its tasks. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:26B, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>442, 450-51, 608 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>288 (1992); <em>Newark Firemen\u2019s Mut.

The statute does not restrict classification of such wetlands to habitats in which an endangered or threatened species either has presently been sighted or has been sighted in the past. Its focus is upon the habitats of such species and affords DEP broad discretion to document such habitats. \u201c[A] documented habitat\u201d exists if DEP \u201cmakes a finding that the habitat remains suitable for use by the\u201d threatened or endangered species. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7(a)(2). The Landscape Project method broadens the inquiry to include habitats in which there have been actual sightings or other physical evidence of an endangered or threatened species, and contiguous wetlands which contain the natural characteristics that make it suitable for that species to populate. The evident premise is that endangered or threatened species are not stationary. As DEP has found, \u201c[m]any rare species populations require large contiguous blocks of habitat to survive.\u201d It is difficult to quarrel with DEP\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he rapid suburbanization of our landscape has led to the loss and degradation of critically important wildlife habitats, and the fragmentation and isolation of the habitats that remain.\u201d Moreover, Builders does not dispute DEP\u2019s examples of a 40 percent loss, of \u201cthe remaining critical migratory bird stopover habitat on the lower third of the Cape May peninsula\u201d and \u201capproximately 50 percent of the State\u2019s bog turtle habitat.\u201d DEP\u2019s effort to adopt a more protective approach through the Landscape Project method is neither inconsistent with the governing statute, unsupported by the record, nor arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\"> Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7(a)(1), freshwater wetlands of exceptional resource value are also \"[t]hose which discharge into FW-1 waters and FW-2 trout production (TP) waters and their tributaries.\u201d These type of exceptional resource wetlands are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\"> The Landscape Project method uses satellite imagery to determine habitat type.
