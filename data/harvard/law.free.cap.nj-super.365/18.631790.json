Defendant was convicted twenty-three minutes later. Because the juror\u2019s empathy for the defendant was not a circumstance which rendered the juror either ill or otherwise unable to continue deliberating, the trial judge was not permitted to remove her from the jury. As a result, the judgment of conviction will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d, and conspiracy, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2. He was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment subject, also, to the No Early Release Act. The mandatory fines, assessments and penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">Defendant has raised two issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>I. SINCE THE JUROR EXCUSED DURING DELIBERATIONS WAS NEITHER ILL NOR UNABLE TO CONTINUE UNDER <em>R. </em>1:8-2(d), AND THE JURORS HAD ALREADY REACHED AN ADVANCED STAGE OP DELIBERATIONS, HER REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT WITH AN ALTERNATE JUROR VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND A FAIR TRIAL BY AN IMPARTIAL JURY. <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMENDS. V, VI, XIV; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>(1947) ART. I, PARS. 1, 9,10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">II. BECAUSE THE MITIGATING FACTORS FAR OUTWEIGHED THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS IN THIS CASE, AND BECAUSE A DOWNGRADED SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE, THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING TO SENTENCE DEFENDANT AS A SECOND-DEGREE OFFENDER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Because we conclude that the removal of a juror during deliberations was erroneous, the judgment of conviction will be reversed. As a result, we need not reach the second point urged by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">After three days of trial, the jury heard the summations of counsel and the trial judge\u2019s instructions, which included an admonishment against permitting passion or prejudice to enter into their deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">As jurors, you are to weigh the evidence calmly and without any passion, prejudice, bias, favor, or sympathy of any kind to either side. As you know, any influences that may be caused by those emotional responses to the case deprive both the State and the defense of what you promised in the beginning; that is, a fair and impartial decision based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">At 11:38 a.m. the jury began its deliberations. A recess for lunch was taken from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Soon after resuming deliberations, the jury forwarded a note to the trial judge indicating that one juror \u201chas the emotions to affect judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The trial judge called for the juror to come out of the deliberating room to ascertain the nature of the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">THE COURT: Come on over. We had a note that there was some problem. I didn\u2019t know what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-13\">THE JUROR: I thought I could make this decision without emotion, but I can\u2019t. THE COURT: You don\u2019t feel you can make a decision here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-14\">THE JUROR: I can\u2019t agree with what they want. I can\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-15\">THE COURT: You are not required to agree with what they want. Nobody is, you know, forcing you to agree with what they want. Everybody wants you to vote your own decision in the case. Is there some other problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-16\">THE JUROR: I\u2019m confused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>THE COURT: You are confused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">THE JUROR: So we have to have a unanimous decision, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a criminal case, and in civil cases they have majority vote. In criminal cases it has to be a unanimous decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">THE JUROR: It\u2019s a very emotional thing for me. I am a black woman. I have children [defendant\u2019s] age. I \u2014 I just can\u2019t make a decision to put him in jail. I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t do that Sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">THE COURT: Well, you understand what the jury charge was; that you decide the case based on the facts and you apply the law to the facts. Now, is it just that you feel that you have kids his age and it\u2019s difficult for you to make the decision on the facts, or what is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">THE JUROR: I can\u2019t separate all the other options from the facts. You know, he\u2019s a young kid. He did something really stupid, I understand that. Yes, he did something wrong, I understand that. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be any room in what we\u2019ve been asked to do to give the kid a break. I just, you know \u2014 I see another black man going to jail for something really stupid when there is some really serious crimes out there. They are just walking around lolligagging, you\u2019re free, you know, doing whatever. Like I said, it\u2019s a very emotional thing. I just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">THE COURT: Well, certainly none of us could advise you how to vote. You have to vote how you choose to vote. Nobody here is telling you to vote one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">THE JUROR: So what are you telling me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">THE COURT: Well, what I\u2019m telling you is that when we gave you \u2014 when we talked to you about jury selection, we indicated that you had to decide the case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">THE JUROR: And I had no idea I was going to have this difficulty, believe you me. It hit me by surprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-14\">THE JUROR: I don\u2019t consider myself the emotional type. I am really embarrassed to be standing here like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-15\">THE COURT: That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s all right. That\u2019s all right. We did indicate that you can\u2019t decide the case based on bias, favor, or sympathy to one side or <em>the </em>other. We did indicate that to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-16\">Wiih regard to this, as far as the sentence is concerned, if the defendant is found guilty, the sentence will be up to the Court, and the Court at that time will listen to both attorneys and the defendant and listen to everybody\u2019s position, and then consult the statute to figure out what sentence would be appropriate. So if you\u2019re focusing on what the sentence is going to be, none of us know what the sentence is going to be at this point. We would have to wait if he\u2019s found guilty, <em>go </em>through the presentence report, listen to the arguments of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-17\">The trial judge then excused the juror from side bar and discussed the situation with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Both counsel consented to an instruction which would remind the juror that she had taken an oath to decide the matter without passion, prejudice, bias or sympathy but that she also was free to vote her own mind. The juror was so instructed. However, in response to the judge\u2019s inquiry as to whether she felt she could comply, the juror shook her head in the negative. <em>As </em>a result, the judge correctly resumed his inquiry as to the juror\u2019s state of mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t feel you can?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">THE JUROR: (Shakes head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">THE COURT: Can you explain that to me a little further, aside from what you already said? I\u2019ve heard that part. It\u2019s just too emotional for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">THE JUROR: Essentially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">THE COURT: Is there anything that we can do to assist you in your deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">THE JUROR: I don\u2019t think so. I know \u2014 you know, I just \u2014 I just can\u2019t see where this kid is going to get a break, that\u2019s all. I just \u2014 you know, if everybody else wants to send him to jail, let them do it, but I can\u2019t be responsible for that. I just \u2014 I won\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">THE COURT: So I take it it\u2019s not a decision with regard to the facts and the evidence and the proofs in the case; it\u2019s more of an emotional response with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">THE JUROR: Yes, it is. I said that. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">THE COURT: Okay. And you don\u2019t feel going back in there, continuing deliberations\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">THE JUROR: They are not \u2014 no, I don\u2019t see \u2014 how is that going to change anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">THE COURT: I am just asking. I don\u2019t know. I am not in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">THE COURT: I take it as far as the facts of the ease are concerned, setting aside the emotional aspect of the case, but strictly the facts, I take it that you participated in those deliberations and you\u2019ve solved the facts, dilemma, for yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-16\">THE JUROR: Pretty much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">The juror was asked to step aside and the trial judge again discussed the matter with counsel. The prosecutor argued that the juror should be excused because her emotional reaction and sympathy for the defendant was causing her to disregard her oath. Defense counsel argued that the juror was feeling pressure from the other jurors because they apparently were not considering any other \u201coptions\u201d and because a vote was likely taken where she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the only person voting the opposite way. Defense counsel argued that the juror should remain on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Following a short recess, the trial judge again called the juror back to side bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">THE COURT: It\u2019s just a couple more questions because we\u2019ve been talking about it trying to figure out what to do with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">With regard to the problem in continuing deliberations, with regard to that, you\u2019ve indicated to me that it would be fruitless; you would be unable to go back and continue delberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">THE JUROR: Expand on that. I mean, what do you mean by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">THE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">THE JUROR: I would \u2014 I could go back, but I am gonna \u2014 not gonna change my mind or nothing that is going to make me feel any different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, let me just ask this question. If you went back into deliberations, do you feel that you would be talking about the facts and the evidence in the case or it\u2019s just this emotional aspect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">THE JUROR: No. No facts. Ut \u2014 uh. I mean, the facts are what they are. That wouldn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not going to change how I am feeling one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">THE COURT: Okay. Are any of the other jurors putting any pressure on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">THE JUROR: No, no, absolutely not. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">THE COURT: They are not pressuring you at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">THE JUROR: No, no, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">THE COURT: So do I have it right, that as far as the decision on this case is concerned, that it\u2019s just down to the emotional aspect; that you are not willing to vote the way that you would otherwise vote because you have this identity with the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-16\">THE JUROR: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-17\">THE COURT: Other than that, you would vote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-18\">THE JUROR: Vote what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-19\">THE COURT: With the other jurors I take it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-20\">THE JUROR: Say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-21\">THE COURT: But for the emotional factor, would this case already be resolved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">THE JUROR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-22\">THE COURT: Okay. So, basically if I have it right, what is preventing you from finishing out deliberations is your emotional involvement with the case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-23\">THE JUROR: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">Once more the trial judge heard the views of counsel. The prosecutor argued that the juror was not separating her emotions from the facts or adhering to her oath and should be discharged. Defense counsel objected to removal. The trial judge decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>remove the juror. He based this determination on the juror\u2019s \u201cemotional response\u201d to the facts and circumstances of the ease, summarizing her quandary in the following way: \u201c[S]he is a black woman and this is a young black man, and she\u2019s not going to be involved in a case that would send another young black man to prison.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s ruling did not include a finding that the juror\u2019s emotional feelings were rendering her ill or were otherwise prohibiting her from continuing to deliberate and we would observe that the juror\u2019s statements, which have been quoted at length, would not support such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">An alternate was selected to replace the removed juror and the trial judge correctly charged the entire jury that they should begin their deliberations anew. Twenty-three minutes later, the reconstituted jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"><em>R. </em>1:8 \u2014 2(d)(1) provides the framework for determining whether a juror may be removed once deliberations have begun:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">[I]f at any time after submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or is discharged by the court because of illness or other inability to continue, the court may direct the clerk to draw the name of an alternate juror to take the place of the juror who is deceased or discharged____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Our Supreme Court has held that a careful application of this rule does not offend the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury. <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 406, 388 A.2d 218 (1978). The Court has, however, emphasized that the \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cillness\u201d standards \u201care narrow,\u201d and, while the \u201cinability-to-continue\u201d standard is \u201csomewhat vague and broad,\u201d it too must be \u201cconstrued and applied ... narrowly.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>151, 163, 793 A.2d 594 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">To remove a juror under the \u201cinability-to-continue\u201d standard, the Court has declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">the record [must] adequately establish ... that the juror suffers from an inability to function that is personal and unrelated to the juror\u2019s interaction with'the other jury members. If a court suspects that the problems with the juror are due to interactions with other jurors, the court should instruct the jury to resume deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">[Id. at 164, 793 A.2d 594, quoting <em>State v. Hightower, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>239, 254, 680 A.2d 649 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>This same approach was adopted in <em>State v. Trent, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 384 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>251, 398 A.2d 1271 (1979). While the Supreme Court, as observed above, has since described the precise standard to be followed in such situations, <em>Trent </em>has particular relevance here, since the facts are similar and yet exhibit one particular and highly relevant distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In <em>Trent, </em>we described the boundaries of illness and \u201cinability-to-continue,\u201d for substitution of an alternate juror during deliberations, in terms similar to those later adopted in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Hightower:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Because they relate exclusively to the personal situation of the juror himself and not to his interaction with the other jurors or with the case itself, <em>they </em>are ordinarily not circumstances having the capacity to affect the substance or the course of the deliberations. Hence the continuation of the trial with a substituted alternate is in these circumstances no way violative of defendant\u2019s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury. In this respect the \u201cunable to continue\u201d standard is much narrower than the concept of good cause requiring the discharge of prospective jurors before trial commences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">[157 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 239, 384 A.2d 888.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">In <em>Trent, </em>after approximately six hours of deliberations, a note was sent from a juror to the trial judge stating \u201cI am getting sick.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 384 A.2d 888. Both counsel and the juror were brought into the judge\u2019s chambers. In response to the judge\u2019s question of \u201c[w]hat is wrong,\u201d the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">THE JUROR: <em>I just feel nervous. I have a headache and everything. </em>I\u2019m just I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">THE COURT: You are just nervous and have a headache?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">THE JUROR: 7 <em>have a headache and feel like </em>7 <em>want to spit up, just too emotional</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">THE COURT: All right. You feel if you took a break or something you\u2019ll feel better?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">THE JUROR: When I close my eyes I guess I\u2019m just too easily get emotional, you know, when children is involved because I have children myself and it just hard for me to make a decision. I\u2019m just all upset. I tried, you know, to go through with it but just because every time I see him sitting there I can picture my son sitting there. He\u2019s about 17 and it is just too much. I can\u2019t take no more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\"><em>[Id. </em>at 235-36, 384 A.2d 888 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The trial court in <em>Trent, </em>against the urging of defense counsel, found the juror to be \u201cphysically and emotionally disturbed\u201d and excused her for good cause. <em>Id. </em>at 236-37, 384 A.2d 888. On appeal, we deemed the trial court\u2019s findings regarding physical and emotional distress sufficient to warrant excusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">That her disabling distress was engendered by her identification of defendant with her own son did not make it any less incapacitating insofar as her ability to function was concerned than if the cause thereof had been totally unrelated to the trial. Nor it is argued that either her distress or its cause tainted or infected the jury as a whole, and we are unable to perceive that it in fact did. In short, <em>it was not the fact of her bias which resulted in her removal from the jury but rather the fact that her bias incapacitated her.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 240, 384 A.2d 888 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\"><em>Trent </em>is similar to the present case in that the juror in <em>Trent, </em>like the removed juror here, empathized with the defendant as she would have for one of her own children and because both jurors described their quandary as emotional. The difference, however, is that the <em>Trent </em>juror described her emotions as having caused physical illness. No such claim was made here by the removed juror. When the trial judge inquired about the juror\u2019s ability to continue deliberating, the juror acknowledged her ability to do so, insisting only that she would be unable to change her feelings about the matter: \u201cI would \u2014 I could go back, but I am gonna \u2014 not gonna change my mind or nothing that is going to make me feel any different.\u201d This difference between <em>Trent </em>and the case at hand compels a result different from <em>Trent. </em>Whereas <em>Trent </em>found no abuse of discretion in the removal of the juror, we conclude that the juror here did not suggest any inability on her part to continue to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The trial judge here did not find that the juror\u2019s emotional quandary caused an illness as in <em>Trent </em>or that the reasons for excusing her were personal to the juror. Instead, the record demonstrates that the juror only exhibited an apparent inability to allow her intellect to overcome her sympathy and bias for the defendant. Accordingly, <em>R. </em>1:8-2 provided no basis for her removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The juror\u2019s feelings may have interfered with her ability to follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions but they did not constitute a valid basis for removing her from the jury. In such circumstances, the trial judge could have declared a mistrial, <em>Hightower, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 262, 680 A.2d 649; <em>Trent, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 384 A.2d 888, or allowed deliberations to continue. Removal of the juror, however, was not authorized in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
