We disagree and find no constitutional infirmity in the provision in issue, the clear language of which, we hold, reaches defendant\u2019s conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Defendant Mohammad Saleem Malik and others were indicted for second-degree conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4A-17(c), N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c) (count one); third-degree Medicaid fraud, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-17(c), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-7 (count two); and second-degree misconduct by a corporate official, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-17(e), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c). Evidence before the grand jury established that defendant, his brother, co-defendant, Iftikhar Hussain, and another co-defendant, Abdul Hafeez Raja, owned and controlled Venditti Clinical Laboratory, Inc. (V.C. Lab), a Medicaid provider that performed diagnostic tests on blood samples and received reimbursement from the government-funded health care program for these services. The proofs also demonstrated that for nine months in 1994 and 1995, defendant and co-defendants operated V.C. Lab in furtherance of a kickback scheme. Specifically, defendant and his cohorts used payments received from the Medicaid program for performing diagnostic blood tests to fund kickbacks to medical clinics and laboratories that provided blood samples to V.C. Lab for testing, in exchange for continuing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>submit samples. The kickbacks totaled $346,980, consisting of $233,595 to fictitious accounts operated by Zahid Ilyas, a cooperating witness, and $113,385 to King Consultants (King) a company owned and operated by two other cooperating witnesses, Shakir Siddiqui and Mohammed Arif, who, through King, owned Specialty Clinical Laboratory and Precise Medical Laboratory, both suppliers of blood specimens to V.C. Lab. There was no competent proof, however, that defendant held any corporate office in V.C. Lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Defendant moved pre-trial to dismiss count three and also to dismiss the part of count one that related to count three, on the ground that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c) did not apply to him because it covers only corporate officers and directors, and he held neither position. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Eventually, defendant and the State entered into a plea agreement wherein defendant would plead guilty to counts two and three in exchange for the State\u2019s recommendation to dismiss count one; to treat the second-degree crime alleged in count three as a third-degree offense for purposes of sentencing; and to impose concurrent \u201cflat sentences\u201d on each count without a parole bar and a fine not to exceed $5,000. Defendant also agreed \u201cto be debarred from Medicaid and related programs for 5 years.\u201d Moreover, defendant reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">At the plea hearing, defendant admitted the occurrence of the activities on which the indictment was based and his participation in them. In response to the inquiry \u201cdid you use[,] control[,] or operate\u201d the corporation in those illegal activities, defendant acknowledged that he had. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Consistent with the plea bargain, defendant was sentenced to a five-year term on count three and a concurrent three-year term on count two. Appropriate fees and a $5,000 fine were also imposed. The judgment of conviction also recited that \u201c[d]efendant is barred from any activity in [the] Medicaid Program\u201d without indicating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>however, that the debarment period, according to the plea agreement, was limited to five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant now appeals, repeating his argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9 imposes liability only on corporate officers and directors, and adding new claims that the statute is unconstitutional, all issues of first impression in this State. He also asserts errors in sentencing. Specifically, the issues presented for our consideration are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">I. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9 REQUIRES AN OFFENDER THEREOF TO BE A CORPORATE OFFICIAL: AS DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WAS NOT A CORPORATE OFFICIAL, HIS CONVICTION UNDER THAT STATUTE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">II.

Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., Inc., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>548, 556, 404 A.2d 625, 629 (1979) (quoting <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 <em>U.S. </em>470, 485, 37 <em>S.Ct. </em>192,194, 61 <em>L.Ed. </em>442, 452 (1917)). The statute in issue here, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9, reads relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">Misconduct by corporate official</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay0\">A <em>person </em>is guilty of a crime when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>a.

It did not change the title when it amended the statute three years later by changing the term \u201cstock corporation\u201d in subsections (a) and (b) to \u201ccorporation\u201d and by adding subsection (c), <em>L. </em>1981, <em>c. </em>290, \u00a7 24, the provision in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">Our function, of course, is to ascertain and implement the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>State v. Sutton, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>471, 479, 625 A.2d 1132, 1136 (1993). Where the statute is clear and unambiguous, the task is simple enough. On this score, a principal canon of statutory construction is that the words and phrases in the statute must be given their generally accepted and ordinary meaning, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1; <em>GE Solid State v. Dir., Div\u2019n of Tax\u2019n, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>298, 307-08, 625 A.2d 468, 472-73 (1993); <em>Fahey v. City of Jersey City, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>103, 107, 244 A.2d 97, 99 (1968); <em>Kingsley v. Hawthorne Fabrics, Inc., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>521, 526, 197 A.2d 673, 675-76 (1964); <em>Safeway Trails, Inc. v. Furman, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>467, 478, 197 A.2d 366, 371, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>14, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>144, 13 L.Ed.2d 84 (1964); <em>State v. Joas, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>179, 187, 168 A.2d 27, 31 (1961), and must be examined not only in their own contextual setting, but in relation to surrounding provisions in the statutory scheme. <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 536, 641 A.2d 257, 266 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 L.Ed.2d 351 (1994). \u201cThere is a need to keep in view ... the structure of the statute, and the relation, physical and logical, between its several parts.\u201d <em>Duparquet Co. v. Evans, </em>297 <em>U.S. </em>216, 218, 56 <em>S.Ct. </em>412, 413, 80 <em>LEd. </em>591, 593 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Guided by these principles, the meaning of the provision in issue, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(e), is plain and clearly encompasses defendant\u2019s conduct as an owner, rather than an officer or director, of the corporation. The statute consists of a general introductory clause \u2014 \u201ca person is guilty of a crime when\u201d \u2014 and three independent, free-standing, but parallel subsections, each defining separate offenses. The first type of offense involves the dissipation of corporate assets and is made applicable only to directors because the criminal proscription involves breaches of corporate responsibilities peculiarly entrusted and reserved to directors. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(a). Thus, to be criminally liable, defendant\u2019s action must be taken in his or her capacity as a director, such as concurring in a board of directors vote, and must involve either the making of an unlawful dividend; paying the capital stock of the corporation to a stockholder in a manner not provided by law; discounting or receiving evidence of a debt in payment of an installment of capital stock called in and required to be paid or with the purpose of providing the means of making such a payment; receiving or discounting any evidence of indebtedness with a purpose of enabling a stockholder to withdraw part of the money paid in by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>on the stock; or applying any portion of corporate funds, directly or indirectly, to purchase its own stock in a manner not provided by law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(a)(1) to (5). As noted, the activities proscribed in paragraphs 1-5 of subsection (a) involve violations of corporate duties uniquely performed by company directors. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>14A:7-2 (number and classes of shares are set by directors); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:7-14 (dividends are declared by directors); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:10-10 (directors must approve sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all of corporation\u2019s assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The second type of corporate offense delineated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:21-9 involves the improper issuance or sale of corporate stock and may be committed by either a director or an officer of the corporation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(b). The fraud must be perpetrated by one of two methods. The first is the issuing, participating in the issuing or voting to issue an increase in the capital stock beyond the amount of capital stock duly authorized by law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(b)(1). The second method is the selling, agreeing to sell or being directly interested in the sale of any share of corporate stock unless the defendant is the actual owner of the share at the time of the sale or agreement, or unless the sale is by or on behalf of an underwriter or dealer in connection with a bona fide public offering. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(b)(2). As with subsection (a), subsection (b) addresses conduct that can only be performed by corporate officials. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>14A:6-15 (officers manage the corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In sharp contrast to the itemized listing of proscribed activities in subsections (a) and (b), the 1981 amendment added a third category of offense, generally and broadly prohibiting the use, control or operation of a corporation for the furtherance or promotion of any criminal object. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c). And unlike subsections (a) and (b), whose proscriptions apply exclusively to the categories of corporate official specifically designated therein, subsection (c) uses the non-specific term \u201che\u201d, which, because of the very structure of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9, has clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>obvious reference to the word \u201cperson\u201d in the statute\u2019s introductory clause, defined elsewhere to include both corporations and individuals such as defendant herein. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Thus, subsection (c) expands the statutory reach to prohibit <em>all </em>\u201cuses\u201d of a corporation for a criminal purpose, and not just those objects enumerated in subsections (a) and (b) that are exclusively reserved to officers and/or directors. Obviously then, subsection (c) applies to all persons, such as owners and majority shareholders in a position to use, control or operate the corporation, because the more limiting interpretation suggested by defendant, to apply only to officers and directors, would render subsections (a) and (b) redundant, and therefore meaningless. Of course, it is not proper statutory construction to reach a result which would render a provision completely meaningless. <em>See, e.g., Gabin v. Skyline Cabana Club, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>550, 555, 258 A.2d 6, 9 (1969). Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of the limiting references to officers and directors that it carefully employed in subsections (a) and (b) demonstrates that it did not intend to limit subsection (e) in the same way. <em>GE, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 307-08, 625 A.2d at 472-73. In other words, if the Legislature intended subsection (c) to require that the offender be an officer or director, it would have said so. We do not presume the Legislature intended something other than what it expressed by way of its plain language. <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 495, 527 A.2d 379, 383 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, namely, that the canon of statutory construction known as <em>ejusdem generis </em>requires us to read the limitation at the beginning of subsection (a) or (b) into subsection (c), is without merit. Granted, that canon instructs that \u2018\u201cwhen general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only the objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stryker v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>138, 155-56, 773 A.2d 674, 684 (2001) (quoting <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 584, 695 A.2d 236, 246 (1997)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>However, the canon applies only where the Legislature\u2019s \u201c \u2018expression is of doubtful meaning,\u2019 \u201d and it is to be avoided \u201c \u2018where the legislative design is expressed in plain and unambiguous terms\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 156, 773 A.2d at 684 (quoting <em>Edwards v. Mayor of Moonachie, </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>17, 23, 68 A.2d 744, 747 (1949)), as is the case here. Furthermore, the canon may not be used \u201c \u2018to defeat the legislative purpose revealed by the provision in its entirety, giving to all the terms their normal sense and <em>significance----\u2019\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 159, 773 A.2d at 687 (quoting <em>Edwards, supra, </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>at 23, 68 A.2d at 747). Here, the very structure of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9, with its introductory clause and three succeeding separate but parallel provisions, strongly indicate that subsection (c), which was added by independent amendment, does not \u201cfollow\u201d subsections (a) and (b) in the subordinate sense that the canon requires. Rather, the proximate language to which the term \u201che\u201d in subsection (c) is subordinate is clearly the word \u201cperson\u201d in the introductory clause whose definition broadly encompasses defendant herein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Admittedly, the structure of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9 also includes a title \u2014 \u201cMisconduct of Corporate Official\u201d \u2014 to which defendant ascribes dispositive significance in the statute\u2019s construction. We disagree. The title of a statute, more properly called its \u201cheadnote\u201d, is deemed not \u201cto be a part of\u2019 it, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-6, and the Legislature repeated this principle in its enactment of the Penal Code. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-1(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Even when the headnote is included in the text of the law as passed by the Legislature, it is not deemed dispositive. <em>State v. Brown, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>656, 661-62, 458 A.2d 165, 168 (Law Div.1983). In <em>Brown, supra, </em>where the phrase in issue appeared in a headnote that was included in the text of the statute when enacted, <em>id. </em>at 661, 458 A.2d at 168, the court nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>determined the statute\u2019s meaning and scope on an analysis of the legislative history and out-of-state decisions construing \u201csubstantially identical\u201d statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 662-74, 458 A.2d at 168-76. Here, of course, the descriptive heading does not control the statute\u2019s interpretation, <em>see, e.g., Chalmers v. Chalmers, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>186, 194-95, 320 A.2d 478, 483 (1974); N. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction, </em>sections 18:11, p. 95 (6th Edition 2000), especially since the headnote was not enacted simultaneously with the amended statutory provision in issue. <em>Cf Brown, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 661, 458 A.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We also recognize that penal statutes are to be strictly construed, <em>State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 17-18, 519 A.2d 322, 323-24 (1987); <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>630, 640,477 A.2d 318, 323 (1984); <em>In re Suspension of License of Marco, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>25, 36, 414 A.2d 1339,1344-45 (1980); however, \u201c \u2018th[is] rule ... does not mean that the manifestations of the Legislature\u2019s intention should be disregarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ferencsik, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 231, 741 A.2d 101, 102 (App.Div.1999) (quoting <em>State v. Thomas, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 518, 731 A.2d 532, 536 (App.Div.1999)). <em>See also State v. Carreker, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>100, 115, 796 A.2d 847, 855-56 (2002); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>292, 298, 146 A.2d 209, 212 (1958). Primary regard must be given to the fundamental purpose for which the legislation was enacted. <em>State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>179, 186, 313 A.2d 797, 800 (1973); <em>State v. Brown, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>405, 415, 126 A.2d 161 (1956). \u201cA construction of a penal statute that would unduly hinder the object and purpose of the law is not favored.\u201d <em>State v. Marchiani, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super </em>541, 545, 765 A.2d 765, 767 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>292, 773 A.2d 1156 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">It seems clear that subsection (e) manifests a legislative intent to expand the scope of conduct interdicted \u201cto cover the knowing and purposeful operation of a corporation for the furtherance or promotion of any criminal object,\u201d <em>Statement to Senate Comm. Substitute for S.1537, </em>\u00a7 26 (January 2, 1981), and by implication to expand the class of persons engaged in these activities beyond the traditional corporate group of officers and directors to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>those individuals, such as defendant, in a position to control or operate the company. In this regard, subsection (c) is distinct from subsections (a) and (b) which criminalize certain violations of corporate law, and is directed against, among other things, \u201corganized crime use [sic] of corporations to further criminal objectives.\u201d Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 2 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9 (2003). Given the clear wording of the statute, the purpose for which the amendment was enacted in 1981, and when considered in full context, it is difficult to perceive that the Legislature intended, by the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c), to treat a \u201ccriminal object\u201d as a crime only when committed by a corporate officer or director and not by, for instance, an owner or controlling shareholder. We find it even more difficult to imagine that the only indication that the Legislature would give of such an intent was the inference from its failure to change the headnote to reflect the amendment\u2019s prohibition of all criminal misuse of a corporation. We find absolutely no support for this position in either the statute or its legislative history. Rather, the statute\u2019s plain meaning compels just the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">For these very same reasons, we also reject defendant\u2019s claim that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9(c) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, an individual who is neither an officer nor director of the corporation through which the Medicaid fraud scheme was perpetrated. \u201cA statute that is vague creates a denial of due process because of a failure to provide notice and warning to an individual that his or her conduct could subject that individual to criminal or quasi-criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 581, 695 A.2d at 245 (citing <em>Screws v. United States, </em>325 <em>U.S. </em>91, 101-02, 65 <em>S.Ct. </em>1031, 1035, 89 <em>L.Ed. </em>1495, 1503 (1945)). Suffice it to say, there is no guessing as to whether defendant\u2019s conduct is criminal under the statute, <em>State v. Lee, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>156, 166, 475 A.2d 31, 36 (1984); <em>State v. Brady, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 450, 753 A.2d 1175, 1178 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>165 <em>N.J. </em>606, 762 A.2d 220 (2000), because the plain language of the statute provides adequate notice of its scope, <em>State v. Kittrell, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>112, 128, 678 A.2d 209, 216 (1996); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 498 A.2d 1217, 1219 (1985), and informs persons-of ordinary intelligence that the conduct to which defendant pled guilty is prohibited. <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 118, 462 A.2d 573, 590 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Defendant alternatively claims that if interpreted to reach individuals other than corporate officers and directors, then the statute violates the constitutionally-based \u201csingle object\u201d rule, <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. IV, \u00a7 7, \u00b6 4, which provides that every law should embrace but one object and that shall be expressed in the title. <em>Cambria v. Soaries, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 776 A.2d 754, 759 (2001). Specifically, the constitutional prohibition reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">To avoid improper influences which may result from intermixing in one and the same act such things as have no proper relation to each other, every law shall embrace but one object, and that shall be expressed in the title. This paragraph shall not invalidate any law adopting or enacting a compilation, consolidation, revision, or rearrangement of all or parts of the statutory law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\"><em>[N.J. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 7, \u00b6 4]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Of course, the constitutional standard does not require that the title of the act index all its provisions. Rather, it is enough that the title expressed the general purpose and all of the statute\u2019s provisions appear to be in furtherance of that purpose and appropriate to the end expressed. <em>Ott v. Braddock, </em>119 <em>N.J.L. </em>507, 511-12, 197 A. 271, 273-74 (E. &amp; A.1938); <em>Supermarkets General Corp. v. Sills, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 347, 225 A.2d 728, 740 (Ch.Div.1966). The constitutional standard is satisfied where the legislators are given notice \u201cof the subject to which the act relates\u201d and the public is informed \u201cof the kind of legislation under consideration.\u201d <em>Howard Sav. Inst. v. Kielb, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>186, 200, 183 A.2d 401, 408 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Indeed, there is \u201cno question\u201d that the Legislature may \u201cproscribe two or more separate and distinct criminal acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>within the same statute.\u201d <em>State v. Juliano, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>232, 235, 245 A.2d 17, 18 (1968); <em>State v. Butler, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 307, 271 A.2d 17, 18 (App.Div.1970). \u201c \u2018All that is required is that the act should not include legislation so incongruous that it could not, by any fair intendment, be considered germane to one general subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Ass\u2019n on Corr. v. Lan, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>199, 215, 403 A.2d 437, 445 (1970) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Harrison, </em>47 <em>Minn. </em>575, 50 <em>N.W. </em>923, 924 (1891)). The different parts of the statute may have any kind of \u201c \u2018connection or relationship,\u2019 \u201d as long as in the \u201c \u2018popular\u2019 \u201d understanding of such matters they could be viewed as being \u201c \u2018connected with and related to a single subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the title \u201cMisconduct by Corporate Official\u201d provides sufficient information and notice of the statute\u2019s content, which, through its three subsections, properly addresses the single end of prohibiting the misuse of a corporation by way of fraud and the promotion of other criminal objectives. With that connection, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-9 satisfies the constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim of excessive sentence is without merit. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, the court treated the second-degree crime of misconduct by a corporate official, to which defendant pled guilty, as a third-degree offense for purposes of sentencing and imposed a term of imprisonment one year longer than the presumptive four-year term. This was based on the clear preponderance of aggravating over mitigating factors found by the judge. In this respect, both the complexity and duration of the Medicaid fraud scheme far exceeded the elements required to prove the offense and thus the court\u2019s consideration of the pervasive and extensive nature of the criminal fraud, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 (a)(1), did not constitute double counting of aggravating factors. Furthermore, a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of mitigating factors is discretionary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(b); <em>State v. Soto, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 72, 773 A.2d 739, 754 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>209, 785 A.2d 438 (2001), and its focus on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the offense rather than the offender and his or her dependents is not misplaced. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>10, 19-20, 570 A.2d 395, 399-400 (1990). We conclude there is no warrant for our interference with the sentence in this instance, with the following qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">While the plea agreement unmistakably provides for a five-year debarment from the Medicaid program, the judgment of conviction contains no such limitation. Although not technically discordant because reinstatement is not automatic, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-12.2, we nevertheless remand the matter for the limited purpose of modifying the judgment of conviction consistent with the express terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The matter is remanded for modification of the judgment of conviction to reflect a five-year'period of debarment. In all other respects, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\"> This is farther evidenced by use of the colon after the beginning clause to introduce the list of offenses, signaling that which follows is closely related to the opening phrase.
