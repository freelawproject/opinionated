Wahl, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (PDVA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to -35, be returned to defendant. The primary issue in this appeal is whether a New Jersey court may order the return of seized firearms to a person who has been convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d as defined by the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 921-930. In considering that issue, we must also determine whether the defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and, if so, whether the weapons return and forfeiture provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) are preempted by 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9), enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>by Congress in 1996 and more commonly known as the Lautenberg Amendment to- the Gun Control Act, which prohibits possession of a firearm that \u201chas been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d by one so convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In reversing, we conclude that a person convicted of the disorderly persons offense of simple assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1(a)(1), has been convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d when the assault involved the use or attempted use of physical force against that person\u2019s current or former spouse or domestic partner, and is thereby prohibited by 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) from owning or possessing any firearms that have, at any point, been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Reading <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) and 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) <em>in pari materia, </em>we further conclude that a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is \u201cunfit,\u201d under New Jersey law, from using, possessing, or owning any firearms that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Therefore, the weapons forfeiture and return provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21(g)(9) and 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) are in harmony and the doctrine of federal preemption is inapplicable to these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our analysis of the issues presented. Defendant and Georgia J. Cinq-Mars <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were married on December 19, 1999. No children were bom of their marriage. On December 10, 2000, an incident occurred between defendant and Cinq-Mars that resulted in two actions \u2014 one criminal and one civil.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On December 10, 2000, Cinq-Mars filed a complaint against defendant under the PDVA in Hackettstown Municipal Court\u2014 docketed later in the Family Part as FV-21-269-01 \u2014 alleging that defendant had committed acts of domestic violence against her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>consisting of assault and criminal mischief. In her complaint, Cinq-Mars stated that she had been physically assaulted by defendant, in that he had choked and slapped her and dragged her down a flight of stairs. Cinq-Mars also alleged a history of acts of domestic violence perpetrated by defendant against her in June or July 1999, causing her to leave their residence and stay in a shelter for protection. In her domestic violence complaint, Cinq-Mars also stated that defendant possessed numerous rifles, shotguns, and bows and arrows. The municipal court judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against defendant on December 10, 2000, and scheduled a final hearing in the Family Part for December 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21a or -22b,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based upon probable cause to believe an act of domestic violence had occurred, Sergeant Scott Wheeler of the Hackettstown Police Department signed a criminal complaint against defendant, charging him with aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1), alleging that defendant had committed acts of aggravated assault against Cinq-Mars by attempting to cause bodily injury to her by choking and slapping her. Pursuant to the authority contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(1)(b), as well as the provision in the TRO prohibiting defendant from possessing any firearms or other weapons, the police seized all weapons in defendant\u2019s possession. Numerous firearms, rounds of ammunition, and bows were seized from defendant and delivered by the police to the Warren County Prosecutor pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(2). Additionally, the police seized defendant\u2019s firearms purchaser identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The PDVA prescribes the procedure to be followed upon the seizure of weapons, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Weapons seized in accordance with the above shall be returned to the owner except upon order of the Superior Court. The prosecutor who has possession of the seized weapons may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object to the return of the weapons on such grounds as are provided for the initial rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, or <em>on the grounds that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">A hearing shall be held and a record made-thereof within 15 days of the notice provided above. No formal pleading and no filing fee shall be required as a preliminary to such hearing. The hearing shall be summary in nature. Appeals from the results of the hearing shall be to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">If the prosecutor does not institute an action within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons shall be returned to the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons to the owner if the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; <em>or if the court determines that the domestic violence situation no longer exists.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">Nothing in this act shall impair the right of the State to retain evidence pending a criminal prosecution. Nor shall any provision of this act be construed to limit the authority of the State or a law enforcement officer to seize, retain or forfeit property pursuant to chapter 64 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">If, after the hearing, the court determines that the weapons are not to be returned to the owner, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">(a) With respect to weapons other than firearms, order the prosecutor to dispose of the weapons if the owner does not arrange for the transfer or sale of the weapons to an appropriate person within 60 days; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">(b) Order the revocation-of the owner\u2019s firearms purchaser identification card or any permit, license or authorization, in which case the court shall order the owner to surrender any firearm seized and all other firearms possessed to the prosecutor and shall order the prosecutor to dispose of the firearms if the owner does not arrange for the sale of the firearms to a registered dealer of the firearms within 60 days; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">(e) Order such other relief as it may deem appropriate. When the court orders the weapons forfeited to the State or the prosecutor is required to dispose of the weapons, the prosecutor shall dispose of the property as provided in N.J.S. 2C:64-6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Thus, where the Family Part concludes \u201cthat the domestic violence situation no longer exists!,]\u201d that the owner is not \u201cunfit!,]\u201d and that the owner does not pose \u201ca threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular!,]\u201d the court shall order that the seized weapons be returned to the owner. <em>See Matter of J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 115-16, 693 A.2d 92 (1997); <em>State v. Volpini, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 412-15, 677 A.2d 780 (App.Div. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On December 14, 2000, a final hearing in FV-21-269-01 was conducted in the Family Part, resulting in entry of a final restraining order (FRO) against defendant. Notably, defendant was prohibited from possessing any firearms or weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On December 21, 2000, the Warren County Prosecutor filed a petition in the Family Part seeking an order regarding disposition of the seized weapons, ammunition, and firearms purchaser identification card. That petition was docketed as FO-21-118-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">On January 10, 2001, the Warren County Prosecutor\u2019s Office downgraded the aggravated assault charge against defendant to simple assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(a)(1), and remanded the matter to the Hackettstown Municipal Court. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the downgraded charge. On March 14, 2001, after a trial in municipal court, defendant was convicted of the disorderly persons offense of simple assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">On January 18, 2001, Cinq-Mars appeared in the Family Part and petitioned for dismissal of the domestic violence complaint filed under FV-21-269-01 and the FRO entered thereunder. The Family Part entered an order of dismissal in accordance with her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">A hearing was held in the Family Part on March 29, 2001, pertaining to the prosecutor\u2019s weapons disposition petition in FO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>21-118-01. Defendant was represented by counsel. The parties entered into an agreement placed upon the record, under which the weapons would not be returned to defendant for a period of one year, during which defendant was to undergo counseling. A formal order memorializing that agreement was entered on April 16, 2001, which specifically required that defendant obtain an evaluation from a psychiatrist or psychologist addressing the issue of whether defendant posed a danger to himself or others. An order amending the April 16, 2001 order clarified that defendant was not to possess any weapons for a period of one year and that a determination as to defendant\u2019s fitness to possess personal weapons shall be made at the end of the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On September 5, 2002, a review hearing was conducted in the Family Part on the issue of whether defendant\u2019s weapons should be returned. The court received into evidence a report from Dr. Lawrence H. Lentehner, a psychologist, dated August 13, 2002. In his report, Dr. Lentehner stated that defendant had been a patient of his during the past one and one-half years, having seen defendant for a total of seventeen sessions both individually and with Cinq-Mars. Dr. Lentehner stated defendant did not have an anger management problem and saw no reason why defendant\u2019s firearms should not be returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">During the hearing, the court took testimony from Cinq-Mars. At that time the parties had been separated for almost two years. Cinq-Mars testified that she had no objection to the firearms and weapons being returned to defendant. However, Cinq-Mars expressed concern that defendant\u2019s possession of weapons might endanger defendant\u2019s adult son because that child had attempted suicide earlier in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Upon questioning by the prosecutor, Cinq-Mars described several incidents of violent behavior by defendant toward her prior to the December 10, 2000 incident. Cinq-Mars also stated that defendant had related an incident to her that had occurred when defendant\u2019s oldest child was age fifteen and defendant was still married to his first wife. Cinq-Mars stated defendant had told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>her that he had given the key to his gun rack to his fifteen year-old son because defendant \u201cwas afraid of what he might do because his wife had moved in with her boyfriend.\u201d Cinq-Mars also related an altercation between her and defendant that had occurred after she had received a subpoena to appear at the September 5, 2002 hearing. Cinq-Mars testified that during an argument while she was riding with defendant in his vehicle, defendant refused to allow her to leave the car while \u201c[h]e was running through red lights and stop signs, so that [she] couldn\u2019t jump out[.]\u201d Cinq-Mars explained that defendant then apologized, turned the vehicle around, and took her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Cinq-Mars testified she did not object to the return of the weapons because the weapons had never played a part in their arguments and he had never threatened use of the weapons against her. Defendant testified and denied the incidents testified to by Cinq-Mars.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">After considering the testimony of the parties and other evidence, the judge addressed the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">I find your wife to be very credible. I sat here, and I looked at her face as she spoke, and it\u2019s very obvious to me that she has some very strong feelings for you. And I find that, after she got the subpoena, that you did have this drive with her____ fF]rankly, I feel you kind of lost it with her and I\u2019m really concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">Here you have a woman that\u2019s very much concerned about you, and she\u2019s telling you. You\u2019re going to counseling. You\u2019re trying to put your marriage back together and she\u2019s telling you she doesn\u2019t want to have any part of those guns. Those guns terrify hey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">I find that you had the training that you said you did in ROTC, and there\u2019s no question that you can safely handle guns. I don\u2019t question that. But I have to tell you something, I didn\u2019t like that outburst where you lost control with her on that incident!.] ... And it seems to me you\u2019ve been counseling for anger management and you had a setback when that occurred, and I\u2019m not inclined to just give your guns back to you. I don\u2019t want you getting these guns and having another anger management problem. That\u2019s my primary reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">My secondary reason is you have a son, who I\u2019m told attempted to commit suicide. And it doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea . to be putting these guns back into this home when you have a son who just attempted suicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>But in any event, I\u2019m not satisfied that you don\u2019t present a threat and, therefore, what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to order that this ease be reviewed again, in six months. And I\u2019m going to tell you, I want you to continue back with that doctor for that anger management^] ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On September 20, 2002, the court entered an order memorializing its decision, directing that the weapons be retained by the prosecutor; that defendant continue in counseling and supply a report from the counselor to the prosecutor\u2019s office addressing the issue of whether defendant poses a risk to himself or others or property if the weapons were returned to him; and that the matter be re-listed for review in six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On May 8, 2003, a review hearing on the weapons-retum issue was conducted in the Family Part. Defendant submitted an updated report from Dr. Lentchner dated January 14, 2003, stating that defendant had continued to see him for psychotherapy, that \u201c[h]e is well motivated for treatment, and makes considerable progress[,]\u201d that he saw no reason for \u201climitation on him with regard to his possession of firearmst,]\u201d and that defendant \u201cis not an individual at risk of either harm to himself or others.\u201d Nevertheless, the State objected to the return of the weapons on the basis that defendant posed a danger \u201cto the public in general or a person or persons in particular,\u201d and that he was disqualified from possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9). The prosecutor and judge then engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHj\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, back in 2000, the defendant was charged with simple assault for slapping and allegedly choking his then wife, Georgiana Cinq-Mars. He has been convicted of that offense, simple assault. Simple assault is a disorderly persons offense. Under federal law, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>922, subsection \u201cg\u201d ... it shall be unlawful for any purpose for any person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to ship or transport in interstate or foreign\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">THE COURT: It\u2019s not a misdemeanor, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a disorderly persons, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Based on a letter issued by the former Attorney General Peter Vemiero on April 4th, 1997, misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence include petty disorderly and disorderly offenses as defined by New Jersey. As the court is aware, [when] New Jersey ... switched from 2A to 2C for the criminal code [it] did away with misdemeanor offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The standard hallmark under common law is that a misdemeanor offense is an offense which imposes no more than one year in jail as a sentence. Petty disorderly persons offense or simple assault carries no more than a six month sentence. While we understand, Your Honor, that the Attorney General\u2019s memorandum is not binding on the court, we ask the court to take judicial notice of it. It has been interpreted as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Basically, there needs to be a finding of five separate facts. There needs to be a relationship with the victim. That relationship must either be a spouse or having a child in common. The victim in this case was the defendant\u2019s former wife or estranged wife at this point in time. There needs to be a showing of an element of violence, the use or attempted use of physical force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">At that point, the judge interrupted the prosecutor to inquire whether Cinq-Mars was present to give further testimony. The State had subpoenaed Cinq-Mars, and the prosecutor informed the judge that she was present, whereupon her testimony was taken. Cinq-Mars stated she had no contact with defendant since the September 5, 2002 hearing, but complained that he continued to telephone her on a daily basis, stopping only after she received the subpoena for the May 8th hearing. In a colloquy with the judge, Cinq-Mars stated she had not filed another domestic violence complaint against defendant because she did not feel threatened by him. The judge informed Cinq-Mars that \u201c[i]f the phone calls are annoying, that would be grounds to get a TRO[,]\u201d and he would recommend that she \u201ctalk about getting a temporary restraining order, because if he continues to call you and you don\u2019t want to talk to him, you don\u2019t have to be threatened, okay, if you\u2019re going to be harmed. Being annoyed is sufficient.\u201d Cinq-Mars stated she would like to seek a restraining order, and the judge adjourned the proceedings for three weeks to give her an opportunity to file a domestic violence complaint and apply for a TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">On that same date \u2014 May 8, 2003 \u2014 Cinq-Mars filed a second domestic violence complaint against defendant, docketed as FV-21-508-03, alleging acts of harassment consisting of defendant telephoning her three times on April 24, 2003, and telephoning her approximately once per day over the last year. A TRO was issued and the matter scheduled for a final hearing on May 15, 2003. That hearing was adjourned to May 22, 2003. On May 22, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Cinq-Mars appeared in the Family Part and requested that the domestic violence complaint be dismissed, and the court entered an order dissolving the TRO and dismissing the complaint. A transcript of the May 22, 2003 hearing is not contained in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The weapons forfeiture review hearing was continued on May 29, 2003. Acknowledging that the domestic violence complaint that had been filed against defendant under FV-21-508-03 had been dismissed, the prosecutor contended that defendant still posed a danger to himself, to Cinq-Mars and to the community, and that the weapons should be forfeited. In ordering that the weapons be returned to defendant, the judge found that although Cinq-Mars had been annoyed by the continuing telephone calls from defendant, she had clearly stated that she did not feel threatened by defendant nor did she object to the return of his weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In requesting a stay of the judge\u2019s order, the prosecutor renewed his previous argument that 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) prohibited defendant from possessing weapons. The court denied the application for a stay. On June 19, 2003, the trial court entered two orders. One memorialized the court\u2019s decision ordering return of the weapons to defendant. The second order reconsidered the State\u2019s request and granted a stay of the return order subject to a notice of appeal being filed in this court within twenty days. On July 9, 2003, the State filed a notice of appeal in this court fi\u2019om the June 19, 2003 order directing the return of defendant\u2019s weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">On appeal, the State presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">18 <em>U.S.C. </em>SECTION 922(g)(9) PREEMPTS STATE LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">THE TRIAL COURT IGNORED CREDIBLE AND RELIABLE EVIDENCE WHEN IT RULED THE DEFENDANT WAS NOT A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL OR A PERSON IN PARTICULAR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We first address the second argument advanced by the State, that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s possession of weapons posed no danger \u201cto the public in general or a person or persons in particular.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). After analyzing the record in the light of the arguments presented by the parties in their briefs, we conclude that this finding by the trial court is supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. 474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 </em>(1974). \u201cBecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding.\u201d Cesare <em>v. Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 413, </em>713 A.2d 390 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In its first argument, the State contends that 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) preempts the weapons-return provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3), and precludes the return of the weapons to defendant.

One commentator explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the rationale for enactment of the Lautenberg Amendment, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Originally, the \u201cGCA [Gun Control Act of 1968] disqualified certain categories of people from receiving firearms or ammunition that had traveled in interstate commerce and imposed criminal liability for the sale or transfer of firearms to disqualified people.\u201d As a result, the GCA allowed states to enforce their own laws regarding firearms, although permitting federal monitoring of any interstate activity involving firearms. As time passed, however, the inadequacy of the original language contained in the GCA became evident, particularly in regard to domestic violence. In addition, the increase in gun-related domestic violence incidents suggested that Congress needed to supplement the GCA. In response to these incidents, Congress enacted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996 to halt the growing number of domestic violence deaths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">The Lautenberg Amendment expands the list of persons subject to a firearm prohibition; the Amendment also makes the receipt or possession of a firearm that has moved in interstate commerce a felony if the person possessing the weapon was previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.... The Amendment applies to all persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, regardless of the date of the offense. Moreover, any violence, whether actual, attempted, or threatened, against a spouse or child \u2014 and prosecuted successfully as a misdemeanor \u2014 triggers application of the Amendment and prohibits the domestic violence offender from possessing, transferring, and purchasing firearms or ammunition. A person who is subject to the Amendment and fails to relinquish all firearms and ammunition can be fined up to $250,000 and receive a ten-year prison sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">[Polly McCann Pruneda, <em>Comment, </em>\u201cThe Lautenberg Amendment: Congress Hit The Mark By Banning Firearms From Domestic Violence Offenders,\u201d 30 <em>St. Mary\u2019s L.J. </em>801, 839-40 (1999) (quoting Major Einwechler and Captain Christian-sen, \u201cAbuse Your Spouse and Lose Your Job: Federal Law Now Prohibits Some Soldiers from Possessing Military Weapons,\u201d 1997 <em>Army Law., </em>at 25-26 (Aug. 1997); other footnotes omitted).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">In <em>United States v.

We further note that the New Jersey Attorney General, in a memorandum to all law enforcement agencies dated April 4, 1997, reached the same conclusion, and required that all county and local law enforcement agencies apply the prohibitions contained in 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) to every officer and employee in their respective agencies required or authorized to carry a firearm.

Pursuant to that federal law, a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is \u201cunfit\u201d to use, possess, or own firearms that have \u201cbeen shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d Reading <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) and 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude they can be reconciled and consistently stand together. Specifically, the Lautenberg Amendment, a law governing the use, possession and ownership of firearms, precludes use, possession or ownership of firearms that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. That prohibition is covered by the prohibitions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). Therefore, we need not reach the issue of preemption. <em>See State v. S.A., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 249, 675 A.2d 678 (App.Div.1996) (concluding that 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 922(g)(8), prohibiting weapon possession by a person against whom a domestic violence restraining order had been issued, was in harmony and not in conflict with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) that prohibits return of weapons where \u201cthe court finds \u2018that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular,\u2019 ... unless \u201cthe domestic violence situation no longer exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Here, the Family Part judge rejected the application of 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) because the simple assault conviction was a disorderly persons offense and he did not consider it to constitute a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d We have ruled otherwise, and conclude that the statutory predicates of \u201cthe use or attempted use of physical force\u201d and the requisite domestic relationship, are also present. Whether the remaining predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>for application of 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9) was present \u2014 that the seized firearms had ever \u201cbeen shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce!,]\u201d \u2014 is an issue that was not reached by the Family Part judge, nor is the record on appeal adequate for us to decide the question. Accordingly, we reverse that part of the June 19, 2003 order that pertains to firearms and remand the matter for a hearing as to whether the seized firearms or any of their component parts have ever been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We provide the following guidance for the remand proceedings. First, since the State has sought forfeiture, it bears the burden to establish the predicate elements for application of the firearms prohibitions contained in 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(9), including the element that the seized weapons, at some point had \u201cbeen shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We also note that the market in firearms is heavily interstate in nature, even international in character, and it would be indeed rare that a firearm, or at least some of its component parts, would have never moved across state lines. <em>People v.
