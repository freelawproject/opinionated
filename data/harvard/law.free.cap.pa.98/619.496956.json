A. brought an action against B. &amp; Co., whom he sued bythat name, before a justice of the peace, to recover the price of certain goods. Having filed an affidavit that defendants resided out of the county, and having given the necessary bond, he issued a writ, of attachment in accordance with the provisions of the Act of July 13th 1843. \u00a7 36, Pamph. L. 345, against the defendants\u2019 goods, which writ was made returnable on the fourth day after its issue, and was, on the same day that it issued, duly returned \u201cgoods attached.\u201d A. then issued a summons to defendants returnable the third day after its issue, which was accordingly returned on that day, \u201cdefendants not found in the county.\u201d A. then obtained judgment against defendants, and issued execution against certain goods belonging to them which were levied upon and sold.

Held, further, that plaintiffs could not object to the validity of such judgment on the ground that it had been rendered against the firm and not against the several partners by name. <em>Held, </em>further, that in any event, said judgment having been rendered against B. by name, all his interest in the goods in question passed under the execution, and that liehoe his joinder as a party plaintiff constituted an insuperable bay to plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-6\">8.

Stewart\u2019s name is here as ' one of the plaintiffs, and he has no right to recover, for all his interest was divested by that sale; but the plaintiff declines to amend by dropping him, placing it on the grounds that that judgment was not a legal one as against Stewart. Mr. Stewart\u2019s name is still in the papers, and it is not controverted that he is one of the parties now claiming, and as there is no controversy upon the facts, your verdict will be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-11\">Verdict, accordingly, for the defendants, and judgment thereon. The plaintiffs took this writ of error, assigning for error, the affirmance of the defendant\u2019s point, and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-12\"><em>Crosby &amp; </em>Crosby, and <em>Osmer, Dale &amp; </em>Freeman, for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIb\">The transcript showing but three days between the date and the return day of the summons, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ment was coram non judice, and void: Camp <em>v. </em>Wood, 10 Watts 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-7\">By the provisions of the Act of 1842, Pnrd. Dig. 857, pi. 76, two distinct modes of proceeding against persons residing out of the county are prescribed, to wit: By summons or attachment, either one of which must be made returnable not less than two nor more than four days from the date thereof; and must be served at least two days before the time of appearance mentioned therein. If the suit be commenced by attachment and shall have been personally served on the defendant at least two days before the return day thereof, the justice shall proceed to hear and determine the case without a further writ. But if (as in this case) the same shall not have been so served, this act provides that \u201ca summons shall issue against the defendant, returnable as summonses issued by justices of the peace are <em>now </em>by law returnable.\u201d Purd. Dig. 858, pi. 78, 80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-8\">The phrase, \u201creturnable as summonses . . . <em>are now by law </em>returnable,\u201d cannot but refer to the <em>then existing </em>statute prescribing the time within which a summons issued by a justice must be made returnable, which was the act of 1810, Purd. Dig. 850, pi. 40, and is in these words: \u201cIf on a summons commanding the defendant, &amp;c., on a day certain therein to be expressed, <em>not more than eight nor less them fioe days </em>from the date of the summons.\u201d That the words \u201care now bylaw returnable,\u201d as used in the act of 1842, Purd. Dig. 858, pi. 80, were intended to refer to the act of 1810, <em>supra, </em>is manifest from the fact that that was then the only <em>law </em>upon the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq9R\">The Act of 1810 has not been repealed. Under its provisions, by far the greater part of the litigation in justices\u2019 conrts has been, and is conducted. \u2022 Its provisions, in respect to the time within which a summons shall be made returnable, are not in conflict with the provisions, in this respect, of the Act of 1842; but on the contrary, are consistent and harmonious therewith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-11\">The attachment, and the execution, moreover, were void, because directed generally against Stewart &amp; Oo., and not against the partners\u2019 interests in the partnership: Act of April 8th 1873, Purd. Dig. Suppl. 1813, pi. 1; Hare v. Commonwealth, 8 W. N. C. 121; Deal <em>v. </em>Bogue, 8 Har. 228; Durborrow\u2019s Appeal, 3 Norris, 404. Stewart was properly joined as a coplaintiff in this action. The omission of his name would have been a good plea in abatement: Addison <em>v. </em>Overend, 6 Term Rep. 766.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-12\"><em>Charles W.

It issued on a judgment recovered against them or some of them in favor of one King. He bought the property, and afterwards sold it to the defendants. The plaintiffs now question the effect of that judgment, and attack its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">It is settled law that the regularity of a judgment of a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter cannot be questioned in a collateral proceeding. Although a judgment recovered before a justice of the peace be irregular, yet if he has jurisdiction of the subject matter, the only redress of the defendants therein is by certiorari. If they acquiesce therein by taking .no steps to reverse it they thereby make it as good and valid as if all the prerequisites of the law had been observed. A title to property acquired under judgment and execution cannot be defeated by proving some defect in the original process. The judgment of every court pronounced on. a subject within its jurisdiction is conclusive and binding on all other courts, except' those only before which it comes by appeal, certiorari or writ of error: Tarbox <em>v. </em>Hays, 6 Watts 398; Hauer\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 473; Sloan <em>v. </em>McKinstry, 6 Harris 120; Billings <em>&amp; </em>May <em>v. </em>Russell, 11 Id. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The judgment in question was obtained on proceedings commenced by attachment under the 26th section of the Act of July 12th 1842, P. L. 345, against H. Stewart <em>&amp; </em>Cb. as nonresidents of the county, having personal property therein. This section provides in case no. capias can issue under section 24 of the act, \u2018\u2018and the defendant shall reside out of the county he shall be proceeded against by summons or attachment, returnable not less than two nor more than four days from the date thereof, which shall be served at least two days before the time of appearance mentioned therein.\u201d Thus this section authorizes either form of writ to issue, at the option of the plaintiff. The day of return and time of service is the same for each\u2014 whichever writ is issued that constitutes the original process. If it be summons, no valid judgment can be rendered without service or appearance by defendant. If it be by attachment, a valid judgment in rem may be obtained. King made the necessary affidavit, and executed the required bond. The claim was for goods sold and delivered. No fact was shown which authorized a capias to issue. The justice had undoubted jurisdiction of the cause of action. The 'attachment was made returnable and served according to the requirement of the statute. The property in question was attached, and due return thereof was made on the writ. Summons then issued, which was returned defendant not found in the county. On the return day, d .'fondants not appearing, after hearing the evidence of the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the justice rendered judgment in his favor against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The writ of summons was made returnable on the third day after the date thereof, and, as the Act of 1810 requires a summons to be made returnable not less than five days after its date, it is contended that this judgment is therefore void. We have, however, shown that jurisdiction over the property was acquired by virtue of the attachment and proceedings thereon. If then there was error in the subsequent proceedings by making the summons returnable prematurely, it was an irregularity wliich could be corrected by certiorari only, and not in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It is further urged, inasmuch as the individual names of all the persons composing the firm were not set forth in the attachment suit, that the rights of those whose names were omitted are not affected by the judgment. If the question was, whether an execution on that judgment would authorize a sale of their individual property, there would be force in this position. Such, however, is not this case. The sale was of the property attached only. That was the property of the firm. So the question is, whether, on a judgment against the firm, the property of the firm can be sold ? One partner may confess a judgment in the name of the firm of which he is a member, which will authorize a sale of the interest of all the partners in partnership property : Ross <em>v. </em>Howell, 3 Norris 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We cannot expect, and must not require, an observance of strict rules of pleading before a justice. In many cases judgments have been held good, when against copartners in the firm name, without stating the names of the persons composing the firm. Objections of this kind, after verdict or judgment, are not to be favored: Porter <em>v. </em>Cresson, 10 S. &amp; R. 259; Morse <em>v. </em>Chase <em>&amp; </em>Co., 1 Watts 156; Seitz &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Buffum &amp; Co., 2 Harris 69. It must be conceded the judgment was against Stewart, one of the firm, and now one of the plaintiffs. It therefore follows, as to him, at least, his interest in the property was sold. His right in the property having been divested the other partners could not unite his name with theirs and recover in an action of trover. A joint action in tort cannot be maintained when some of the plaintiffs are shown to have no right to recover. It is elementary law in actions ex delicto, that if too many persons are made co-plaintiffs, the objection, if it appear on the record, may be taken advantage of either by demurrer, in arrest of judgment, or by writ of error; or if the objection do not appear on the face of the pleadings, it will be ground of nonsuit on the trial: 1 Ohitty Plead. 76. It follows the learned judge correctly held the plaintiffs could not recover. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
