Patton, Esq., the following facts appeared in evidence: Daniel Stahl died November 1st 1853, seised of a certain farm in Antrim township, Franklin county. By his will, which was duly admitted to probate, Stahl directed said farm to be sold by his executors within two or three years after his decease, and further provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">\u201c After the sale of the large farm I allow $3,000 to remain in said.farm, and the interest arising from said $3,000 I allow my wife to receive -annually,.....and after the death of my widow I allow the said $3,000 to be equally between my children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">Testator left him surviving a wife and two daughters, Malinda Catherine, .who was unmarried, and Joanna, who had intermarried with Benjamin M. Powell. In 1856 Stahl\u2019s execm tors sold and conveyed the farm to said Powell, charged as directed by the testator. On November 4th 1868 testator\u2019s widow died. \u00edn 1869 Powell paid Malinda Catherine Stahl the sum of $1,500, being her share on the charge upon the farm. He paid his own wife nothing, nor did she demand it of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-11\">Powell about this time became- embarrassed financially, and the following judgments were entered up against him, constituting liens upon the farm :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-12\">Elizabeth Powell, No. 171 August T., 1871 . . . $231 00 Rebecca McKee, No. 218 December T., 1874 . . . 500 00 A.

This release was under seal, was attested by one subscribing witness, and was accompanied by the following cex-tificate of acknowledgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-17\">\n<em>Franldm County, ss.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-18\">Before me, the subscriber, one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said county, personally appeared the within named Joanna Powell, and acknowledged the foregoing written instru\u2022ment of consent signed by her to be her act and deed, and that the same was done without any coercion of her husband, Benjamin M. Powell, and desired that the same might be recorded as such; and I certify that tire same was done and executed before me, before the signing and execution of the written in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>denture, release or deed of conveyance; and further, the said Joanna Powell acknowledged the release separate and apart from her said husband.

P. </em>[Seal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">Mrs. Powell,testified as to the execution of this release, inter alia, as follows : \u201c This is my signature to paper. Husband gave me a paper at our house. My husband said I should take the paper to Col. B. F. Winger. Said I should give the paper to him. He gave me no directions about signing the paper. Ho said I should sign it; it would be all right. We went to Greencastle. I gave Col. Winger the paper in his office. I don\u2019t remember signing the paper. I don\u2019t remember Esquire Wallech being in Mr. Winger\u2019s office the same day. I don\u2019t remember of Col. Winger reading the paper over to me. I don\u2019t remember seeing that paper afterwards. If I released my share of that dower that day I know nothing about it. If I did release that day I never understood anything. My husband never paid me any part of that dower. \u00cd never got any money on account of my share of that dower \u2014 before I signed the paper \u2014 at the time \u2014 nor afterwards. My husband did not tell mo who had written the paper. He (my husband) gave me no reason why he wanted me to sign the paper. He did not tell me what was in the paper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-9\">Witness also testified with regard to her joinder in a deed to other parties for thirty acres of said farm, that she had signed it because her husband told her that if she did not, she might look out for herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-10\">John G. Wallech, Esq., testified with reference'to the execution of the release as follows : \u201c 1 know Mrs. Joanna Powell. I took her acknowledgment. The acknowledgment is in my hand-writing. She appeared before me personally. She came, I think, to my office and asked me to come to Winger\u2019s office. I am not certain this was the time she came after me. She did come once. Her husband was not with her. I examined her separate and apart from him, and even separate and apart from her attorney. Before taking the acknowledgment I made known t\u00ede contents. I commenced and read to her until I saw the import of the release, and she said to me while I was reading that it was not necessary, that she understood it all. This occurred in Col. Winger\u2019s back office. We came out of the back office and then she signed it in presence of Col. Winger. She said to me, while separate and apart from every one, that she signed stitne of her own free will and accord, and without any coercion or compulsion on the part of her said husband.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>' The auditor found as a matter of fact that Mrs. Powell received no consideration for the release and that there was no competent evidence that she had a knowledge of its contents. The release was on October 30th 1875 duly recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">After the execution and recording of the release the following judgments were entered against Powell:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">E. B. Winger, No. 144 September T., 1876, . . . $400 00 John S. Grove, No. 56 September T., 1876, . . . 359 45 James IL Wilson, No. 393 September T., 1876, . . 486 00 Solomon Firey\u2019s ex\u2019rs, No. 51 February T., 1877, . . 992 53 Samuel M'Creery, No. 100 February T., 1877, . . 315 00 Samuel M\u2018Creery, No. 101 February T., 1877, . . 284 93</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6j\">M\u2018Creery testified that his first judgment No. 100, was entered upon a judgment note, dated April 22d 1875, prior to the date of the release. He testified, however, as to his second judgment, No. 101, that it was entered on a judgment note, dated February 1st 1876, and that he had advanced money to Powell thereon, simply because of Powell\u2019s representation that his wife had released her interest in his land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-14\">The judgments of Wilson and Firey\u2019s executrix were also entered up for loans made to Powell after the date of the release, but it did not appear, whether said loans had been made in \"view of the release or on the faith of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-15\">On January 7th 1877, said Powell and wife conveyed said farm to Winger and Schafhert, by a voluntary deed of assignment for the benefit of Powell\u2019s creditors, reserving, however, the wife\u2019s interest in the same. Afterwards said assignees sold the said farm under order of court, free and discharged of all liens, for $5,-971.21, which amount constituted the fund to be distributed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-16\">Mrs. Powell claimed out of the fund the sum of $1,500, with interest from the date of the death of Stahl\u2019s widow. Upon this point the auditor reported, inter alia, as follows : \u201cFrom the testimony it appears that Mrs. Powell did not have her own free will in the execution of the release. It is true she signed it out of the presence of her husband, but she swears that her husband told her unless she did sign i she must look out for herself.\u2019 Taking this to be true, we think it negatives the certificate of the magistrate that she executed the same <em>\u2018 </em>without any coercion of her husband, Benjamin M. Powell;\u2019 but outside of this, the certificate of acknowledgment is fatally defective, in that it does not set out that the contents were made known to said Joanna Powell. It is held that the fact that the contents were made known to a feme covert must substantially appear on the face of the certificate: Steele <em>v. </em>Thompson, 14 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 92; also Shaller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>v. </em>Brand, 6 Binn. 438; Evans <em>v. </em>Ooin\u2019th, 4 S. &amp; B. 272; Watson <em>v. </em>Mercer, 6 S. &amp; B. 48; Fowler <em>v. </em>M\u2018Clurg, 6 S. &amp; B. 143 ; Jourdan <em>v. </em>Jourdan, 9 S. <em>&amp; </em>B. 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">\u201c An attempt was made to supply tlie defect in the acknowledgment by the testimony of the magistrate who took the acknowledgment.. This testimony is ruled out. It is incompetent to supply the defect appearing on the face of the certificate by parol testimony : See Watson and wife <em>v. </em>Bailey, 1 Binney 470; Jourdan <em>v. </em>Jourdan, supra; Barnett <em>v. </em>Barnet, 15 S. &amp; B. 72; Loudon <em>v. </em>Blythe, 4 Harris, 541. Your auditor, therefore, holds that the paper is void for the purpose of release of any interest in real estate. But it is urged that the interest which J oanna Powell had in said farm was not such an interest in lands as required. an acknowledgment. Your auditor thinks that Mrs. Powell, a married woman, could only release this interest in the dower, or whatever it was, by a release acknowledged in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Assembly relating to conveyances of real estate by married women. ' That she could not sell or release to her husband directly, because, this being an interest in land, <em>both </em>must sign, and it is also invalid as a release of her interest, because it is not signed by her husband, who was then living. . . . But it is claimed that Mrs. Powell\u2019s interest in the land was a chose in action, and that she could give it to her husband. We answer that even it was a chose in action, it was not such <em>an article as wouldpass by mere </em>delivery, and therefore the method must conform to the mode prescribed by law, which in this case would be by deed or release, <em>properly </em>acknowledged: Hinney <em>v. </em>Phillips, 14 Wr. 382.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">\u201c But it was no gift, nor intended to be such, by either husband or wife. . . . But it is urged that the release which she signed should estop her from pressing her claim until all the judgment creditors who loaned money on <em>thq faith of the release </em>are satisfied. We cannot agree to this. A judgment creditor is <em>not a </em>purchaser, and would not be protected by knowledge of the release ; but the only evidence your auditor has that any one judgment creditor loaned their money on the faith of the release, is Mr. Samuel M'Oreery. lie testifies that lie knew of the lien upon the land in favor of the wife, and did not loan money until he was informed by <em>Mr. Powell </em>that rhe wife had released her claim. Now, if Mr. Powell told Samuel M'Oreery that, he acted badly, because the record shows that the money of Mr. M'Oreery wTas loaned, or at least the single bill dated 22cl April 1875, six months before the release was executed, and Mr. Powell\u2019s statement could not have been true. That being so, and the release at that time not being executed, Mr. M'Oreery might have loaned his money on the faith of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Mv. Powell said to him about the release, but not on the faith of the release actually executed. And your auditor holds that what Mr. Powell said, out of the presence of Mrs. Joanna Powell, could not prejudice her claim in any way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">The auditor accordingly, after deducting the costs of audit, awarded to Mi\u2019s. Powell the full amount of her claim out of the fund, viz.: $2,317.50. The residue he distributed to the judgment creditors of Powell in the order of their priority, paying Elizabeth Powell, Rebecca McKee, A. L. Irwin, H. S. Stone, E. B. Winger and John Hade in full, and awarding to Wilson on account $65.83, which exhausted the fund. To this report exceptions were iiled on behalf of Wilson and the judgment creditors whose claims were not reached in the distribution, on the ground that the auditor had erred in allowing to Mrs. Powell the amount of her claim with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">The court, Rowe, P. J., was of opinion that the release was good in substance and form, and that is was duly executed a.nd acknowledged,- but that, Mrs. Powell having received no consideration therefor, and not having intended to make a gift, the same was invalid as between her and her husband or his judgment creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">As to M\u2019Creery, the court held, however, that he having advanced the money represented by his second judgment subsequent to the release and on the faith thereof, Mrs. Powell was estopped as to him from setting up its invalidity. As to the other judgment creditors subsequent to the release who were not shown to have so acted, the court held that the principle of estoppel could not be invoked. The court also disallowed Mrs. Powell\u2019s claim for interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">The matter being recommitted to the auditor for redistribution in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion of the court, he deducted the sum of $817.50 from the amount previously awarded to Mrs. Powell, being the interest on her claim, and applied $453.36 thereof to satisfy that portion of Wilson\u2019s judgment remaining unpaid. The residue, viz.: $334.14, he applied on account of the judgment of Solomon Firey\u2019s executrix, which was the next in priority of lien. He also deducted from the allowance of $1,500 to Mrs. Powell the sum of $303.67, \u25a0which lie awarded to M\u2018Oreery in payment of his second judgment with interest. A report embracing the redistribution was filed and was duly confirmed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">Joanna Powell thereupon took an appeal, assigning for error the deduction of M\u2018Creery\u2019s second judgment from her claim, and the awarding of the same to him, and also the refusal to allow her interest on her claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\">Anna M. Firey, executrix, also-took an appeal, assigning for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>error the action of the court in allowing Mrs. Powell\u2019s claim, and in not awarding the amount of that claim to the judgment of Firey\u2019s executrix.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-6\"><em>J. McD. Sharpe, </em>for Joanna Powell.-The</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af8p\">release was not good in substance or in form. Appellant\u2019s interest in the land was of such a 'character that she might have brought ejectment: Kensinger <em>v. </em>Smith, to use, 9 W. N.

It was in the nature of a mortgage: Moore <em>v. </em>Cornell, 18 P. F. Smith, 320.

That this omission is a fatal defect in conveyances of real estate, is decided in numerous cases. I cite only two of the recent ones: Miller <em>v. </em>Wentworth, 1 Norris 280; Hornbeck <em>v. </em>The Building Association, 7 Id. 64. This, however, was not the case of a conveyance of land. Mrs. Powell had no dower in her father's estate and could have none. What she held was a mere legacy. That it was charged upon land makes no essential difference. A release of a legacy charged upon land is within the recording acts. The act of 15th of April 1828, authorizing such releases to be recorded, requires that they shall be executed \u201cbefore at least, two competent subscribing witnesses.\u201d The present release has but one subscribing witness, and does not corno within the act: Hellman <em>v. </em>Hellman, 4 Rawle 440. Section 24 of the Act of 26th April 1850, P. L. 581, authorizes the recording of such releases only when they \u201cshall have been duly acknowledged or the execution thereof proved by the existing laws for the acknowledgment and proof of the execution of deeds or other instruments of writing concerning any lands or tenements,\u201d &amp;c. As the release of Mrs. Powell was not so acknowledged it is manifest the Act of 1850 does not apply, nor is the case affected by the Act of April 11th 1848. The acknowledgment by the wife referred to in said act is when the husband seeks to convey or incumber her separate estate. The ffrst section of the Act of 11th April 1856, P. L. 315, repeals so much of the Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1848 as provides that the acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage conveying the separate estate of a married woman may be made differently from her acknowledgment when joining her husband in conveying his real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">This release is not void, however, because not so acknowledged as to bring it within the recording acts. As before observed, it was not a conveyance of an interest in lands. It concerned personal property, was a mere chose in action, and as such within her own control with the consent of her husband. As this release was made to her husband, at his request, aud for his benefit, his consent is to be presumed. It was held in Bond <em>v. </em>Bunting, 28 P. F. Smith 210, that a married woman, her husband joining therein, could assign her dioses in action without acknowledgment of any kind, and the distinction is there pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>out between a ebose in action and a mortgage; the latter, though a security for money, is a conveyance of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">This release is sufficient in form, however defective the acknowledgment may be. It was said to be invalid, however, for the reason that it was not executed by Mrs. Powell of her own free will; that she did not know what she was signing, and that she received no consideration therefor. And it was urged that if the release was invalid as to her husband it was equally so as to his judgment creditors who merely stand upon the foot of their debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The only wituess called to attack the release was Mrs. Powell herself, who, although - incompetent, was permitted to testify by agreement. Giving entire credit to what she says, she fails to show any fraud practiced upon her in the acknowledgment, or any coercion on the part of her husband prior thereto. The substance of what she says is that she did not receive any money; that her husband told her to sign the release, and that it would be all right. It is true the learned auditor finds that her husband told her if she did not sign it \u201c she must look out for herself.\u201d In this the auditor made a mistake. The words referred to had reference to a deed of thirty acres of land her husband desired to convey, and not to this release. Mrs. Powell took the release to the justice, unaccompanied by her husband, and executed and acknowledged it in the presence of the former. The justice was examined, and testified that she acknowledged the release voluntarily, and that, when he commenced to explain to her the contents of the paper, she interrupted him and stated she understood it; that it was a release of her dower. Mrs. Powell does not essentially contradict him otherwise than by the convenient \u201c I don\u2019t know.\u201d There is not a scintilla of evidence to show fraud or coercion on the part of her husband, yet if Mrs. Powell is believed there was no consideration for the release. There certainly is no proof she ever received the $1,500, and the auditor does not find she intended it as a gift. 'We must, therefore, hold the release invalid as to her husband. Is it so as to his judgment creditors ?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We think it very clear that so far as such creditors have loaned their money upon the faith of the release they are entitled_to priority over Mrs. Powell in the distribution of this fund. It is true a judgment creditor stands upon the foot of his debtor so far as title is concerned; but this rule has no application where a third person has misled the creditor as to the condition of the title and thereby induced him to lend his money on the faith of it. . Samuel M\u2018Creery had actual knowledge of the release, and took one of his judgments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>loaned the money on the faith of it. As to him Mrs. Powell ia estopped from setting up her release. It is true she was a married woman, and the general rule undoubtedly is that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply to such persons. But there are exceptions. The rule rests upon the fact that a married woman cannot contract. It follows logically that what alie cannot pass by contract she may not pass by estoppel. But where the law clothes her with the power to contract, to the extent of that power she is bound precisely as other persons are bound. The law gives her the right to dispose of her personal estate with the assent of her husband. In doing so she lias no more right to injure and mislead others than if she were <em>sui juris. </em>To hold otherwise would enable her to continue her operations with her separate estate so long as they were profitable, and then make reprisals for her losses upon those who had trusted her. Brown\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>W. </em>N. C. 329, distinctly recognized this principle. There a married woman who held a judgment against certain real estate agreed in writing that the lien of her judgment should be postponed to the lien of a subsequent judgment. After the money had been loaned on the faith of her agreement she attempted to repudiate it on the ground of her coverture. This court held that as she had the absolute control of her judgment, could satisfy it at will, she could also postpone, and, as an innocent party had acted upon the faith of her conduct, she was estopped from claiming a first lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">It does not appear that any of the other creditors loaned their money upon the faith of the release, nor that they had knowledge of it. Not having been duly acknowledged it must be treated as an unrecorded paper. lienee, no question arises as to constructive notice to the creditors, and actual notice is not pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We see no error' in the refusal of the court below to allow interest on Mrs. Powell\u2019s claim. The authorities cited by him are sufficient to sustain his ruling. See May <em>v. </em>May, 12 P. F. Smith 206; Bachman <em>v. </em>Killinger, 5 Id. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The decree is affirmed and the appeals dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
