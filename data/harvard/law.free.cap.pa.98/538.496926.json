'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-12\">On the trial, before Collier, J., the following facts appeared : The plaintiffs, who lived in Nobiestown, had been in the habit for several years of sending money to S. B. W. Gill, an attorney-at-law in Pittsburgh, as their argentand attorney, for the purpose of investment, on the understanding that Gill was to pay interest on the money from the time he received it until he invested it. On September 17th 1S77, the plaintiffs sent the sum of $1,300 to Gill\u2019s office, with a message that it was for investment. Mr. Gill was absent from the city, and the money was left with his son and business assistant, who gave the following receipt:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-13\">\u201cReceived, Pittsburgh, September 17th 1877, of George W. and W. McMurray, the sum of thirteen hundred dollars, to be invested by me for them. S. B. W. Gill,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-14\">II. B. Gill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-15\">The standing arrangement that Gill was to pay interest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>such funds until invested was not countermanded or alluded to. H. B. Gill, on 'the same day, deposited this sum in the defendant bank, to the credit of his father\u2019s general private account. Subsequently he drew from the bank,' on blank checks left with him and signed by his father, sums exceeding $1,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">Two mouths afterwards, it being currently rumored that S. B. W. Gill was a defaulter and had absconded, the plaintiffs demanded the sum of $1,300 from the bank, on the-ground that it was trust money belonging to them. At this time the balance to Gill\u2019s credit was $1,951. The bank refused the demand. On the same day a writ of sequestration, issued from the Orphans\u2019 Court, was served upon the bank, and the said balance standing to Gill\u2019s credit, was paid to the sheriff, who afterwards, under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, paid the same to Gill\u2019s assignee in bankruptcy. The plaintiffs afterwards brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">The bank alleged that they had an agreement with Gill that he was to keep a large balance on deposit to secure a line of discounts; that they received the $1,300 as Gill\u2019s money, without notice of any trust; and that, in fact, the transaction between the plaintiffs and Gill was a loan and not a trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">The defendant presented, inter alia, the following point: (5) If the jury find that the money in question was sent to S. B. W. Gill for investment under the same arrangement as he had before that time received other moneys from plaintiffs for investment, to wit, under an arrangement that he (Gill) was to pay interest to the plaintiffs until the money should be invested, then the verdict should be for the defendant. And if the fact was as stated by Win. MeMurray, one of the plaintiffs, that such arrangement was not countermanded when they sent the money claimed in this case to Gill, the presumption would be that the same arrangement was to continue in respect to said money as had been agreed upon before that time in respect to other moneys placed by plaintiffs in Gill\u2019s hands for investment.\u201d <em>Refused. </em>Exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs.

Gill agreed to pay interest until the money was invested; therefore he had a right in the meantime to use it as his own, and the bank had a right, under their agreement with Gill, to retain it as security for discounts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-6\">' <em>T.

If, as was alleged, the money was placed in Gill\u2019s hands for investment, with an understanding or agreement that until he could find a satisfactory mortgage he should pay interest thereon, the plaintiffs below cannot hold him as a trustee, nor follow his deposit in the bank as trust money. As the court below negatived the point, we must assume the jury would have found the facts as stated therein. The plaintiffs cannot treat Gill in the dual character of trustee and debtor. Undoubtedly the receipt by him of the money for investment^ ]vjtb.QU\u00cd ijnwe, 'vyould have made him^/tuugtee. The money would have been trust money, and if misapplied, could have been followed until it reached the hands of an innocent holder for value. But the agreement to pay interest necessarily implied the rightjo use the money. Interest is the price or consideration for Jfhte ruse of money. It-follows that Gill became the nmreMsSSjgy or debtor .of the plaintiffs, subject to the duty of investing Ri^-money iaa mortgage when a suitable opportunity should oe\u00bfUB?v^nU|tlfe mean time he had the right to use it in any way liig convenience or necessities required. When deposited in the bank, it was the money of Gill, not of the plaintiffs, if the facts be as stated in the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The remaining assignments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
