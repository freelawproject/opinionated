A coal company liad given a mortgage upon its lands for $150,000, and had also incurred certain flouting indebtedness. To accommodate the company, A. agreed to advance the money to pay oil said mortgage and indebtness, on the execution to him of a new mortgage upon said lands for $350,000. The latter mortgage was accordingly executed, but was not recorded. And A. having advanced the necessary sum, the mortgage for $150,000 was put under his control but was not marked satisfied of record. B. and O., stockholders in the coal company, undertook in writing to afford A. the fullest protection for payment of his $350,000 mortgage. D., who was also a stockholder, afterward recovered a judgment against the company. From this judgment the company took a writ of error giving a bond, together with B., C., E. and E. (the two latter not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>being stockholders) whereby the obligors bound themselves jointly and severally to pay to D. the amount of his judgment in case the said writ of error was not successfully prosecuted. A. afterwards recorded his $350,000 mortgage, and marked the $150,000 mortgage satisfied of record. He at the same time, instituted proceedings on the former mortgage, upon, which lie obtained judgment. Subsequently the writ of error upon D.\u2019s judgment was dismissed, and A. thereupon purchased the said judgment, and had it assigned to him. Afterwards A. issued a levari facias upon his judgment on the $250,000 mortgage,-under which the coal company\u2019s land was sold to him for $85,000 and a special return made that A. was entitled, by virtue of his judgment on said mortgage, to the whole of that sum. Exceptions to this return were filed by (3., who claimed, that a portion of D.\u2019s judgment belonged to him, by virtue of an assignment prior to that of A., and that said judgment was prior in lien to the $250,000 mortgage, and therefore entitled to participate in-the fund. A sum equal to the portion of D.\u2019s judgment claimed by G. was thereupon paid into court, by A. and an issue was awarded between G. and A., to determine the questions raised by the exceptions, and also whether G. was entitled to any part of D.\u2019s judgment. The issue resulted in a verdict for A., and the amount paid by him into court; was accordingly returned to him. In an action subsequently brought by A. in D.\u2019s name against the coal company, B.. C., E. and F. jointly on their joint and several bond, wherein theplaintiff sought to recover the amount of D.\u2019s <em>judgment, </em>\u2014 Held, that A., having had a clear right- as owner of D.\u2019s judgment to participate in the fund produced by the sheriff\u2019s sale under the mortgage, and having neglected to avail himself of that opportunity, was now precluded in equity, from recovering against the sureties on the bond in suit. <em>Held, </em>further, that the verdict rendered in the issue between A. and G., to determine the questions raised by G.\u2019s exception, was not conclusive as to said sureties, who were not parties to said issue. <em>Held, </em>further, that as far as E. and F. were concerned, the agreement of B. &amp; O. to give A. the fullest possible protection for liis $250,000 mortgage, and the fact that D. was also a stockholder in tile company, did,not raise any countervailing equity which won hi make E. and F. liable on the bond in suit, notwithstanding A.\u2019s negligence. <em>Held, </em>therefore that A., having sued all the parties on. said bond jointly, and some of them having a valid defense, all the defendants were entitled to judgment,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-6\">8. The satisfaction of the $150,000 mortgage was probably entered by A. under the mistaken impression that by reason of the then pending writ of error, D.\u2019s judgment had lost its lien. This was not, however, such a mistake as a court of equity will interpose to rectify as against sureties who have at- least an equal equity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">June 17th 1881.

J., the following facts appeared : On October 1st 1872, the Derby Coal Company executed to Ynocencio Casanova a mortgage for $250,000 upon certain lands owned by it in Centre and Clearfield counties. This mortgage was not recorded until March 17th 1873. Immediately after said recording, the interest being unpaid, Casanova instituted proceedings in Clearfield county upon said mortgage, and on November 21st 1874, recovered a judgment against the company thereon for $285,822.12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">On December 4th 1872, E. E. Clow recovered a judgment for the sum of $29,961.03 against the said company in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On February 10th 1873, a writ of error was taken to this judgment by the company to the Supreme Court of the United States, the bond in suit being at the same time filed in compliance with the provisions of the Kevised Statutes of the United States. On October 13th 1874, the Supreme Court of the United States, having heard argument in the cause, dismissed the writ of error. On December 5th 1874, the judgment in the cause was purchased by Casanova and was marked assigned to his use. On December 8th 1874, an assignment of $8,600 of said judgment by Clow to one A. C. Finney, bearing date December 4th 1872, was filed in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">On January 15th 1875, CasanoYa caused a writ of levari facias to be issued upon his judgment in Clearfield county on the mortgage of October 1st 1872, by virtue of which all the mortgaged premises in Centre and Clearfield counties were sold on March 15th 1875, at a judicial sale. Casanova, became himself the purchaser for the price or sum of $85,000. The sheriff made a special return to the effect that Casanova as holder of the judgment upon the mortgage of October 1st 1872, was entitled to the whole proceeds of the sale, and that receipts had accordingly been exchanged with him for the whole of said proceeds. A sheriff\u2019s deed to Casanova was also presented for acknowledgment. Exceptions were filed by A. C. Finney both to the special return and to the acknowledgment, delivery and recording of the deed on the grounds: (1) That the Clow judgment was a prior lien to Casanova\u2019s mortgage upon the properties sold. (2) That therefore the sheriff, had, to the extent of that judgment, no right to make the special return; and, (3) That the sheriff had notice that he would be ruled to bring into court enough of the proceeds of said sale to satisfy that portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of said judgment owned by A. C. Finney. The exceptions to the acknowledgment, delivery and recording of the sheriff\u2019s deed to Casanova were dismissed, and said deed was the same day acknowledged, delivered and recorded. Casanova was, however, ordered to pay the sum of $11,000 into court, and said sum having been placed at interest an issue was awarded between Finney as plaintiff and Casanova as defendant to try: (1) \"Whether Finney was entitled to any part of the Clow judgment. (2) Whether said judgment was a prior lien to Casanova's mortgage of October 1st 1872 ; and, (3) Whether said judgment was entitled to any of the proceeds of the sale under said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">Meantime certain proceedings had been instituted by Finney in the Circuit Court of tbe United States to \u00f1x bis rights in the judgment of Clow <em>v. </em>Derby Coal Company. These culminated in the following decree, which was entered in said suit on January 15 th 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\"><em>\u201c </em>It is adjudged and decreed that \"the assignment by R.

Casanova, dated December 5th 1874 \u2014 is also prior in equity; that any money paid or applicable to said judgment be appropriated to the satisfaction of the amount so assigned to said Finney, according to the tenor of his assignment, before any part thereof is applied to tbe interest of said Casanova therein as aforesaid; and that a copy of this decree be entered on the record of said judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\">Casanova thereupon purchased from Finney all bis rights in said judgment and took an assignment thereof from him. On the trial of the issue in Clearfield county between Finney and Casanova a verdict was rendered for defendant, and on May 30th 1876, the $11,000 deposited by Casanova was by order of court repaid to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\">The present suit was instituted on August 25th 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-11\">Plaintiff made tbe following offer of evidence: \u201c A certified copy of a mortgage dated the 15th day of October 1869 of the Derby Coal Com pany of Pennsylvania to Allen 1Toy, in tbe sum of $150,000.

M. Soteldo, A. Gf. Curtin and William A. Wallace have recognized the rights of Mr. Casanova as the owner and holder of the Allen Hoy bonds and mortgage; that Anderson and Soteldo, as stockholders of the Derby Coal Company, agreed and accepted the proposition in writing from Mr. Casanova, to give him the fullest protection possible, for the payment of the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage, bond and interest, and that Clow was a stockholder of the'Derby Coal Company, and had notice of the mortgage of the 1st of October 1872.

Actual payment does not discharge a judgment in equity if justice requires the parties in interest to be restrained from insisting on their legal rights : Fleming <em>v. </em>Beaver, 2 Rawle 129; Lathrop <em>&amp; </em>Dale\u2019s Appeal, 1 Barr 518 ; Morris <em>v. </em>Oakford, 9 Barr 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">Whether or not the act of the creditor complained of works a discharge of the surety in any case is determined by the effect that act may have on the surety\u2019s increased or diminished liability. If the act or contract of the creditor increases the liability of the surety, it operates as a discharge of the surety, either entirely or pro tanto, according to the Circumstances of each case: Schock <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 Barr 401; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. &amp; S. 36; Holt <em>v. </em>Bodey, 6 Harris 207; Wharton <em>v. </em>Duncan, 2 Norris 40.0</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">Here the circumstances reveal no adequate cause for such discharge. The defendants being stockholders in the company it was to their interest to have the Hoy mortgage satisfied, and they cannot now escape liability on a bond, the validity of which they represented to plaintiff as sufficient ground for entering that satisfaction 'for their benefit: McCullough <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 Harris 436; Diamond Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Fisher, 7 Harris 272 ; Wilkins <em>v. </em>Anderson, 1 Jones 402. Before defendants can disclaim liability they must show that their right of substitution to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Clow judgment is superior in equity to plaintiff\u2019s: Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. &amp; W. 296; Goswiler's Appeal, 3 P. &amp; W. 200; McGinnis\u2019 Appeal, 4 Harris 445; Ziegler <em>v. </em>Long, 2 Watts 206. Their action here clearly precludes them from setting up such claims. A new trial should not be awarded but judgment be entered for plaintiff: Stephens <em>v. </em>Cowan, 6 Watts 514; Mosher <em>v. </em>Small, 5 Barr 224. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-6\"><em>G.

The law appropriated the proceeds to the liens as they stood at the time of sale according to their priority. If Clow had still retained his judgment, plaintiff could not have appropriated the proceeds of sale to his mortgage excluding the first lien : Fleming <em>v. </em>Beaver, 2 Rawle 128; Selden\u2019s Appeal, 24 P. F.

The verdict of the jury in the feigned issue between plaintiff and Finney on this point could not bind defendants, who were not parties thereto: Morrison <em>v. </em>Mullin, 10 Casey 18; Taylor <em>v. </em>Cornelius, 10 P. F. Smith 198; Giltinan <em>v. </em>Strong, 14 P. F.

A feigned issue must be confined to facts: Shutzer <em>v. </em>Herr, 7 Harris 34; Christophers <em>v. </em>Selden, 4 Casey 165; Russel <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Casey 166. And is only conclusive as to facts: Garrison\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 531; Barrett\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 317; Hoxworth <em>v. </em>Miller, 7 Barr 458; Tomb\u2019s Appeal, 9 Barr 61; Martin <em>v. </em>Gernandt, 7 Harris 124. In the present case no facts were involved in the issue. Even if defendants were concluded there are such evident marks of collusion between the plaintiff and the company as to entitle defendants, who are sureties of the company, to inquire collaterally into the proceedings: Postens <em>v. </em>Posteas, 3 W. &amp; S. 135 ; Sheetz <em>v. </em>Hanbest, 31 P.

Plaintiff\u2019s act in attempting to postpone the first lien, viz.: the Clow judgment, to that of his mortgage released the sureties on the bond in suit: Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 36; Holt <em>v. </em>Bodey, 6 Harris 207; Wharton <em>v. </em>Duncan, 2 Norris 40.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aj8U\">June 22d 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-7\">Chief Justice Sharswood</author>\n<p id=\"AB5N\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>This was a joint action against the defendants upon a joint and several bond. The plaintiff might have instituted a several action against each, but as it stands he must recover against all or none. Curtin and Wallace were sureties. It is alleged that the others were stockholders of the Derby Coal Company, and what the equities of the use plaintiff were or would have been against them under the offer of evidence made in the court below it is unnecessary to inquire. The plaintiff claimed to recover against all the defendants. The question then is, had he a right to recover against those of the defendants conceded to bo sureties \u2014 whatever may be the case as to the others. Clow, the legal plaintiff in this suit, which is marked to the use of Casanova, had recovered a judgment against the Derby Coal Company in the Circuit Court of the United States of the western district. Upon this judgment a writ of error was taken out of the Supreme Court of the United States, and to procure a supersedeas of execution the bond in suit was executed by the defendants. The writ of error was dismissed and the bond became absolute. Casanova had made a contract with the Derby Coal Company, \u2014 and he offers to prove that two of the defendants were parties and assenting thereto, \u2014 by which he was to advance a certain amount of money to the company, from which certain bonds secured by a mortgage to Allen Hoy, trustee, were to be extinguished, and a new mortgage given to him. In pursuance of this arrangement satisfaction was actually entered on. the Allen Hoy mortgage, and the new mortgage given. The legal effect of this was that the Clow judgment became the first lien upon the lands of the company. Proceedings were instituted upon the second mortgage, and a sheriff\u2019s sale had, the proceeds of which were appropriated to that mortgage \u2014 no claim having been made on the Clow judgment. In point of fact Casanova bad purchased the Clow judgment, and was the owner of the same. An issue was awarded between him and one Finney to try the right of the latter to a part of that judgment, and a verdiet rendered in favor of Finney. It is agreed that Casanova also purchased his right. This was a proceeding collateral to the question of distribution, and could have no legal eonclusiveness except as between the parties to it. The question then is resolved into this \u2014 whether Casanova, as owner of the Clow judgment, having had a clear right to payment out of the fund raised by the sheriff\u2019s sale, and having neglected to avail himself of it, is not precluded in equity from recovering against the sureties on the bond in suit. If the creditor has the means of satisfaction from the property of the principal in his power and fails to avail himself of it, the surety is discharged. The plaintiff concedes this, but sets up a countervailing equity which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lie contends overcomes it. It is comprised in bis offer of evidence which was rejected by the learned court below, which re? jection forms the subject of complaint in the third assignment of error. In substance be contends that under the circumstanc\u00e9s be is entitled to have the satisfaction of the Hoy mortgage set aside or disregarded, So as to re-establish the priority of the lien of that mortgage \u2014 and to appropriate all the proceeds of the sale on the second mortgage towards payment of it. No fraud is alleged' \u2014 no mistake of such a character as would justify tlie interference of a court of equity. It is indeed probable that the Hoy mortgage was satisfied upon the mistaken idea that the Clow judgment had lost its lien by\u2019the writ of error to the supreme court. It would have been wiser if' Casanova had been advised to take an assignment of the Hoy mortgage, instead of having it satisfied of record. This is not such a mistake, however, as a court of equity would interpose to rectify as against sureties who have at least an equal equity. \"W hen satisfaction was entered on the Hoy mortgage, it was the intention of Casa^ nova to extinguish it. It is true he alleges and offered-to prove, that Anderson and Soteldo, two of tlio obligors, were stockholders of the Derby Coal Company, and agreed and accepted tlie proposition in writing from him, to give him the fullest protection possible for the payment of the second mortgage, and that Clow was also a stockholder, and had notice of that mortgage. But no offer was made to show that Curtin and Wallace had made any such agreement, or even had knowledge of it. No countervailing equity, therefore, was shown as against them. We think that the learned court below were perfectly right in rejecting the evidence offered, and directing a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
