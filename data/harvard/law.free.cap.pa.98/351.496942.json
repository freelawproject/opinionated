Butterbaugh (the appellant) as trustee under the will of Jacob Butterbaugh, deceased, be so stated that certain expenses and charges, paid by the trustee, should be charged to the corpus of the trust fund and not to the annual income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-14\">Jacob\" Butterbaugh, the testator, by his will, proved April 11th 1871, directed as follows: \u201c It is my will, and I do hereby so direct, that the shares of my daughters, Mary Hollinger and Susan Stroek, in my estate, shall be put to interest, and the same paid to the said Mary and Susan, annually. But it is my will, that if their husbands should die before them, then, and in that case, their respective shares shall be subject to their immediate use and control. But in case of the decease of the said Mary Hollinger or Susan Stroek, before their husbands, then, and in that event, it is my will, that their respective shares in my estate shall go to their children on their attaining the age of twenty-one years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-15\">The testator appointed no executor or trustee and John J. Butterbaugh was appointed administrator, <em>c. t. a. </em>and the (Orphans\u2019 Court also appointed him trustee under the will. In his account, filed as trustee as to the share of Mary Hollinger, he claimed credit, inter alia, for the following items: Counsel fee, register and clerk, $20.35 ; taxes paid on money at interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>$46.01; allowance to accountant, $24; one third costs of audit, $12.77; tolalj $103.13. The account was referred to an auditor and upon exceptions to his report, the court, in an opinion by Rowe, P. J., decided, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">\u201cThe account ought to be so stated that the expenses and charges will come out of the fund, and not out of the annual interest, for Mrs. Mary Hollinger is the primary object of the testator\u2019s bounty. It is in the hands of a trustee only to protect it from the husband. It is intended that she shall have all possible benefit from the fund, consistent with its being in the hands of a trustee. She is to have the interest annually without deductions, for the principal is not to be preserved for some one else.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">\u25a0 The said items, amounting to $103.13, were accordingly charged against the principal of the trust estate. The said trustee thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error the decree that the said sum of $103.13, should be paid out of the principal instead of out of the income.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-8\"><em>W. U. Brewer </em>( <em>W. Rush </em>Gillan, with him), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXz\">The trust under the will of Jacob Butterbaugh was not only to protect the estate from the husband of Mrs. Hollinger, but also, in case she should die before her husband, to preserve her share intact for her children. The charges for administration of the trust and for taxes on money at interest should therefore be paid. out of the income. If such payments be made out of the capital, the latter will be gradually consumed, and the time may come when there may be no fund left, and consequently no annual income. The children may then claim the whole corpus of the fund and the decree entered in the court below would afford the trustee no protection: Spangler\u2019s Estate, 9 Harris, 335.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-9\"><em>W. F. </em>Patton, for Mrs. Mary Hollinger, appellee, did not appear, and presented no paper book.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AcDa\">October 3rd, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-10\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">delivered the opinion of the court</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">It was held in Spangler\u2019s Estate, 9 Harris 335, that the interest and not the principal of a trust fund must bear the expense of administering it. Were it otherwise, the entire principal might bo absorbed in paying the trustee\u2019s commissions upon income. A trustee is entitled to a reasonable compensation for his services as they are rendered, and unless a contrary intention appear, the compensation must come out of the income of the fund in the administration of which it is earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered that the sura of $103.13, composed of an allowance for compensation to the accountant, taxes paid by him, and sundry costs and ex-. [Deuses connected with the filing of the account, and the audit thereof, be paid out of the principal of the fund, upon the ground that'the cestui que trust was the primary object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and that it was the intent of said testator that she should have \u201c all possible benefit from the fund consistent with its being in the hands of a trustee.\u201d The difficulty in this view of the case is that the will of Jacob Butterbaugh expressly provides that in case of the decease of Mary Ilollinger, the cestui que trust, before her husband, the share of said Mary in the testator\u2019s estate shall go to her children on their attaining the age of twenty-one years. It is her share that is to go to her children upon the contingency referred to; not what may be left of it. Such share cannot be preserved unless the income of the fund is made to bear the cost of its administration. The case does not need elaboration. It is ruled by Spangler\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The decree is reversed, and it is now ordered that the aforesaid sum of $103.13, and the costs upon this appeal, be paid by the appellee. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
