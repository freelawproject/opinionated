In 1967, he elected to participate in the optional retirement program established under article 125-A and became a member of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA), which operates the program. Article 125-A allows certain employees of the Board of Higher Education in the City of New York to elect to participate in the optional program as an alternative to membership in the New York City teachers\u2019 or employees\u2019 retirement systems (see Education Law, \u00a7 6253, subds 1, 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The optional program provides \u201cfor the purchase of contracts providing retirement and death benefits for or on behalf of electing employees\u201d, which contracts are purchased through contributions by the city and employee, \u201cto the extent authorized or required\u201d, and are issued to and and become the property of the employee (Education Law, \u00a7 6251, subd 1). The board designates the insurer to which the contributions are to be paid and approves the form and content of contracts purchased <em>(id., </em>subd 2). The board is also authorized to provide for the administration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>optional program and to perform or authorize performance of the functions necessary thereto <em>(id., </em>subd 3). The city and board are not parties to the contract purchased under the optional program and are not liable for retirement or death benefits provided through the program; such benefits are payable by the insurer under the terms of the contract (\u00a7 6255). Contributions are governed by section 6252, which specifies that 3% of an employee\u2019s salary shall be deducted by the comptroller as the employee contribution, except that the employee contribution shall be assumed by the city \u201cduring such period as either section seventy-a of the retirement and social security law or section B3-36.1 or section B20-41.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York provides that the contribution of any member of the New York city employees\u2019 retirement system or the New York city teachers\u2019 retirement system in the employ of the city shall be reduced by at least eight percentum of his compensation\u201d (Education Law, \u00a7 6252, subd 2). The final proviso to subdivision 2 of section 6252 provides that \u201cnotwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this subdivision to the contrary\u201d, the city shall make the employee contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1,1972 and ending June 30, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Until July, 1977, the city paid the 3% employee contribution. At that time, however, the comptroller began deducting from petitioner\u2019s salary the employee contribution at the rate of 1.5% of his salary. The city took the position that the reduction by one half of its obligation to pay the employee contribution was required by subdivision b of section 480 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which, although extending to 1981 any program set to expire in 1974 \u201cunder which an employer in a public retirement system funded by the state or one of its political subdivisions assumes all or part of the contribution which would otherwise be made by its employees toward retirement\u201d, reduces by one half the rate of contribution \u201cassumed by an employer in any of the public retirement systems funded and maintained by a city\u201d for the period January 1, 1976 to July 1,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">When the city declined petitioner\u2019s request to cease withholding the portion of his salary, he commenced this article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>78 proceeding, alleging that the deduction was unauthorized in that the optional program was privately operated and thus not within the terms of subdivision b of section 480. Following respondents\u2019 unsuccessful cross motion to dismiss on the grounds of laches and Statute of Limitations, and after service of an answer, Special Term granted the petition on the ground that the optional program was a private retirement system to which subdivision b Spf section 480 did not apply. The Appellate Division affirmed and granted leave to appeal to this court. For the reasons that follow, there should be a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Respondents urge that the optional retirement program, though privately operated by TIAA, is a public retirement system within the meaning of subdivision b of section 480. In support, respondents point to the history of subdivision 2 of section 6252 and subdivision b of section 480 and to the absence of other authority for the city to assume any part of the employee contribution. To the contrary, petitioner, asserting that the optional retirement program is a private system, maintains that subdivision b of section 480 is inapplicable because it applies only to public retirement systems. Since there is no doubt that a private retirement system is beyond the reach of subdivision b of section 480, the inquiry is whether the optional program is a private or public system within the meaning of the statute. It is concluded that the optional program is a public retirement system for purposes of subdivision b of section 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">;</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It is recognized that the optional retirement program created by article 125-A has certain attributes that are of a private nature. The program provides that retirement and death benefits are payable from a private source, the insurer with whom the employee contracts, rather than the city. Additionally, TIAA, a private entity, operates the program. These aspects of the program, however, cannot and do not negate the aspects of the program that connect it to the public and bring it within the reach of subdivision b of section 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Of telling significance is that the program is offered by a public entity, is available to public employees and is funded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>by contributions made by the public employer. Moreover, the board is charged with designating the insurer and approving the form and content of the contracts under which benefits are paid to electing employees. Authority to administer the program is vested in the board, which may perform or authorize performance of functions necessary to administration. Quite simply, the program operates under public authority for the benefit of public employees. The program is an alternative to other established public retirement systems and is merely another means for the city to provide retirement benefits to its employees. That the alternative relieves the city of certain burdens borne under then existing retirement systems does not mean the program is any less a public retirement system for purposes of subdivision b of section 480. Thus, the optional program does come within the language of subdivision b of section 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Additionally, the history and operation of subdivision 2 of section 6252 and subdivision b of section 480 show that the optional program was intended to benefit from the extension provided by subdivision b of section 480. The optional program originally obligated the city to assume the 3 % employee contribution only during the periods when the contribution of any member of the city employees\u2019 or teachers\u2019 retirement systems was being reduced by 8% <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1965, ch 1028). In 1970, apparently in anticipation of a decrease in the reduction of employee contributions for certain members of the teachers\u2019 retirement system and to assure continued payment by the city of the employee contribution for members of the optional program (see NY Legis Ann, 1970, p 189), a clause was added to subdivision 2 of section 6252 to provide that the city assume the employee contribution for fiscal year July 1,1970 to June 30,1971 without regard to the percentage reduction of contributions for members of the employees\u2019 and teachers\u2019 retirement systems (Education Law, \u00a7 6252, subd 2, as amd by L 1970, ch 771, \u00a7 2). That clause was twice amended to extend the city\u2019s obligation for fiscal years 1971-1972 (Education Law, \u00a7 6252, subd 2, as amd by L1971, ch 611, \u00a7 2) and 1972-1973 (Education Law, \u00a7 6252, subd 2, as amd by L 1972, ch 375, \u00a7 2). During the 1970-1973 period, the rate of reduction in em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ployee contributions did not reach 8% / Thus, as of June 30, 1973, nothing in subdivision 2 of section 6252 of the Education Law specifically authorized or obligated the city to assume the 3 % employee contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The city\u2019s obligation, however, was indeed continued beyond 1973. By section 2 of chapter 383 of the Laws of 1973, the Legislature introduced the predecessor to subdivision b of section 480, providing that \u201c[a]ny program under which an employer in a public retirement system funded by the state or political subdivision thereof assumes all or part of the contribution which would be otherwise made by its employees toward retirement, which expires on or before August thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-three, shall be extended until August thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-three.\u201d In the Extraordinary Session of that year, the Legislature amended section 2 of chapter 383 to extend to June 30, 1974 the programs under which a public employer assumed employee contributions (L 1973, ch 1046, \u00a766). Significantly, the fiscal note to this legislation, summitted pursuant to section 50 of the Legislative Law, expressly points to the costs to New York City of extending the optional retirement program (see Fiscal Note, Part V, reprinted in McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, 1973, pp 1957,1959). The Legislature again extended such programs until July 1, 1976, adding subdivision b of section 480 to the Retirement and Social Security Law (L 1974, ch 510, \u00a7 24).1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In 1975, at the height of the city\u2019s fiscal crisis, the Legislature amended subdivision b of section 480, by adding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>clause that from January to June, 1976 the rate of contribution \u201cassumed by an employer in any of the public retirement systems funded and maintained by a city, shall be one-half of the rate of such contribution assumed by such employer for the immediately preceding payroll period\u201d (Retirement and Social Security Law, \u00a7 480, subd b, as added by L 1974, ch 510, \u00a7 24, as amd by L 1975, ch 892, \u00a7 1). Through subsequent amendments, the programs under which an employer in a public retirement system assumed employee contributions and the city\u2019s modified obligations were extended to July 1,1981 (Retirement and Social Security Law, \u00a7 480, subd b, as added by L 1974, ch 510, \u00a7 24, as amd by L 1975, ch 892, \u00a7 1, as amd by L 1976, ch 491, \u00a7 2, as amd by L 1977, ch 347, \u00a7 1, as amd by L 1978, ch 464, \u00a7 7, as amd by L 1979, ch 321, \u00a7 7). Thus, the city\u2019s obligation to assume employee contributions under the optional program was extended by subdivision b of section 480 and its predecessors, but was modified by requiring the city to assume only one half of the employee contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In sum, the statutory development in subdivision 2 of section 6252 of the Education Law and subdivision b of section 480 of the Retirement and Social Security Law lead to the conclusion that the city lawfully deducted from petitioner\u2019s salary the employee contribution at a rate of 1.5% of his salary. The term \u201cpublic retirement system\u201d under subdivision b of section 480 has not been statutorily defined to exclude the optional program from its scope and the indicia of a public system evident in the optional program and the language and history of subdivision b of section 480 indicate that members of the program indeed were to benefit from the extension. Nothing has been brought to the court\u2019s attention that compels a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\">. During the 1970-1973 period, the rate of reduction in employee contributions authorized by section B3-36.1 of the New York City Administrative Code did not reach 8% (see Administrative Code of City of New York, \u00a7 B3-36.1, subd m, par 1, els [i]-[k] ; par 2, els [h]-[j]). Under section B20-41.1 of the code, for fiscal year 1970-1971, the authorized rate of reduction in employee contributions was 5%, contingent upon passage of certain legislation, or <em>8% </em>in the event the legislation failed (Administrative Code, \u00a7 B20-41.1, subds m, n), and for fiscal years 1971-1972 and 1972-1973 the rate was 5% <em>(id., </em>subds o, p). The Administrative Code does not itself provide for reduction beyond 1973 and the rate last authorized by sections B3-36.1 or B20-41.1 did not reach 8%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">. Here too, the fiscal note points to the costs to the city of extending increased take-home pay provisions (see Fiscal Note, Part III, reprinted in McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, 1974, pp 681, 683).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
