The renewal provision is not so indefinite as to render it unenforceable. <em>(Forma v Moran, </em>273 App Div 818; <em>Huber v Ruby, </em>188 Misc 1001, 272 App Div 779; <em>Sammis v Town of Huntington, </em>104 Misc 7,186 App Div 463; <em>May Metropolitan Corp. v May Oil Burner Corp., </em>290 NY 260; <em>Konitzky v Meyer, </em>49 NY 571; <em>Park Inn Hotel v Messing, </em>31 Misc 2d 961.) II. There is much authority in the law of sister States to support a holding that the renewal provision is valid and enforceable. III. The rules governing the construction of leases, and of contracts in general, support a finding that the renewal clause is valid and enforceable. <em>(Levinson v Shapiro, </em>238 App Div 158; <em>Kotcher v Edelblute, </em>250 NY 178; <em>O\u2019Neil Supply Co. v Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>280 NY 50; <em>Kirke La Shelie Co. v Armstrong Co., </em>263 NY 79; <em>Brooklyn Bus Corp. v City of New York, </em>274 NY 140; <em>Muzak Corp. v Hotel Taft Corp., </em>1 NY2d 42; <em>Corhill Corp. v S.

Pursuant to section 2-305 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the parties, if they so intend, may enter into a binding contractual commitment even though the exact price is not settled. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the amount to be paid is left to be agreed upon by the parties, and the parties fail to agree, the price is deemed to be a reasonable one given the prevailing market conditions. V. The general principles underlying equity jurisdiction dictate that the renewal clause be deemed enforceable. <em>(Flushing Nat. Bank v Municipal Assistance Corp. for City of N. Y., </em>84 Misc 2d 976; <em>Kaminsky v Kahn, </em>23 AD2d 231; <em>Madison Sq. Garden Corp. v Universal Pictures Co., </em>255 App Div 459; <em>World of Food v New York World\u2019s Fair 1964.-1965 Corp., </em>22 AD2d 278; <em>Washer v Seager, </em>272 App Div 297; <em>Crippen v Spies, </em>255 App Div 411; <em>Pezenick v Greenberg, </em>251 App Div 866; <em>Tai On Luck Corp. v Cirota, </em>35 AD2d 380.) VI. That the court in its day-to-day functioning sets reasonable values in a wide variety of cases indicates that the court is capable of doing so in the present instance. VII. The court below acted appropriately in reversing both Special Term\u2019s order of summary judgment and its order denying Martin\u2019s motion to consolidate the present action with that pending in the District Court, commenced by Schumacher to recover the premises in question. VIII. The procedure posited by the Honorable Joseph A. Suozzi in his concurring opinion requiring the court to immediately undertake to determine a reasonable rental for the premises in question should be followed rather than the two-step procedure set forth in the majority opinion. <em>(Moolenaar v Co-Build Cos., </em>354 F Supp 980; <em>Tai On Luck Corp. v Cirota, </em>35 AD2d 380; <em>Frankel v Tremont Norman Motors Corp., </em>10 AD2d 680, 8 NY2d 901.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-4\"><em>David S.

The renewal provision was an agreement to agree in the future and was so indefinite as to be unenforceable. <em>(Forma v Moran, </em>273 App Div 818; <em>Willmott v Giarraputo, </em>5 NY2d 250.) II. The authority in the law of sister States is not controlling in this State. III. Had the Legislature intended the law as set forth in section 2-305 of the Uniform Commercial Code to extend beyond sales contracts, it would have enacted similar legislation within other laws.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Fuchsberg, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">This case raises an issue fundamental to the law of contracts. It calls upon us to review a decision of the Appellate Division, which held that a realty lease\u2019s provision that the rent for a renewal period was \u201cto be agreed upon\u201d may be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Thqqrertinent factual and procedural contexts in which thef\"case reaches this court are uncomplicated. In 1973, the appellant, as landlord, leased a retail store to the respondent for a five-year term at a rent graduated upwards from $500 per month for the first year to $650 for the fifth. The renewal clause stated that \u201c[t]he Tenant may renew this lease for an additional period of five years at annual rentals to be agreed upon; Tenant shall give Landlord thirty (30) days written notice, to be mailed certified mail, return receipt requested, of the intention to exercise such right\u201d. It is not disputed that the tenant gave timely notice of its desire to renew or that, once the landlord made it clear that he would do so only at a rental starting at $900 a month, the tenant engaged an appraiser who opined that a fair market rental value would be $545.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The tenant thereupon commenced an action for specific performance in Supreme Court, Suffolk County, to compel the landlord to extend the lease for the additional term at the appraiser\u2019s figure or such other sum as the court would decide was reasonable. For his part, the landlord in due course brought a holdover proceeding in the local District Court to evict the tenant. On the landlord\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Supreme Court, holding that a bald agreement to agree on a future rental was unenforceable for uncertainty as a matter of law, dismissed the tenant\u2019s complaint. Concordantly, it denied as moot the tenant\u2019s motion to remove the District Court case to the Supreme Court and to consolidate the two suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It was on appeal by the tenant from these orders that the Appellate Division, expressly overruling an established line of cases in the process, reinstated the tenant\u2019s complaint and granted consolidation. In so doing, it reasoned that \u201ca renewal clause in a lease providing for future agreement on the rent to be paid during the renewal term is enforceable if it is established that the parties\u2019 intent was not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>terminate in the event of a failure to agree\u201d. It went on to provide that, if the tenant met that burden, the trial court could proceed to set a \u201creasonable rent\u201d. One of the Justices, concurring, would have eliminated the first step and required the trial court to proceed directly to the fixation of the rent. Each party now appeals by leave of the Appellate Division pursuant to CPLR, 5602 (subd [b], par 1). The tenant seeks only a modification adopting the concurred position. The question formally certified to us by the Appellate Division is simply whether its order was properly made. Since we conclude that the disposition at the Supreme Court was the correct one, our answer must be in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">We begin our analysis with the basic observation that, unless otherwise mandated by law (e.g., residential emergency rent control statutes), a contract is a private \u201cordering\u201d in which a party binds himself to do, or not to do, a particular thing <em>(Fletcher v Peck, </em>6 Cranch [10 US] 87, 136; Hart and Sachs, Legal Process, 147-148 [1958]). This liberty is no right at all if it is not accompanied by freedom not to contract. The corollary is that, before one may secure redress in our courts because another has failed to honor a promise, it must appear that the promisee assented to the obligation in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">It also follows that, before the power of law can be invoked to enforce a promise, it must be sufficiently certain and specific so that what was promised can be ascertained. Otherwise, a court, in intervening, would be imposing its own conception of what the parties should or might have undertaken, rather than confining itself to the implementation of a bargain to which they have mutually committed themselves. Thus, definiteness as to material matters is of the very essence in contract law. Impenetrable vagueness and uncertainty will not do (1 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 95, p 394; 6 Encyclopedia of New York Law, Contracts, \u00a7 301; Restatement, Contracts 2d, \u00a7 32, Comment <em>a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Dictated by these principles, it is rightfully well settled in the common law of contracts in this State that a mere agreement to agree, in which a material term is left for future negotiations, is unenforceable <em>(Willmott v Giar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>raputo, </em>5 NY2d 250, 253; <em>Sourwine v Truscott, </em>17 Hun 432, 434).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This is especially true of the amount to be paid for the sale or lease of real property (see <em>Forma v Moran, </em>273 App Div 818; <em>Huber v Ruby, </em>187 Misc 967, 969, app dsmd 271 App Div 927; see, generally, 58 ALR 3d 500, Validity and Enforceability of Provision for Renewal of Lease at Rental to be Fixed by Subsequent Agreement of the Parties). The rule applies all the more, and not the less, when, as here, the extraordinary remedy of specific performance is sought (11 Williston, Contracts [Jaeger 3d ed], \u00a7 1424; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 1405).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">This is not to say that the requirement for definiteness in the case before us now could only have been met by explicit expression of the rent to be paid. The concern is with substance, not form. It certainly would have sufficed, for instance, if a methodology for determining the rent was to be found within the four corners of the lease, for a rent so arrived at would have been the end product of agreement between the parties themselves. Nor would the agreement have failed for indefiniteness because it invited recourse to an objective extrinsic event, condition or standard on which the amount was made to depend. All of these, <em>inter alia, </em>would have come within the embrace of the maxim that what can be made certain is certain (9 Coke 47a). (Cf. <em>Backer Mgt. Corp. v Acme Quilting Co., </em>46 NY2d 211, 219 [escalation of rent keyed to building employees\u2019 future wage increases]; <em>City of Hope v Fisk Bldg. Assoc., </em>63 AD2d 946 [rental increase to be adjusted for upward movement in US Consumer Price Index]; see, generally, 87 ALR3d 986; Lease Provisions Providing for Rent Adjustment Based on Event or Formula Outside Control of Parties.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">But the renewal clause here in fact contains no such in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>gredients. Its unrevealing, unamplified language speaks to no more than \u201cannual rentals to be agreed upon\u201d. Its simple words leave no room for legal construction or resolution of ambiguity. Neither tenant nor landlord is bound to any formula. There is not so much as a hint at a commitment to be bound by the \u201cfair market rental value\u201d which the tenant\u2019s expert reported or the \u201creasonable rent\u201d the Appellate Division would impose, much less any definition of either. Nowhere is there an inkling that either of the parties directly or indirectly assented, upon accepting the clause, to subordinate the figure on which it ultimately would insist, to one fixed judicially, as the Appellate Division decreed be done, or, for that matter, by an arbitrator or other third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Finally, in this context, we note that the tenant\u2019s reliance on <em>May Metropolitan Corp. v May Oil Burner Corp. </em>(290 NY 260) is misplaced. There the parties had executed a franchise agreement for the sale of oil burners. The contract provided for annual renewal, at which time each year\u2019s sales quota was \u201cto be mutually agreed upon\u201d. In holding that the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been denied, the court indicated that the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to establish that a series of annual renewals had ripened into a course of dealing from which it might be possible to give meaning to an otherwise uncertain term. This decision, in the more fluid sales setting in which it occurred, may be seen as a precursor to the subsequently enacted Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s treatment of open terms in contracts for the sale of goods (see Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 1-205, subd <em>[1]; </em>\u00a7 2-204, subd [3]; see, also, Restatement, Contracts 2d, \u00a7 249). As the tenant candidly concedes, the code, by its very terms, is limited to the sale of goods. The <em>May </em>case is therefore not applicable to real estate contracts. Stability is a hallmark of the law controlling such transactions (see <em>Heyert v Orange &amp; Rockland Utilities, </em>17 NY2d 352, 362).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">For all these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the orders of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, reinstated. The certified question, therefore, should be answered in the negative. As to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s appeal, since that party was not aggrieved by the order of the Appellate Division, the appeal should be dismissed (CPLR 5511), without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\"> Other States which are in accord include: Arkansas <em>(Lutterloh v Patterson, </em>211 Ark 814) ; Maine <em>(Metcalf Auto Co. v Norton, </em>119 Me 103); Missouri <em>(State ex rel. Johnson v Blair, </em>351 Mo 1072; North Carolina <em>(Young v Sweet, </em>266 NC 623); Oregon <em>(Karamanos v Hamm, </em>267 Ore 1); and Rhode Island <em>(Vartabedian v Peerless Wrench Co., </em>46 RI 472). But see: Alaska <em>(Hammond v Ringstad, </em>10 Alaska 543); Arizona <em>(Hall v Weatherford, </em>32 Ariz 370); California <em>(Chaney v Schneider, </em>92 Cal App 2d 88); Ohio <em>(Moss v Olson, </em>148 Ohio St 625); and Tennessee <em>(Playmate Clubs v Country Clubs, </em>62 Tenn App 383).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b150-5\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">(concurring). While I concur in the result because the facts of this case do not fit the rule of <em>May Metropolitan Corp. v May Oil Burner Corp. </em>(290 NY 260), I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s rejection of that case as necessarily inapplicable to litigation concerning leases. That the setting of that case was commercial and that its principle is now incorporated in a statute (the Uniform Commercial Code) which by its terms is not applicable to real estate is irrelevant to the question whether the principle can be applied in real estate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As we recognized in <em>Farrell Lines v City of New York </em>(30 NY2d 76, 82, quoting from <em>A.Z.A. Realty Corp. v Harrigan\u2019s Cafe, </em>113 Misc 141, 147): \u201cAn agreement of lease possesses no peculiar sanctity requiring the application of rules of construction different from those applicable to an ordinary contract.\u201d To the extent that the majority opinion can be read as holding that no course of dealing between the parties to a lease could make a clause providing for renewal at a rental \u201cto be agreed upon\u201d enforceable I do not concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b150-7\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHO\">(dissenting in part). While I recognize that the traditional rule is that a provision for renewal of a lease must be \u201ccertain\u201d in order to render it binding and enforceable, in my view the better rule would be that if the tenant can establish its entitlement to renewal under the lease, the mere presence of a provision calling for renewal at \u201crentals to be agreed upon\u201d should not prevent judicial intervention to fix rent at a reasonable rate in order to avoid a forfeiture. Therefore, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Division for the reasons stated in the opinion of Justice Leon D. Lazer at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur with Judge Fuchsberg; Judge Meyer concurs in a memorandum; Judge Jasen dissents in part and on defendant\u2019s appeal votes to affirm in a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">On defendant\u2019s appeal: Order reversed, with costs, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>orders of Supreme Court, Suffolk County, reinstated and the question certified answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">On plaintiff\u2019s appeal: Appeal dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
