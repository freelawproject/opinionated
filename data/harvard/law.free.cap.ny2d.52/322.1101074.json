Although the right to counsel on the unrelated charge indelibly attaches upon the issuance of an accusatory instrument or warrant on that charge and in relation to that charge proscribes waiver of counsel in the absence of counsel, the unrelated charge is pertinent to the suspect\u2019s right to counsel on a new charge only if the suspect is in fact represented by counsel on the unrelated charge. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>appearing from this record that defendant Kazmarick was not represented on the unrelated charge, his right to counsel was not violated by subjecting him to a lie detector test to which he consented, or by questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The order of the Appellate Division affirming defendant\u2019s conviction on his plea of guilty should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Defendant, an alcoholic, was a suspect in the arson deaths of five persons in the Village of Monticello in Sullivan County. On the day of the fire he consented to take a polygraph test, but the test was aborted because his state of intoxication at the time rendered any result unreliable. The next day defendant was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, assault on a police officer, escape, and criminal mischief. Counsel was appointed for him on those charges, which were satisfied by defendant\u2019s plea at arraignment in the Village Court to the disorderly conduct charge. Defendant was sentenced to a 15-day term in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Two days after his incarceration for disorderly conduct, defendant was scheduled to appear in the Justice Court of the Town of Thompson, a neighboring jurisdiction, on a pending five-month-old shoplifting charge for which he had been given a desk appearance ticket. When he failed to appear on that charge the Town of Thompson Justice issued an arrest warrant for defendant which was filed with the Sullivan County Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Upon the expiration of his disorderly conduct sentence, defendant, now sober, was met at the jail by the detectives investigating the arson and taken once again for a polygraph test. No attempt was made to execute the shoplifting warrant. After the second test defendant was told that his answers were untruthful. He then admitted that he had unintentionally set a fire in the stairwell which he tried but failed to stamp out and that he then \u201cgot scared\u201d and ran home.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Defendant was indicted for five counts of murder in the second degree on the theory that he had demonstrated a depraved indifference to human life. His pretrial motion to suppress his confession having been denied after a hearing, defendant pleaded guilty to five charges of criminally negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>gent homicide. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On this appeal defendant argues that his confession was obtained in violation of his right to counsel, that the evidence before the Grand Jury was insufficient to sustain the indictment because his confession was not corroborated, that it was not voluntary, and that his arrest and incarceration on the disorderly conduct charge was but a pretext to sober him up for the polygraph test and, therefore, improper conduct on the part of the People. The sufficiency of the evidence presented to the Grand Jury cannot now be raised because as we held in <em>People v Clairborne </em>(29 NY2d 950, 951), \u201cA bargained guilty plea to a lesser crime makes unnecessary a factual basis for the particular crime confessed.\u201d The Trial Judge found the confession to have been voluntary and that incarceration on the disorderly conduct charge was not a pretext. Those findings having been affirmed by the Appellate Division are now beyond our consideration. We therefore discuss only defendant\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">With respect to the right to counsel, defendant relying principally on <em>People v Samuels </em>(49 NY2d 218) and <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167), claims that the pendency of the shoplifting complaint in combination with the issuance of the arrest warrant caused his right to counsel to attach \u201cindeliblv\u201d on the unrelated arson case (see <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154, 165). Therefore, argues defendant, he could not waive counsel in counsel\u2019s absence and his confession must be suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Both <em>Samuels </em>and <em>Rogers </em>deal with when the right to counsel indelibly attaches and, therefore, may not be waived in counsel\u2019s absence. The line of cases of which <em>Samuels </em>is a recent manifestation holds that upon the commencement of formal adversary proceedings the right arises, without regard to whether defendant in fact has or has requested counsel <em>(People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d 203, 208). Proceedings are commenced, we have held, upon the filing of a felony complaint <em>(People v Samuels, supra), </em>upon indictment (P<em>eople v Settles, supra), </em>as well as upon arraignment (P<em>eople v Meyer, </em>11 NY2d 162). As expressed in <em>Settles (supra, </em>at p 163), the justification for this principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>is that when \u201cthe character of the police function shifts from investigatory to accusatory\u201d the assistance of counsel becomes \u201cindispensable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The right to counsel may, however, \u201cindelibly attach\u201d apart from the commencement of formal adversary proceedings. As we recognized in <em>Cunningham </em>(49 NY2d, at p 208), there is a second distinct line of cases beginning with <em>People v Donovan </em>(13 NY2d 148) and running through <em>People v Arthur </em>(22 NY2d 325) and <em>People v Hobson </em>(39 NY2d 479), which articulates the rule that a suspect who has retained or been assigned counsel may not be questioned about the specific charge on which he is being held in the absence of counsel. That rule was extended in <em>People v Rogers (supra), </em>to bar questioning of a suspect who is in custody and represented by an attorney, about matters unrelated to the charge on which he is being held, in <em>People v Cunningham (supra), </em>to a suspect in custody not yet represented by counsel but who has requested counsel, and in <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24) to one not in custody but who is questioned about a matter under investigation in relation to which he is known by the officials to have obtained counsel. The predicates for this branch of the counsel rule are fundamental fairness, the belief that an attorney\u2019s presence is the most effective means of minimizing the disadvantage of the accused person in custody, and the recognition that an unrepresented defendant in custody who has requested an attorney has indicated his own belief that without legal advice he is not competent to deal with those in whose custody he is being held <em>(People v Cuningham, supra, </em>at pp 207-209). That ruling, we said in <em>Hobson </em>and reiterated in <em>Cunningham </em>(at p 208), \u201cbreathes life into the requirement that a waiver of a constitutional right must be competent, intelligent and voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Defendant in an overly simplistic lumping of the two lines of cases argues from <em>Samuels </em>that the arrest warrant and accusatory instrument<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the shoplifting charge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a nonwaivable right to counsel and from <em>Rogers </em>that attachment of that right prevented interrogation on any other criminal matter. While the filing of an accusatory instrument triggers a right to counsel with respect to the charge made by the accusatory instrument, the right to counsel and representation by counsel are not the same thing. The fact that defendant Kazmarick may have been entitled to counsel on the shoplifting charge does not require, automatically and in all events, acting as though he was in fact represented by counsel and, therefore, protected even as to an unrelated charge. Simply put, the legal fiction of representation indulged by the <em>Samuels </em>line of cases is not tantamount to the actual or requested representation protected by the <em>Roger s-Cunningham </em>line. To accept the \u201cstrict liability\u201d rule for which defendant argues would tax law enforcement officials anywhere with knowledge of accusatory instruments on unrelated charges everywhere, and unnecessarily and unrealistically limit police interrogation procedures (see <em>People v Servidlo, 77 </em>AD2d 191; cf. <em>People v Miller, </em>76 AD2d 576).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">This is not to say that law enforcement officials may never be chargeable with knowledge that defendant is in fact represented by counsel, or has requested counsel on an unrelated charge, in such a way as to cut off their rights to interrogate except in the presence of, or after waiver made in the presence of, counsel. Though the emphasis in the <em>Rogers </em>line of cases has been upon actual awareness by the police that defendant has counsel <em>(People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56, 59; <em>People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592, 599; <em>People v Blake, </em>35 NY2d 331, 338; <em>People v Arthur, supra, </em>at p 329), we noted in <em>People v Cunningham (supra, </em>at p 209), that the police may not obtain a waiver of the right to counsel \u201cin the absence of counsel once they know or have reason to know that an attorney has become involved in the case,\u201d and in <em>People v Garofolo, (supra), </em>and <em>People v Pinzon </em>(44 NY2d 458) we have held a county police department barred on constructive notice principles from interrogating a suspect in its custody in one of its office by notice given to central police headquarters that the suspect was represented by counsel. None of our decisions go so far, however, as to hold the police bound because they had reason to know of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>another </em>charge on which defendant\u2019s right to counsel has attached, as defendant urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We do not find it necessary on the present record to determine whether or under what circumstances knowledge, actual or constructive, by the police of a pending unrelated charge against defendant will be sufficient to put them on notice that defendant is in fact represented by counsel on that charge and, therefore, may not be interrogated on the new matter, absent waiver of counsel in the presence of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Obviously, if the suspect informs the police that he has a lawyer on an unrelated pending case his right to counsel on the new matter will indelibly attach and bar interrogation <em>(People v Cunningham, supra; People v Servidio, supra). </em>Short of such direct advice, however, even actual knowledge by the police that there is a pending unrelated charge, such as defendant Kazmarick\u2019s shoplifting offense, cannot charge them with any more information than would have been revealed had the police made reasonable inquiry concerning whether defendant in fact had counsel on the unrelated charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Though the record shows that the detective sergeant who took defendant to both polygraph tests was aware of the shoplifting charge appearance ticket, any inquiry made would have revealed that defendant Kazmarick was not represented on that charge, for his brief on this appeal concedes that he \u201chad failed to appear in Court [on the shoplifting charge] since his arrest the previous November\u201d and argues only that with the issuance of the arrest warrant \u201cKazmarick\u2019s right to an attorney attached,\u201d not that he ever had counsel on that charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, defendant\u2019s right to counsel on the second degree murder charges had not indelibly attached as a consequence of either that pending case or warrant so as to require suppression of his subsequent confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. A misdemeanor information was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. On this appeal defendant does not suggest that assignment of counsel on the disorderly conduct matter affected the right of the police to question him concerning the murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">. <em>People v Servidio, supra, </em>rejected a constructive knowledge-strict liability approach. Without accepting or rejecting that conclusion, we note that proximity in time and geographical location would, as <em>Servidlo </em>suggests, have important bearing, as would the seriousness of the pending unrelated charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">. The People\u2019s brief, to which no reply was filed, states flatly that on the petty larceny charge \u201cno counsel had been retained or appointed\u201d for Kazmarick.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b368-5\">Chief Judge Cooke</author>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">(dissenting). Because I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s right to counsel analysis, I dissent, vote to reverse the conviction and grant the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167), this court held that once a defendant is represented by counsel, he may not be questioned in the absence of counsel either on the charge for which the attorney was retained or assigned or on any unrelated charge. This ruling extended the established New York principle that a represented defendant obtains an \u201cindelible\u201d right to counsel which cannot be waived unless counsel is present. Whether the <em>Rogers </em>rationale also precludes questioning on unrelated charges where defendant obtains an \u201cindelible\u201d right to counsel other than by actual representation is the question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">As the majority concedes, since an accusatory instrument and an arrest warrant were filed against defendant in connection with an unrelated shoplifting charge, defendant possessed a right to counsel which could not be waived in the absence of counsel <em>(People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218, 222-223). What the majority refuses to acknowledge, however, is that once this \u201cindelible\u201d right to counsel attaches it prohibits questioning in the absence of counsel, not only as to the charge on which defendant is entitled to a lawyer, but also as to all unrelated charges <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, the rationale of <em>Rogers </em>itself\u2014 that law enforcement officials should not be permitted to circumvent the right to counsel by the simple expedient of questioning on unrelated charges \u2014 requires this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">To escape the simple logic of the conclusion dictated by <em>Rogers, </em>the majority engages in a lengthy discussion of the genesis of the so-called \u201cindelible\u201d right to counsel. It notes, quite correctly, that there are two basic and closely related lines of cases in this area. The first, the <em>Donovan-Arthur </em>rule, holds that once an attorney enters the proceeding, no waiver of rights may be extracted from a defendant without the attorney being present (e.g., <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479). Under the second rule, which may be referred to as the <em>Settles-Samuels </em>doctrine, the nonwaivability principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>attaches upon actual commencement of the criminal proceeding (e.g., <em>People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218, <em>supra; People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154). The majority would treat these two related rules as distinct, and apply <em>Rogers </em>to prohibit questioning on unrelated charges only where the defendant actually has an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Whatever superficial distinctions may exist between the two principles, they share the same historic roots and seek to foster the same goal. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s unsupported assertion, this court has previously held that the commencement of the criminal proceeding <em>is the equivalent </em>of actual representation by counsel. Indeed, in <em>People v Settles (supra, </em>at pp 159, 166), where we held that the indelible right to counsel attaches upon indictment, the court expressly stated: \u201cwhere an indictment has been returned, we <em>equate </em>the indictment with entry of a lawyer into the proceedings and invoke the requirement of counsel\u2019s presence to effectuate a valid waiver\u201d [emphasis added] and \u201can indictment constitutes the commencement of a formal judicial action against the defendant and is equated with the entry of an attorney into the proceedings.\u201d In so ruling, the court in <em>Settles </em>relied heavily upon the <em>Donovan-Arthur </em>cases (46 NY2d, at pp 161-166, <em>supra). </em>Thus, rather than being a separate and distinct rule, the <em>Settles-Samuels </em>cases stem from and are intimately rooted to the <em>Donovan-Arthur </em>principle. And, the rule articulated in both lines of cases has but a single purpose: to protect against an uncounseled and unknowing waiver of the right to counsel in instances where that right has attached (see, e.g., <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154, 163-165, <em>supra; People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479, 484-485, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Moreover, it is not logical to say that recognizing a defendant\u2019s nonwaivable right to counsel where an unrelated criminal complaint is filed \u201cwould tax law enforcement officials anywhere with knowledge of accusatory instruments on unrelated charges everywhere\u201d (majority opn, at p 328). Quite simply, the rule would not be triggered absent knowledge of the unrelated charges. Here, the detective who accompanied defendant to the polygraph test admitted his knowledge of the outstanding charge. More fundamentally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>however, this court has until today steadfastly refused to dilute the fundamental right to an attorney merely to provide law enforcement officials with a convenient procedure for obtaining a confession (e.g., <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167, 173, <em>supra; People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154, 164, <em>supra; People v Donovan, </em>13 NY2d 148, 152). Yet, the majority now overrides the defendant\u2019s right to counsel so as not to \u201cunrealistically limit police interrogation procedures\u201d (at p 328).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Today\u2019s decision is reminiscent of <em>People v Robles </em>(27 NY2d 155, overruled <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479, <em>supra), </em>in which this court, in affirming a criminal conviction, suddenly and unexplainedly departed from the consciously evolved <em>Donovan-Arthur </em>principle. The result was a period of uncertainty as to the scope of the right to counsel under the New York Constitution (see, e.g., <em>People v Pellicano, </em>40 AD2d 169; 51 St John\u2019s L Rev 216, 217-218). The decision in this case likewise might be viewed as a backtracking from the court\u2019s unswerving insistence that the fundamental right to counsel be respected. Especially is this so here, where the interaction of the two established rules articulated in <em>Samuels </em>and <em>Rogers </em>\u2014 and the very purpose of those rules \u2014 dictates that defendant was entitled to a non waivable right to counsel. Rather than join in a rationale which can only cause renewed confusion as to the scope of the right to counsel, I would hold that a defendant who possesses an unwaivable right to counsel cannot waive his rights where the police, with knowledge of the facts which give rise to the right to counsel, question him on unrelated charges. In this case, since the detective admitted that he knew of the outstanding shoplifting charge, defendant should not have been questioned in the absence of an attorney on the unrelated murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur with Judge Meyer; Chief Judge Cooke dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
