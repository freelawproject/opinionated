The motion is based on the ground that the appellant did not file his brief within the time permitted by the rules of the court. The transcript was filed on October 6, 1930. The time for appellant to file his opening brief expired, therefore, on November 5, 1930. Notice of the presentation of this motion was served and filed December 10, 1930. The motion was noticed for presentation on January 13, 1931, and was presented on that date. On December 12, 1930, appellant\u2019s brief was filed. Appellant\u2019s attorney has presented and filed an affidavit from which it appears that during the period of his apparent delay he was diligently employed in the trial of various cases. Furthermore, the affidavit shows that the appeal has been taken and presented in good faith and that the delay has not appreciably postponed the hearing of the appeal on its merits. <em>(Fishman </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>108 Cal.
