Deponent cannot positively say whether the notice was given on Monday or Tuesday; but he thinks and believes that it was on the Tuesday. Said notice was brought to deponent through the post-office, and has been mislaid by him. Deponent also says that he keeps tavern in Spring Garden street, between Seventh and Eighth streets, and has resided in Philadelphia for the last seven years, and is well known to the community. Deponent further says, that he. is advised by his counsel, that in consequence of no notice of protest being legally given to him of the non-payment of the note by the drawer, deponent is discharged from liability as endorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The court entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence; which was now assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-7\"><em>Norris, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">cited <em>Gurly </em>v. <em>Gettysburg Bank, </em>(7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>324); <em>Stuckert </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>(3 <em>Whart. </em>119); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>The Bank of Washington, </em>(5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>321); <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>(10 <em>Johns. </em>490); <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>(2 <em>Hill </em>587); <em>Weakly </em>v. <em>Bell, (9 Watts </em>273).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-8\"><em>St George Campbell, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6\">referred to <em>Jenks </em>v. <em>The Doylestown Bank, </em>(4 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>509); <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Hawthorn, </em>(3 <em>Rawle </em>358); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>The Bank of Washington, </em>(5 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>321).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">This affidavit contains an assertion of every fact necessary to constitute a defence, but one. The note in suit fell due on a Friday, and notice of non-payment was not received, certainly, till the Monday following; which would be too late, if the parties lived in the same towm. But the defendant has not sworn to the residence of the drawer; and as demand of payment was to be made there, it may have been a place so remote, that notice could not be sent from it to the endorser so as to reach him in less than the time sworn to, by the regular operations of the mail. But the defendant may have been unable to swear to the place of his residence. Very well. He is bound affirmatively to make out a case of negligence, and must swear to facts enough to constitute it. If he cannot do that, he cannot swear to a defence. In this case every fact sworn to may be true, and yet the plaintiff be entitled to recover. It is said that, as the note is dated at Philadelphia, the presumption is that the.drawer resided there also. But a defendant is bound to swear to facts, not presumptions. This endorser was bound to know the residence of the drawer; and ought to have stated, at least, his belief that he would be able to prove it to the satisfaction of a jury; without which his defence would be incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
