The charter of William Penn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>authorized a market, and clerks to be appointed. After the revolution a charter was given to the city by Act of Assembly, but it contained nothing on the subject of building markets. Shortly after, the Act of 1786 was passed, authorizing the extension of the market-house from Third to Fourth street, and so on from time to time as necessity or occasion required. By the 8th section of this Act, the one-half of the market-house was to be free to the country people, and the other half to be let for the use of the city. In 1795, however, another Act was passed, which prohibits the sale of beef in the western moiety of this market from Third to <em>Fourth </em>street, by the express words of the 1st section, by any person whatever, butcher or other person. The 3d section gives the right to extend the market further, and by the 4th section the provisions of the 1st section are extended to all such future markets to be built. The market now in question being beyond Fourth street, is one extended since, and therefore falls within the same regulations as the market from Third to Fourth street. The words of the 4th section are, that one-half shall be and remain free for the country people bringing the produce of their farms to market, agreeably to what is directed by the 1st section. On this Act there could not be a doubt; but the doubt is raised by the Act of 19th March 1810; for that of 1804 is only to authorize markets in other places than High street. Now the Act of 19th March 1810 does not repeal that of 1795 expressly, nor by any necessary implication, but is perfectly consistent with it. Its great object was to give the farmer an exclusive right to a stall, by taking a lease of it and paying a rent, so as to exclude intruders, hucksters and others, who had begun to deprive him of the stalls by prior occupation. Some slept on the stall for that purpose, and held it by continual possession. The Act directs, therefore, that the stalls shall be let only to those who send or carry their produce from the country. It limits the rent to $20, and confines the sale of beef by the victualler to the eastern moiety of the market. All this goes to show, that instead of repealing the provisions of the Act of 1795, the Legislature meant to continue them, as they had been found advantageous both to the butchers and the country people, and the city derived a much larger rent from the butcher to enable it to pay the expense of building and keeping up the market, of maintaining clerks of the market, of cleaning and lighting the market-houses, and other expenses. It is clear, that produce of the farm did not include beef, under the Act of 1795; why, then, should it under the Act of 1810? The rule is well settled, that different statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together, and the same word to receive the same construction in all. This is the rule in construing bankrupt laws, poor laws, and all others. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Loxdale, </em>(1 <em>Burr. </em>447). And the use of the words, \u201c produce of the farm,\u201d in the Act of 1795, is borne out by correct grammatical construction; for beef is an article manufactured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>from the produce of the farm by'those'who exercise what the Act of 1795 calls, \u201c the trade of a butcher or victualler.\u201d The present question is not between the butchers and the farmers, as is commonly supposed ; it is a question merely affecting the city\u2019s right to a revenue from the markets.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-5\"><em>Lewis </em>and <em>Norris. </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-B\">This is ar mere question between the butchers and the farmers. The former desire a monopoly \u2014 to compel the farmer to sell to therfr^and then charge the citizen. The butcher\u2019s trade requires no skill,- and even in England would not come within the apprentice laws. The streets being public highways, the city has no power'.to erect or regulate markets, except what is given by the <em>Legislature; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Passmore, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>221); <em>Rung </em>v. <em>Shoneberger, </em>(2 <em>Watts </em>25); <em>Philad. and Trenton Railroad Co., (6 Whart. </em>44); and the authority to prevent farmers from selling beef in the western moiety of this market, is not given by the Acts of Assembly. The Act of 1795 was not intended to alter the free and full right given by the Act of 1786. The preamble recites that the franchise of'the country people had been intruded upon, and its object was to secure, but not to restrict them. There was little or no beef raised in the adjoining counties in 1795; and that was not in view. Since the year 1802 these counties have become grazing counties, and the feeding and fattening of cattle \u00e1re an important item of agriculture; and the object of the Act of 1810 was to secure the farmers against the shinners who intruded upon them. The intention of the. Legislature is tobe ascertained from the necessity under which the Act was made. 15 Johns. 380; 1 <em>Wheat. </em>115. A penal statute is to be construed strictly, and not extended by construction, and there is no prohibition in the Act of 1810 as to any market beyond Fourth street. The Act of 6 th April 1802, (3 <em>Sm. L. </em>530), is also an important Act, and to be considered in determining this question. It enacts, that from and after the passing of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for any person or persons to sell or expose to sale provisions, vegetables or fruit in the markets of any city, borough, or corporate town w\u2019ithin this Commonwealth, provided such provisions, vegetables or fruit shall not have been previously purchased within the limits of such city, borough or corporate town; any law to the contrary notwithstanding. And in the word \u201cprovisions,\u201d beef is Certainly included, being the most important. Again: the Act of 1804 expressly makes markets to be thereafter built, free for the use of the country people attending them: and to the same effect is the Act of 1810, under which the market now in question was built. The western moiety is to be let to such persons from the country who send or carry the produce of their farms to market, and to no others; whilst the butchers are prohibited from selling beef there. It is a common law right to sell and buy where you can. find a market, and grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>to corporations are construed strictly. 2 <em>Cow. </em>420; 4 <em>Cow. </em>144; <em>Cowp. </em>29; 15 <em>E. C. L. </em>37. Produce is that which the legitimate proceeds of farming yield. This includes the purchasing and grazing of cattle.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-6\"><em>Dallas, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACA\">insisted that the interest of the great body of the farmers was promoted by this ordinance, however a few colourable farmers might think otherwise. The main question, however, is, whether the Act of 1795, the enactments of which are precise and clear on the subject, is repealed by any subsequent legislation. It is incumbent on the party alleging this to show that it is so by express words or necessary implication. The object of the Act of 6th April 1802, is only to secure to the country people the common law freedom of markets in any town or place in Pennsylvania: but it does not extend to the market-house, which was built by the city of Philadelphia as its own, and at its own expense, and over which the control is given to them. The markets are far beyond the market-houses: the one belongs to the State and its citizens, the other to the corporation. If the Act of 1802 is applied in all its extent, it sets aside the whole system of the city market-houses. No clerks could inspect, no corrupt or unwholesome provisions could be expelled. As to the Act of 1810, it is evidently for the protection of the country people, by keeping out intruders, and extends their privileges, by enabling them not only to come, but to send a person to market. Independently of the Act of 1795, will it be pretended that they could bring every kind of produce to the market-house? Could they bring there and place on the stalls manure, or hay, or wood, or charcoal, under the name of produce ? And is there no power to regulate the general right, by fixing the time, place and manner of conducting the market? Beef is not the produce of a farm, any more than hats, or shoes, or shirts made from the raw article ? A farm is defined to be cultivated ground, and the produce is that which grows from it. Beef is defined to be the flesh of black cattle prepared for food. He who prepares and brings in such beef to market becomes a butcher, and subject to all that attaches to that character. A bullock not raised on the farm, but bought, is not the produce of the farm. He may have grazed from time to time in several, and which one can lay claim to him as its produce ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b276-8\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8X\">So far as statutes for the regulation of trade impose fines or create forfeitures, they are doubtless to be construed strictly as penal, and not liberally as remedial laws. Of this stamp are revenue laws, and laws for the registry of ships, as was held in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>(3 <em>Taunt. </em>377), and of the same stamp is at least one of the laws for the regulation of this market, so far as the corporation is empowered by it to enforce obedience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to it by the infliction of a penalty. But it cannot be maintained that a penal statute is to be construed strictly in all its parts; or that the words of it are to be narrowed in their operation, even in those parts of it which define the-offence and annex the penalty. \u201cWe are to look at the words, in the first instance,\u201d said Justice Bumek, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hodnett, </em>(1 <em>T. R. </em>96), \u201cand, where they are plain, we are to decide on\u2019them.' If they are doubtful, we are to have recourse to the subject-matter.\u201d - The true rule is, that words descriptive of an offence, or the punishment of it, are not to be bent to the one side or the other. The question, then, is, whether the. Act of the 12th February 1795, which explicitly prohibits the sale of beef in the western moiety of every High street market-house above Third street, has been expressly or impliedly repealed, in whole or in part, by the Act of the 19th March 1810.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Act of the 23d March 1786, which is the first member of the series, did no more than authorize the corporation to extend the market in High street, from Third to Fourth street, and still further when it should be thought necessary: but on condition that the western moiety of each market-house should be left free to the country people. The stalls in the other moiety were to be rented. This does not touch the case before us. Then came the Act of 1795, reciting that the intentions of the Legislature were likely to be frustrated by the intrusion of persons of a different description from those intended to be provided for by the preceding Act, and declaring that \u201c it shall, not be lawful for <em>any </em>person whatever to sell any <em>beef </em>in the western moiety of the market-house or shambles in High street between Third and Fourth streets; nor for any person exercising the trade of a butcher or victualler to occupy any stall or sell any meat of any kind, within the said western moiety of the market-house or shambles aforesaid.\u201d This settled the question as to the market-house then about to be built. But the Act gave the corporation the same power that was given to it before, to extend the market indefinitely to the west, expressly subject, however, to the preceding prohibition. , Hence, it became unlawful to sell beef in the western moiety of any market-house on High street subsequently erected. By what statute has this prohibition been repealed?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Act of the 6th April 1802, which is alleged to bear on it because it declares generally that any person may sell provisions in any city, borough, or corporate town, was not intended to be applied to the High street market, which had a code of its own; nor was it intended to destroy, at one fell swoop, all restrictive regulation elsewhere. Any one may doubtless sell provisions in a market-town, but only at the market-place appointed for the sale of the particular article. There certainly was no design to sanction the intrusion of their poultry and pigs into the churches or.the dwellings of the inhabitants, or into any other place that would be improper for the exhibition of them. It is impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>conjecture, at this day, what was the grievance intended to be redressed by it, or why a law declarative of a right so unquestionable before it, should have been thought necessary. It was probably to maintain the quarrel of a few market-people with the authorities of some incorporated village or town; but it was certainly unnecessary to back it with the august power of the Legislature. Nor does the Act of the 19th March 1804, which authorizes the corporation of .Philadelphia to establish markets, with analogous regulations in other parts of the city, touch the question more nearly. We come then to the Act of the 19th March 1810, which consists of two sections containing very nearly the same provisions for the very same thing; and which consequently exhibits a lack of precision and perspicuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The first provides that it shall be lawful for the corporation to extend the market in High street or elsewhere, and to build market-houses ; \u201c to let or demise the one-half of the stalls they may erect, to such persons from the country as send or carry the produce of their farms to the said market, and to no others; and to let the other half of the stalls so erected, at their own discretion, to such persons, victuallers or butchers, as to them may seem proper; any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d The concluding expletive was not thrown in to give the section a repealing tendency. It was freely used by the Legislature, at that day, to round off a period, and perhaps to jog the memory of the Judges, lest they should forget that posterior laws abrogate those which happen to be prior and contrary to them. The other section provided, that <em>\u201c </em>whenever the market-house in High street shall be extended, it shall not be lawful for any <em>victualler </em>to sell beef in the western moiety of any market-house or shambles that may be erected at any time hereafter in High street; but the western moiety shall be let to such persons from the country who (as) send or carry their produce to market, and no others; and the one-half of the stalls that may be erected elsewhere, shall also be let to such persons from the country who (as) send or carry the produce of their farms to market, and no others:\u201d provided, that the annual rent do not exceed twenty dollars the stall. From this, it is said, we must infer, that because victuallers, and they only, are expressly forbidden to sell beef in the western market, and because the stalls are required to be let to those who fetch the produce of their farms to market, the occupants were to be at liberty to use them for the sale of every thing, without exception, which happens to be the immediate or remote produce of his farm. But why was this statute enacted, and what was the mischief to be corrected by it? Certainly not to authorize the extension of the market, for that had been doubly done before. The object was simply to let the stalls. And here let me say, it is the bungling attempts of the penman to say the same thing in different words, which so \u00a1frequently involves the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>legislature in uncertainty. It is a matter of history, that the mischief which called for correction, was the confusion and jostling which occurred before their several places were assigned to the country people ; and the legislature intended no more than to apply a remedy to it, by giving each a separate right to a stall. Surely the petty rent of twenty dollars was not meant to be compensation for a privilege which would put a grazier on a par with a regular victualler, who is con\u00edpelled to pay much more for his stall. Why then should it be thought that because a moiety of the stalls is required to be let to the country people, they must necessarily be at liberty to use them for the sale of every thing which a farmer brings from the country ? The inference attempted, is that because the stall is let to one who markets the produce of a farm, he may use it to market whatever is the produce of a farm in the largest sense. But we are called on not to put a construction on the Act of 1795, which is in some measure a penal one \u2014 for it needs no construction \u2014 but on the Act of 1810, which is asserted by the defendant himself to be remedial; and if we are to be guided by common sense applied to the context, we must suppose that there are many thirigs which are necessarily exceptions to the general expression. Swine, horses, neat cattle, sheep, manure, cord-wood, hay, and many other things not more savoury, <em>would be out </em>of place in a market-house for the sale of poultry, vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk, butter, lard, and other provisions for the mouth ; yet they are strictly produce of the farm : much more so, indeed, than beef, which, though it comes, like every thing else, primitively from the soil, is as much a manufactured article as leather, cloth, or charcoal. The ox is \"the produce of the farm; beef is the produce of the slaughter-house and the shambles. It is manufactured by the professional skill of an artisan, whose business is as distinct from that of a farmer, as is that of a flax-dresser or a wool-comber. That the farmer sometimes works up his own raw materials, cannot prevent it from taking a new denomination from the additional labour expended on it. The versatility so conspicuous in the American people, often makes him his own weaver; yet it follows not. that his linsey-woolsey, though cut from his own sheep, is the less manufactured, or the less improperly denominated the produce of his farm. The blending of trades does not change the nature of the wares. When the farmer slaughters his own ox, the beef is not less the product of the slaughter-house; and this may be the reason why it was thought unnecessary to re-enact the prohibition of the preceding Act, against the sale of beef in the western parts of the market-houses, by any person, whether farmer or victualler. The three statutes which 1 have drawn particularly into view, being parts of a system, are to be taken together as one; for it is to be intended that the system was meant to be consistent throughout. The interpretation of statutes in <em>pan materia </em>by each other, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>been carried so far, that it was said by Lord Mansfield, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Loxdale, </em>(1 <em>Burr. </em>447), \u201c that all 'which relate to the same subject, notwithstanding some of them may be expired or not noticed, must be taken to be one system, and construed consistently.\u201d But what is more to the purpose, it was ruled in <em>The King qui tam </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(4 <em>T. R. </em>419), that when the same word is used in statutes which are in <em>pari materia, </em>a distinction as to the sense in which it is used in the one, is a legislative exposition of the sense in which it is to be understood in the other. And in <em>Bacon\u2019s Abr. Title, \u201cStatute\u201d I. </em>it is said that words and phrases whose sense, in a statute, has been ascertained, are to be understood in the same sense when used in a subsequent statute. Now the phrase \u2018 produce of a farm,\u2019 was taken, in the Act of 1795, not to include beef; and it is consequently not to include beef in the Act of 1810. As the Act of 1795 expressly gives the corporation power to enforce the prohibition by such by-laws as might be found necessary, the penalty was legally imposed, and must be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Judgment of the Common Pleas reversed, and judgment of the Mayor affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
