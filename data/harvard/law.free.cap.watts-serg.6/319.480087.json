Speakman and John Hart and Lydia his wife by deed dated 6th May 1800, to hold to them and their heirs and assigns as tenants in common and not as joint tenants. Mrs Speakman and John Hart and Lydia his wife, afterwards by deed dated July 11th 1805, granted one undivided third part of said premises to Sarah Spackman, who afterwards by deed dated 12th April 1806, granted the said one third part of the premises to John Hart in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-14\">The question was whether under the first recited deed Mrs H.

The deed in the premises shows that the consideration moved, from each, and that there was to be no joint tenancy: the habendum and warranty are the same, and the receipt for the purchase money is from each. A husband and wife can hold as tenants in common during coverture. Marriage does not alter the estates they had before, and if they held jointly before, they hold so afterwards. If there is a grant to the husband and wife and a third person, one for life, one in tail and one for years, each takes one third. <em>Fitz. N. B. </em>194; <em>Co. Lit. </em>187 <em>b. </em>So if there is a gift to the use of a man and woman, marriage afterwards will not make them tenants by entireties. 2 <em>Prest. Ab. </em>41. Under a grant to husband and wife and to a third person, as tenants in common, each has an interest of one third in severalty as tenant in common. 1 <em>Prest. Est. </em>132; 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>363; 1 <em>Rop. Husb. &amp; Wife </em>51. An estate in the husband and wife by entireties cannot be created by a conveyance to them as tenants in common. An estate by entireties is one kind of estate in joint tenancy and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the words here \u201c and not as joint tenants\u201d all kinds of joint tenancy are excluded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-6\"><em>Price, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ9\">Without the clause \u201c tenants in common and not as joint tenants,\u201d the husband and'wife would have taken by entireties (2 <em>Prest. Est. </em>39), that is the husband and wife would have one half and the other party another half. There can be no other estate granted to husband and wife than by entireties; they cannot take by moieties; the husband, cannot sever it; they constitute one person. 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>184; 1 <em>Prest. Ab. </em>137. The words are used with the view of excluding Hart and wife from taking as joint tenants, and of conveying to them as tenants in common with Mrs Speakman. If such be the conveyance, then it is clear the husband and wife take one half-by entireties, and Mrs Speak-man the other half. The conveyance is to H. S. and J. H. and Lydia his wife, not Lydia Hart. Legacy to A, B and C, and the wife of C, to be equally divided amongst them ; the husband and wife took one third. <em>Bricker </em>v. <em>Whalley </em>(1 <em>Vern. </em>233); <em>Skin. </em>182. A conveyance to husband and wife gives an estate by entireties and not a joint tenancy. <em>Green v. King </em>(2 <em>Wm. Black </em>1211): 5 <em>Ch. Rep. </em>437. The point before the court is expressly decided in 16 <em>Wend. </em>615; 5 <em>Halst. 42</em>; 3 <em>Rand. </em>179.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b321-8\">Kennedy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARK\">The only question raised in this case is whether ujider the deed from Mary de Brahm to Hannah Speakman and John Hart and Lydia his wife, Hannah Speakman took an undivided moiety of the estate thereby conveyed or only an undivided third part thereof; or, in other words, whether John Hart and Lydia his wife did not each take an equal undivided third part of the same as tenants in common, or only an undivided moiety of the whole, to be held by them jointly as tenants in common with Hannah Speakman. Had the estate been granted to them to be held as joint tenants and not as tenants in common, it would, according to all the authorities on the subject, be quite clear that Hart and his wife would only have taken an undivided moiety of the whole, and Hannah Speakman the remaining moiety. But it is contended that as the estate was granted to them to hold the same as tenants in common and not as joint tenants, each of the three, therefore, in order to carry into effect fully the meaning of the words of the habendum, must- be considered as having taken an equal undivided third part thereof. And in support of this Mr Preston in his first volume on estates, p. 132, has been cited, where he says <em>\u201c </em>in point of fact and agreeable to natural reason, free from artificial deductions, the husband and wife are distinct and individual persons; and accordingly where lands are granted to them as tenants in common, thereby treating them without any respect to their social union, they will hold by moieties, as other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>distinct and individual persons will do.\u201d And Mr Preston, to sustain what he has thus said, refers to <em>Co. Lit. </em>187 <em>b., </em>where Lord <em>Coke </em>says \u201cif a man make a lease to A. and to baron and feme, viz: to A. for life, to the husband in tail and to the feme for years, in this case it is said that each of them hath a third in respect to the severalty of their estates.\u2019 Then Mr Preston proceeds to say \u201c also when a grant is made to a husband and his wife and a third person as tenants in common, each of these three will have a distinct and separate interest in and tenancy of a third part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Now although it may well be in the case mentioned by Lord Coke, that the husband and wife would each take a third, as a separate and distinct estate is given to each of them severally in express terms, so that if they take at all consistently with the terms of the grant, it must be a several and not a joint interest; but in the case put by Mr. Preston, the same meaning does not necessarily apply; for to many purposes, if not generally, husband and wife are regarded as one person only in law; and as the case in its terms does not preclude this idea of unity, they may be considered as taking a joint interest in an undivided moiety of the whole, and as holding the same as tenants in common with the third person, who has and .holds the other moiety also as tenant in common. Hence, according to Littleton, sec. 291, if a joint estate be made of land to husband and wife and to a third person, the husband and wife have but a moiety in law, and. the third person the other moiety, because the husband and wife are but one person in law. Bracton saith, <em>vir et uxor sunt quasi \u00fanica persona, quia caro una et sanguis unus. Co. Lit. </em>187 <em>b. \u201c </em>And therefore,\u201d says Judge Blackstone, in the 2d vol. of his commentaries, p. 182, \u201c if an estate in fee be given to a man and his wife, they are neither properly joint tenants nor tenants in common; for husband and wife being considered as one person in law, they cannot take the estate by moieties, but both are seised of the entirety <em>per tout et non per my ; </em>the consequence of which is, that neither the husband nor the wife can dispose of any part without the assent of the other, but the whole must remain to the survivor.\u201d And in a case before Lord Keeper North, <em>(Skinner </em>182), A. B. having three nieces, one of whom had a husband, bequeathed a legacy to the husband and wife and the other two equally; and held, that the husband and wife took one third only of the legacy, and that the remaining two nieces took each a third thereof; because, as the Lord Keeper said, the husband and wife took only as one person, according to the rule of the common law. So in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>(15 <em>Wend. </em>615), wherfdry a deed of settlement, the grant was to a husband and wife ami to six of their children, naming them, and to such other, &amp;c., to hold as tenants in common, it was ruled, that the husband and wife took only as one person, notwithstanding the estate was granted to them to be held in common and not jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"AXB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>It would therefore seem, according to the weight of authority and opinion too, that John Hart and Lydia his wife, took only a moiety of the estate conveyed by the deed from Mary de Brahm, and not each one third thereof, as contended by the counsel for the plaintiff. This construction also appears to be more consonant to the intention of the parties as indicated by the form of the expression used both in the premises and. the habendum of the deed for the purpose of describing or designating the grantees, which is as follows, viz: \u201cHannah Speakman of &amp;c. <em>and </em>John Hart of &amp;c., and Lydia his wife, of the other part;\u201d thus naming and describing them in the same manner precisely as if it had been intended to make Hart and his wife take as one person only. Had it been intended to make them take as two distinct and individual persons, such intention would have been better and more clearly expressed by having omitted the conjunction \u201c and\u201d inserted immediately before the name of Hart, after naming Hannah Speak-man. Then it would have read \u201c Hannah Speakman of, &amp;c., John Hart of, &amp;c., and Lydia his wife, &amp;c.\u201d But it is not necessary to say here that this change, had it been observed, would have been ^sufficient to have given to Hart and his wife, each one third of the estate, as language showing such design beyond all question or doubt, could have been employed, had- the parties so intended it. It is enough ito say that the language of the deed does not show it clearly, and hence we are of .opinion that Hart and his wife took only a moiety of the estate conveyed, and that Hannah Speakman took the other moiety-thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
