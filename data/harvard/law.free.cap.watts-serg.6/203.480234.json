D., proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">\u201c Fifth, I give, devise and bequeath unto the said Enoch Green and John Stewart and their heirs and the heirs of the survivor of them, all my real estate, lands, tenements and hereditaments, with the appurtenances, wheresoever situate, and all my personal estate or other property of whatever nature or kind, to have and to hold the same upon the trusts and to and for the several uses hereinafter and before expressed and declared concerning the same; that is to say,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">After the payment by them of my debts, funeral expenses and the personal legacies above bequeathed, I hereby direct my said executors and the survivor of them, as soon as conveniently can be after my decease, to ascertain the value of the whole of my said real and personal estate, then to set apart such a portion of the same as may be necessary to constitute a fund from the annual proceeds of which together with the rent of the said store, the annuity bequeathed aforesaid to my said wife, may be paid, then to ascertain how much has been advanced by me to each and every of my children and the husbands of those of my daughters who are or have been married, and how much each of them may be indebted to me on bond, note, book-account or otherwise, and to so divide the residue of my said property among my said children, to be paid to them or held to and for their use as hereinafter directed, as that each child, may have an equal share of my estate ; that is, that the monies so advanced to any of my said children or the husbands of such of my daughters as are, have been, or shall be married, and for which they shall be indebted to me as aforesaid, be counted as so much paid on account of the share of such child in my estate, (the legacies of stock above bequeathed to two of my daughters to be also reckoned as part of their shares), and upon the decease of my said wife to make like distribution among my said children, to be paid and held as aforesaid, of the proceeds arising from the sale of the said house and furniture bequeathed to my said wife for her life as aforesaid, and the fund so as aforesaid set apart for producing the said annuity of $600, (the like deduction as aforesaid to be made from the share of each child who may be still in advance of the others) so that my whole estate may be so divided that each of my children either during my life or' after my decease may have received from me an equal portion with the others.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">He then gave authority to his executors to sell real estate, and proceeded to direct how the shares tohis said children should be paid and invested;

and if. my said daughter shall' marry, and not thereafter during my life have been so advanced by me, it is my will, and I do hereby order and direct her said trustee to pay over to her immediately out of the said fund, the sum of $1000, to be absolutely hers; and after her decease I do order and direct the said Enoch Green to pay over and distribute the whole of the said fund equally, among her children,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">All four said cases were argued together by consent, and the court in each case gave judgment for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">Error assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-8\">The court erred in giving judgment for defendants; they should have given judgment for plaintiffs and charged interest on the said debts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-9\"><em>Maxwell </em>and <em>Hepburn, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afu\">The notes and the bond were debts, not advancements. <em>Levering </em>v. <em>Rittenhouse, </em>(4 <em>Whart. </em>130); <em>Haverstock </em>v. <em>Sarbach, </em>(1 <em>Watts </em>&amp; <em>Serg. </em>390); <em>Kreider </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>(10 <em>Watts </em>54). The testator distinguishes between debts and advancements. At all events, if the will changed them into advancements, they remained debts up to the date of the will, and interest is' chargeable to that time for the value of the advancement as estimated at the time it is made. <em>Oyster </em>v. <em>Oyster, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>422). But the will shows an intention on the testator\u2019s part to charge interest. It distinguishes throughout between the advancements he had made and the debts due him from his children. The receipt of interest on the note of George also shows this intention. The testator throughout evinces a design to produce equality among his children, which can only be done by making those who have been advanced pay interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-10\"><em>Brooke </em>and <em>Brown, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMe\">Equality would demand the opposite construction, as the presumption is that those who received money in advance left their home and provided for themselves, but those who remained were a charge to the parent. All these debts, except the bond, were barred by the Statute of Limitations, and would have been lost if the testator had died intestate. It is only by regarding them as advancements that the bar of the statute is saved. As to the receipt of interest, it was only in one instance, and was afterwards abandoned. On the whole will, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>intent is plain that they should be put on the footing of advancements, and the interest, therefore, is not released. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>(3 <em>Pick. </em>450), is a case as nearly resembling the present as can be, and there the interest was held not chargeable. They also cited <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>(1 <em>Binn. </em>212); <em>Wentz </em>v. <em>Dehaven, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>317); <em>Jer. Eq. 90; Hook </em>v. <em>Hoak, </em>(5 <em>Watts </em>82); <em>Musselman\u2019s Estate, </em>(5 <em>Watts </em>9); <em>Hengst\u2019s Estate, </em>(6 <em>Watts 87); Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>(6 <em>Watts </em>257); <em>King\u2019s Estate, </em>(6 <em>Whart. </em>370); 2 <em>Dess. </em>127.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b208-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQI\">That the notes in question were originally evidence of debt, is not to be contested; for whatever may have been the ultimate purpose of the father, the monies advanced by him might have been recovered back, which shows they were not given absolutely in anticipation of the shares at his death. But whatever they were at first, he had power to turn them into advancements by his will; and he did so by directing his executors to ascertain how much had been advanced to each of his children, or how much each of them had been indebted to him, and to divide the residue.of the property so that all should have equal shares, the monies advanced being considered as paid on account. It is evident that he used the word \u201cindebted\u201d as equivalent to the word \u201c advanced ;\u201d and the question is whether the monies are to viewed as advancements from the date of the notes, or from the date of the will. The plaintiffs contend that interest ought to be charged respectively from the times when the notes, as such, would have begun to bear it; and that the principal sums cannot be treated, by relation, as advancements at periods further back. But the testator had power to order it otherwise; and when he said the debts should be treated as advancements, he made them such out and out, and gave them all the usual incidents, one of which is that they should be valued as of the time of the gift. Had <em>he </em>meant that they should be debts as regards interest, and gifts as regards the principal, he would have said so. It is pretty clear that he did not mean, from the first, that interest should be charged on any of the notes but one; for where an advancement is put into the form of a debt, the object is not accumulation, but to enable the father, as a creditor, to save something from <em>the </em>wreck of the child\u2019s property in case of misfortune; and the construction we have put on this will best accords with the actual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
