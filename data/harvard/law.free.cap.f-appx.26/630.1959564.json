Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we will not restate them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">\n<em>The Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">\u201cFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides for the imposition of sanctions when a filing is frivolous, legally unreasonable, or without factual foundation, or is brought for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Estate of Blue v. County of Los Angeles, </em>120 F.3d 982, 985 (9th Cir.1997). The district court found the complaint that appellants\u2019 filed on behalf of the Kunimotos to be both frivolous and \u201cfor the improper purpose of harassing and pressuring the Defendants to settle other pending litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">\u201cFrivolous filings are those that are both baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.\u201d <em>Buster v. Greisen, </em>104 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted). Not all of a complaint\u2019s claims must be frivolous for Rule 11 sanctions to be appropriate. <em>Townsend v. Holman Consulting Corp., </em>929 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">The Kunimotos lacked standing to file the complaint because once in bankruptcy, a debtor\u2019s property rights, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ing legal causes of action, belong to the bankruptcy estate, under the supervision of the court-appointed trustee. <em>See </em>Bankruptcy Code 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a); <em>Sierra Switchboard Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>789 F.2d 705, 707-09 (9th Cir.1986). All claims alleged on the Kunimotos\u2019 behalf originated either before the bankruptcy filing or during the Chapter 11 phase of Mr. Kunimoto\u2019s case, and therefore were part of the bankruptcy estate. Mrs. Kunimoto\u2019s claims were nearly all entirely derivative of Mr. Kunimoto\u2019s causes of action, and are therefore just as frivolous as his. That one or two of Mrs. Kunimoto\u2019s claims may not have been derivative on their face does not immunize her complaint from Rule 11 sanctions. <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We are unconvinced by appellants\u2019 arguments that their assertion of standing was colorable. Appellant Young posits that if debtor\u2019s claims were the property of the trustee, the trustee should have been substituted for the plaintiff. But here, the trustee is one of the <em>defendants </em>and so could not have been the plaintiff as well. Moreover, the trustee did not consent to any substitution, and his consent was highly unlikely in light of the history of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Both appellants further argue for standing on the theory that because taxes are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, the trustee\u2019s alleged failure to pay taxes will cause the plaintiff personal harm in the form of tax liability. Appellants list in a string cite, with no discussion, five cases that supposedly support their novel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Three of the five cases discuss an exception to the rule precluding standing by a bankruptcy debtor that clearly does not apply here: when a debtor disputes claims of creditors, standing is proper if the disallowance of the claims would create a surplus of assets to be returned to the debtor. <em>Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. v. D.M. Reid Assoc., Ltd., </em>992 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1993), <em>Silverman v. Leucadia, Inc., </em>37 B.R. 200, 201 (S.D.N.Y.1982), <em>Kapp v. Naturelle, Inc., </em>611 F.2d 703, 707 (8th Cir. 1979). Plaintiff in this case did not seek to establish the invalidity of any creditors\u2019 claims, and so the \u201csurplus\u201d exception could not possibly apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The remaining two cases appellants cite allow debtor plaintiffs to sue trustees for breach of fiduciary duty, which indeed was one of the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. <em>Yadkin Valley Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. McGee, </em>5 F.3d 750 (4th Cir.1993), does so with no discussion of the standing issue. Presumably, standing was not raised by the lawyers in that case or there was trustee consent to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\"><em>Reich v. Burke, </em>54 B.R. 995, 1002 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1985), which involved Chapter 7 bankruptcy rather than Chapter 11, begins its discussion by stating: \u201cAlthough it is undeniable that a Chapter 7 trustee has the duty to preserve estate assets, <em>no case has been found in which it was held that the duty was owed to the debtor\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted). The <em>Reich </em>opinion finds standing nonetheless. The debtor in that case claimed that the trustee negligently allowed the destruction of a property in which debtor had maintained an exemption, a partial property right. The court reasoned that because of the exemption, the trustee\u2019s alleged negligence would cause \u201ca loss peculiar to\u201d the debtor. There is no such exemption in this case. Moreover, <em>Reich </em>was brought in the bankruptcy court, not in the district court. Even if such a suit were otherwise viable in the district court, it would require permission by the bankruptcy court, <em>see In re Kashani, </em>190 B.R. 875, 884 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1995), and none was requested or obtained. Finally, in this case the trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was only <em>one </em>of the defendants, and the alleged duty to preserve the estate cannot possibly support standing against the other defendants, such as the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Appellants also argue that Mrs. Kunimoto\u2019s derivative claims were not frivolous, citing <em>Brown v. KFC Nat\u2019l Management Company, </em>82 Hawai\u2019i 226, 921 P.2d 146 (Haw.1996). Though <em>Brown </em>found loss of consortium claims to be independent from their parent claims in the sense that they can be litigated in different forums, <em>Brown </em>made clear that the spouse\u2019s consortium claim is \u201cderivative in the sense that [it does] not arise unless one\u2019s spouse has sustained a personal injury.\u201d <em>Brown </em>at 161 (quoting <em>Yamamoto v. Premier Ins. Co., </em>4 Haw.App. 429, 668 P.2d 42, 48 (Haw. Ct.App.1983)). Since Mr. Kunimoto could show no personal injury, Mrs. Kunimoto\u2019s spousal claims were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the complaint was \u201cboth baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\n<em>Improper Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The district court had ample justification for finding that the complaints were filed for the improper purpose \u201cof harassing and pressuring the Defendants to settle other pending litigation.\u201d The complaints largely repeated claims that had been settled in state court. Also, appellants\u2019 parade of motions for reconsideration, for striking orders, and for disqualifying the judge and the special master cumulatively suggest a strategy of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">\n<em>Safe Harbor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Appellants claim that they offered to dismiss the Kunimotos\u2019 complaints without prejudice within the 21 day safe harbor period, and that appellees ignored the offer. But the district court was within its discretion in finding that appellants\u2019 alleged offers were not sincere proposals but rather disingenuous attempts to force settlement. Appellants proposed only a withdrawal <em>without </em>prejudice; they then failed to file any withdrawal motion with the court or send any proposed withdrawal documents to the bank, though they continued to speak equivocally about the possibility of withdrawing after the safe harbor period ended. In addition, the alleged offer was made only to the bank and therefore has no bearing on the motion for sanctions brought by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">\n<em>The Amount of the Penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">The district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cafter careful consideration\u201d and in the hope of putting \u201can end to [appellants\u2019] continued misuse of the federal court system.\u201d <em>Gaskell v. Weir, </em>10 F.3d 626, 629 (9th Cir.1993), stated that \u201cwhere the original complaint is the improper pleading, all attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred in defending against the claims asserted in the complaint form the proper basis for sanctions.\u201d Still, we take note that the award in this case is quite large for a Rule 11 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Appellants make five arguments in contending that the fee award was excessive. First, they argue without support that fees should be limited to time spent specifically on the standing issue because it was lack of standing that was the basis for dismissal of the case. Rule 11(c)(1)(A) simply states that, \u201cIf warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(1)(A). In this case, the district court carefully explained why it found attorney\u2019s fees warranted for all the pleadings in the case, not only those opposing standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Second, appellants argue that fees should not be awarded for appellees\u2019 ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>forts in carrying out the motions for sanctions. But \u201cthe December 1, 1993 amendment to Rule 11 specifically allows a district court to include the costs associated with sanctions proceedings.\u201d <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 854 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Third, appellants argue that the bank wrongly bundled, or \u201clumped\u201d different tasks under single blocks of time. Aware of this concern, the special master conducted a line-by-line in camera comparison of the bank\u2019s redacted and unredacted entries. The special master found that for the most part the unredacted records showed \u201ccontemporaneous records that were transcribed on the same day as the services were performed.\u201d Wherever there was doubt, the special master reduced the fees accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Fourth, appellants argue that the special master did not consider their evidence of inability to pay. The special master discussed appellants\u2019 evidence in its ruling, finding the declarations filed not probative because they failed to account for appellants\u2019 assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Finally, appellants argue that they were denied adequate due process in the fee determination. In fact, the appointment of a special master and the evidentiary hearings comprised more process than what was required. <em>See, e.g., Buster v. Greisen, </em>104 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">In sum, we find that despite the magnitude of the award, the special master\u2019s lengthy proceedings and thorough 36-page opinion substantiate that the award was within the discretion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
