Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b679-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">The appellant and debtor, Jerome Berg, appeals the decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s grants of summary judgment to the Trustee, Charles Sims, and to the State Bar of Arizona, and affirming a fee award to the Trustee\u2019s attorney, Paul Goldsmith. Because we find Berg\u2019s arguments to be totally without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Berg\u2019s claim against Trustee Sims is barred by the res judicata effect of the bankruptcy court\u2019s earlier Sale Order, and the appeals therefrom, because (1) the parties are identical; (2) the claim of mishandling the sale of the Newsom Action is the same; and (3) the bankruptcy court resolved the claim by a valid and final judgment on the merits. <em>See Robertson v. Isomedix, Inc. (In re Int\u2019l Nutronics, Inc.), </em>28 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir.1994); <em>FDIC v. Jenson (In re Jenson), </em>980 F.2d 1254, 1256 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Berg\u2019s alleged \u201cnew\u201d evidence was available before the auction and Sale Order. The evidence relates directly to the issue of the alleged mishandling of the Newsom Action sale, which the bankruptcy court conclusively adjudicated in entering the Sale Order. \u201cRes judicata bars all grounds for recovery which could have been asserted, whether they were or not, in a prior suit between the same parties on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Clark v. Bear Steams &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Berg\u2019s challenge to the fees awarded to attorney Goldsmith is based to a large extent on the same contention that the Newsom Action was improperly undervalued. That contention is rendered moot by the auction held at Berg\u2019s request. Berg\u2019s further challenge to the fee award is without merit. The bankruptcy court declined to award fees for work on the Newsom Action and did not abuse its discretion in awarding approximately seventy-five percent of the requested fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">The bankruptcy court also properly granted summary judgment to the California State Bar. As an arm of the State, the State Bar enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Hirsh v. Justices of the Supreme Court, </em>67 F.3d 708, 715 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>Lupert v. Cal. State Bar, </em>761 F.2d 1325, 1327 (9th Cir.1985). The bankruptcy court and the BAP properly held that there was no waiver of immunity; the State Bar properly preserved its Eleventh Amendment immunity by asserting it as its first affirmative defense. <em>See Hill v. Blind Indus. &amp; Servs., </em>179 F.3d 754, 758 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel is in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
