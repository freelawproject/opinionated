Finding no error, we affirm Jenkins\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-25\">Jenkins claims the district court did not satisfy the minimum requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 when it accepted his guilty plea because the court failed to fully ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>plain the elements of the offense and because his testimony could not form the basis of a voluntary and intelligent plea. We have reviewed the record, however, and find no reversible error in Jenkins\u2019 Rule 11 hearing. Both the Government in its summary of facts, and the district court in its explanation of the charge contained in the indictment, summarized the elements of the drug conspiracy. <em>See generally United States v. Rhynes, </em>206 F.3d 349, 361 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>662 F.2d 274, 276 (4th Cir.1981). Moreover, at the plea hearing, Jenkins stated he understood the elements of the offense to which he was pleading guilty and indicated he had in fact distributed drugs. Accordingly, we affirm Jenkins\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Jenkins also claims his 262-month sentence is invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because Jenkins\u2019 sentence is not above the thirty year statutory maximum of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction, we find <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated and affirm his sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Sept. 20, 2001) (No. 01-6398); <em>United States v. Dinnall, </em>269 F.3d 418 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> At the time of the present conviction, Jenkins had two prior convictions for a felony drug offense, thus triggering \u00a7 841(b)(l)(C)\u2019s thirty year maximum penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
