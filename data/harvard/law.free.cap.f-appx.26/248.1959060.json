Deane\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Deane pled guilty to possession of eighteen firearms after having been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The presentence investigation report calculated Deane\u2019s offense level at twenty-one with a criminal history category of II, resulting in a sentencing guidelines range of forty-one to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. This included a five-level enhancement pursuant to USSG 2K2.1(b)(l)(E) for Deane\u2019s involvement in the acquisition, possession, and transportation of forty-one firearms. Deane initially objected to the calculation of the sentencing guidelines range, then subsequently withdrew his objections and stipulated to the sentencing range of forty-one to fifty-one months imprisonment. The district court sentenced him to the minimum of forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Deane charges the district court with error in accepting his guilty plea. Because Deane did not raise any objections at his guilty plea hearing, this Court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>112 F.3d 163, 165 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">The Rule 11 colloquy established Deane\u2019s competence to plead guilty, and Deane acknowledged his satisfaction with his counsel\u2019s representation and his awareness that by pleading guilty, he was forfeiting his rights to the presumption of innocence, to a jury trial, to have the government prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to confront witnesses against him, to cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence on his own behalf or not put on any evidence, and to choose whether to testify at trial, which decision could not be used against him. Deane acknowledged his awareness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of the charge against him and the potential maximum punishment for the charged offense. He affirmed his desire to plead guilty of his own free will, made without any promises, threats, or coercion, and admitted his guilt. The Government presented a summary of the evidence establishing Deane\u2019s possession of eighteen firearms and his prior felony conviction, to which there was no objection. We find the district court did not err in accepting his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Furthermore, we find the calculations of the criminal history category and offense level are supported by the evidence presented at the first sentencing hearing, at the Rule 11 hearing, and in the presentence investigation report. Further, because Deane\u2019s sentence of forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment, even if based on a finding of possession of more firearms than charged in the original indictment, is less than the ten-year statutory maximum punishment and thus does not implicate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Moreover, Deane\u2019s stipulation waived any objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Next, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Deane\u2019s pro se \u201cMotion to Withdraw from Counsel,\u201d <em>See Fields v. Murray, </em>49 F.3d 1024, 1029 (4th Cir.1995). Further, to the extent Deane\u2019s motion could be read to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, such a claim is not cognizable in this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and concluded that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (1994), this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Deane\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
