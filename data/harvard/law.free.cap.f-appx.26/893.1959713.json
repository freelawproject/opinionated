R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).

He was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release; at the end of his imprisonment, he is to be surrendered to immigration officials for deportation. Mr. Ochoa Olivas appeals from the denial of his motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. Mr. Ochoa sought a downward departure, arguing that his case presented unique circumstances in that he had been advised by someone he believed to be an attorney that he could lawfully remain in the United States. III R. (PSR) 111178-86. Mr. Ochoa argued for a downward departure on this basis independently of whether the government moved for one based upon substantial assistance, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The government declined to move for a substantial assistance departure. Ill R. 11 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">We have reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing. We only have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart when the district court \u201cconcludes that an entire class of circumstances never constitutes the basis for a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 888 (10th Cir.1998). Where the district court exercises its discretion to depart based upon the circumstances of a defendant\u2019s case, as happened here, we lack jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Browning, </em>252 F.3d 1153, 1160-61 (10th Cir.2001). The district court not only found that \u201cno departure is warranted under the facts of this case,\u201d II R. 17, but also considered those actual facts-even if Mr. Ochoa Olivas was given incorrect advice in January 2001, he still had to enter the country unlawfully, II R. 18. Contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, this is not a categorical denial, but rather a consideration of the Defendant\u2019s circumstances that surrounded the defective advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b923-32\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
