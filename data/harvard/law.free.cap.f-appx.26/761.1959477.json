This argument is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pierre Y., </em>No. 00-30411, 2002 WL 187420 (cite forthcoming).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">Longee also argues that his conviction for burglary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 violates equal protection. This contention is without merit. <em>See United States v. Yazzie, </em>693 F.2d 102, 104 (9th Cir.1982) (holding \u201cit was rational for Congress to provide that [burglary] under the Major Crimes Act was to be defined and punished as provided by state law, in order to ensure that Indians and non-Indians who commit identical acts in the same location would be subject to identical punishments\u201d). Longee cannot dispute that all persons subject to federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b) are subject to similar treatment. Nor has he met his burden \u201cto negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 964, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-19\">.
