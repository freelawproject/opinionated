The parties have waived oral argument, and upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">At sentencing, Espino-Ochoa moved the district court to limit his sentence of imprisonment to a two-year maximum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). In support of his motion, Espino-Ochoa asserted that the indictment charging him with the offense did not charge that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony at the time he illegally re-entered the United States, and he did not admit or stipulate at his change of plea that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony at the time he unlawfully re-entered the United States. Because the aggravated felony was not included in his indictment, Espino-Ochoa argued that he should only be subjected to the two-year penalty set out in \u00a7 1326. Espino-Ochoa cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), for the proposition that a prior aggravated felony is an element of a separate offense in \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and that it must be charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court overruled Espino-Ochoa\u2019s motion, found that Espino-Ochoa had previously been deported subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony, and sentenced Espino-Ochoa to forty-six months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In his timely appeal, Espino-Ochoa essentially reasserts the argument set forth in the district court. Espino-Ochoa candidly concedes that in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior aggravated felony is a sentencing factor under \u00a7 1326, but he contends that the decision in <em>Apprendi </em>limits or abrogates the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The issue in this case involves the application of law to a given set of facts that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>988 F.2d 658, 660 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Upon review, we conclude that EspinoOchoa\u2019s argument is unavailing. He contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>limits or abrogates the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and entitles him to a sentence below the two-year maximum set forth in \u00a7 1326(a). The decision in <em>Apprendi </em>was foreshadowed in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), which held that serious bodily injury or death was an element under the federal carjacking statute. In both <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Jones </em>the Court discussed and distinguished its earlier decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>which upheld a sentencing enhancement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) based upon the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Espino-Ochoa argues that <em>Apprendi </em>should be extended to prohibit the use of a prior conviction to increase the maximum statutory penalty unless the issue is submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. While the Court in <em>Apprendi </em>suggested it might reconsider the recidivist issue in the future, it nonetheless declined to revisit its earlier decision upholding a sentencing enhancement based on the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains the law of the land, <em>United States v. Gatewood, </em>230 F.3d 186, 192 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc), and it is indistinguishable from the immediate case. As was the case in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>Espino-Ochoa\u2019s case presents circumstances wherein there exists both the certainty that procedural safeguards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>attached to any fact of prior conviction, and the reality that Espino-Ochoa did not challenge the accuracy of that fact in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
