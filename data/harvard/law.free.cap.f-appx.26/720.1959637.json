Lowerison (\u201cLowerison\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellees, the County of San Diego (\u201cCounty\u201d) and Sheriffs Deputy William Yavno (\u201cYavno\u201d), on Lowerison\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state law claims. Lowerison\u2019s claims are predicated on a traffic stop initiated by Yavno. Lowerison contends that Yavno used ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>cessive force by applying handcuffs too tightly. The district court also refused to grant Lowerison\u2019s third request for additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">\n<em>Excessive Force</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Lowerison admitted that Yavno did nothing to hurt him \u201cphysically as far as pain goes,\u201d and that Yavno only touched him and guided him. Lowerison complained to Yavno about tight handcuffs only one time, while Yavno was driving to the station. Lowerison failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding excessive force, and thus the district court properly granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Little v. Windermere Relocation, Inc., </em>265 F.3d 903, 915 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>False Arrest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Lowerison asserts a false arrest claim, on the basis that Yavno lacked probable cause for Lowerison\u2019s arrest. Lowerison is collaterally estopped from asserting lack of probable cause for his arrest, because the state court\u2019s denial of Lowerison\u2019s motion to suppress evidence precludes relitigation of the false arrest issue. <em>Ayers v. City of Richmond, </em>895 F.2d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.1990). Lowerison contends that because there was doubt about the judgment in the criminal proceeding, the motion to suppress was \u201cnot essential to the final judgment in the criminal proceeding\u201d and was \u201cnot fully and finally litigated.\u201d However, the motion to suppress was an integral part of the criminal proceeding. Lowerison\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Lowerison\u2019s guilty plea also es-tops him from asserting lack of probable cause for his arrest. Lowerison argues that Appellees waived the affirmative defense of collateral estoppel by failing to specifically plead it. Affirmative defenses are not waived even if they are first raised in pretrial dispositive motions, if the plaintiff is not unfairly surprised or prejudiced. <em>See Camarillo v. McCarthy, </em>998 F.2d 638, 639 (9th Cir.1993). Because Lowerison has failed to establish surprise or prejudice, Appellees did not waive the affirmative defense of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">\n<em>Malicious Prosecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">Lowerison\u2019s malicious prosecution claim against Yavno fails because no material issue of fact exists regarding the independent authority of the prosecutor to proceed with charges. <em>Nadell v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dept., </em>268 F.3d 924, 929 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">\n<em>Destruction of Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Lowerison contends that Yavno damaged equipment in Lowerison\u2019s truck, and also damaged his truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yavno presented evidence that there was \u201cno major damage\u201d to the vehicle when it left his control. Lowerison\u2019s conclusory statements are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>Magana v. N. Mariana Islands, </em>107 F.3d 1436, 1447-48 (9th Cir. 1997). Additionally, claims which are \u201cnot specifically and distinctly argued and raised in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived.\u201d <em>Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 919 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1105, 1110 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">In any event, if California has an \u201cadequate post deprivation remedy,\u201d Lowerison is barred from bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>816-17 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). California law does provide such a remedy. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Lowerison is not entitled to relief on his property damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\n<em>Falsification of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Lowerison failed to raise a question of fact regarding his falsification of evidence claim. Lowerison offered absolutely no evidence that Yavno tampered with Lowerison\u2019s blood sample. Yavno detailed the handling of the blood test tube, tracing its location from the nurse who drew the sample, to the evidence refrigerator where Yavno left it to be tested according to procedure. Summary judgment was proper as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\n<em>Discovery Request</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The district court\u2019s denial of Lowerison\u2019s request for further discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Chance v. Pac-Tel Teletrac Inc., </em>242 F.3d 1151, 1161 n. 6 (9th Cir.2001). Lowerison had the burden of proffering sufficient facts to make clear \u201cwhat further discovery would reveal that is \u2018essential to justify ... opposition\u2019 and prevent summary judgment.\u201d <em>Nicholas v. Wallenstein, </em>266 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Program Eng\u2019g Inc. v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>634 F.2d 1188, 1194 (9th Cir. 1980)). The district court noted that Lowerison failed to \u201cspecify what, if any additional documents\u201d he sought to uncover through discovery. The district court acted within its discretion in denying Lowerison\u2019s third request for additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">For the reasons stated above, this Court affirms the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Lowerison could not see which items, if any, Yavno picked up when he was bending over Lowerison's truck during the search, b\u00e9cause Yavno did not lift items up high enough for Lowerison to see over the bed walls of the truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
