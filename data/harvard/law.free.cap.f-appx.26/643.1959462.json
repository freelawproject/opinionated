Carelle and Paul Groh of the Yamhill County Sheriffs Department. Peebles brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he was falsely arrested for illegally videotaping an incident between himself and a neighbor. He also asserted related state law claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">We need not state the facts because the parties are familiar with them. The determinative issue is whether the officers had probable cause to arrest Peebles. Probable cause is a complete defense to false arrest and malicious prosecution claims under both federal and Oregon law. <em>See Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, </em>68 F.3d 1180, 1189 (9th Cir.1995) (malicious prosecution as a basis for federal due process claim); <em>Gustafson v. Payless Drug Stores N.W., Inc., </em>269 Or. 354, 525 P.2d 118, 119-20 (Or.1974) (state malicious prosecution); <em>Bacon v. City of Tigard, </em>81 Or. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>App. 147, 724 P.2d 885 (Or.Ct.App.1986) (state false arrest). It is also a complete defense to Peebles\u2019s section 1983 claim. <em>Beauregard v. Wingard, </em>362 F.2d 901, 903 (9th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Here, \u201c \u2018the facts and circumstances within [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they [had] reasonably trustworthy information [were] sufficient to warrant a prudent man in beheving\u201d \u2019 that Peebles violated Oregon law when he recorded the conversation with Ader. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>241 F.3d 638, 648 (9th Cir.) (quoting <em>Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1634, 149 L.Ed.2d 494 (2001). Oregon law prohibits a person from \u201c[o]btain[ing] or attempting] to obtain the whole or any part of a conversation by means of any device, contrivance, machine or apparatus ... if all participants in the conversation are not specifically informed that their conversation is being obtained.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 165.540(l)(e). After watching the video recording and questioning Peebles, the officers determined that Peebles had not informed Aders that the conversation was being recorded before he began filming. Thus, the officers reasonably concluded that the recording was in violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Peebles contends that the officers acted without probable cause because his conduct fits within a statutory exception contained in Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 165.540(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not decide this issue. Whether or not the exception applies, the officers\u2019 interpretation of the statute was reasonable. They had probable cause to believe that Peebles had recorded the conversation illegally, and they had probable cause to arrest him. This provided them with a complete defense, not only to Peebles\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, but to his false arrest and malicious prosecution claims as well. Because the officers did not violate Peebles\u2019s rights, we need not consider whether the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (holding that if no constitutional right is violated, \u201cthere is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Peebles\u2019s claim for infliction of emotional distress also fails. His allegations fail to support an inference that the officers engaged in conduct that \u201c \u2018constituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 901 P.2d 841, 849 (Or.1995) (quoting <em>Sheets v. Knight, </em>308 Or. 220, 779 P.2d 1000, 1010 (Or.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\">.
