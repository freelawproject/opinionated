The claim of ineffective assistance rests solely on defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise a double jeopardy argument. Mr. Musone contends that because his sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was determined with reference to the guidelines for arson, the imposition of the statutory enhancement .for use-of-fire in the commission of a felony, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h), constitutes multiple punishment for the same offense, a result not intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-25\">Mr. Musone was convicted on six counts, including one of conspiracy to commit arson and mail fraud. The federal appellate courts that have addressed the issue agree that conspiracy to commit arson is not the same offense as use-of-fire in the commission of a felony. Under the Guidelines, Mr. Musone\u2019s sentence on the arson-related group of charges was properly based on the offense level of the substantive offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of arson. Congress has provided a mandatory enhancement under \u00a7 844(h) for the use of fire in the commission of a felony and the courts have no power to disregard it. The fact that Mr. Musone committed arson as well as other offenses does not insulate him from punishment for the separate offenses of conspiracy and use-of-fire to commit a felony. Defense counsel\u2019s decision not to raise an argument not supported by the law of this or any other court of appeals does not constitute deficient representation under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The judgment denying the petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
