The plaintiffs, two groups dedicated to protecting parkland, argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction. Because this court has previously permitted almost identical removals, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">This case stems from protracted, ongoing litigation over the last twenty years designed to desegregate public housing in the City of Yonkers. <em>See U.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., </em>624 F.Supp. 1276 (S.D.N.Y. 1985), 635 F.Supp. 1577 (S.D.N.Y.1986), <em>aff'd </em>837 F.2d 1181 (2d Cir.1987). One of the major steps in remedying the segregation is the creation of new subsidized housing in predominantly white Northeast Yonkers. After extensive delays, the City designated the \u201cEast Grassy Sprain Road Site\u201d as its location for new housing construction. At the time, the site was part of Rory O\u2019Moore Park, and the district court required that the City properly de-dedicate the site as parkland before it could be finally approved. In order to de-dedicate the site as parkland, the City needed an act of the New York State Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>authorizing its de-dedication and an agreement by Westchester County to waive its reversionary interest in the site. The state act was signed into law on January 30, 1997, with a stipulation that the City \u201cshall dedicate replacement lands of equal or greater fair market value for park purposes.\u201d 1996 N.Y. Laws 728. On April 25,1997, the Westchester County Board of Legislators authorized a quitclaim conveyance of the site to the City on the condition that the City \u201cdedicate at least twenty-five (25) additional acres to the existing park system of the City of Yonkers.\u201d Act No. 64-1997, Westchester County Board of Legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In January 1998, the City adopted a resolution dedicating five parcels of city-owned land as public parkland; the plaintiffs claim that this land had been acquired for park purposes before the agreement and thus was not an \u201cadditional\u201d twenty-five acres. In response, the plaintiffs filed the current action in August 2000 in New York State Supreme Court, requesting that the court determine whether the City had complied with the terms of the County\u2019s conveyance and requesting a declaration that the quitclaim deed was \u201cnull and void and of no effect,\u201d an injunction against the use of the site for residential development or any other purpose besides public parkland, and such other relief as is \u201cjust, proper and equitable.\u201d The County cross-claimed against the City, agreeing that the City had failed to dedicate additional parklands as required by the County\u2019s act and the Intermunicipal Agreement implementing the County\u2019s act, and requesting that the court order specific performance by the City (dedication of an additional twenty-five acres of parkland).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The City removed to the district court under the authority of the All Writs Act. The district court, after conducting a hearing, denied the motion to remand, holding that jurisdiction existed under the All Writs Act, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the Intermunicipal Agreement for lack of standing (although not the County\u2019s parallel claim), issuing an injunction forbidding the plaintiffs from \u201cchallenging in any forum the use of the Grassy Sprain site for housing purposes,\u201d and remanding the claims for specific performance to the New York Supreme Court. The plaintiffs appealed only the conclusion that the district court has jurisdiction under the All Writs Act. The County has taken no position in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d In a prior appeal involving the Yonkers desegregation litigation, the Second Circuit has held that the All Writs Act supports removal when removal is \u201cnecessary to protect the integrity of the Consent Decree\u201d and \u201cthe issues raised by the [state-court action] cannot be separated from the relief provided by the Consent Decree.\u201d <em>Yonkers Racing Corp. v. City of Yonkers, </em>858 F.2d 855, 865 (2d Cir.1988). In <em>Yonkers Racing Corp., </em>the court upheld removal of an Article 78 proceeding seeking to enjoin the City of Yonkers from condemning land for use as subsidized housing under the district court\u2019s order. Although the court did mention its concerns that the City would not litigate the condemnation proceedings aggressively enough in state court, its primary concerns were eliminating delays to the implementation of the federal court\u2019s prior decisions and avoiding the danger of inconsistent orders from state and federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 863-66. The present proceeding is essentially indistinguishable from <em>Yonkers Racing Corp. </em>In other cases, this court has similarly permitted removal to avoid de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lays and frustrations of federal court orders. <em>See, e.g., United States v. City of New York, </em>972 F.2d 464, 469 (2d Cir.1992). Accordingly, we conclude that removal under the All Writs Act was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
