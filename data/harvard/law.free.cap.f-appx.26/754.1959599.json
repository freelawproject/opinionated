Appellants, various officials at SRCI, bring this interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The district court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). The district court\u2019s order rejecting Appellants\u2019 qualified-immunity defense was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d subject to immediate appeal under the general appellate jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 312-13, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1995). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Grants of summary judgment are reviewed de novo. <em>Clicks Billiards Inc. v. Sixshooters Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2001). The Court must determine, viewing all evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity de novo. <em>Watkins v. City of Oakland, Cal., </em>145 F.3d 1087, 1092 (9th Cir.1998). Likewise, the determination of whether a right was clearly established at the time of the incident presents a pure question of law reviewed de novo. <em>Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, </em>988 F.2d 868, 873 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Government officials performing discretionary functions receive qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 so long as their conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 648, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">In this case the district court found that Appellants\u2019 actions violated Hunter\u2019s First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of his grievances and his right to free speech. However, here the kyte was quite clearly asserting the right of Petrie in the confiscation of his particular materials that Hunter had prepared. An inmate legal assistant does not have a clearly established right to assert the claim of another inmate for the confiscation of that inmate\u2019s legal materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
