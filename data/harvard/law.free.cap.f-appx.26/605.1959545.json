Patel and Silloo J. Patel appeal pro se the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of their 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging their jury trial conviction for two counts of attempted income tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">We granted a certificate of appealability as to the issue of whether the district court erred for <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing the Patels\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred. We review de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion on statute of limitations grounds. <em>See Herbst v. Cook, </em>260 F.3d 1039,1042 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">The district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a \u00a7 2255 motion on statute of limitations grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1042; <em>cf. United States v. Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that the statute of limitations period for \u00a7 2254 petitions and \u00a7 2255 motions is not treated differently). However, before dismissing, the district court must first give adequate notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>Id. </em>at 1043. Review of the record demonstrates that the Patels were neither given notice, nor the opportunity to respond prior to the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Accordingly, the order dismissing the Patels\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-13\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction over Silloo Patel because she allegedly was not in custody when the \u00a7 2255 motion was filed in the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (vesting the Court of Appeals with appellate jurisdiction over all final decisions of the district courts); <em>Blazak v. Ricketts, </em>971 F.2d 1408, 1410 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (stating that the district court\u2019s order was a final appealable order because it disposed of all claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
