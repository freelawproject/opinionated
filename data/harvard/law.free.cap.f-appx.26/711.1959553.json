He also appeals the district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions on his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">With respect to summary judgment on the race discrimination claim, on de novo review, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its written order. In particular, we note that Glenn\u2019s racial reference to Plaintiff was a single isolated remark that, in all the circumstances revealed on this record, is insufficient to give rise to an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">With respect to the imposition of a monetary sanction, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion under its inherent powers. At the hearing on the order to show cause, Plaintiffs lawyer specifically stated that a f\u00edne was an appropriate sanction for his act of signing Cogan\u2019s name to the affidavit, which was in violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. Moreover, the district court found that counsel\u2019s conduct had \u201cdegrade[d] the whole concept of \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 making true representations to the Court\u201d and that his conduct had created substantial burdens for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"Au6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
