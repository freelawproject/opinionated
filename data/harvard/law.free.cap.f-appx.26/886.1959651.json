R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-19\">These two appeals are consolidated for disposition on appeal. Each counts as an appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Both \u00a7 1983 actions were dismissed by the trial court because they were redundant of prior pending action 01-WM-630. Mr. Negron is still pursuing the prior pending action in district court. We agree with the trial court that these two appeals are redundant of pending action 01-WM-630 and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">The trial court also denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal because it found that \u201cthe appeal[s are] not taken in good faith because plaintiff has not shown the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues on appeal.\u201d Record at 10. The trial court was correct both in its dismissal and in denying leave to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">We DENY Mr. Negron\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We also DENY the renewed motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal and remind Appellant that he remains bound to pay the appellate filing fees as well as the installment payments ordered by the trial court when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>granted leave to proceed in the district court in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The appeals are DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
