McCants appeals from the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board affirming the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) that he had been overpaid $17,280.65 in civil service annuity benefits as the conservator and representative payee for Robert E. Ford. <em>McCants v. OPM, </em>No. DC-831M-01-0268-I-1, slip op. at 5 (MSPB June 6, 2001). Because McCants has not shown that the Board erred, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Mr. McCants was appointed as the conservator for Robert E. Ford by the Superi- or Court for the District of Columbia on July 8, 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Mr. Ford had retired in February 1980 under the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. 8331-8351, and thus was the beneficiary of an annuity for his years of federal service. <em>Id. </em>On August 11, 1998, McCants submitted a Form RI 20-7 \u201cRepresentative Payee Application\u201d to OPM, which requested that he receive the monthly annuity payments on behalf of Mr. Ford. <em>Id. </em>That form stated in relevant part that \u201cI agree that I will be liable for any payments which I receive after the annuitant\u2019s death. I understand that all such payments will be considered debts to the U.S. Government and are to be immediately returned to the U.S. Treasury Department.\u201d On November 2, 1998, McCants notified OPM in writing that Mr. Ford\u2019s wife had died in April 1984, and that deductions for survivor benefits had been erroneously withheld from Mr. Ford\u2019s annuity payments since that time. <em>Id. </em>OPM subsequently agreed to pay the accrued annuity benefits previously withheld, which totaled $11,214.90 after taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">Mr. Ford died on December 24, 1998. Nevertheless, OPM continued to send annuity checks to McCants on January 1, February 1, March 1, April 1, and May 1, 1999. <em>Id. </em>The February annuity payment included the $11,214.90 refund for the amounts withheld for survivor benefits since May 1, 1984. <em>Id. </em>In January 1999, Shermanita Ford, Mr. Ford\u2019s daughter, was appointed by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia as the Personal Representative of her father\u2019s estate. <em>Id. </em>at 3. In June 1999, she submitted an application for death benefits to OPM. <em>Id. </em>OPM made a lump sum payment to Ms. Ford for the twenty-four days of December preced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ing her father\u2019s death, which represented the amount that should have been included in the January 1, 1999, annuity check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">After learning of Mr. Ford\u2019s death, OPM notified McCants on August 11,1999, that under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(c), Mr. Ford\u2019s annuity terminated on the day of his death, that he was not entitled to any of the annuity checks issued after December 1, 1998, and that he therefore was liable for the $17,280.65 in annuity payments that he erroneously received. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Upon McCants\u2019 request for reconsideration, OPM affirmed its initial decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">McCants initiated the present appeal to the Board alleging that although OPM is entitled to a refund for the $6,065.75 in monthly annuity payments that accrued after Mr. Ford\u2019s death, he is not obligated to refund the portion of the February 1, 1999, annuity check representing payment for the survivor deductions that had been erroneously withheld from Mr. Ford\u2019s annuity since May 1, 1984. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Ms. Ford intervened in the appeal, and joined OPM in claiming that McCants should return the amounts of the annuity checks that were issued to him between January 1 and May 1, 1999, so that the money could be distributed according to the statutory order of precedence. <em>Id. </em>The Administrative Judge assigned to the ease affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, reasoning that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342 requires that any accrued-but-unpaid annuity be distributed in accordance with the statutory order of precedence set forth in \u00a7 8342(c), which does not include a conservator. <em>Id. </em>at 5. McCants did not request review of the initial decision, thus rendering that decision final. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(b) (2001). McCants timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Jennings v. MSPB, </em>59 F.3d 159,160 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">On appeal, McCants argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the $11,214.90 payment was not an annuity payment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(a), but rather was a lump sum payment for the erroneous survivor benefits deductions dating back to May 1, 1984. McCants therefore argues that the statutory order of precedence set forth in \u00a7 8342(c) does not apply to that payment, and that he is not obligated to repay that money.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">We conclude that the Board did not err in affirming OPM\u2019s decision that McCants is liable for the full overpayment debt of $17,280.65. The requirements for creating a survivor annuity are set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(j)(4), which provides that: \u201cIn order to provide a survivor annuity ... the annuity of an employee ... is reduced by 2 /\u00e9 percent of the first $3,600 thereof plus 10 percent of so much thereof that exceeds $3,600.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(j)(4) (2000). Section 8339(j)(5)(i) provides that such a reduction in an employee\u2019s annuity \u201cshall be terminated for each full month ... after the death of the spouse.... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(j)(5) (2000). Therefore, once an annuitant\u2019s spouse has died, the amount of the deduction that had been made for the survivor annuity automatically becomes part of the employee\u2019s annuity, regardless whether or not OPM has properly included that money in the regular monthly annuity payment. Accordingly, the money that had been deducted for his wife\u2019s survivor annuity began accruing in Mr. Ford\u2019s annuity as of May 1, 1984, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>any payment of those amounts later made by OPM to compensate for any erroneous survivor annuity deductions must be considered to be an annuity payment under the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Section 8342 of title 5 of the United States Code expressly governs the distribution of lump sum benefits arising from annuity monies that have accrued but are unpaid at the time of the annuitant\u2019s death. Section 8342(f) provides that \u201c[I]f an annuitant dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(f) (2000). Subsection (f) is governed by \u00a7 8342(c), which states in relevant part that: \u201cLump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (d)-(f) of this section shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the employee or Member and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and payment bars recovery by any other person.... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(c) (2000). The statutory order of precedence includes designated beneficiaries, widows, children, parents, executors or administrators, and next of kin. <em>Id. </em>Neither a conservator nor a representative payee is mentioned, and MeCants is therefore not entitled to the $11,214.90 annuity payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Moreover, MeCants expressly agreed to return <em>any </em>payments he received after Mr. Ford\u2019s death in the Form RI 20-7 he submitted to OPM as a condition to becoming Mr. Ford\u2019s representative payee. MeCants is therefore obligated under his agreement with OPM to return the $11,214.90 in accrued-but-unpaid lump sum annuity benefits so that OPM may redistribute the money to the proper beneficiary in accordance with the statutory order of precedence set forth in \u00a7 8342(c). Accordingly, we conclude that the Board did not err in affirming OPM\u2019s decision that MeCants is hable for annuity overpayments in the amount of $17,280.65.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">We have considered MeCants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\"> We express no opinion as to any entitlement of MeCants to reimbursement from the estate of Robert D. Ford of expenses he claims he incurred on behalf of the annuitant, including funeral expenses. Such expenses are not relevant to McCant's obligations to OPM.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
