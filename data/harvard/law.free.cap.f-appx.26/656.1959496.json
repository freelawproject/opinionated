We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Sharaf first argues that the district court erred by not allowing him to offer a jury instruction regarding his proposed good-faith defense. We review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo because it concerns \u201cwhether the instructions given adequately presented the defendant\u2019s theory of the case,\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>233 F.3d 1117, 1130 (9th Cir.2000), and we review the formulation of the jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>217 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1037, 121 S.Ct. 627, 148 L.Ed.2d 536 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Here, the court\u2019s charge incorporated the crux of Sharafs proffered instruction, including the various scienter elements that the government needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction under \u00a7 1344. It also defined several key terms, including \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d Consequently, the district court\u2019s ruling was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Sharaf also argues that the district court erred under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) by admitting evidence of uncharged fraudulent acts. The evidence admitted demonstrated that Sharaf had defrauded Boatmen\u2019s Bank (\u201cBoatmen\u2019s\u201d) in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1995 by using almost the same type of scheme the government charged in the indictment. For example, he repeatedly deposited worthless checks drawn on accounts in Pakistan, and eventually was successful in withdrawing money from his Boatmen\u2019s account before the bank could freeze it. Also, considering that Sharaf perpetrated his scheme throughout the 1990s, there was a sufficient temporal link between the Boatmen\u2019s activity and the frauds committed against the Seattle-area banks. Admission of the Boatmen\u2019s Bank evidence was consistent with Rule 404(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Next, Sharaf challenges the district court\u2019s eight-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 based on findings regarding amounts that Sharaf intended to defraud from various banks \u2014 as opposed to the amounts that he actually defrauded the banks. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of a sentencing guideline de novo, its application of the guideline \u201cto the facts of a particular case for abuse of discretion,\u201d and \u201cthe factual findings underlying the court\u2019s sentencing decision\u201d for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayakhom, </em>186 F.3d 928, 946 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>197 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1179, 120 S.Ct. 1216, 145 L.Ed.2d 1117 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">We previously have held that in a fraud case a district court may sentence according to the amount of intended loss \u201cif that amount can be determined and if it is greater than the actual loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallagher, </em>99 F.3d 329, 334 (9th Cir.1996). Here, Sharaf engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud Seattle-area banks by repeatedly withdrawing money from accounts until the banks finally became aware of his misconduct. The district court reasonably determined that Sharaf did not intend to limit his withdrawals and, indeed, would have continued his fraudulent conduct but for the banks\u2019 intervention. Considering that Sharafs intended loss was subject to calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and far exceeded the actual losses sustained by the banks, the district court did not err in enhancing his base offense level by eight points.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Sharaf also argues that the district court improperly cut short his sentencing allocution. We review for harmless error a district court\u2019s failure to provide a complete allocution to a defendant. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>200 F.3d 653, 657 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1234, 120 S.Ct. 2669, 147 L.Ed.2d 282 (2000). Although such an error is not harmless if the district court had discretion to impose a shorter sentence, <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>73 F.3d 1470, 1503-04 (9th Cir.1995),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a defendant\u2019s right to allocate is not unfettered; the district court may, for example, cut short an allocution if the defendant strays from \u201cissues pertaining to mitigation.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>200 F.3d at 658. Here, although the district court initially indicated that it would not allow Sharaf to continue speaking, it acceded to Sharafs request that he be allowed to ask the court a final \u201cquestion\u201d before the court imposed its sentence. Considering that the district court essentially permitted Sharaf to finish his already lengthy allocution, we cannot say that it improperly restricted Sharafs right to speak during the sentencing colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Finally, we hold that Sharaf waived any objection to the factual assertions in the Presentence Report by failing to present his objections to the district court during the sentencing colloquy. <em>United States v. Manarite, </em>44 F.3d 1407, 1419 n. 18 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. Sharaf also argues that the district court erred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. We disagree. Considering that the government proffered ample evidence in its case-in-chief about Sharaf\u2019s Seattle-area schemes, evidence regarding similar activities in the St. Louis area was not substantially more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">.
