COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, Medical Department, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b917-11\">No. 01-1525.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b917-12\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b917-13\">Feb. 6, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b917-14\">Before TACHA, Chief Judge, EBEL and LUCERO, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b917-15\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b917-16\">EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b917-17\">We will exercise jurisdiction over this appeal despite the apparent untimeliness of Shaw\u2019s notice of appeal because the district court failed to enter judgment on a separate document, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. Under such circumstances, judgment is not final, but we nevertheless will address the merits in the interest of efficiency and judicial economy. <em>See Clough v. Rush, </em>959 F.2d 182, 185-86 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">As recognized by the district court, Shaw\u2019s section 1983 suit against the Colorado Department of Corrections is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Griess v. State of Colorado, </em>841 F.2d 1042, 1045 (10th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Shaw\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED. We will not consider Shaw\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, as it was not raised below and thus is not properly before us on appeal. Shaw\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of the filing fee is DENIED. The unpaid balance of the filing fee is due and should be paid immediately.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
