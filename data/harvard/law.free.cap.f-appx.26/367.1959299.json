Accordingly, we deny Harrell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Harrell, </em>Nos. CR-90-27; CA-00-1239-1 (M.D.N.C. May 7, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"> A panel of this court recently heard argument in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>No. 00-7578, on the issue of whether a district court must notify a pro se litigant that it intends to construe a filing that is not so labeled as a \u00a7 2255 motion and afford the movant the opportunity to withdraw the motion in order to avoid the restrictions on second or successive motions under \u00a7 2255. This case will not be controlled by the decision in <em>Emmanuel, </em>however, as Harrell has previously filed a first \u00a7 2255 motion and therefore was not prejudiced by the district court's failure to provide notice and an opportunity to withdraw prior to construing his motion as one filed under \u00a7 2255. Harrell\u2019s recourse is a motion in this court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West Supp. 2001), for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
