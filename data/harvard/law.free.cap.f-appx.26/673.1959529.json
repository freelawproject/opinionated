We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The district court properly concluded that no cause of action exists against the individual postal employees for violations of Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c); <em>Mahoney v. United States Postal Service, </em>884 F.2d 1194, 1196 (9th Cir.1989) (recognizing that the only proper Title VII defendant is the head of the agency in which the alleged discrimination occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Because Knox failed to timely and properly serve defendant Postmaster General and did not show good cause for the failure, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the Title VII cause of action. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), 4(i); <em>see also Boudette v. Barnette, </em>923 F.2d 754, 755-56 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">The district court properly dismissed Knox\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, \u00a7 1985, \u00a7 1986 and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 claims against the postal service. <em>See White v. General Services Admin., </em>652 F.2d 913, 916-17 (9th Cir.1981) (holding that Title VII action against federal government provides the exclusive remedy for a federal employment discrimination action).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">The union defendants were properly dismissed because Knox failed to exhaust administrative remedies as to the Title VII claim, <em>see Stache v. Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers, </em>852 F.2d 1231, 1233-34 (9th Cir. 1988), failed to present evidence of a breach of the duty of fair representation, <em>see Peterson v. Kennedy, </em>771 F.2d 1244, 1253-55 (9th Cir.1985) and failed to present evidence of \u00a7 1985 violations, <em>see Dooley v. Reiss, </em>736 F.2d 1392, 1395-96 (9th Cir.1984). Without a valid section 1985 claim, the section 1986 must also fail. <em>See Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep\u2019t., </em>839 F.2d 621, 626 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">The district court properly dismissed the action against defendants EEOC and Player, an EEOC administrative law judge, for failure to state a claim. <em>See Ward v. EEOC, </em>719 F.2d 311, 313-14 (9th Cir.1983) (recognizing no cause of action against the EEOC by employees of third parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Knox\u2019s request for discovery. <em>See H20 Houseboat Vacations Inc. v. Hernandez, </em>103 F.3d 914, 917 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Because his case does not present exceptional circumstances on appeal, we deny Knox\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Knox\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Knox\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">iptijg \u00bf^position is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
