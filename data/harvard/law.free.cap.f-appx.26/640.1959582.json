Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not repeat them in further detail. We affirm the denial of both motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The district court did not commit clear error in finding that Jurado consented to the automobile search. Jurado verbally agreed to the search and signed a consent form. There is some ambiguity in the record about whether the officer possessed Jurado\u2019s identification card at the time the officer asked for consent. But the same portion of the record establishes that the officer told Jurado that he was \u201cfree to leave\u201d before asking for consent to search. Voluntary consent to search is a factual determination, reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Cormier, </em>220 F.3d 1103, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We cannot find any clear error here. Given the district court\u2019s finding of voluntary consent, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was appropriately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The district court was also correct in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the secretly recorded conversation between defendant and codefendant in the back of a patrol car. The contents of the conversation evince the absence of a subjective expectation of privacy. Defendants wondered out loud whether they were being taped. Fourth Amendment protection does not apply where there is no subjective expectation of privacy. We therefore do not reach the question of whether there is an objective expectation of privacy in a patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">Fifth Amendment protection is equally inapplicable. \u201c[A] necessary element of compulsory self-incrimination is some kind of compulsion.\u201d <em>Hoff a v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 304, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966). Because Jurado was not forced to say anything, his statements do not constitute compulsed self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
