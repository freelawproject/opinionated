The district court did not, as Trammell argues, impermissibly shift the burden of proof to him by using his silence against him. Instead, the district court elected not to rely on those facts in the PreSentence Report to which Trammell objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">Neither did the district court err in applying the vulnerable victim adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1. Pifen Lo (\u201cLo\u201d), a woman with whom Trammell engaged in a sexual relationship after she appeared as a defendant in a criminal case before Trammell, was a vulnerable victim of Trammell\u2019s crime. The harm Trammell caused Lo need not be an element of the crime of which Trammell was convicted. <em>United States v. Haggard, </em>41 F.3d 1320, 1324-26 (9th Cir.1994). Trammell\u2019s criminal conduct need only be \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the harm his sexual relationship with Lo caused to her. <em>See United States v. Sherwood, </em>98 F.3d 402, 413 (9th Cir.1996). Lo was unusually vulnerable as she was born abroad, had limited English language skills, was on probation under Trammell\u2019s supervision, a psychologist testified at her sentencing hearing that she had a \u201cdependent personality disorder\u201d, and Trammell was about to sentence her husband in the same criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">The vulnerable victim enhancement serves an entirely different purpose in this case than the high-level decision maker enhancement applied to Trammell\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.7(b)(1)(B). <em>See United States v. Archdale, </em>229 F.3d 861, 869 (9th Cir.2000). The vulnerable victim enhancement was appropriately applied because Lo was in a position of vulnerability when compared with the usual victim of Trammell\u2019s crime, the People of California. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>262 F.3d 957, 961-62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(9th Cir.2001) (holding vulnerable victim status applies when the particular scheme targets victims who are unusually vulnerable based on characteristics different from most victims of that type of crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.7 (fraud involving deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of public officials) rather than section 2C1.2 (offering, giving, soliciting or receiving a gratuity to a public official with respect to an official act), to determine Trammell\u2019s base offense level. The gravamen of Trammell\u2019s crime was, as Trammell admitted, concealing his sexual relationship with Lo from the \u201cparties in the criminal case and the People of the State of California,\u201d which deprived the People of Trammell\u2019s honest services as a judge. Thus, Trammell\u2019s offense conduct is more specifically covered by section 2C1.7, and the district court properly applied that guideline section in determining Trammell\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, Trammell\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
