We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and order denying the motion for reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>eration and for leave to amend the pleadings and find no reversible'error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeals on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>Nos. CR-92-239-WS; CA-99-521-1 (M.D.N.C. June 26, 2000; July 20, 2001).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-14\"> We note that the magistrate judge filed his report and recommendation on the same day our decision issued in <em>Harris v. Hutchinson, </em>209 F.3d 325 (4th Cir.2000). In <em>Harris, </em>we held that 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(d) (West Supp. 2001) is a statute of limitation and is subject to equitable tolling in limited circumstances. <em>Harris, </em>209 F.3d at 329-30. Because the magistrate judge applied the proper equitable tolling principles even without the benefit of our decision in <em>Harris, </em>we find there is no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
