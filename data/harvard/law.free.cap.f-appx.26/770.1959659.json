R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b800-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">Thompson &amp; Company Insurance Services, Inc. (\u201cThompson\u201d), an insurance brokerage firm, appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d) in its action seeking a declaration of rights under an Insurance Agents and Brokers Professional Liability Policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) which Philadelphia had issued to Thompson. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">Philadelphia has eliminated any and all possibility of coverage under the terms of the policy because both underlying actions are \u201cclaims for fees,\u201d which are expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>excluded from coverage. <em>See Tana v. Professionals Prototype I Ins. Co., </em>47 Cal. App.4th 1612, 55 Cal.Rptr.2d 160, 163 (Ct. App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Thompson\u2019s claimed \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of coverage is not relevant because the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous. <em>American Star Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of the West, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 1320, 284 Cal.Rptr. 45, 52 (Ct.App.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The fact that the underlying actions contain claims for negligent misrepresentation does not give rise to a duty to defend both because California law considers negligent misrepresentation to be purposeful rather than accidental for the purpose of insurance coverage, <em>Chatton v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>10 Cal.App.4th 846, 13 Cal. Rptr.2d 318, 328 (Ct.App.1992), and because the underlying actions are \u201cclaims for fees,\u201d which are excluded from coverage regardless of whether they allege negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Thompson has failed to put forth sufficient evidence to raise any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). There is no evidence that Philadelphia has waived its right to deny coverage. <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619, 636 (Cal.1995). Philadelphia is not estopped from denying coverage because Thompson has made no showing of detrimental reliance on Philadelphia\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b800-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
