The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of Dayton Hudson. Schmidt appeals, arguing that the evidence in the summary-judgment record shows various disputed issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">Having reviewed the record de novo in light of the briefs and oral arguments and applying well-established summary-judgment standards, we are satisfied the District Court correctly ruled that Dayton Hudson was entitled to summary judgment. We conclude that as a matter of law Schmidt has failed to make a case for trial on any of her claims. Finding no flaw in the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned memorandum and order, we affirm the final judgment entered by that court against Schmidt and in favor of Dayton Hudson. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-17\">. The Honorable Kathleen A.
