General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>was sentenced to 294 months imprisonment for Count 1 and 60 months consecutively for Count 4. The court also imposed a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, he raises four issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">First, General alleges that the district court committed reversible error because it failed to inform him at his plea hearing that the mandatory minimum sentence for Count 4 is five years. We find that the district court\u2019s failure to follow Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c) was harmless as this information was contained in General\u2019s plea agreement. See <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard); <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117 (4th Cir.1991) (holding Rule 11 error harmless if information adequately covered in plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Second, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion by denying General\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000) (citing standard). General has failed to establish his burden to show a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e); <em>see also United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Next, General alleges that his 294 month sentence for Count 1 is erroneous in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). More specifically, he alleges that his sentence should be no more than 240 months for an unspecified amount of a Schedule I or II drug as stated in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West Supp.2001). In <em>United States v. Dinnall, </em>269 F.3d 418, 420-24 (4th Cir.2001), this court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine base but vacated and remanded Dinnall\u2019s 360-month sentence for the district court to impose a sentence no greater than 240 months under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). We find <em>Dinnall </em>controlling here and affirm General\u2019s conviction for Count 1, but vacate and remand his sentence for the district court to impose a sentence within the 240-month statutory maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Finally, General\u2019s argument that his sentence of five years of supervised release is also improper has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 647-48 (4th Cir.2001). We affirm General\u2019s conviction and sentence for Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
