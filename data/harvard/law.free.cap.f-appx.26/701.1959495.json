We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-22\">We review a district court\u2019s entry of sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Westreich argues that the district court should not have awarded attorney\u2019s fees because his novel legal theory was a good-faith effort to extend the law. Riverside argues that Schmitzer\u2019s claims had little or no chance of success and that Westreich was \u201creckless\u201d in pursuing Schmitzer\u2019s lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not decide which of these arguments is correct because we conclude that Westreich did not \u201cmultiply\u201d the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-23\">The plain language of \u00a7 1927 provides for sanctions only if an attorney \u201cmultiplies the proceedings ... unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Riverside\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>go to the \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cvexatious\u201d elements. Riverside is entitled to a \u00a7 1927 fee award, however, only if Westreich also \u201cmultiplied\u201d the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Westreich\u2019s conduct in this case caused only a single additional \u201cproceeding\u201d \u2014 summary judgment. Summary judgment ended this case; rather than creating new questions or issues to be litigated, it resolved the underlying dispute. Thus, summary judgment did not \u201cmultiply\u201d the proceedings: it brought the case to a conclusion. We reject Riverside\u2019s argument that Schmitzer\u2019s claims were so meritless that the summary judgment process alone constituted an unnecessary multiplication of the proceedings. Summary judgment is a common means of disposing of non-meritorious cases \u2014 particularly where, as here, the defendant never challenged the plaintiffs lawsuit with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, thus increasing the likelihood that the ease would go all the way to summary judgment \u2014 and \u00a7 1927 does not authorize sanctions to reimburse a party for the \u201cordinary costs\u201d of litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Riverside argues that sanctions are nonetheless appropriate because Westreich delayed in offering to settle after he determined that a then-recent case from this court undercut his legal theory, and because he filed Schmitzer\u2019s one-sentence response to summary judgment three days late.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These facts are irrelevant. It may be that Westreich could have acted more expeditiously and could have filed a more detailed and substantial summary judgment response; but even so, his conduct did not multiply the proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 1927 does not authorize sanctions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">The district court abused its discretion in imposing \u00a7 1927 sanctions because Westreich did not \u201cmultiply\u201d the proceedings, regardless of how his conduct is characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-14\">. <em>Pacific Harbor Capital, Inc. v.
