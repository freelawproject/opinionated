Mr. Arceneaux has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We deny a COA, a jurisdictional prerequisite, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B), and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Mr. Arceneaux pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) and aiding and abetting in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He later unsuccessfully sought to withdraw his guilty plea. Mr. Arceneaux was sentenced to 292 months imprisonment and five years supervised release. On direct appeal, this court affirmed Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Arceneaux, </em>No. 99-6049, 2000 WL 136150 (10th Cir. Jan.26, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">On appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Arceneaux argues that (1) he has not had a full and fair opportunity for an adjudication of his Fourth Amendment claim, and (2) he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion without adjudicating the merits. Aplt. Br. (A-15) at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was addressed by this court on direct appeal. <em>Arceneaux, </em>2000 WL 136150 at * 2. We found Mr. Arceneaux had failed to show that his counsel was ineffective and could not raise his Fourth Amendment claim given his valid guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Arceneaux may not raise issues decided on direct appeal under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">We DENY Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s request for a COA and IFP and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b924-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
