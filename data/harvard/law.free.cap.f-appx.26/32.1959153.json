Koeltl, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of said district court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Plaintiff-appellant James R. Moore appeals from the May 16, 2001 judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees, the New York State Department of Correctional Services and several of its employees (collectively \u201cDOCS\u201d), and dismissing his complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, asserting that DOCS\u2019 refusal to allow him to participate in the Family Reunion Program (\u201cFRP\u201d) with his wife, notwithstanding his previous participation in the program for two years, violated his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">We affirm the judgment below for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Decision and Order dated May 10, 2001. As the district court noted, to state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must establish the deprivation of a \u201cprotected liberty interest.\u201d <em>Arce v. Walker, </em>139 F.3d 329, 333 (2d Cir.1998). Inmates do not have a protected liberty interest in marital privacy or conjugal visits. <em>See Hernandez v. Coughlin, </em>18 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir.1994); see <em>also Champion v. Artuz, </em>76 F.3d 483, 486 (2d Cir.1996) (no protected liberty interest in participation in FRP, even where inmate was previously allowed to participate). Therefore, DOCS refusal to permit Moore to participate in the FRP does not constitute a violation of his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">To the extent Moore is claiming a violation of his right to equal protection because other similarly situated inmates were allowed to participate in the FRP, such a claim fails because under a rational-basis review, <em>see Lee v. Governor of New York, </em>87 F.3d 55, 60 (2d Cir.1996) (holding that rational basis applies because prisoners, either in the aggregate or separated by specific offense, do not constitute a suspect class), DOCS\u2019 reasons for not allowing Moore to participate in the FRP\u2014 based on the nature of his crime and his refusal to accept full responsibility- \u2014 -are rationally related to the penological goals of the prison system. <em>See Smith v. Coughlin, </em>748 F.2d 783, 786-88 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">Finally, Moore\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim fails because the denial of participation in the FRP, which is a discretionary program offered only to select inmates, does not constitute a deprivation that is \u201cobjectively, sufficiently serious\u201d so as to deny Moore \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>See Gaston v. Coughlin, </em>249 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
