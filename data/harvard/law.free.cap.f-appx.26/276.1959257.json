Reid argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the officers who stopped the vehicle in which he was riding did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. Reid also argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that his sentence was incorrectly calculated under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(1998). We affirm Reid\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The findings of fact from the suppression hearing are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). On the night in question, Officer Green of the Durham police department received a report from the communications division regarding a complaint of a burgundy Dodge Durango with weapons located near Building 36 on Ridgeway Avenue in the McDougal Terrace public housing development. Officer Green and two other officers responded to the call. While on the way to Building 36, they received a report over the police radio that a vehicle matching the same description was involved in an armed robbery a couple of days earlier. The officers located a burgundy Dodge Durango three or four blocks from Building 36 and stopped the vehicle. After the driver of the vehicle was arrested, Reid, a passenger, tried to flee. Reid was arrested for obstruction and trying to leave the scene. A subsequent search found 374.8 grams of crack cocaine on Reid\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Officers are permitted \u201cto effect a limited investigatory detention when they possess \u2018a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is engaged in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 294 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 440,100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980)). The combination of the tip stating the individuals in the vehicle had weapons and the report that a vehicle matching the same description was involved in an armed robbery a couple of days earlier provided reasonable suspicion for the stop of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Reid argues the testimony at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because the testimony of the officers regarding where police found the bag of drugs was contradictory. We review the verdict to determine whether there is substantial evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the conviction. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). When considering the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d 384, 391 n. 11 (4th.Cir.1998). We have reviewed the evidence and find, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dence is sufficient to support Reid\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Next, Reid argues his sentence was incorrectly calculated under the Guidelines. First, he argues the district court improperly assessed seven criminal history points placing him in category IV. We find the seven point criminal history assessment proper under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1. Second, Reid argues the district court erroneously failed to make a downward departure from the guidelines range. However, we lack authority to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward unless the district court\u2019s decision is based on a mistaken belief that it lacks authority to depart. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1130, 120 S.Ct. 968, 145 L.Ed.2d 839 (2000). Reid does not contend the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart; therefore, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Finally, Reid argues he should have been given a two point reduction in his offense level pursuant to a Department of Justice policy based on his agreement to deportation following his incarceration. Reid, however, has provided no authority for this type of a reduction or cited any specific policy. Therefore, we affirm Reid\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
