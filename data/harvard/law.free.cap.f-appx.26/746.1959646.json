We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo and may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Steckman v. Hart Brewing, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">Because plaintiffs reside in Montana and North Dakota but did not allege a concrete harm caused by the out-of-state defendants, the district court properly dismissed these claims for lack of standing. <em>See Shaw v. Hunt, </em>517 U.S. 899, 904, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996) (holding that a plaintiff lacks standing to challenge legislation created outside of plaintiffs district absent specific evidence of personal harm); <em>United States v. Hays, </em>515 U.S. 737, 743-44, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995) (indicating that a generalized grievance against allegedly illegal governmental conduct is insufficient to provide standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">The district court properly dismissed Harley McLain\u2019s claims against the North Dakota defendants because he failed to allege a concrete harm. <em>See Hays, </em>515 U.S. at 743-44, 115 S.Ct. 2431. The district court properly dismissed Frank McLain\u2019s claims against the Montana defendants because the complaint was conclusory and did not adequately link defendants to causes of action. <em>See McHenry v. Renne, </em>84 F.3d 1172, 1175 (9th Cir.1996) (indicating that a complaint must make clear the connections between specific allegations and individual defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">Because any amendment of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint would be futile, dismissal with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>out leave to amend was appropriate. <em>See Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>80 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Barilla v. Ervin, </em>886 F.2d 1514, 1522-25 (9th Cir.1989) (declaring constitutional Oregon\u2019s 20-day voter registration cut off), <em>overruled on other grounds, Simpson v. Lear Astronics Corp., </em>77 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Because plaintiffs fail to specifically challenge the remainder of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendation in their opening brief, these arguments are waived. <em>See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 919 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that issues which are not specifically and distinctly argued and raised a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b776-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
