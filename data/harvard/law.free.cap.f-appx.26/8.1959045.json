Mott appeals the decision of the District Court in its application of the sentencing guidelines, arguing that the Court erred when it: 1) established the amount of drugs constituting relevant conduct; 2) increased Mott\u2019s base offense level for use of a minor; and 3) denied Mott\u2019s motion for a downward departure. For the reasons that follow, Mott\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">Mott allowed various drug dealers to use his apartment to sell drugs while he was accepting drugs in payment. This was how he obtained his drugs as he was an addict. One of these dealers was a 17-year-old boy named Benjamin Wilson, who was arrested inside Mott\u2019s apartment; Mott claims that he did not know Wilson was a minor. Upon arresting Mott and Wilson, the police found 9.46 grams of cocaine base under a chair occupied by Wilson. Mott claims that these drugs should not have been utilized to determine his sentence for conspiracy to distribute because they were intended for his own personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">Mott\u2019s presentence report calculated his sentence as follows: Mott received a base offense level of 28 based on the amount of crack cocaine involved in both his offense conduct and his relevant conduct. Mott\u2019s offense level was then increased by two because he allowed a juvenile to sell cocaine base from his apartment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). Mott then received a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b), a two-level decrease for his minor role in the offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and a two-level safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Thus, Mott\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 23, and, with a criminal history category of I, Mott\u2019s guideline range of imprisonment was 46 to 57 months. The Court ultimately sentenced Mott to 46 months. Mott appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">On appeal, challenges to a district court\u2019s factual findings in connection with sentencing hearings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Santos Batista, </em>239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2001). A district court must include in its drug weight calculations the drugs involved in any uncharged transaction that was \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan\u201d as the charged conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Moreover, in the case of \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d such as in the instant case, the defendant is responsible at sentencing for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(1)(B). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The district court employs the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in making its drug quantity and relevant conduct findings. <em>Santos Batista, </em>239 F.3d at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The undisputed facts establish that, as part of the conspiracy to sell cocaine base from Mott\u2019s apartment, Mott allowed Wilson and other dealers to use his apartment in return for free cocaine base. The parties also agree that, shortly before the search, Wilson made a sale of cocaine base from Mott\u2019s apartment, as charged in Count 7 of the indictment, to which Mott pled guilty. The district judge rejected, as a factual matter, the argument that the cocaine under Wilson\u2019s chair was not for sale, but was for Mott\u2019s personal use. Thus, the cocaine seized from beneath Wilson\u2019s chair in Mott\u2019s apartment was properly attributable to Mott, for purposes of sentencing, as part of the underlying distribution conspiracy, and the district court did not commit clear error in making this factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Mott next argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 upon making a factual determination that Mott involved a minor in the commission of his offense. Mott first contends that he was unaware of Wilson\u2019s age; second, he says that he did not \u201cuse or attempt to use a minor.\u201d Again, the district court\u2019s decision in that regard is reviewed for clear error. <em>Santos Batista, </em>239 F.3d at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The provision at issue states: \u201cIf the defendant used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or apprehension for, the offense, increase [the base offense level] by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. As to the first point, Mott\u2019s contention that he did not know Wilson was a minor is irrelevant. There is no scienter element in this guideline, and no Court has seen fit to read one in. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>262 F.3d 867, 2001 WL 946335, *2 (9th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. McClain, </em>252 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2001). As to the second point, the First Circuit has held that an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.4 may be based on the relevant conduct principle that defendants are responsible for the foreseeable acts of their co-conspirators. <em>United States v. Patrick, </em>248 F.3d 11, 26-28 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that a defendant head of a drug conspiracy who did not personally employ minors in the conspiracy was nonetheless responsible for the reasonably foreseeable employment of minors by his co-conspirators). It follows that under \u00a7 IB 1.3 of the sentencing guidelines, Mott is liable for his unindicted co-conspirators\u2019 foreseeable actions to use the minor Wilson for the drug sales which form the basis of the conspiracy. There was an adequate evidentiary basis for the trial judge to conclude that the use of Wilson was foreseeable to Mott. Mott was aware that Wilson was selling drugs from the apartment and agreed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Finally, Mott claims that the district court should have granted his motion for a downward departure on the basis that 1) he was addicted to cocaine base at the time of the offenses; 2) he was victimized by higher-level drug dealers; 3) his offense conduct constituted \u201caberrant behavior\u201d because he had previously been law-abiding; and 4) he suffered from extraordinary physical, mental, and emotional conditions due to his cocaine addiction. Mott contends that the district court therefore abused its discretion by denying his motion, and that the district court improperly believed that it lacked the authority to grant the downward departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">It is well settled that \u201c[a] district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward is unreviewable unless the court believed it lacked the authority to do so.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Patrick, </em>248 F.3d at 28. A defendant must show more than an arguable ambiguity in a district court\u2019s ruling denying a downward departure motion to establish that the court acted in the belief that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>187 F.3d 60, 69 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In the present case, Mott does not even point to any ambiguity in the district court\u2019s ruling. Nor could he. In the words of the district court at sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">I don\u2019t believe you qualify for a downward departure. You certainly have accepted responsibility, I have no way of knowing how sincere or genuine your acceptance is, but I take you at your word. You\u2019ve accepted responsibility, and you got credit for that. You had a relatively minor role in these offense [sic], and you got credit for that, too. You have had a good record up until now, but that doesn\u2019t entitle you to a downward departure. I don\u2019t think your case is sufficiently outside the heartland. It\u2019s not sufficiently different from other cases like that that would warrant a downward departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Sentencing Tran. 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The instant case is indistinguishable from <em>Patrick, </em>where the First Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure motion where \u201cthe district court, exercising its discretion, found it inappropriate to depart because Patrick had not identified any factors that took his case outside the \u2018heartland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patrick, </em>248 F.3d. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In sum, there is nothing in the district court\u2019s explanation for its denial of Mott\u2019s downward departure motion that suggests the district court thought or believed it lacked the authority to depart. Consequently, this Court is without authority to review the district court\u2019s denial of the downward departure motion, and Mott\u2019s appeal may not be sustained on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
