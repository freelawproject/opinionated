Tanner appeals the district court\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, asserting that the government failed to establish that: (1) his voice mail message contained a threat and (2) a sufficient nexus existed between the message and interstate commerce. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In January 2000, defendant Tanner and his son retained Toledo attorney Samuel Morrison to represent them in bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy court ultimately dismissed Tanner\u2019s ease. During the bankruptcy proceedings. Tanner became dissatisfied with Morrison\u2019s legal representation and, at a meeting in Morrison\u2019s office on December 7, 2000, expressed his anger with Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On December 26, 2000, Morrison, while visiting relatives in Alabama, checked his voice mail on his Sprint PCS cellular telephone. Morrison received the following voice mail message from Tanner:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Tanner: </em>Yeah, Sam, Merry Christmas. It\u2019s Roger. Just wanted to know when you\u2019re going to be back in town. Uh, I need to, uh, talk at you, um, and go forth with some things. Um, like when I talked to you when you left, ah, don\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve accomplished anything. (BEEP) Um, you know? I know you filed a lot of paperwork, you\u2019ve done this and so forth but, you know, if, ah, I was fixing a car and I gave a guy a bunch of paperwork, it don\u2019t mean I fixed it. You haven\u2019t got anything done. Um, question is, Sam, if you, ah, were just an average attorney you would at least get something in exchange, you haven\u2019t got anything out of these guys, nothing. Your deal about saying that, uh, they were going to sell the stuff, was total a lie. You know that, I know that. You had this whole goddamned thing arranged when we showed up that morning. So, um, obviously, Sam, you got some awful big explaining to do. Um, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re my friend anymore. Furthermore, a, you ... you sure come up with a whole fucking bunch of money to go to, to New Orleans, when you\u2019re always broke. You also said you\u2019re gonna apply what I sent you (BEEP) a thousand dollars from Texas. You said you\u2019re going to file four or five cases, ah, adversary. Another goddamned lie. You didn\u2019t do a fucking thing except take the money. (Unintelligible) Sam, I\u2019m going to call an ace an ace, an ass an ass. Uh, you probably won\u2019t be too pleased to see me, unless you got something you\u2019re going to make that something happen real fucking quick. Ah, goddamned fucking attorneys are all the same. I had another attorney did this to me one time. Should have killed the motherfucker. You better get something done, Sam. Patience is runnin out. You and the rest of these cocksuckers. You\u2019re all ... you know it\u2019s like Judge Speer said up there, he knew what the fuck was going on. You did too. Um, I almost died, Sam. You don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s stoppin ... now. Tell me when you\u2019re in town or else I\u2019ll find ya. I\u2019m not afraid to come down there either. (BEEP) Uh, threat? Take it for a.. .what you think. I\u2019m coming after ya, I want some fucking justice. I\u2019m gonna get it Sam, this time you\u2019re on the hook.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Tanner was later indicted and tried on two charges. Count 1 charged Tanner with threatening a United States judge in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count 2 alleged that Tanner transmitted a threatening communication in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u00a7 875(c). He was found not guilty on Count 1 but guilty on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Harrod, </em>168 F.3d 887, 889 (6th Cir.1999). In reviewing the denial of a motion for acquittal, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Communication Containing a Threat</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">On appeal, Tanner argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because his voice mad message was not a threat under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). Section 875(c) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[wjhoever transmits in interstate ... commerce any communication containing ... any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined ... or imprisoned .... \u201d The government must allege and prove the following three elements to support a conviction under \u00a7 875(c): \u201c(1) a transmission in interstate commerce; (2) a communication containing a threat; and (3) the threat must be a threat to injure the person of another.\u201d <em>United States v. DeAndino, </em>958 F.2d 146, 148 (6th Cir.1992). To constitute \u201ca communication containing a threat,\u201d the second element, \u201ca communication must be such that a reasonable person (1) would take the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm (the mens rea), and (2) would perceive such expression as being communicated to effect some change or achieve some goal through intimidation (the actus reus).\u201d <em>United States v. Alkhabaz, </em>104 F.3d 1492, 1495 (6th Cir.1997). \u201c[T]he alleged threatening statement must be viewed from the objective perspective of the recipient, which frequently involves the context of the parties\u2019 relationship.\u201d <em>United States v. Landham, </em>251 F.3d 1072, 1080 (6th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">According to Tanner, the indictment is devoid of anything that would lead any reasonable person to conclude that the statements constitute a threat as contemplated by \u00a7 875(c). In support of his argument, Tanner focuses exclusively on the statements contained in the superseding indictment rather than the voice mail message as a whole. Emphasis on the statements contained in the superseding indictment would be appropriate in a challenge to the denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment. Here, however, Tanner appeals the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. Accordingly, this court looks beyond the selected representative statements contained in the indictment and considers the entire voice mail message.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Tanner also asserts that when viewed in their context, his statements contained in the indictment relate to his dissatisfaction with Morrison\u2019s representation and convey his intent to take legal action. Tanner\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant: \u201ca threat, is not a state of mind in the threatener; it is an appearance to the victim.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>957 F.2d 264, 266 (6th Cir. 1992); <em>see also Alkhabaz, </em>104 F.3d at 1496 (holding that the mens rea and actus reus elements of a \u00a7 875(c) violation \u201cmust be determined objectively, from the prospective of the receiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Citing <em>Landham, </em>251 F.3d 1072, Tanner argues that he engaged in \u201cemotionally charged language that did not cross the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>line between protected speech and true threats.\u201d However, the allegedly threatening statement in <em>Landham </em>referred to past, not present or future conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1082. In addition, the alleged threat of harm was from a ballpoint pen, referring to damaging remarks made in writing. <em>Id. </em>Tanner\u2019s statements referred to future harm, and nothing in the voice mail message indicated that this harm would arise from a non-violent source.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In the voice mail message, Tanner stated, \u201cI had another attorney did this to me one time. Should have killed the motherfucker.\u201d This statement was followed by \u201cTell me when you\u2019re in town or else I\u2019ll find ya. I\u2019m not afraid to come down there either,\u201d referring to Alabama, where Morrison was visiting relatives. Tanner ended the message: \u201cUh threat? Take it for a ... what you think. I\u2019m coming after ya, I want some fuckin justice. I\u2019m gonna get it Sam, this time you\u2019re on the hook.\u201d Morrison testified regarding his difficult relationship with Tanner and about Tanner\u2019s anger and dissatisfaction with Morrison\u2019s representation. Viewing these statements and their context in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Tanner\u2019s voice mail message constituted a communication containing a threat under \u00a7 875(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Nexus with Interstate Commerce</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Contending that his activity was predominantly local, Tanner asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the government failed to establish a sufficient nexus between his voice mail message and interstate commerce. At trial, FBI Agent Robert McCorkle testified that records of the Arcadia Telephone Company revealed that Tanner made the call to Morrison from his son\u2019s home in Arcadia, Ohio. Morrison testified that he received Tanner\u2019s voice mail message in Alabama. Indicating that he knew that Morrison was in Alabama, Tanner\u2019s message states, \u201cjust wanted to know when you\u2019re going to be back in town.... I\u2019m not afraid to come down there either.\u201d Moreover, Elizabeth Evans, an analyst with Sprint PCS, testified that Tanner\u2019s call to Morrison\u2019s cellular telephone was routed through a call set-up facility in either Texas or Illinois and that his voice mail message was then sent to a facility in Michigan. In light of the evidence of the message\u2019s transmission through several states and receipt in Alabama, a rational juror could have found the interstate commerce element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-10\">.
