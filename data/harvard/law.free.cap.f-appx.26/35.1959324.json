Donaldson was sentenced principally to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cto run concurrently with and adjusted for the state sentence he is currently serving\u201d for the violation of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">This case stems from Donaldson\u2019s illegal re-entry into the United States and subsequent arrest in 1998 for New York state drug and weapons charges. Found to have violated his parole for a prior state conviction by illegally re-entering the country, Donaldson was remanded to state custody. Shortly thereafter, the instant federal proceeding was commenced, resulting in Donaldson\u2019s conviction and sentence for illegal re-entry. When the Bureau of Prisons did not adjust, or \u201ccredit,\u201d Donaldson\u2019s federal sentence for the time he had served in state custody prior to the imposition of the sentence in this case, Donaldson brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">On appeal, Donaldson claims (1) that the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s failure to award him credit violated his constitutional rights by breaching an agreement, \u201calbeit moral and informal,\u201d between Donaldson and the district court whereby Donaldson would admit his guilt and save the government the expense of prosecuting him in exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>for leniency; and (2) that the district court was authorized to grant such a credit as a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We agree with the government that the Sentencing Guidelines do not authorize the district court to credit Donaldson\u2019s sentence for time already served. The district court imposed a concurrent sentence and a credit under the mistaken belief that subsection (b) of \u00a7 5G1.3 and Application Note 2 to subsection (b) were applicable. Subsection (b) applies when \u201cthe undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), and it requires a concurrent sentence to prevent double punishment, <em>United States v. Fermin, </em>252 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir.2001). Application Note 2 to subsection (b) urges that \u201cthe court should adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the guideline range\u201d when the district court determines that such a credit will not be awarded by the Bureau of Prisons. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), cmt. n. 2. The district court applied these provisions because it thought that Donaldson\u2019s illegal re-entry was the basis for both his federal sentence and, insofar as it was the ground for his parole violation, his state sentence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In fact, subsection (b) and Application Note 2 were not applicable to this case because \u201cwhen a criminal defendant is imprisoned as a result of his violation of the terms of his parole, the \u2018offense\u2019 that \u2018results\u2019 in his imprisonment is, for the purposes of \u00a7 5G1.3(b), the underlying prior offense of conviction, not the conduct violative of his parole conditions.\u201d <em>Fermin, 252 </em>F.3d at 108 (quoting <em>United States v. Garcia-Hernandez, </em>237 F.3d 105, 110 (2d Cir. 2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus Donaldson was in state custody for his prior 1992 New York state drug conviction and not, as the district court thought, his illegal re-entry. Moreover, Donaldson has not indicated any way in which his prior state conviction was fully taken into account in the calculation of his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In such cases, we have found that subsection (c) is applicable and that it \u201cdoes not permit courts to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the guidelines range for time already served on a different sentence, and does not import the \u2018credit\u2019 approach of Application Note 2 to subsection (b).\u201d <em>Fermin, </em>252 F.3d at 110 (footnote omitted). Section 5G1.3 therefore did not authorize the district court to credit Donaldson\u2019s sentence through an adjusted concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Though a downward departure to account for time already served is warranted in some circumstances under \u00a7 5K2.0, <em>id., </em>this is not a case where \u201cthe court finds \u2018that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)). As is evident from <em>Ferm\u00edn, </em>the Sentencing Commission has considered in \u00a7 5G1.3 whether sentences should run concurrently and be adjusted with credit in cases like this one. Nor has Donaldson indicated that any other aspects of his case are \u201cunusual enough ... to fall outside the heartland of cases in the Guideline.\u201d <em>Ferm\u00edn, 252 </em>F.3d at 111 n. 16 (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Because the district court was without authority to credit Donaldson\u2019s sentence, the judgment of the district court is MODIFIED in part to strike the language \u201cand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>adjusted for\u201d and as MODIFIED is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
