Challenging his convictions, Ng argues (1) that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to consolidate counts as multiplicitous, and (2) that the facts establish entrapment as a matter of law. With respect to sentencing, defendant claims he should have been awarded a two-level reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility and a downward departure on the grounds of imperfect entrapment. Finally, defendant claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of the failure to move for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. After review of the record and the arguments presented on appeal, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">The charges arose out of numerous conversations and two face-to-face meetings between Ng and Donald DeClercq, during which Ng allegedly arranged to pay De-Clercq to murder Dr. So Tang. Ng was arrested on June 23, 1999, after giving DeClercq a down payment of $4,000 in cash, four pictures of Dr. Tang, and a note with Dr. Tang\u2019s name and address. Ng claimed he was entrapped by DeClercq, who was cooperating with the FBI. Ng was convicted by a jury on three counts of violating the federal murder-for-hire statute. The indictment alleged: (1) that Ng traveled from California to Michigan on or about December 12, 1998, with intent that the murder of Dr. Tang be committed for $100,000; (2) that Ng caused DeClercq to travel from Michigan to California on June 22, 1999, with intent that the murder of Dr. Tang be committed for $30,000; and (3) that from October 27, 1998, through June 23, 1999, Ng used a facility in interstate commerce (the telephone) with intent that the murder of Dr. Tang be committed as consideration for something of pecuniary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Keith Ng became acquainted with Dr. Tang, an anesthesiologist, and his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Hsin-Ming Tang, while working as a general contractor in the construction of their house and a medical office building in San Marino, California. In 1988, Ng and the Tangs invested in a vineyard located in Santa Maria, California. The Tangs held the deed, but orally guaranteed Ng a twenty-percent share. Ng moved to Santa Maria to run the vineyard. Dr. Tang discovered that his wife was having an affair with Ng. In 1996, the vineyard, along with other property, was conveyed to the Tangs\u2019 two children. At that time, Ng was promised that his interest would be honored. Mrs. Tang, who was separated from her husband, filed for divorce. In 1997, Dr. Tang filed a lawsuit seeking to set aside the property transfers as fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Ng and Hsin Tang traveled to Michigan more than once to help her son, George Tang, who had started his medical residency training in the Detroit area. During a visit in July 1998, George\u2019s neighbor, Larry Campbell, took Ng to several antique and pawn shops to look for watches and introduced him to DeClercq. After discussing their mutual interest in watch collecting, DeClercq arranged for Ng to come to his home located in Bloomfield, Michigan, from which he operated a business called DeClercq\u2019s Watches. Within a few days, Ng had visited DeClercq twice and purchased two expensive watches. Ng paid DeClercq $8,000 in cash and gave him a $4,000 check written to \u201ccash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">During one visit, DeClercq and Ng spent an hour or two talking. According to DeClercq, Ng said he ran a vineyard and was \u201chaving a problem\u201d with someone who had lent him $250,000 to open the vineyard. Ng said this person was demanding $5 million to release a lien that was clouding title to the property and making it difficult to borrow money to keep the business going. Ng told De-Clercq, \u201cI would pay $100,000 just to make sure this person went to Mexico and never returned.\u201d Ng seemed serious and, when questioned further, Ng offered to pay $100,000; $50,000 down and $50,000 when the problem went away. DeClercq asked if he wanted this man murdered, and Ng answered that he wanted this problem to \u201cgo away.\u201d DeClercq was suspicious, but told Ng he would look into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Ng offered a different version of this meeting. Ng testified that he went to DeClercq\u2019s house to pay for the watches, and DeClercq showed him around. De-Clercq also showed him a stack of pictures of naked women and asked him to pick one, but Ng was not interested. When Ng told DeClercq he owned a vineyard, De-Clercq said he had friends in South America with money to invest in legitimate businesses. Ng said he was not interested in a partner because he had his own problems with a lawsuit pending, liens on the property, and loans to pay. That, Ng claimed, was when DeClercq offered to \u201cfix [his] problem\u201d and make it disappear like Jimmy Hoffa. Ng didn\u2019t know who Jimmy Hoffa was, so DeClercq told him to rent a movie called \u201cThe Jackal\u201d or one called \u201cThe Mechanic.\u201d Although shocked by this discussion, Ng testified that he remained calm and stayed for a few drinks. Ng came back a few days later to have his Rolex fixed and to see a watch DeClercq wanted to sell for $80,000. Ng did not buy the watch and returned to California shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">DeClercq, who was under criminal investigation by the IRS, went to see his attorney. Concerned that the solicitation could be \u201ca set up,\u201d they also recognized that it might be an opportunity to improve his situation with the IRS. Inquiries made through the United States Attorney\u2019s Office led to an interview with FBI Agent Joseph Callahan on October 27, 1998. De-Clercq thought it was possible that Camp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>bell might have told Ng that DeClercq was connected to the mafia. Callahan decided to monitor a call from DeClercq\u2019s home to Ng\u2019s cellular telephone in California the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">At the outset of the conversation on October 27, DeClercq asked Ng: \u2018You still have that problem?\u201d Ng replied: \u2018Yep ... I don\u2019t know which way to turn.\u201d After discussing Ng\u2019s travel plans. De-Clercq told him he should be in Texas when \u201cthings happen\u201d and explained that \u201c[i]n other words, you know, ... the best time for the house to burn down is when you\u2019re on vacation.\u201d Ng said \u201c[yjeah.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d \u201cI, be, I be in Paris.\u201d When De-Clercq asked for the person\u2019s name, Ng responded: \u201cNo I don\u2019t wanna talk on the phone ... [sjomebody may listen to the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On November 5, 1998, at Callahan\u2019s direction, DeClercq asked Ng to put together a package including photographs, a description of the car, and background information about the intended victim to bring to a face-to-face meeting in Michigan. Ng responded: \u201c[Njo problem I have all that, I have all that in my folders ... I been follow this tail for long time.\u201d They agreed to talk in a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">When DeClercq called Ng on November 16, Ng told him he had purchased a telephone card so that his calls to DeClercq could not be discovered. Ng invited De-Clercq to fly to California to \u201cget a, visual inspection you know?\u201d DeClercq said he would think about it, and they then discussed a watch Ng was interested in buying.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Ng called DeClercq back the next day and asked him to come to California and said, \u201cI mean the, the, the merchandise is here, if you want to look at it.\u201d They talked about their schedules and DeClercq asked, \u201cwhen do you want this watch stopped?\u201d Ng answered: \u201cAnytime. Sooner the better.\u201d At Callahan\u2019s direction, DeClercq attempted to arrange for their meeting to take place in Detroit. DeClercq asked for the name of the lender for the vineyard. Ng responded that he\u2019d gotten an extension for a couple of months, but that \u201cthis is on the way, so you clean the title for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">On December 11, 1998, Ng flew from California to Michigan to meet DeClercq in person. At Callahan\u2019s direction, De-Clercq arranged to meet Ng in a hotel room in Troy, Michigan, at noon on December 14, 1998. The meeting was recorded and videotaped. After they discussed watches for a while, DeClercq brought up the \u201cother thing.\u201d Ng looked around and asked about \u201ccameras.\u201d Ng told DeClercq to talk in simple terms \u201cin case somebody had a tape on it.\u201d De-Clercq asked Ng if he was sure he wanted to do this. Ng immediately answered \u201cyes\u201d and said he had \u201cno choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">During their meeting, Ng agreed to pay $100,000, with a $25,000 down payment. Although DeClercq asked Ng how he wanted it to happen, Ng made it clear he did not want to know. When DeClercq asked for the package of information, Ng assured him that he had everything ready and would give it to him with the down payment. They agreed to do it after the holidays, when Ng had the money ready. Ng also talked about the need to pay for Buddhist monks to pray to be sure the spirit would be at peace so it would not bother them.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">During several calls in January 1999, Ng told DeClercq he was ready to \u201cget it done and over with.\u201d On January 13, Ng told DeClercq that \u201cthe main thing is I\u2019m ready, and the money\u2019s ready, everything is ready.\u201d Ng wanted it done by the end of January, and DeClercq agreed to go to Los Angeles within the next ten days. Ng <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>planned to meet DeClercq, show him where the victim lived, and then leave town. The FBI decided to delay the meeting to try to determine the identity of the intended victim. As a result, DeClercq called Ng on January 19, and put off his trip to Los Angeles. Ng said he\u2019d like to \u201cget it done\u201d by the end of February.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Ng called DeClercq during the first week of February and said he had someone else who could possibly take care of it for a much lower price, but didn\u2019t trust him. DeClercq called Ng on February 17, 1999, and they arranged that Ng would call DeClercq on March 22 and they would do it that week. Around this time, De-Clercq sent Ng a watch he thought he might buy. The watch was returned to DeClercq. When Ng did not call as expected, DeClercq called and left four messages for Ng between March 29 and April 7, 1999. At that point, Callahan felt the case was slipping away and told DeClercq not to call Ng.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In June 1999, DeClercq was in Las Vegas to attend a huge watch show. De-Clercq, who was calling his previous customers, made an unmonitored call to Ng on June 14. DeClercq asked Ng about his problem, and Ng told him that he had hired someone else for $50,000 but that the guy just took his money and left town. As a result, Ng said he could no longer afford to pay $100,000. They renegotiated the price and Ng agreed to pay $30,000, with $5,000 down. Callahan had DeClercq make a monitored call to Ng on June 16 to rehash their last conversation. Ng said he had paid someone else, who did not do the job. Ng wanted DeClerq to take care of the problem for $30,000, paying $5,000 down and the rest \u201con completion of the job.\u201d They agreed that DeClercq would come to Los Angeles the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On June 22, 1999, DeClercq, accompanied by Callahan, flew from Detroit, Michigan, to Los Angeles, California. Once in Los Angeles, DeClercq called Ng and arranged to meet him outside a Denny\u2019s restaurant the next morning. DeClercq wore a recording device and the meeting was videotaped. When DeClercq got into Ng\u2019s Cadillac, Ng patted him down. Ng gave DeClercq the address of Dr. Tang\u2019s office and explained that Tang lived in one of the back rooms. Even then, Ng would not say Dr. Tang\u2019s name until DeClercq insisted so he could be sime he \u201cgot the right guy.\u201d DeClercq was unable to get Ng to identify the person he said he had hired, despite offering to get his money back for him. Ng gave DeClercq $4,000 in cash, and they agreed DeClercq would get $26,000 when he had pictures of the murdered Dr. Tang. DeClercq asked Ng how he wanted it done. Ng volunteered that Dr. Tang had a heart condition and said \u201c[y]ou can turn on the gas and blow the whole f-ing house ... I don\u2019t care ... you can choke him ... no air\u2019s the best.\u201d After DeClercq left the ear, FBI agents arrested Ng.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to consolidate the charges as multiplicitous, which was denied. At the conclusion of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of all three counts. Defendant was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on count one, to be followed by concurrent one-month terms of imprisonment on counts two and three. Defendant was also sentenced to three years of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">A. Entrapment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Defendant argues that his convictions should be reversed because the facts establish entrapment as a matter of law. There are two- related elements to a valid entrapment defense; government in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ducement of the crime and a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant. <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 888, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988). <em>See also Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 540, 548, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992). Predisposition \u201cfocuses upon whether the defendant was an \u2018unwary innocent\u2019 or, instead, an \u2018unwary criminal\u2019 who readily availed himself of the opportunity to perpetrate the crime.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>485 U.S. at 63 (citations omitted). \u201cIt is only when the Government\u2019s deception actually implants the criminal design in the mind of the defendant that the defense of entrapment comes into play.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 436, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Entrapment is generally an issue for the jury, not the court. <em>United States v. Barger, </em>931 F.2d 359, 366 (6th Cir.1991). In order to succeed on a claim of entrapment as a matter of law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWQ\">the testimony and facts must be undisputed; a court may not choose between conflicting testimony or make credibility determinations. Furthermore, the undisputed evidence must demonstrate a \u201cpatently clear\u201d absence of predisposition. If either of these elements is missing, then the predisposition question is for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>United States v. Pennell, </em>737 F.2d 521, 534 (6th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). Once entrapment is placed in issue, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>855 F.2d 299, 303 (6th Cir. 1988). In determining whether the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish predisposition, we must view the evidence and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Barger, </em>931 F.2d at 366 (quoting <em>United States v. McLernon, </em>746 F.2d 1098, 1111 (6th Cir.1984)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\u201cPredisposition\u201d means the defendant\u2019s state of mind before coming into contact with government agents. <em>See McLemon, </em>746 F.2d at 1112. Several factors are relevant to this determination: the defendant\u2019s character and reputation, including any criminal record; whether the suggestion of criminal activity was initially made by the government or the defendant; whether the defendant was engaged in the criminal activity for profit; whether the defendant was reluctant to commit the offense and overcome only by repeated government inducement or persuasion; and the nature of the government\u2019s inducement or persuasion. <em>Id. See also Barger, </em>931 F.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Applying these factors, Ng argues that it is clear he was not predisposed to commit the offenses. There was no evidence that Ng had a criminal record. Several witnesses who testified about his character described Ng as honest, kind, gentle, easy going, and not quick to anger. Even George Tang testified that it was out of character for Ng to try to arrange a contract killing. However, defendant concedes, as he must, that the evidence was disputed concerning whether he or De-Clercq was the first to suggest killing Dr. Tang. But, there is no dispute that Ng stood to benefit from Dr. Tang\u2019s death as it would clear title to the vineyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Ng relies heavily on the factor that we have described as being the most impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>tant in determining the lack of predisposition as a matter of law-whether the defendant demonstrated reluctance to engage in the criminal activity that was overcome by repeated government inducement or persuasion. McLe<em>rnon, </em>746 F.2d at 1113. Claiming that DeClercq pursued him relentlessly until he finally succumbed to the pressure, Ng emphasizes that it took eleven months for Ng finally to give DeClercq the intended victim\u2019s name and a down payment for the murder. Ng states that there were apparently no conversations between July and October 1998. The telephone records, however, indicate that not only were there calls between them, but also that two of the calls were initiated by Ng.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">At no time was Ng heard to express doubts about going ahead with the murder. In fact, the only reluctance Ng actually expressed was reluctance to talk about their plans over the telephone in anything but oblique terms. Concerned that someone might be listening or watching, Ng nonetheless repeatedly assured DeClercq that he \u201cwas ready.\u201d In November 1998, Ng invited DeClercq to come to California for \u201ca visual inspection\u201d of the \u201cmerchandise\u201d and indicated that the sooner the \u201cwatch was stopped\u201d the better. During the December meeting, Ng agreed on a price and decided to have DeClercq do it after the holidays. Nor did their conversations in January suggest either reluctance or government inducements to go forward. Although DeClercq made an unmonitored call to Ng on December 29, no evidence was offered concerning the content of that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Finally, Ng claims that a lack of predisposition can be inferred from his failure to call DeClercq in March or return the four messages DeClercq left for him. Ng testified that he did not contact DeClercq because he did not want to go forward with the murder. Ng denied having actually hired someone else during that time, and claimed to have made up the story to put DeClercq off. Ng emphasizes that De-Clercq found himself in more trouble and had a greater interest in seeing the plan go forward after he was arrested on March 20, 1999, for theft and charged with being a habitual offender. Although DeClercq was certainly trying to help himself by cooperating with the FBI, he did not try to contact Ng between the first week of April and mid-June. When taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could conclude that Ng did not contact DeClercq for several months because he had arranged for someone else to do the job for less, did not have the money to pay DeClercq, or wanted to get DeClercq to do it for less.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Maybe Ng would not have brought De-Clercq to Los Angeles if DeClercq had not called him on June 14. Yet, Ng did not claim that DeClercq had offered inducements, exerted pressure, or made threats that caused Ng to go forward with the murder in June 1999. The evidence concerning predisposition was clearly disputed and the jury\u2019s conclusion rested in large part on the jury\u2019s credibility determinations. Therefore, we cannot find entrapment as a matter of law and the issue was properly submitted to the jury. Further, we find that when the evidence and inferences are taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could find defendant was predisposed to commit the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">B. Multiplicitous Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion to consolidate the three counts as multiplicitous. Defendant maintains that the indictment was multiplicitous because it actually charged a single offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>in several counts. Multiple charges put the defendant in jeopardy of multiple sentences for a single offense and may suggest to the jury that he committed not one but several offenses. <em>See Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 867-68, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>850 F.2d 1104, 1108 n. 4 (6th Cir.1988). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to require the prosecution to elect between multiplicitous counts. <em>United States v. Throneburg, </em>921 F.2d 654, 657 (6th Cir. 1990). The remedy for multiplicitous prosecutions and convictions is for the sentencing court to vacate or merge any multiplicitous counts. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ball, </em>470 U.S. at 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Defendant was charged with three violations of the federal murder-for-hire statute, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">Whoever travels in or causes another ... to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or uses or causes another ... to use ... any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent that a murder be committed ... as consideration for the receipt of, or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value, or who conspires to do so, shall be fined ... or imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958. Applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the district court concluded that the charges did not violate double jeopardy because they each involved proof of facts not required by the others: namely, defendant\u2019s own interstate travel, defendant\u2019s having caused DeClercq to travel interstate, and defendant\u2019s use of an interstate communication facility in the murder-for-hire scheme. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>See also Murr v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 895 (6th Cir.2000) (same elements test).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The district court also rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the government had impermissibly divided a single offense into several counts, finding that this case could not be distinguished from <em>United States v. Snelenberger, </em>24 F.3d 799, 803 (6th Cir. 1994). In <em>Snelenberger, </em>the defendant was charged separately with threats he made against a magistrate judge to two different people at two different places in the course of being involuntarily hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Defendant argues that the statute is intended to punish, as a unit of prosecution, the hiring of someone to kill another person. Since it was charged in each count that he intended for DeClercq to murder Dr. Tang, defendant argues there was only one offense. The proscribed conduct, however, is traveling or causing another to travel in interstate commerce, or using or causing another to use facilities of interstate commerce, with intent that a murder-for-hire be committed. <em>See United States v. Ransbottom, </em>914 F.2d 743, 746 (6th Cir. 1990). Relying on two Sixth Circuit decisions, defendant argues that the element of interstate travel or use of facilities of interstate commerce are nothing more than \u201cjurisdictional requirements.\u201d <em>See United States v. Weathers, </em>169 F.3d 336 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Winters, </em>33 F.3d 720 (6th Cir.1994). Defendant\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In <em>Weathers, </em>the court was faced with the question of whether the intrastate use of a facility of interstate commerce would satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of \u00a7 1958. Concluding that the facility must have been used in interstate commerce, the court described the \u201csubstantive prohibition\u201d of the offense as the use of a \u201cfacility in interstate commerce\u201d with intent that a murder-for-hire be committed. The court was not asked to decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>more than one offense could be committed as part of a scheme to commit a murder-for-hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Examination of the decision in <em>Winters </em>makes clear that defendant misapprehends the significance of the jurisdictional element. In that case, the defendants were charged with using or causing another to use the mails with intent to commit murder-for-hire in violation of \u00a7 1958. The defendants argued that the government must prove that they intended that the mails be used, not just that they intended that a murder-for-hire be committed. In rejecting this claim, the court held that \u201cthere is no intent requirement with respect to the use of the mails and that this element of the crime is jurisdictional in nature.\u201d 33 F.3d at 721. The court then took care to note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">[t]he significance of labeling a statutory requirement as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is not that the requirement is viewed as outside the scope of the evil Congress intended to forestall, but merely that the existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Id. </em>at n. 1 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 676-77 n. 9, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975)). The plain language of the statute makes clear that the evil it intended to proscribe was the interstate travel and use of facilities in interstate commerce with intent that a murder-for-hire be committed. The defendant\u2019s own travel from California to Michigan in December 1998 was a separate offense from his causing DeClercq to travel from Michigan to California in June 1999, even though they were committed as part of an ongoing scheme to commit murder-for-hire. Further, the defendant\u2019s use of a facility in interstate commerce between October 1998 and June 1999 was properly charged as a separate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Defendant argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a two-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) \u00a7 3El.l(a). We review the district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Mahan, </em>190 F.3d 416, 418 (6th Cir.1999). Generally, the reduction for acceptance of responsibility is not intended to apply to a defendant who denies the factual elements of guilt at trial and only admits guilt and expresses remorse after he is convicted. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>167 F.3d 1055, 1071 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The district court recognized that defendant\u2019s assertion of an entrapment defense at trial did not necessarily preclude a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a). <em>United States v. Fleener, </em>900 F.2d 914, 918 (6th Cir.1990). At the same time, <em>\u201cFleener </em>does not stand for the proposition that all defendants who go to trial and assert entrapment are entitled to receive the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Rather, <em>Fleener </em>holds that such a reduction is not <em>per se </em>unavailable[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>31 F.3d 354, 361 (6th Cir.1994). Defendant relied on the statements he made at the time of his arrest: \u201cI understand. I made a mistake. I\u2019m going to cooperate.\u201d After exercising his right to counsel, however, Ng chose not to make a statement. In <em>Fleener, </em>the reduction was specifically tied to the defendant\u2019s voluntary cooperation in providing evidence to the government. Here, the district court heard the testimony, noted that the jury disbelieved Ng, and concluded that the reduction was not warranted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>this case. We find no clear error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Defendant also sought a downward departure from the guideline range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment on the grounds of \u201cimperfect entrapment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Coleman, </em>188 F.3d 354, 358-59 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (6th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(improper government action is permissible basis for downward departure). The refusal to depart downward is not reviewable on appeal unless the district court did not recognize that it had the discretion to do so. <em>United States v. Prince, </em>214 F.3d 740, 766 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 974, 121 S.Ct. 417, 148 L.Ed.2d 322 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">It is clear from our review of the arguments and the district court\u2019s ruling on the issue that the district court considered the actions of the government agent as a possible basis for downward departure, but found such a departure was not warranted on the facts. The district court noted that the inducements were nothing more than telephone calls, found that it was not improper for DeClercq to have initiated contact with Ng, and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">So the real reason that I think it inappropriate to depart is, as I have said, this is not conduct outside the heartland and to the extent that I do agree with [defense counsel] there was an element [or] aspect of ambivalence or reluctance on Mr. Ng\u2019s part at different points of this series of events, I do think that can be accounted for within the established guideline range and no departure would be necessary for that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Since there is no indication that the district court believed that it lacked discretion to depart downward, we have no jurisdiction to review this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Defendant claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to move for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, on the grounds of newly discovered evidence of wrongdoing by DeClercq. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is ordinarily not reviewed on direct appeal because of the lack of an adequate factual record. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>90 F.3d 1135, 1143 (6th Cir.1996). Instead, these claims are more properly brought in a post-conviction proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. See also United States v. Aguwa, </em>123 F.3d 418, 423 (6th Cir.1997). Only if the record is sufficiently developed to allow the court to evaluate counsel\u2019s performance, will this court consider an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>48 F.3d 198, 199 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Defendant relies on newly discovered evidence that DeClercq was alleged to have attempted to bribe a police officer. DeClercq was facing charges of retail fraud, which was known at the time of trial and used to impeach DeClercq\u2019s credibility. DeClercq allegedly approached an officer on March 13, 2000, shortly before testifying in defendant\u2019s trial, and asked the officer to make the stolen property disappear from the police station. Because the facts concerning the alleged bribery charge have not been developed in the record, we decline to review defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">. The government argues that because defendant did not move for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 at the close of the evidence, we may only review the sufficiency of the evidence for plain error resulting in \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Price, </em>134 F.3d 340, 350 (6th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Cox, </em>957 F.2d 264, 265 (6th Cir. 1992). Since there was no error, there also was no plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-14\">. We do note, however, that a motion for new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>dence will not be granted unless all four of the following requirements are met: (1) the new evidence was discovered after trial; (2) the evidence could not have been discovered earlier with due diligence; (3) the evidence is material and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the evidence would likely produce an acquittal. <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>693 F.2d 954, 966 (6th Cir.1982). The government argues that this evidence was not material, but was merely cumulative impeachment evidence that would not likely produce an acquittal. Although not entirely clear, it seems that DeClercq was being investigated for attempted bribery at the time of defendant\u2019s trial, but had not yet been charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
