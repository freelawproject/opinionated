We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-26\">This case is governed by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) because Lemus-Herrera was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>placed in exclusion proceedings before April 1, 1997, and his final exclusion order was filed after October 30, 1996. <em>See Hose v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 992, 995 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). Under the transitional rules, we lack jurisdiction over appeals by aliens who are \u201cinadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 212(a)(2) or section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ....\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G). In this case, Le-mus-Herrera concedes that he is excludable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(i)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Magana-Pizano v. INS, </em>200 F.3d 603, 607 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) repealed this court\u2019s jurisdiction over petitions for review filed by aliens who are deportable for having committed enumerated criminal offenses, but did not repeal 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Petition DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
