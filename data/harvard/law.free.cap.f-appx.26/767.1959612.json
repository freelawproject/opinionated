New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo, <em>Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir.1988), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">In general, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides the exclusive mechanism by which a federal prisoner may contest the legality of a sentence. <em>Hernandez v. Campbell, </em>204 F.3d 861, 864 (9th Cir.2000). However, \u201ca federal prisoner may file a habeas corpus petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 to contest the legality of a sentence where his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864-65 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). The burden is on the petitioner to show that the remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Redfield v. United States, </em>315 F.2d 76, 83 (9th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">Gholston appears to argue that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be prohibited as successive, therefore, it is inadequate or ineffective. However, this court has made clear that \u201c \u00a7 2241 is not available under the inadequate-or-ineffective-remedy escape hatch of \u00a7 2255 merely because the court of appeals refuses to certify a second or successive motion under the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2555.\u201d <em>Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 953 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Gholston also argues that a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective because he is \u201cbarred from receiving relief ... due to the decisions issued by\u201d the court of appeals of the sentencing district. However, a \u201cremedy is not inadequate or ineffective under section 2255 merely because the sentencing court denied relief on the merits.\u201d <em>Tripati, </em>843 F.2d at 1162 (citations omitted). Likewise, a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the petitioner feels the sentencing court is likely to deny relief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Gholston has not carried his burden of showing that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective, therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing his petition for habeas corpus without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b797-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
