The information obtained by Officer Howard provided sufficient probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 228-30, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). This information adequately demonstrated citizen-informant Black\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge.\u201d Black stated that he personally saw Hogshire make and consume opium tea and other drugs, and observed drug-manufacturing equipment in Hog-shire\u2019s apartment. Howard also had sufficient information to establish Black\u2019s veracity and reliability. Black provided his name, address and occupation, as well as additional information about his connection to Hogshire and what he saw in Hogshire\u2019s apartment. Howard corroborated Black\u2019s information through independent investigation and consulted with narcotics specialists at the Seattle Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration, who advised that the chemicals and equipment mentioned in Black\u2019s letter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>in Hogshire\u2019s police report could be used to manufacture controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">2. We reject Hogshire\u2019s contention that Howard is not entitled to the defense of qualified immunity because he included an allegedly false statement in his affidavit. Hogshire fails to show that Howard was guilty of a \u201cdeliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for truth.\u201d <em>Hervey v. Estes, </em>65 F.3d 784, 788 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although Black provided the wrong street number for Hogshire\u2019s building, and Howard corrected it in his affidavit without indicating that the correction was his, Howard acted on the basis of a description of the building provided by Black and confirmed the address with Hogshire\u2019s building manager and with Hogshire\u2019s police incident report. Hog-shire also fails to show that, but for the change, \u201cthe magistrate would not have issued the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. The other evidence collected by Howard was sufficient to support issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">3. We also GRANT appellees\u2019 motion to strike portions of Hogshire\u2019s opening brief and excerpts of record and DENY Hogshire\u2019s motion to file exhibits. Although we will not impose sanctions on appellant\u2019s counsel this time, we regard submission of appendices and exhibits not offered in the district court to be improper and, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, not permitted by Fed. R.App. 10(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b734-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
