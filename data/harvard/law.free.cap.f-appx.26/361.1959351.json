Moore seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying his motions filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001), and Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We dismiss the appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction because the appeal was untimely filed. The district court entered its order denying \u00a7 2255 relief on June 25, 2001. Moore did not file his notice of appeal within the sixty-day appeal period provided by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), nor did the district court extend the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">In his motion, Moore sought reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Unites States v. Moore, </em>Nos. CR-97-362-A; CA-00-1776AM (E.D.Va. July 23, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
