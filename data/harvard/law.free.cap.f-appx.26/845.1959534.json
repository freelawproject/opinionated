We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b876-20\">In October and November of 2000, Siany committed three unarmed bank robberies in Oklahoma and Texas. For each robbery he would drive to a branch bank located inside a grocery store, approach the teller with a jacket draped over his arm, inform the teller that he was carrying a nine-millimeter pistol, and demand that the teller place money in a plastic bag he provided. Siany would effect his escape in a green sport utility vehicle that he had stolen from an auto dealership in Oklahoma. He was eventually arrested in Texas while casing another bank located in a grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-21\">A four-count information was filed against Siany in district court. Three of the charges were for bank robbery in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>lation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and the fourth was for the interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. Siany pled guilty to each of the counts, and the district court sentenced him to 110 months imprisonment. To arrive at this sentence, the court determined that the Guidelines computation resulting in a criminal history category of III for Siany did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and that an upward departure to a criminal history category of VI was more appropriate. Specifically, the court decided that a number of prior convictions- \u2014 for issuing bad checks, possessing forged instruments, grand larceny, embezzlement, obtaining money by false pretense, and driving under the influence \u2014 that were not considered in the criminal history computation, as well as the fact that Siany had felony charges pending in state court at the time he committed the instant offenses, merited the upward departure. Had the district court not upwardly departed, Siany\u2019s sentencing range would have been only seventy to eighty-seven months. Siany repeatedly objected to this exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion, and under the terms of his plea agreement he reserved the right to appeal such a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Under the Guidelines, calculation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history category ordinarily does not take into account \u201cstale\u201d prior sentences. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) (excluding from criminal history calculation sentences exceeding thirteen months if not imposed within fifteen years of the commencement of the instant offense); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) (excluding from calculation any other prior sentences if not imposed within ten years of the instant offense). However, the Guidelines allow a sentencing court to depart from an otherwise applicable Guideline range \u201cif the court finds \u2018that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The Guidelines specifically contemplate an upward departure if the sentencing court determines \u201cthat the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.3. Information relevant to such a determination includes the fact of \u201cprior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category,\u201d and \u201cwhether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 8 (\u201cIf the court finds that a sentence imposed outside [the applicable time period] is evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under \u00a7 4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">To determine whether the district court abused its discretion in departing from the Guidelines, we must evaluate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">(1) whether the factual circumstances supporting a departure are permissible departure factors; (2) whether the departure factors relied upon by the district court remove the defendant from the applicable Guideline heartland thus warranting a departure, (3) whether the record sufficiently supports the factual basis underlying the departure, and (4) whether the degree of departure is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-11\"><em>United States v. Collins, </em>122 F.3d 1297, 1303 (10th Cir.1997). Although we need not defer to the district court\u2019s resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>of the first question because it is primarily a legal issue, all four steps of this departure review analysis are subject to a \u201cunitary abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We proceed to address each step.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Whether a factual circumstance supporting a departure is a permissible departure factor is a legal question that we review de novo. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>Collins, </em>122 F.3d at 1303. We have already held that \u201c[bjecause \u00a7 4A1.3 provides an encouraged basis for departure,\u201d a sentencing court\u2019s reliance on that section\u2019s enumerated departure factors is permissible. <em>United States v. Bartsma, </em>198 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that a set of stale prior sentences is a permissible departure factor); <em>see also United States v. Hannah, </em>268 F.3d 937, 941 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that the fact that charges are pending at the time of the offense is a permissible departure factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We must give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s resolution of the second question \u2014 whether the departure factors it relied upon remove the defendant from the applicable Guidelines heartland under the facts of the case. <em>Collins, </em>122 F.3d at 1303. Given Siany\u2019s pending state felony charges and his multiple uncounted convictions for a range of serious conduct, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Siany\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We also conclude that the record sufficiently supports the factual basis underlying the departure. We review for clear error the factual determinations underlying the district court\u2019s decision to depart. <em>See United States v. Maldonado-Campos, </em>920 F.2d 714, 720 (10th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1071 (10th Cir.1998) (noting that the clear-error standard articulated in <em>Maldonado-Campos </em>is unaltered by Koon). Because Siany did not contest the facts of his prior convictions and of his pending state charges at his sentencing hearing, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to rely on those facts in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Yates, </em>22 F.3d 981, 989 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cOnly facts that are contested at a sentencing hearing must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Finally, we address whether the district court\u2019s degree of departure from criminal history category III to category VI was reasonable. In making this determination,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">we consider the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence together with factors such as: \u201cthe seriousness of the offense, the need for just punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, correctional treatment, the sentencing pattern of the Guidelines, the policy statements contained in the Guidelines, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-10\"><em>Collins, </em>122 F.3d at 1308-09 (quoting <em>United States v. White, </em>893 F.2d 276, 278 (10th Cir.1990) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a))). The district court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">[Siany] has several prior convictions which were not considered in the computation of the criminal history category due to the date of the offense. If counted, these convictions would result in ten additional criminal history points for a ... criminal history category of 6. This, coupled with the fact that the defendant had felony charges pending in [state court] when he committed the instant offenses, warrants a departure from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>prescribed guideline range pursuant to USSG Section 4A1.3(a) and (e). <em>The departure is a guided depaHure, in that the criminal history category which most closely resembled the criminal history of this defendant, a category 6, will be used to determine the sentence in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2G\">(Sentencing Tr. at 27 (emphasis added).) It is true that an \u201cexplanation [that] does nothing more than restate the justification for upward departure ... does not fulfill the separate requirement of stating the reasons for imposing the particular sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whiteskunk, </em>162 F.3d 1244, 1254 (10th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). Nonetheless, the district court sufficiently \u201cartieulate[d] reasons for the degree of departure using [a] reasonable methodology hitched to the Sentencing Guidelines, including extrapolation from or analogy to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Bartsma, </em>198 F.3d at 1196 (quotations omitted). In arriving at a sentence, the court took account of the sentencing pattern and policies of the Guidelines and reached a reasonable determination in light of the factual circumstances presented to it. We conclude that the district court\u2019s rationale and conclusions were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">AFFIRMED.
