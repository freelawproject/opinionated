R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">Roland S. Weaver appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his civil rights complaint for lack of jurisdiction\u2014 as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and res judicata \u2014 failure to state a claim, and frivolousness, and denying him leave to file an amended complaint. The parties are familiar with the underlying facts; we need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say, all of Mr. Weaver\u2019s allegations and legal arguments arise out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>seizure of his vehicles. We have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s rulings <em>de novo. See Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir.1999) (failure to state a claim); <em>ANR Pipeline Co. v. Lafaver, </em>150 F.3d 1178, 1186 (10th Cir.1998) (subject matter jurisdiction). We construe appellant\u2019s pro se pleadings liberally, as required by <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">On appeal, Mr. Weaver alleges wrongful taking, false arrest, conspiracy, selective prosecution, due process violations, and undefined RICO claims. All of these claims were decided \u2014 or could have been decided had they been asserted \u2014 in his previous state lawsuits. His legal arguments challenging the district court\u2019s rulings lack merit. After careful review of the entire record on appeal in light of appellant\u2019s arguments and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons contained in the district court\u2019s thorough Memorandum and Order filed February 21, 2001, the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas is AFFIRMED. Plaintiffs motions for leave to file an appendix on appeal and to remand this case to the district court are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-6\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
