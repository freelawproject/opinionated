Davis alleges that the district court erred in finding that <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2J1.2 (1998), the obstruction of justice guideline, applied to forgery of a judicial signature on a fictitious court order; and in refusing to group the counts under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2 because there were two separate victims. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the court erred in applying USSG \u00a7 2J1.2 for the forgery offense and remand for resentencing on this issue. We also conclude that the court did not err in declining to group the offenses, and therefore affirm that part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">Davis argues that the district court erred by applying USSG \u00a7 2J1 .2, the obstruction of justice guideline, for the judicial forgery conviction under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 505. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s guideline selection de novo. <em>See United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088,1091 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines direct a sentencing court to use the Chapter Two guideline that is \u201cmost applicable to the offense of conviction,\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.2(a), and provide a statutory index of crimes and applicable guidelines to assist in that determination, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.2 comment. (n.l); USSG App. A. Appendix A of the Guidelines provides that for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 505, the applicable guideline sections are \u00a7 2F1.1, which applies to offenses involving fraud or deceit, specifically forgery or altered or counterfeit instruments other than counterfeit currency, and \u00a7 2J1.2, which applies to obstruction of justice offenses. When more than one guideline is referenced in Appendix A, the sentencing court must \u201cuse the guideline most appropriate for the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d USSG App. A, intro, comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">The district court determined that obstruction of justice was the most applicable guideline for the offense conduct of creating a fictitious court order and affixing the judge\u2019s name to it. We disagree. By selecting both the fraud guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>line and the obstruction of justice guideline as potentially applicable to a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 505, the Guidelines clearly contemplate that some violations of section 505 will not involve obstruction of justice. This approach is consistent with that of section 505, which, broadly speaking, proscribes two types of conduct: the use of a false or counterfeit judicial signature to authenticate a document, and the \u201ctenderling] in evidence\u201d of a document with a forged or counterfeit judicial signature. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 505. In our view, the fraud guideline generally will be the most applicable guideline when the section 505 violation involves only the authentication of a document for purposes of defrauding a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">This conclusion is supported by the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Cowan, </em>116 F.3d 1360 (10th Cir.1997). In <em>Cowan, </em>the court noted that the defendant\u2019s action of forging a judicial signature affected the victim\u2019s right to have his claims heard and was not an attempt to defraud the victim of property. The court therefore found that the obstruction of justice guideline was more applicable than the fraud guideline. <em>See id. </em>at 1364 n. 5. In this case, Davis\u2019s conduct did not interfere with any judicial proceedings, but rather was an attempt to use the document with the forged judicial signature to defraud the creditor of its property. We therefore conclude that USSG \u00a7 2F1.1, the fraud guideline, should have been applied to the forgery offense. We remand the case to the district court for resentencing for the limited purpose of sentencing Davis on the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 505 conviction using USSG \u00a7 2F1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Davis also asserts that the forgery and bankruptcy fraud counts should have been grouped together under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2, which requires counts involving substantially the same harm to be grouped together. Under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2(b), counts involve substantially the same harm if they \u201cinvolve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Davis argues that the creditor was the victim of both offenses and that both offenses were part of a common scheme, so that the judicial forgery and bankruptcy fraud counts should have been grouped together. Whether the district court properly applied the grouping provisions is a question involving interpretation of the guidelines and is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Toler, </em>901 F.2d 399, 402 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Although the judicial forgery was part of the same scheme to defraud Davis\u2019s creditor, the primary victims were not the same. As the district court concluded, the primary victim of the judicial forgery count was the judicial system itself. <em>Cf. Cowan, </em>116 F.3d at 1363 (\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 505 is to protect the reputation and integrity of the federal courts, their officials documents and proceedings.... \u201d). The primary victim of the other counts, however, was Davis\u2019s creditor. We therefore conclude that the district court properly declined to group the counts under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2(b). <em>See Toler, </em>901 F.2d at 403 (explaining that \u201cthe grouping determination looks only to the primary victim of the offenses\u201d and affirming the district court\u2019s refusal to group offenses where the primary victim of one offense was the exploited minor and \u201csociety in general\u201d was the primary victim of the other offenses); <em>see also United States v. Kunzman, </em>54 F.3d 1522, 1531 (10th Cir.1995) (affirming district court\u2019s refusal to group fraud and money laundering counts, because fraud victim is the individual defrauded, but society is the victim of money laundering).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
