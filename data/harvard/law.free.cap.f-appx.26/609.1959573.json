We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Garza\u2019s habeas petition, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Garza contends that the statute of limitations found in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), was tolled because (1) he reasonably relied on his counsel to file a timely habeas petition on his behalf; (2) he was denied access to the prison law library; and (3) he was separated from his personal legal materials. He argues that the district court erred by concluding that the facts alleged in his declaration did not constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying his delay in filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Equitable tolling is available \u201cif extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (internal citations omitted). <em>See also Allen v. Lewis, </em>255 F.3d 798, 800 (9th Cir.2001). Statutory tolling is available until an \u201cimpediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). After the district court\u2019s decision was rendered, we emphasized in <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), that \u201cdetermination of whether there was an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) and whether there are grounds for equitable tolling are highly fact-dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Because the State apparently was not asked to respond to Garza\u2019s declaration and the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing, the record in this case is inadequate to determine whether Garza\u2019s petition is timely. It cannot be said that there are \u201cno circumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition and declaration under which he would be entitled to a finding of an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Whalem/Hunt, </em>233 F.3d at 1148. Because \u201cthe district court is in a better position to develop the facts and assess their legal significance in the first instance,\u201d <em>id., </em>we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court for appropriate development of the record and a new judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-19\">.
