The essential facts are largely undisputed and the parties disagree only as to the conclusions that may be drawn from those facts. We have earefully reviewed the record and briefs on appeal and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">First, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Saxena\u2019s continued performance under a consulting agreement with Thorson, Zahler &amp; Co. (\u201cThorson\u201d), a registered investment adviser and brokerage firm, for some nine months after entry of an administrative order barring him from \u201cassociation with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company,\u201d as well as his substantial involvement in the formation of two investment funds and Saxena Capital Management, Inc. (\u201cSCM\u201d), the company that served as general partner for the funds, was sufficient to establish a violation of the bar order.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">Further, Saxena does not dispute that he provided free advertising for SCM and the investment funds on his website and also provided SCM free access to his investment newsletter subscriber lists for use in promoting the funds. And, since the solicitation of interests in the funds was undisputedly widespread and publicly advertised, interests in the funds were not, as Saxena contends, private offerings exempt from registration under Rule 506 of Regulation D, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.506. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d(2); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.502(c). Accordingly, we think the undisputed facts demonstrate that Saxena violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a) and (c), by participating in the offer or sale of unregistered securities in interstate commerce or through the mails.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-17\">The undisputed facts also showed that Saxena participated in preparing the offering memoranda for the investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>funds and, in connection therewith, supplied false and misleading information concerning the funds\u2019 management and investment strategies. This conduct is sufficient to establish that Saxena violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80b-6(l) and (2). Further, Saxena\u2019s failure to disclose either the fee arrangement under the Thorson consulting agreement or the SEC bar order in notices advising his newsletter subscribers of their opportunity to open brokerage accounts at Thorson, his failure to advise Thorson of the bar order, and his failure to terminate the consulting agreement immediately after its entry are also sufficient to establish violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6(4) and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s disgorgement order and award of a civil monetary penalty, <em>see SEC v. Warde, </em>151 F.3d 42, 49 (2d Cir.1998); <em>SEC v. First City Financial Corp., </em>890 F.2d 1215, 1228 (D.C.Cir.1989), and Saxena\u2019s remaining challenges to the district court\u2019s preclusion order and its denial of his motion to transfer venue are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-12\">. Interests in the investment funds constituted securities because the undisputed facts established that they were \"investment contracts\u201d as the Supreme Court defined that term in <em>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
