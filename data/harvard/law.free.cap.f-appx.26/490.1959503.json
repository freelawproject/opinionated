Wilson and his family for a civil damages claim arising out of an automobile accident. Based on recent developments in Kentucky case law, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND with instructions for the district court to enter judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The events giving rise to this action occurred in the late evening and early morning of August 21 and 22, 1997 in Nelson County, Kentucky. At approximately 11:00 p.m. on August 21, after his parents, Garry and Nancy Wilson, had gone to bed, sixteen-year-old Christopher Wilson disengaged his home\u2019s security system and climbed out of his first-floor bedroom window. Once out of the house, Christopher walked the short distance to the property owned by his grandparents, Robert and Virginia Davis. As Christopher was well aware, the Davises were away on a camping trip that evening. Christopher then proceeded to his grandparents\u2019 garage, which housed his grandparents\u2019 1995 Dodge Dakota pick-up truck. Using a key he had copied without his grandparents\u2019 knowledge, he started the truck and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">It is undisputed from the deposition testimony that Christopher knew that he did not have permission from his grandparents to drive the vehicle, nor had his parents authorized him to leave the house that evening. Christopher also did not have a valid driver\u2019s license. Instead, Christopher had only a learner\u2019s permit, which prohibited him from driving without a licensed driver in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Christopher admitted in his deposition that he took the truck so that he could go joy riding with his friends, Donald Pegago, III, and Timothy Downs, both of whom were fifteen-years-old and without driver\u2019s licenses at the time. As per their prearranged plan, Christopher picked up Donald around midnight, and then Timothy shortly thereafter. According to Christopher, both Timothy and Donald knew that Christopher was driving without a license and that he did not have permission to drive his grandfather\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">After picking up Timothy, Christopher drove to Timothy\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house, where they stayed for approximately two hours. When the boys finally left Timothy\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house, they were in a hurry to return Donald to his house before his family discovered that he was missing. While the boys were en route to Donald\u2019s house, a police officer observed the truck traveling at approximately seventy miles per hour in a thirty-five mile-per-hour zone. The officer gave chase, and Christopher, egged on by his friends, attempted to outrun the police car. By Christopher\u2019s own estimate, his speed reached approximately 135 miles per hour during the chase. At a sharp curve in the road, Christopher lost control of the truck and drove off the road. According to Christo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>pher, the truck flipped six times, throwing Donald from the cabin. Donald suffered severe injuries as a result, and his family have sued Christopher and his parents in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Following the accident, Christopher was charged with wanton endangerment, eluding the police, driving without a license, speeding, and criminal mischief. He was not charged with any crime, however, for taking his grandparents\u2019 vehicle without their permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Both the Wilsons and the Davises insured their vehicles with State Farm. On August 18,1998, State Farm filed a declaratory action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, seeking a ruling that State Farm was not hable under either of the two policies for the injuries suffered by Donald Pegago.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The relevant language in the Wilsons\u2019 automobile insurance policy for purposes of this dispute involves the policy\u2019s coverage of non-owned cars. According to the language of the policy, \u201cnon-owned car\u201d is defined as</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">a <em>car </em>not owned by or registered or leased in the name of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">1. [the policy holder or the policy holder\u2019s spouse];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">2. any <em>relative</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">3. any other <em>person </em>residing in the same household as [the policy holder, the policy holder\u2019s spouse] or any <em>relative; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">4. an employer of [the policy holder, the policy holder\u2019s spouse] or any <em>relative.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 385. The provision central to this case appears immediately after this definition, stating that a car \u201cwhich is not in the lawful possession of the <em>person </em>operating it\u201d is not a \u201cnon-owned car\u201d for purposes of the policy. J.A. at 385-86. The parties do not dispute that Christopher would be covered by his family\u2019s policy if the grandparents\u2019 pick-up truck is classified as a non-owned car. Whether the grandparents\u2019 truck is classified as a non-owned vehicle hinges upon whether Christopher was in \u201clawful possession\u201d of the truck while driving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">After the parties conducted limited discovery, State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to its declaratory action. On December 13, 1999, the district court issued an opinion granting State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the Davises\u2019 policy, but denying State Farm\u2019s motion with respect to the Wilsons\u2019 policy, holding that \u201cState Farm must provide coverage and a defense for Christopher Wilson and his parents\u201d concerning the damages resulting from Pegago\u2019s injuries. J.A. at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">In its opinion, the district court first recognized that, given the undisputed fact that Christopher took his grandparents\u2019 truck without their permission, and the fact that Kentucky law prohibits the unauthorized possession of a motor vehicle, Ky. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 514 .100, \u201cone might logically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>assume that State Farm would have no obligation to defend or indemnify under the policy.\u201d J.A. at 92. After an analysis of the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Healthwise of Kentucky, Ltd. v. Anglin, </em>956 S.W.2d 213 (Ky.1997), however, the district court concluded that the notion of \u201clawful possession\u201d must be considered an ambiguous policy provision and that an adjudication of criminal guilt with respect to Christopher\u2019s unauthorized use of the truck was needed before the policy provision at issue would preclude coverage. <em>See </em>J.A. at 92-93. Noting that the <em>Health-wise </em>decision was binding in this diversity case, the district court held that Christopher Wilson\u2019s use of the truck fell within the policy\u2019s coverage for non-owned vehicles, and that State Farm would have to provide the Wilson family coverage and a defense with respect to the Pegago family\u2019s state-law claims. <em>See </em>J.A. at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Following the district court\u2019s decision, State Farm filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54 requesting that the district court enter a final judgment with respect to the claims decided in the court\u2019s December 13, 1999 order granting in part and denying in part State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court, finding no just cause for delay, granted State Farm\u2019s motion on April 18, 2000. State Farm filed a timely appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Campbell v. Grand Trunk W. R.R. Co., </em>238 F.3d 772, 775 (6th Cir.2001). The moving party has the burden of establishing that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). This court also applies de novo review to a district court\u2019s determinations of state law. <em>Kurczi v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>113 F.3d 1426,1429 (6th Cir.1997). In diversity cases, we are bound to apply the same law as would be applied by the state courts. <em>See id. </em>If the Kentucky Supreme Court has addressed in a decision the issue before us on appeal, \u201cwe are bound by that decision unless we are convinced that the [state\u2019s] high court would overrule it if confronted with facts similar to those before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Before we address the relevant state case law, it is important that we emphasize, as the Kentucky state courts repeatedly have, the two \u201ccardinal principles\u201d of Kentucky insurance law. <em>Ky. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKinney, </em>831 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Ky.1992). First, insurance contracts are to be liberally construed so that all doubts pertaining to coverage are resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. <em>See id. </em>Second, an insurance policy\u2019s \u201cexceptions and exclusions should be strictly construed to make insurance effective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The Kentucky Supreme Court has noted, however, that these general rules do</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">not mean that every doubt must be resolved against [the insurance company] and [do] not interfere with the rule that the policy must receive a reasonable interpretation consistent with the parties\u2019 object and intent or narrowly expressed in the plain meaning and/or language of the contract. Neither should a nonexistent ambiguity be utilized to resolve a policy against the company. We consider that courts should not rewrite an insurance contract to enlarge the risk to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Powell-Walton-Milward, Inc., </em>870 S.W.2d 223, 226-27 (Ky.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">In two recent cases, <em>Healthwise </em>and <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Martinez, </em>54 S.W.3d 142 (Ky.2001), the Ken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tucky Supreme Court has addressed insurance provisions similar to, though not the same as, the provision at issue in this case. In important respects, these decisions appear to be inconsistent, with <em>Martinez </em>limiting, significantly, the holding of <em>Health-wise. </em>Because of the lack of clarity of the Kentucky law, we certified the following question to the Kentucky Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbE\">In light of the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s recent interpretation of <em>Healthwise of Kentucky, Ltd. v. Anglin, </em>956 S.W.2d 213 (Ky.1997), in <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Martinez, </em>No.l999-SC1008-D, 2001 WL 567731 (Ky. May 24, 2001), is a criminal adjudication of guilt required before an automobile insurance provision excluding coverage can be invoked where: the provision denies coverage for damages incurred when driving non-owned vehicles if the vehicle \u201cis not in the <em>lawful possession </em>of the person operating it;\u201d \u201clawful possession\u201d was not defined in the insurance policy nor in the Kentucky Penal Code; and the insured, while admitting to driving the vehicle without permission of the owners (his grandparents), was not criminally charged for this conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In an order entered on October 25, 2001, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied our request for certification. Thus, we must analyze the case law to determine how the Kentucky Supreme Court would decide the case at bar, without guidance from that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In <em>Healthwise, </em>the insured was seriously injured while racing another vehicle; his blood alcohol level was .21 percent. The insured, however, was not charged with any offense. <em>See Healthwise, </em>956 S.W.2d at 215. A short time after the accident, the insurance provider notified the insured that it would not cover any of his medical expenses because two of his policy\u2019s coverage exclusions applied. The first exclusion stated that \u201c[ljosses suffered ... while committing or attempting to commit a crime\u201d were not covered. <em>Id. </em>at 215-16. The insurer argued that this exclusion applied because the insured suffered his injuries while committing the crime of drag racing. The second exclusion stated that \u201c[tjreatment for injuries sustained as a result of being under the influence of alcohol (legal intoxication as defined by Kentucky law) or the illegal use of drugs\u201d would not be covered under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 216. The insurer claimed that, given the insured\u2019s blood alcohol level, this exclusion also applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In first addressing the crime exclusion, the Kentucky Supreme Court stated that, although the average person would view the insured\u2019s drag racing while under the influence as criminal, for purposes of the exclusion the term \u201ccrime\u201d should not be defined as the ordinary person would define it. Rather, because \u201c[pjeople often use the words \u2018crime\u2019 and \u2018criminal\u2019 to describe actions which, though perhaps reprehensible, are neither illegal nor unlawful, ujsing a subjective definition of \u2018crime\u2019 would lead to an overly broad reading of the exclusion and inconsistent applications of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead of looking to the insurer\u2019s proposed definition of crime found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, the court looked to the Kentucky Penal Code\u2019s definition of crime, as suggested by the insured. Based on the Kentucky Penal Code\u2019s definition of crime as \u201ca misdemeanor or a felony,\u201d Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 500.080(2), the Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately decided that drag racing was neither a misdemeanor nor a felony, but was instead a separate traffic offense. Thus, the court held, the \u201ccrime\u201d exclusion did not apply. <em>See Healthwise, </em>956 S.W.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">In examining the intoxication exclusion, which defined \u201cbeing under the influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of alcohol\u201d as meaning \u201clegal intoxication as defined by Kentucky law,\u201d the court again decided that the exclusion was ambiguous because \u201cseveral definitions of legal intoxication ... could apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. After examining several statutory provisions, the court decided that Ky.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 222.202(1) was the most appropriate provision from which to extract the definition of \u201clegal intoxication.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 217-18. Section 222.202(1) states: \u201cA person is guilty of alcohol intoxication when he appears in a public place manifestly under the influence of alcohol to the degree that he may endanger himself or other persons or property, or unreasonably annoy persons in his vicinity.\u201d Based on this statutory language, the court concluded that \u201cthe status of legal alcohol intoxication is determined through adjudication in a criminal proceeding\u201d and that for the intoxication exclusion to apply, the insured \u201cmust not only have acted in a manner described under KRS 222.202(1), but he must have been adjudicated guilty of such conduct.\u201d <em>Healthwise, </em>956 S.W.2d at 218 (quotation omitted). Because both exclusions were inapplicable to the insured, the court held that the insurer was required to cover the insured\u2019s medical expenses associated with the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The district court in the present case was apparently correct in holding, under <em>Healthmse, </em>that the policy provision at issue would preclude coverage only if there were a criminal adjudication of Christopher Wilson\u2019s guilt for unlawful possession of his grandfather\u2019s truck, even though the ordinary person would consider his conduct unlawful without the need for any such adjudication. As with the \u201ccrime\u201d exclusion in <em>Healthmse, </em>the \u201cnot in the lawful possession\u201d policy language at issue in this case was not defined in the policy itself and thus the Kentucky Supreme Court would likely find it both ambiguous and susceptible to \u201can overly broad reading.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Healthwise, </em>956 S.W.2d at 216. It is also likely that, in determining what does and does, not constitute \u201clawful possession\u201d for purposes of this case, the state supreme court would turn to Kentucky statutory law. As the district court noted in its opinion, there is one clearly applicable code provision to which the state supreme court would likely look in determining whether Christopher Wilson\u2019s possession was lawful. This provision, Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 514.100(1), concerns the crime of an unauthorized use of an automobile, and states that \u201c[a] person is guilty of the unauthorized use of an automobile or other propelled vehicle when he knowingly operates, exercises control over, or otherwise uses such vehicle without consent of the owner or person having legal possession thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Although the Kentucky Supreme Court did not explain how it determined, from the language of the intoxication statute at issue in <em>Healthwise, </em>that a criminal adjudication of guilt was needed before one could be considered legally intoxicated under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Kentucky law, the language of the \u201cunauthorized use of an automobile\u201d statute is similarly constructed. As the district court noted, both provisions begin, \u201cA person is guilty of [this offense] when.... \u201d Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 222.202(1), 514.100(1). Given the statutes\u2019 similar language, as well as the Kentucky courts\u2019 doctrine that ambiguous policy provisions should be construed in favor of coverage, it is likely that, under <em>Healthwise, </em>the Kentucky Supreme Court would hold that a criminal adjudication of guilt for an \u201cunauthorized use of an automobile\u201d is necessary before it could be decided that Christopher Wilson was \u201cnot in the lawful possession of\u2019 his grandfather\u2019s vehicle, and thus that Donald Pegago\u2019s injuries were covered under the Wilson policy. Because, like the insured in <em>Healthwise, </em>Christopher Wilson was never charged with any crime for taking his grandparents\u2019 truck, it appears that, if <em>Healthwise </em>were the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s last word on this issue, that court would hold on these facts that Christopher is covered under his family\u2019s automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">But in determining how the Kentucky Supreme Court would decide the present case, we must also take into account its more recent decision in <em>Martinez. Martinez </em>was handed down on May 24, 2001,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while this appeal was pending, and thus the district court did not have the opportunity to consider it in ruling on the motions in the present case. We are obligated, however, to consider <em>Martinez </em>in determining how the Kentucky Supreme Court would decide the present case. Following <em>Martinez, </em>we conclude that the Kentucky Supreme Court would hold that the policy provision denying coverage must be enforced in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In <em>Martinez, </em>the Kentucky Supreme Court held that a criminal conviction was not necessary to trigger a provision excluding coverage for bodily injury resulting from the \u201cwillful violation of a penal statute or ordinance.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>54 S.W.3d at 143. The defendants-insureds in <em>Martinez </em>owned and operated a cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. The defendants were faced with a civil damages claim following the discovery that the cemetery had committed a number of improper practices, including interring multiple bodies in a single grave. The criminal charges brought against the defendants were dropped when the defendants agreed to participate in a diversion program. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The specific language of the exclusion at issue in <em>Martinez </em>stated that there would be no coverage for \u201cbodily injury caused by willful violation of a penal statute or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge of an insured or of a manager employed by the named insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that, by acknowledging that they had engaged in over-burying, reusing grave sites, and other improper practices, the defendants had admitted, effectively, violating a penal statute: \u201cIn this case, no question exists as to whether [the insured] violated a penal statute; such violations were admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. Thus, no formal adjudication of guilt was necessary to trigger the policy exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">In reaching this conclusion, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the state court of appeals, which had based its decision on <em>Healthwise. </em>The Kentucky Supreme Court stated that the court of appeals had misapplied <em>Healthwise. See id. </em>at 144, 145. In so holding, the court focused on the <em>Healthwise </em>court\u2019s treatment of the intoxication exclusion. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>supreme court held, in a somewhat confusing analysis, that a criminal adjudication of the \u201cstatus\u201d of alcohol intoxication was required \u201cbecause, while the use of alcohol alone did not trigger the exclusion, intoxication did. Because intoxication was not defined expressly in the penal code, it required a court determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. In contrast, the court reasoned that the defendants in <em>Martinez </em>effectively admitted to violating a penal statute, even though they had not pleaded guilty, and thus there was no need for a criminal adjudication of their guilt before the coverage exclusion was triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We conclude that the Kentucky Supreme Court would decide the present case differently under <em>Martinez </em>than it would have under <em>Healthwise. </em>The <em>Martinez </em>court emphasized that the defendants in that case effectively admitted to violating a penal statute. Similarly, it appears that the Wilsons have admitted, in effect, that Christopher violated Kentucky law in the present case. Section 514.100(1) is violated if a person knowingly operates a vehicle \u201cwithout consent of the owner or person having legal possession thereof.\u201d Christopher openly and repeatedly admitted in his deposition that he did not have permission to drive his grandparents\u2019 truck, and that he was wrong to do so. <em>See </em>J.A. at 236, 248-49, 262, 266-67. Moreover, in their answer to State Farm\u2019s complaint, the Wilsons admitted that Christopher was not in lawful possession of the vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the <em>Martinez </em>court\u2019s reasoning, such admissions render a criminal adjudication of guilt under \u00a7 514.100(1) unnecessary to trigger the policy provision precluding coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Thus, rather than hold that a criminal adjudication of guilt is necessary with respect to the lawfulness of Christopher\u2019s possession of the truck, we follow <em>Martinez </em>and hold that the Wilsons\u2019 admissions amount to an effective admission of guilt under \u00a7 514.100(1), the statutory provision most helpful in defining what constitutes lawful possession for purposes of this case. Because Christopher has admitted, in effect, to not having lawful possession of the truck, and the Wilsons admitted as much in their answer, the policy provision denying coverage must be enforced in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Based on this reasoning, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision holding that State Farm must provide coverage and a defense for the Wilson family with respect to Donald Pegago\u2019s state-law damages claims and REMAND for the district court to enter judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court with directions to enter judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-12\">. The damage caused to the Davises\u2019 truck was covered and paid for by State Farm under the Davises\u2019 automobile insurance policy. The district court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm with respect to the Davises\u2019 policy, holding that it did not cover any of Pegago\u2019s injuries. This aspect of the district court\u2019s decision is not contested on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-18\">. The policy defines a \u201crelative\u201d as \u201ca <em>person </em>related to [the policy holder or the policy holder's spouse] by blood, marriage or adoption who lives with [the policy holder].\u201d J.A. at 386. Because the Davises did not live with the Wilsons, there is no dispute that the Davises do not fall within the Wilson policy\u2019s coverage of a car owned, registered, or leased in the name of a relative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">. State Farm argues on appeal that the term \"unlawful,\u201d unlike \"illegal,\u201d is broad enough to encompass acts not punishable by criminal laws, and thus a criminal adjudication of guilt should not be needed before the policy provision excluding coverage applies. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21. It is unlikely, however, that the Kentucky Supreme Court, in light of its opinion that \"crime\u201d is a nebulous term, would allow the term \"lawful\u201d to go unclarified by the relevant statutory provisions in the Kentucky Penal Code relating to lawful possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\">. The commentary to Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 514.100 states that the provision \"is directed primarily against joy riding\u2019 generally committed by youngsters.

The Wilsons\u2019 answer admitted to the allegations contained in the sixth paragraph of State Farm's complaint. <em>See </em>J.A. at 18. Paragraph six of State Farm\u2019s complaint alleged that Christopher Wilson had operated his grandfather\u2019s truck \u201cwithout lawful possession.\u201d J.A. at 10. The Wilsons subsequently moved the district court to allow them to file an amended answer. <em>See </em>J.A. at 21. In their proposed amended answer, the Wilsons denied this allegation. <em>See </em>J.A. at 22. The district court, however, denied the Wilsons' motion. <em>See </em>J.A. at 40 (Order, June 7, 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b528-11\">ROSEN, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AoE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">I fully concur with the Court\u2019s ruling in this case. I wish only to add that at least two alternative constructions of Kentucky case law, in addition to the one adopted by the majority, would lead to precisely the same result. Under our diversity jurisdiction, where our role is narrowly limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>predicting what a state court would do if presented with the facts before us, I am reluctant to foreclose the possibility that the Kentucky courts might choose to follow a course different from the one selected by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As noted by the majority, the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Healthwise of Kentucky, Ltd. v. Anglin, </em>956 S.W.2d 213 (Ky.1997), seems to require a criminal adjudication of guilt in order to satisfy an insurance policy provision which incorporates a standard of criminal law. I believe there are at least three ways, however, in which the ruling in <em>Healthwise </em>may be deemed not to control here. First, as recognized by the majority, the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Martinez, </em>54 S.W.3d 142 (Ky.2001), adopts an \u201cadmission of guilt\u201d exception to <em>Health-wise </em>\u2019s requirement of a criminal adjudication. The majority finds, and I wholly agree, that there are ample admissions in the record before us to establish that Christopher Wilson\u2019s use of his grandfather\u2019s pickup truck was \u201cunauthorized,\u201d and hence violative of Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 514.100(1), and that these admissions, under <em>Martinez, </em>obviate the need for a formal adjudication of Christopher\u2019s guilt under the Kentucky Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Even without the exception recognized in <em>Martinez, </em>however, I believe the result here would be no different. First, I question whether <em>Healthwise </em>dictates that we look solely to the Kentucky Penal Code to construe the \u201clawful possession\u201d policy language at issue here. The policy language addressed in <em>Healthwise </em>expressly referenced \u201clegal intoxication as defined by Kentucky law,\u201d and the policy in <em>Martinez </em>likewise required the \u201cwillful violation of a penal statute\u201d to defeat coverage. Here, by contrast, the State Farm policy speaks of \u201clawful possession\u201d of a vehicle. As demonstrated through the various dictionary definitions offered by the parties, \u201clawful\u201d does not equate merely to \u201cnot criminal,\u201d and one can act \u201cunlawfully\u201d without committing a criminal offense. <em>Cf. Kimberly &amp; European Diamonds, Inc. v. Burbank, </em>518 F.Supp. 599, 601-02 (W.D.Ky.1981) (discussing the tort of conversion under Kentucky law), <em>aff'd, </em>684 F.2d 363 (6th Cir.1982); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 217 (setting forth the elements of a tort claim of trespass to chattels). Given this factual distinction between this case and <em>Healthwise </em>and <em>Martinez, </em>I do not believe that the Kentucky courts necessarily would require an adjudication or admission of criminal wrongdoing in order to conclude that Christopher Wilson was not in \u201clawful possession\u201d of his grandfather\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Next, I note that <em>Healthwise </em>looked to the Kentucky Penal Code, and then required an adjudication of guilt under this body of law, only <em>after </em>concluding that the \u201clegal intoxication\u201d policy language at issue in that case was ambiguous, and could be construed by reference to a variety of competing statutory standards. The same could be said of the \u201clawful possession\u201d policy language at issue here \u2014 there are, as the District Court noted, a number of Kentucky statutes that arguably bear upon the question of \u201clawful possession\u201d \u2014 but with one important difference. Notably, and in contrast to the circumstances presented in <em>Healthwise, </em>the Wilsons have failed to identify <em>any </em>standard of \u201clawful possession\u201d under Kentucky law, whether within the Penal Code or elsewhere, that might plausibly encompass Christopher Wilson\u2019s use of his grandfather\u2019s vehicle. Thus, even under the most liberal rules of construction favoring the Wilsons, it simply is not possible to interpret the State Farm policy in a way that supports coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Given these alternative paths to the same result, we should be hesitant, as a federal court sitting in diversity, to adopt a single, definitive construction of the decisions in <em>Healthwise </em>and <em>Martinez, </em>or to endorse any particular means of harmonizing these rulings. Rather, I believe that we should leave it to the state courts to further elucidate the law in this area. With this caveat, I join in the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
