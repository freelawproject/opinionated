New Mexico), Defendants-Appellees.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b918-4\">No. 01-2142.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b918-5\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b918-7\">Feb. 6, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b918-8\">Before SEYMOUR and McKAY, Circuit Judges, and BRORBY, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b918-9\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AjW\">McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Mr. Baxter appeals the District of New Mexico Court\u2019s Partial Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal which dismissed the majority of his \u00a7 1983 claims. Mr. Baxter claims Defendants violated his constitutional rights in a variety of ways including illegally incarcerating him in a private prison, violating various state laws, and subjecting Mr. Baxter to constitutionally inadequate conditions of confinement such as inadequate access to a legal library.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">We could add little to the well-reasoned district court opinion. In dismissing Mr. Baxter\u2019s claims, the district correctly cites long-standing precedence which mandates a dismissal of Mr. Baxter\u2019s claims. After a thorough review of Mr. Baxter\u2019s brief and the record on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision based on the grounds set forth in its opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We remind Appellant that he is obligated to continue making partial payments towards the filing fee until the entire fee has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-24\">. Mr. Baxter\u2019s motion for issuance of a certificate of appealability is denied as moot as a certificate of appealability is unnecessary in a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
