Barfield was tried for first-degree murder as an habitual offender; in the instant action, he alleged that his appointed trial counsel conspired with the state court judge, and with unidentified state officials, to secure his conviction on a lesser included offense. On appeal, he reiterates his arguments below, and further argues that the district court should have construed his complaint as an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Following de novo review, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Barfield\u2019s claims. The court also did not err in refusing to construe Barfield\u2019s complaint as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as Barfield already had filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>see Gary Barfield v. Larry Norris, </em>No. 01-1287 (8th Cir. Mar. 5, 2001), and did not obtain permission from this court to file a second petition, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Barfield\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\">. The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Bobby E. Shepherd, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
