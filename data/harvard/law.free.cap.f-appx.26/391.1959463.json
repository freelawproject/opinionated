This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-17\"> The Honorable Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr., United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b421-26\">On October 16, 1992, Blackwell and his co-defendant, Billy Frank Richard, Sr., were convicted by a jury-of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Both were sentenced to 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. This court affirmed their convictions and sentences on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>Nos. 93-3068/3069, 16 F.3d 1221, 1994 WL 6809 (6th Cir. Jan.10, 1994) (unpublished), and each man has subsequently sought post-conviction relief. In 1997, Blackwell filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, which was dismissed by the district court. This court declined to issue a certificate of appealability on March 18, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In his own series of attempts at post-conviction relief, Richard filed a petition for a writ of error eoram nobis in May 1998, asserting that he had been sentenced \u201cfor a charge [he] was never indicted on.\u201d The district court found that Richard\u2019s claim was not cognizable under \u00a7 1651 and dismissed the petition on April 30, 1999. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s order on June 19, 2000. <em>United States v. Richard, </em>No. 99-3619, 221 F.3d 1337, 2000 WL 875369 (6th Cir. June 19, 2000) (unpublished). Meanwhile, on May 30, 2000, Blackwell filed his instant motion to join Richard\u2019s coram nobis petition, and the district court denied the joinder motion as moot in a marginal order on June 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In his timely appeal, Blackwell argues that he should be resentenced in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), and <em>United States v. Rebmann, </em>226 F.3d 521 (6th Cir. 2000). Blackwell moves for pauper status on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">As an initial matter, we decline to consider Blackwell\u2019s arguments on appeal which were not first raised in the district court. Unless exceptional circumstances are present, the court normally will not address an issue not first raised in the district court. <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm\u2019rs, </em>85 F.3d 257, 261 (6th Cir.1996). No exceptional circumstances exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Blackwell\u2019s motion to join. The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Blackwell\u2019s motion because Richard previously had filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his eoram nobis petition. The filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction to act in matters involving the merits of the appeal. <em>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>71 F.3d 1197, 1203 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Accordingly, Blackwell\u2019s motion for pauper status is granted for the limited purposes of this appeal, and the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.
