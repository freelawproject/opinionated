We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is only available when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>see In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and it may not be used as a substitute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his right to such relief is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Lewis has not made such a showing. Accordingly, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. Lewis\u2019 request to proceed in for-ma pauperis is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
