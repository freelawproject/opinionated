R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">This case is before the court on Edward Herring\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Herring seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless the movant first obtains a COA). Because Herring has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Herring pleaded guilty in federal district court to three counts of aiding and abetting in a bank robbery. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Herring contends that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by two points pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B). As the district court pointed out in denying Herring\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, however, Herring\u2019s judgment of conviction was entered on the docket on July 8, 1998, and became final on July 22, 1998. Furthermore, Herring never filed a direct appeal. Accordingly, Herring\u2019s instant \u00a7 2255 motion, which was filed February 6, 2001, was filed more than two years outside of the one-year limitation period set out in \u00a7 2255 para. 6. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Herring did not argue that the limitations period should be equitably tolled, the district court denied Herring\u2019s petition on the ground that it was untimely. In so doing, the district court noted that even if Herring\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was not untimely, his sentencing claim would be procedurally barred because it was not raised in a direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 165, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), and was, in any event, meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">To be entitled to a COA, Herring must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 474, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that when a district court dismisses a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner is entitled to a COA only if he shows both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether he had stated a valid constitutional claim and debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct). Herring has utterly failed to carry his burden. In fact, he does not even address in his filings in this court the district court\u2019s conclusion that his \u00a7 2255 motion is time-barred or the question of equitable tolling. Because Herring does not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that his \u00a7 2255 motion is time-barred and does not offer any ground upon which the limitations period could be equitably tolled, this court DENIES his request for a COA for substantially those reasons set out in the district court order filed March 21, 2001, and DISMISSES this appeal. Herring\u2019s request to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
