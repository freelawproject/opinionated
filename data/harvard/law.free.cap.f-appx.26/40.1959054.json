Martinez was sentenced to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, which he is currently serving, three years of supervised release, and a $400 special assessment. On appeal, Martinez challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, brought pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>This appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a new trial arises from the post-trial revelation that Raymond Saladino, a prison inmate and government \u201ccooperator\u201d who played a central role in the investigation of Martinez, perjured himself at Martinez\u2019s trial. In December 1996 and January 1997, Saladino was authorized by government investigators to offer to pay bribes to Martinez, a unit manager at the Metropolitan Detention Center, in exchange for authorizing prohibited visits and smuggling sham heroin into prison. At Martinez\u2019s trial, the government offered audio and video tapes of Martinez accepting the bribes, documentary and other evidence to establish that Martinez had granted the requested favors, and Saladino\u2019s testimony concerning his role in the investigation. Saladino also testified that he had undergone a moral transformation after his incarceration, as a result of which he was no longer involved in criminal activity and was now testifying truthfully. Martinez, on the other hand, did not deny that he took the bribes; rather, he raised the defense of entrapment, claiming that he was improperly induced to take the bribes by a combination of his sleep disorder and the fear aroused in him by Saladino\u2019s and another government agent\u2019s reputed or claimed violent pasts and ties to organized crime. After Martinez\u2019s conviction, the government learned that, contrary to his moral transformation testimony, Saladino had been dealing drugs and possibly committing other crimes during the period of his government cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Martinez moved for a new trial on the ground that Saladino\u2019s perjury was material and that the jury, had it known of the perjury, would have likely reached a different verdict. The district court denied the motion, finding that the government had adduced sufficient independence evidence apart from Saladino\u2019s testimony to support Martinez\u2019s conviction and that, in light of the damage done to Saladino\u2019s credibility on cross-examination, the evidence of perjury was cumulative and hence immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">On appeal, Martinez claims that the district court erred in denying him a new trial because (1) the government\u2019s rebuttal of Martinez\u2019s entrapment defense, namely that Martinez was predisposed to commit the crimes, rested entirely on Saladino\u2019s testimony; and (2) the evidence of Saladino\u2019s perjury was material because it would illuminate Saladino\u2019s ability to manipulate and deceive and undermine the jury\u2019s basis for believing Saladino because his \u201cmoral transformation\u201d was a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We review the denial of a Rule 33 motion for abuse of discretion, accepting the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Gallego, </em>191 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Where, as here, the government neither knew nor should have known of its witness\u2019s perjury at the time of trial, Martinez must make the following showing to win a new trial: (1) that the perjured testimony was material; and (2) but for the perjured testimony, the defendant would most likely not have been convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 162. Martinez cannot make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">First, we are unpersuaded by Martinez\u2019s claim that because Saladino was the sole source of evidence of Martinez\u2019s predisposition to take bribes, Martinez would most likely not have been convicted but for the perjured testimony. Unlike the cases cited by Martinez in support of this contention, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Wallach, </em>935 F.2d 445, 458 (2d Cir.1991), the government\u2019s witness here was not the sole or essential source of evidence concerning Martinez\u2019s predisposition. Rather, as the district court found, the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tapes showed that Martinez took the bribes and agreed to smuggle drugs into prison knowingly, without reluctance, and at times even eagerly. <em>See United States v. Salerno, </em>66 F.3d 544, 547 (2d Cir.1995) (noting that predisposition can be shown by evidence of \u201ca willingness to commit the crime for which [the defendant] is charged as evidenced by the accused\u2019s ready response to the inducement\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, the district court found that because Martinez testified, the jury was able to determine whether it found his sleep disorder/intimidation defense credible. We do not find the district court\u2019s findings on these points to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Second, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that the evidence of Saladino\u2019s perjury would have been cumulative and hence immaterial given the extensive impeachment of Saladino\u2019s character on cross-examination. As we have repeatedly held, \u201cnew impeachment evidence is <em>not </em>material, and thus a new trial is <em>not </em>required when the suppressed impeachment evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to impeach a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable.\u201d <em>United States v. Wong, </em>78 F.3d 73, 79 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation omitted, emphasis in original). In addition to the long list of Saladino\u2019s past and even possibly present violent crimes, the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Saladino also brought home to the jury his capacity to manipulate and willingness to obstruct justice. Two such instances were Saladino\u2019s attempt to suborn his girlfriend\u2019s perjury and his causing his mother to throw a gun into the ocean. The district court did not err in concluding that, given the effectiveness of the defense\u2019s assault on Saladino\u2019s credibility, the evidence of his perjury would have furnished but \u201can additional basis\u201d of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
