The facts relevant to Mendez\u2019s appeal are set forth in a prior summary order, <em>United States v. Kyranious, </em>No. 98-1414 (2d Cir. Nov. 3, 1999), in which we remanded for supplementation <em>of the </em>record. Specifically, upon concluding that the district court erred in calculating Mendez\u2019s guideline range to be 41 to 51 months rather than 37 to 46 months, we asked the district court to say whether, based on the correct guideline range, any different sentence would have been imposed on Mendez. <em>Id. </em>at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">We have now received a transcript of the hearing conducted before the district court following that limited remand. The district judge determined that, notwithstanding a different guideline range \u2014 37 to 46 months \u2014 he would still sentence Mendez to a term of 41 months in prison. Given this determination, and in light of our prior analysis we conclude that the error in the calculation of Mendez\u2019s guideline range did not \u201caffect[ ] defendant\u2019s-substantial rights resulting in a manifest injustice,\u201d for Mendez would have received the same sentence in the absence of error. <em>United States v. Keppler, </em>2 F.3d 21, 24 (2d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Arigbodi </em>924 F.2d 462, 464 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">For the reasons set forth above, the sentence imposed in the judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
