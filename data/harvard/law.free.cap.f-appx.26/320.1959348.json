We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief on the federal claims on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Wimberley v. City of Wilson, </em>No. CA-01-451-5-BO(2) (E.D.N.C. Aug. 17, 2001). Because the district court properly denied Wimberley\u2019s federal claims, we find that the court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over his pendent state law claims. <em>Davis v. Pak, </em>856 F.2d 648, 650-52 (4th Cir.1988). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
