Harmon also seeks to appeal his criminal conviction entered on his guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and a related conspiracy charge. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1994); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1994). In his motion to reinstate his appellate rights, Harmon alleged that despite the fact that he instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal, no such notice was filed. <em>See United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). Harmon\u2019s direct criminal appeal is pending as a result of Harmon\u2019s pro se filing of a document construed as a notice of appeal nearly eleven months after entry of the district court\u2019s judgment in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of Harmon\u2019s motion to reinstate his appellate rights, the district court held an evidentiary hearing to resolve the factual issues surrounding Harmon\u2019s post-judgment instructions to his attorney and found that Harmon and his attorney agreed that an appeal would not be filed. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>94 F.3d 136, 140 (4th Cir.1996) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>52(a)). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Harmon, </em>No. CR-99-23 (E.D.Va. Apr. 25, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Turning to Harmon\u2019s direct criminal appeal, on the finding of the district court that Harmon did not instruct his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal, we are constrained to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Harmon\u2019s pro se notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Parties to a criminal proceeding are accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on August 9, 1999. Harmon\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on June 30, 2000. Because Harmon failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
