R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b922-17\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b922-18\">PAUL KELLY, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">Mr. Aguirre, a federal inmate appearing pro se, seeks to appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence by a person in federal custody. Because Mr. Aguirre has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his application for a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and dismiss the appeal. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-20\">Mr. Aguirre is presently serving a 360-month federal sentence (New Mexico federal sentence) on various drug charges. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>108 F.3d 1228, 1232-33 (10th Cir.1997) (affirming on direct appeal). He contends that he should receive credit based upon a previously imposed federal sentence (Kansas federal sentence) for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and a telephone count, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a), 843(b). <em>See United States v. Armendariz, </em>922 F.2d 602, 605 (10th Cir.1990) (affirming on direct appeal). Mr. Aguirre was sentenced to 48 months and two years supervised release on the Kansas conviction. He served the 48 months, but it appears that he may not have completed the two years of supervised release. Mr. Aguirre characterizes his issue on appeal as whether the maximum statutory sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>statutory maximum under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Aplt. Br. (A-15) at 3, 7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Even assuming that Mr. Aguirre was in custody on the Kansas federal sentence because it was not completed, see <em>Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 45-46, 115 S.Ct. 1948, 132 L.Ed.2d 36 (1995), Mr. Aguirre has no <em>Apprendi </em>claim for at least two reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive on collateral review under <em>Teague v. Lane. </em>489 U.S. 288, 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>254 F.3d 1180, 1193 n. 7 (10th Cir.2001) (en banc) (in the context of second and successive petitions under \u00a7 2255 para. 8, reserving issue of whether <em>Apprendi </em>meets the second <em>Teague </em>exception); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1256-58 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(Apprendi </em>not retroactive on collateral review; initial \u00a7 2255 motion); <em>Jarrett v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 789, 791 (8th Cir.2001) (same); <em>Dukes v. United States, </em>255 F.3d 912, 913-14 (8th Cir.2001) (same); <em>United States v. Moss, </em>252 F.3d 993, 997-1000 (8th Cir. 2001) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 848, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, 2002 WL 13705 (Jan. 7, 2002); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 146-51 (4th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 573, \u2014 L.Ed.2d\u2014(2001); <em>Jones v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1227, 1236-1238 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(Apprendi </em>not retroactive on collateral review; initial \u00a7 2254 petition). Second, Mr. Aguirre\u2019s sentence of 48 months and two years supervised release is within the statutory range for unspecified quantities of marijuana, i.e. 5 years and two years of supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D); <em>United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215, 1220 (10th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Keeling, </em>235 F.3d 533, 537 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2575, 150 L.Ed.2d 738 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b922-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">. The government does not argue on appeal that any <em>Apprendi </em>claim would be procedurally barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
