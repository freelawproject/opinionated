James SAFFLE, Director, Oklahoma Department of Corrections, Respondent-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b935-15\">No. 01-6297.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b935-16\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b935-17\">Feb. 8, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b935-18\">Before TACHA, Chief Judge, EBEL, and LUCERO, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b935-20\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b935-21\">TACHA, Chief Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not- be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">Petitioner Hunnicutt seeks to appeal <em>pro se </em>from an order of the district court dismissing his appeal as time barred pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">Petitioner seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to pursue his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Determining that Mr. Hunnicutt has not met the statutory requirements, we deny his application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Hunnicutt must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, 529 </em>U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-26\">We may grant habeas relief only if the state court entered a judgment that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-27\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">After a review of the record and the docket sheet demonstrating the filings and deadlines applicable to petitioner\u2019s case, we conclude that the issue of whether petitioner timely filed his action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is not one about which reasonable jurists could debate whether the petition should have been resolved in a different manner. For this reason, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. Petitioner has moved to proceed <em>in forma pawperis. </em>That motion is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
