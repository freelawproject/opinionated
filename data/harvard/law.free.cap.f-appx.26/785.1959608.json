R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Breavess McBride was convicted after a jury trial of five counts of sexual abuse in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242(1), five counts of abusive sexual contact in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2244(a)(2), and one count of sexual abuse of an inmate in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2243(b). Each of the aforementioned crimes includes as an element that the act of sexual abuse or contact occurred \u201cin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in- a Federal prison.\u201d McBride appeals his convictions, contending that this element, which he argues is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The evidence showed, and McBride does not dispute, that he was a correctional counselor at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City and that the incidents forming the basis of the charges occurred there. The jury was properly instructed, with regard to each crime, that the government had to prove that the defendant\u2019s actions took place in a federal prison. The jury was further instructed, with regard to each crime, that \u201cthe parties agree that the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma is a federal prison in the Western District of Oklahoma,\u201d R., Vol. I, doc. 36, instr. 10, 14, 18, and that it therefore need not concern itself with that element. McBride does not challenge the voluntary and knowing nature of this stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">On appeal, McBride\u2019s sole contention is that the Federal Transfer Center is not a \u201cfederal prison\u201d within the meaning of the statutes under which he was convicted. His previous concession of this element poses obvious problems for his argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wittgenstein, </em>163 F.3d 1164, 1169 (10th Cir.1998) (stating right to jury trial concerning every element of offense, including right to proper instruction as to that element, is waived when defendant stipulates that the element has been satisfied). McBride argues, however, that the requirement that the offenses occurred in a federal prison is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and that he may therefore raise it as a basis for appeal even though he previously conceded it in the district court. <em>See generally United States v. Burch, </em>169 F.3d 666, 668 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cChallenges to a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">McBride misconceives the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d nature of this element. A federal court\u2019s jurisdictional power to adjudicate federal criminal cases comes from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, not from the individual criminal statute under which a defendant is convicted. <em>Hugi v. United States, </em>164 F.3d 378, 380 (7th Cir.1999). The individual elements of a crime are not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in the sense that they affect a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Prentiss, </em>256 F.3d 971, 982 (10th Cir.2001). For this reason, a defendant may concede essential elements, including those that make a crime \u201cfederal,\u201d without running afoul of jurisdictional principles. <em>See Hugi, </em>164 F.3d at 380-81. Under general principles noted above, such a concession waives an appellate challenge to the existence of the element whose existence has been stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Through his stipulation, McBride has waived any appellate challenge to sufficiency of the evidence, correctness of the jury instruction, or federal \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to prosecute him arising from the issue of whether the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City is a \u201cfederal prison.\u201d The judgment of the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
