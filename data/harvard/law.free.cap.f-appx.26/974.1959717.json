Curtis appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, No. DA0752000600-I-1, 2001 WL 455856 (April 16, 2001), which became final on April 16, 2001, and dismissed his appeal with prejudice for failure to prosecute. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-32\">We must affirm the decision of the board unless we find that it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1994). Such a finding is not warranted here. An administrative judge has authority under the board\u2019s regulations to dismiss an appeal for failure to prosecute. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.43(b) (2001). We have held that a dismissal may result from an appellant\u2019s repeated failure to respond to board orders. <em>See Ahlberg v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>804 F.2d 1238, 1242-43 (Fed.Cir.1986). Moreover, sanctions are within the discretion of the board and will not be reversed unless there is a clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>harmful abuse of discretion. <em>See Baker v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>912 F.2d 1448, 1457 (Fed.Cir.1990) (citing <em>Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Curtis repeatedly ignored the administrative judge\u2019s orders, all of which warned that failure to comply could result in dismissal of his appeal. He has provided no explanation for not contacting the board in response to its orders and has provided no justification for his repeated lack of compliance. Curtis offers that he was unable to participate in a conference call, but did not provide any explanation as to why he did not call to reschedule. The board\u2019s decision to dismiss Curtis\u2019s appeal with prejudice for failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
