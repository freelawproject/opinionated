Barritt filed a document titled Motion for Discharge for Failure to Process on June 4, 2001, and the district court referred this motion to a magistrate judge the day it was received. Because there has been no undue delay in acting on Barritt\u2019s habeas petition, mandamus relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>is not warranted. Accordingly, we deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We further deny Barritt\u2019s related motions for en banc consideration, a hearing, to admit evidence, for designation of record, and for reconsideration of the assessment of a filing fee under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 (West Supp.2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
