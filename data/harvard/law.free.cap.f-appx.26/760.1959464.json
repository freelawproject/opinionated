Pierre Y., </em>No. 00-30411, 2002 WL 187420 (cite forthcoming). We also reject C.P.\u2019s contention that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032\u2019s exclusion of Indian tribes from the certification process violates equal protection. <em>Id. </em>(relying on <em>United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>864 F.2d 641, 646 (9th Cir. 1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-19\">Our decision in <em>Pierre Y. </em>additionally forecloses several other of C.P.\u2019s claims, including his arguments that 1) his adjudication of juvenile delinquency violates due process because ambiguity exists as to the prescribed penalty; 2) the district court erred in applying the procedures set forth in the FJDA, rather than state juvenile delinquency law, to adjudicate C.P.\u2019s case; and 3) the district court improperly denied C.P.\u2019s request for a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-20\">Finally, C.P. claims that his adjudication of juvenile delinquency for committing burglary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 violates equal protection. We find this argument to be without merit. <em>See United States v. Yazzie, </em>693 F.2d 102, 104 (9th Cir.1982) (holding \u201cit was rational for Congress to provide that [burglary] under the Major Crimes Act was to be defined and punished as provided by state law, in order to ensure that Indians and non-Indians who commit identical acts in the same location would be subject to identical punishments.\u201d). C.P. cannot dispute that all persons subject to federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b) are subject to similar treatment. Nor has he met his burden \u201cto negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 964, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
