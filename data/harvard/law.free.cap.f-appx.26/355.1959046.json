Wade\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the possibility that the plea was invalid and that the sentence was improper. Wade was informed of his right to file a pro se brief, but he has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Wade\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We find that Wade\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Wade was properly advised as to his rights, the offense charged, and the maximum sentence for the offense. The court also determined that there was an .independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">We find that the district court properly computed Wade\u2019s offense level and criminal history category and correctly determined the applicable guideline range of seventy to eighty-seven months. The court\u2019s imposition of a sentence within the properly calculated range is not reviewable. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wade\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court \u201cfor leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
