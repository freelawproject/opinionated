(\u201cColt\u201d). We find no error in the district court\u2019s claim construction, and find that under this construction there is no dispute of fact that Colt\u2019s accused products do not literally infringe. We also find that prosecution history estoppel precludes a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b997-18\">This appeal arises from Saeilo\u2019s infringement suit against Colt\u2019s Manufacturing, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,415,075 (\u201cthe \u2019075 patent\u201d), directed to improvements in compact semiautomatic firearms. The \u2019075 patent covers a design for a low-profile semiautomatic handgun. As the district court ably explains, semiautomatic firearms rely on the explosive force of the ammunition to eject a spent round and insert a new round into the gun breech. In the design employed by Saeilo and the accused products, the rear of the barrel moves downward as it recoils backward, tilting the entire barrel to break the breech seal and receive a new round. The rearward motion of the barrel upon recoil is directed downwards by means of a \u201ccam,\u2019\u2019 which is a general term for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>element that interconverts linear and rotary motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">In the embodiment depicted in the <em>\u2019075 </em>patent, the cam is formed by two lugs protruding downward from the rear of the barrel, which form a cam surface into which a camming pin fits. When the barrel recoils backwards after firing, the relative movement of the cam surface against the camming pin forces the rear of the barrel to move downward relative to the camming pin. This downward movement of the barrel provides the tilt of the barrel necessary for the semiautomatic mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Since the camming pin defines the axis around which the barrel moves, to provide for the proper rotation of the barrel, the camming pin (and hence the cam lugs) must be set some distance below the barrel. However, when the breech moves downwards after firing, the cam lugs also move downwards. To ensure that the cam lugs do not interfere with the trigger assembly in the recoiled position, the design of the \u2019075 patent provides cam lugs that are laterally displaced from the bore axis. If the trigger bar is set on one side of the gun and the cam lug on the other, there will be enough space for the cam lug and the trigger bar to overlap without interfering with each other. This design permits the cam lugs and trigger assembly to be placed in close proximity to each other, thereby allowing the barrel to be set close to the trigger and providing a low-profile, easily concealable firearm. In the embodiment depicted in the \u2019075 patent, the cam lug is uniform in cross-section and is displaced to one side of the bore axis along its entire length.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Colt\u2019s accused design is similar in principle. However, instead of a symmetrical cam lug placed off-center from the bore axis, Colt\u2019s design features a cam lug centered on the bore axis. Rather than offset the entire lug, Colt removes material from one side of the lug to provide clearance for the trigger assembly. Thus, in Colt\u2019s design, the cam lug varies in cross-section along its length, and is centered on the bore axis \u2014 at least in those portions of the lug that do not overlap with the trigger assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The only claim limitations at issue in this appeal appear in claim 1, which recites \u201csaid cam lug being laterally offset relative to the axis of said bore,\u201d and claim 9, which specifies that the \u201clug has a central axis parallel to and laterally offset relative to the axis of said bore.\u201d Claims 1 and 9 are the only independent claims of \u2019075, and, treating the limitations of claim 1 and claim 9 as similar, the parties have focused their dispute on whether Colt\u2019s cam lug meets the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Saeilo and Colt made cross-motions for summary judgment, each side submitting to the district court its proposed interpretation of the disputed claim language. Saeilo proposed a construction of \u201claterally offset\u201d meaning \u201chaving a cross-section in the region where the trigger will pass by the lug the central axis of which is off-set laterally from the central axis of the bore.\u201d Essentially, Saeilo proposed that a cam lug will meet this limitation if the lug is \u201claterally offset\u201d from the bore axis at <em>any </em>point where the trigger assembly will pass by. The district court, however, preferred Colt\u2019s view of the plain language of the claim, and interpreted the limitation to require that the cam lug be laterally offset from the bore axis along the entire length of the lug. While the district court viewed the prosecution history as uninformative, the court found support for its interpretation from the fact that the \u2019075 drawings depict a cam lug laterally offset from the bore axis along its entire length.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Since Colt\u2019s accused products do not feature a cam lug that is laterally offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>from the bore axis along its entire length, the district court concluded that the accused designs could not meet the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation of claims 1 or 9. Accordingly, the district court found that Saeilo had failed to create an issue of material fact on the question of whether the accused products could literally infringe claims 1 and 9, and granted summary judgment of noninfringement to Colt. Furthermore, the district court held that Colt\u2019s structure could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents, since such a finding would obviate the requirement that the cam lug be laterally offset along its entire length. The district court also concluded that Saeilo had surrendered structures analogous to the Colt lug when it amended its claims to overcome an anticipation rejection dining prosecution of \u2019075. The district court therefore also held that prosecution history estoppel barred Saeilo from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, and granted summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents to Colt. Saeilo asks that this court reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and, at the least, remand the case for trial of infringement. We exercise jurisdiction over Saeilo\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\u201cWhen a district court <em>grants </em>summary judgment, we review without deference to the trial court whether there are disputed material facts, and we review independently whether the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>SunTiger, Inc. v. Scientific Research Funding Group, </em>189 F.3d 1327, 1333, 51 USPQ2d 1811, 1814 (Fed.Cir. 1999). Infringement is determined by a two-step inquiry: claim construction and comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused matter. <em>Bai v. L &amp; L Wings, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1350, 1353, 48 USPQ2d 1674, 1676 (Fed.Cir.1998). A district court\u2019s claim construction is an issue of law, reviewed <em>de novo. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456, 46 USPQ2d 1169, 1174 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). Although whether the properly construed claims encompass the accused device, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, is a question of fact, summary judgment of noninfringement is proper when no reasonable jury could find that every limitation of the properly construed claim is present in the accused device. <em>Bai, </em>160 F.3d at 1353-54, 48 USPQ2d at 1676-77. Moreover, whether infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is barred by prosecution history estoppel is a question of law, reviewed <em>de novo. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki, </em>234 F.3d 558, 585, 56 USPQ2d 1865, 1885 (Fed.Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">To construe the meaning of the disputed limitation, the court looks first to the words of the claims themselves. <em>Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1576, 1582, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1576 (Fed. Cir.1996). The district court correctly began with the plain words of the claim and recognized that the dispute centers around how \u201claterally offset\u201d should be applied to \u201clug.\u201d The claim language requires that the lateral offset of the cam lug be gauged relative to the axis of the bore. The district court reasoned that since' the lateral offset is defined relative to the bore axis, and since the bore axis runs the entire length of the bore, the lateral offset must extend for the entire length of the lug.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">While one might find fault with the district court\u2019s syllogism, we agree with its conclusion. As the district court appreci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>ated, this dispute boils down to whether \u201claterally offset\u201d must refer to the entire lug, or only to a portion of the lug. The claim language requires only that the \u201clug\u201d be laterally offset from the bore axis. Between \u201cthe entire lug\u201d and \u201ca portion of the lug,\u201d we think the former is the more natural reading of the plain term \u201clug.\u201d When language is used precisely and naturally, a piece or portion of a lug is not a \u201clug.\u201d Moreover, we note that the drafter of Saeilo\u2019s claims knew how to couch elements in the appropriate language when he or she contemplated that the claim language should be so interpreted. When describing how the trigger assembly passes by the offset lug in the unlocked position, claims 1, 3, and 9 refer to \u201ca portion\u201d or \u201cportions\u201d of the trigger and trigger bar. The fact that no such proviso appears with respect to the cam lug suggests that \u201clug\u201d should be given its most natural meaning \u2014 a lug in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Having considered the plain meaning of the claim language itself, the district court next looked to the specification to determine whether the inventor had used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary meaning. The specification refers the reader to Figure 2 of the drawings for a demonstration of the lateral offset. As conceded by Saeilo at oral argument, Figure 2 \u2014 like all other figures in the patent \u2014 shows only a lug of uniform cross-section that is laterally offset from the bore axis along its entire length. Although Saeilo objects that construing \u201claterally offset\u201d by reference to the preferred embodiment would import a limitation from the specification into the claims, the specification provides no support at all for Saeilo\u2019s proposed definition. Neither the specification nor the prosecution history makes any reference to the cross-section of the lug, to any means of calculating the central axis of the lug, or to a region of the lug where the trigger will pass by the lug. Moreover, Saeilo\u2019s proposed definition requires that the cam lug have more than one central axis, and neither the specification nor the prosecution history makes reference to more than one central axis. Since the specification provides no support for Saeilo\u2019s proposed definition, we think the district court did not err by referring to the embodiments disclosed in the specification to reinforce its construction of the disputed claim language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Saeilo, seizing on the district court\u2019s use of \u201cnotch\u201d to describe Colt\u2019s design, relies heavily on a single passage in the specification reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-7\">The lateral offset of the barrel cam lug 28 provides a space or notch 37 between an associated one of the inner surfaces 29 and an opposing face 39 on the barrel cam lug 28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">\u2019075 patent, col. 3 II. 5-9. Like the district court, we find little support for Saeilo\u2019s proposed definition in this language. At the outset, we are not inclined to accord much weight to the use of the term \u201cnotch,\u201d since we have no indication what \u201cnotch\u201d means. Simply because the parties and the court have used the nondescript term \u201cnotch\u201d to describe Colt\u2019s design does not mean that \u201cnotch\u201d as used in the \u2019075 specification bears any relation to the accused device.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">In any event, this language does not literally describe a notch <em>in </em>the lug itself or equate the lateral offset to a notch; rather, this passage says only that the face of the lug and the inner surface of the receiver define a space or notch. The simplest interpretation of this language is simply that \u201cnotch\u201d refers to the space bounded by the offset lug and the receiver housing, as shown in Figure 2 of \u2019075. Such a \u201cnotch\u201d may be formed simply by the apposition of the cam lug and the receiver housing, without removing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>material from the lug itself. In other words, this language suggests only that a space or notch may be created by the spatial relationship of the lug and receiver elements, but not by any peculiarity or variation in their cross-section. Thus, one need not interpret the use of \u201cnotch\u201d in the patent text as corresponding to the \u201cnotch\u201d in Colt\u2019s design, which could be defined as a \u201cnotch\u201d without reference to the receiver housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Moreover, the language pointed to by Saeilo was absent from \u2019075 as originally filed. As originally written, the specification did not include the language quoted above. Instead, the specification described the novel feature of the invention in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGB\">the cam 28 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 particularly, is staggered, with notch 30 defined in the location shown in the drawings as a cut in the camming lugs of the barrel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">But the \u201cnotch\u201d in this passage is not the space that allows for the trigger assembly to pass, and is not a \u201cnotch\u201d in the sense used by Judge Duffy to describe Colt\u2019s lug design. As clearly shown in the original Figure 3, \u201cnotch\u201d in the application as filed ref\u00e9rred to the space between the cam lugs into which the camming pin fits when the barrel recoils \u2014 that is, the operative cam surface. In the application as originally filed, the term \u201cnotch\u201d did not relate to the lateral offset of the cam lug. As recognized by Saeilo\u2019s patent attorney during prosecution, the amendments to the specification could not have introduced new matter beyond that already found in the specification and claims as filed. Thus, we cannot view the new language \u201cspace or notch\u201d as suggesting any structure not already inherent in the application as originally filed. We conclude that the \u2019075 specification does not support Saeilo\u2019s proposed claim construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Also like the district court, we find the amendments in response to the initial rejection by the PTO are of little relevance to determining the literal scope of the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation. Colt argues at some length that Saeilo disclaimed coverage of Colt\u2019s \u201cnotch\u201d design when Saeilo substituted a new claim lacking the term \u201cnotch\u201d for its original claim, and when Saeilo traversed a section 102(b) rejection over the Roy reference (U.S. Patent No. 3,756,120). As we explain above, the fact that Saeilo replaced an original claim containing the word \u201cnotch\u201d with an amended claim lacking the word \u201cnotch\u201d is not relevant, since the term \u201cnotch\u201d in the original application had no relation to the lateral offset at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">Neither did Saeilo\u2019s traversal of the Roy reference explicitly surrender any subject matter. In the Roy design, the cam lug is positioned well forward of the trigger assembly, even when the barrel is fully recoiled. Roy provides a cut-out in the barrel itself \u2014 not a cut-out in the cam lug \u2014 -to provide space for the trigger and trigger bar when the barrel recoils backwards. Since, in Roy\u2019s design, the trigger and trigger bar are always positioned behind the lug, overlap between the trigger assembly and the cam lug is not an issue. This much was recognized by Saeilo\u2019s patent attorney, who argued that \u201cthe problem solved by applicant\u2019s claimed structure does not exist in the Roy structure.\u201d Consequently, Saeilo\u2019s traversal of the rejection over Roy cannot be said to have disclaimed any elements of Colt\u2019s design. Since the prosecution history provides no insight to how the term \u201claterally offset\u201d ought to be construed, the district court properly limited its analysis to the claim language and the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Thus, considering first the plain language of the claim, and second, the \u2019075 specification, we arrive at the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>sion reached by the district court. Namely, that \u201claterally offset\u201d as used in claims 1 and 9 imposes a limitation on the entire cam lug, and not on merely a portion of the lug. We are not persuaded by Saeilo\u2019s argument that such a construction is improper because it allows Colt to escape infringement by adding \u201cextra metal\u201d to a lug that is otherwise infringing. The \u201cextra metal\u201d of Colt\u2019s lug is an integral part of the lug design, not an extraneous addition. Moreover, even under Saeilo\u2019s proposed definition, one could avoid infringement by adding or removing metal from other regions of the lug such that the central axis of a cross-section, however that might be defined, would not be laterally offset from the bore axis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Employing this proper claim construction, the district court concluded that no dispute of material fact existed as to whether Colt\u2019s design met the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation of claims 1 and 9. Saeilo has not attempted to argue that, given this claim construction, a finding of literal infringement was possible. Nonetheless, our independent review convinces us that there is no genuine dispute as to whether the accused products meet the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation of claims 1 and 9. Since the burden rested with Saeilo to prove that the accused devices meet each and every limitation of the \u2019075 claims, the district court correctly denied Saeilo\u2019s motion for summary judgment of literal infringement, and correctly granted Colt\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the \u2019075 claims were not literally infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The district court held, as a matter of law, that Saeilo could not establish infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. The district court based its grant of summary judgment on two grounds. First, since the district court had construed claims 1 and 9 to require the cam lug to be laterally offset for the entire length of the lug, the court thought that considering the \u201cnotch\u201d in Colt\u2019s design to be an equivalent would read an express limitation out of the claims. Second, since the court thought that Saeilo had amended its claims to remove the word \u201cnotch,\u201d the court concluded that prosecution history estoppel precluded Saeilo from reclaiming the \u201cnotch\u201d of Colt\u2019s design by resorting to the doctrine of equivalents. Because we hold that prosecution history estoppel bars Saeilo from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, we need not address whether a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would read an express limitation out of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">We do disagree with the district court that Saeilo expressly disclaimed Colt\u2019s lug design by amending its claim to remove the word \u201cnotch\u201d or by traversing the anticipation rejection over Roy. As noted above, the \u201cnotch\u201d in original claim 1 referred to the space for the camming pin, not the space for the trigger assembly. Thus, the mere removal of the word \u201cnotch\u201d did not narrow the cam lug element, but merely described the lug as \u201ca depending cam lug defining a cam surface\u201d instead of \u201ccam lugs for providing rotation of said barrel, said lugs defining a notch.\u201d There is essentially no difference between the scope of these limitations, and the amendment did not explicitly surrender any claim scope reading on the Colt structure. Concerning the rejection over Roy, we have already noted that the prosecution history shows that the patentee traversed the rejection over Roy by arguing that the overlap problem addressed by the Saeilo and Colt lugs did not arise in Roy\u2019s design. Even if we were to assume that the claim amendments were at least in part made to avoid the Roy reference, Roy does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>disclose any structure similar to Colt\u2019s cam lug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Nonetheless, even if the patentee did not limit its claims to avoid the Roy reference, Saeilo is precluded from asserting any equivalents to the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation because that limitation was added by way of an amendment that narrowed the scope of the claim. The prosecution history clearly shows that the patentee amended its claim to overcome an indefiniteness rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, 2nd paragraph. The original claim 1 recited \u201ca structure which eliminates potential interference between the trigger bar and the barrel and provides a compact handgun, comprising cam lugs for providing rotation of said barrel, said lugs defining a notch.\u201d As we have described, the \u201cnotch\u201d in original claim 1 could only have referred to the element designated as the cam surface in the issued patent. Original claim 1 therefore set no structural limitations on the cam lugs, other than that they defined a cam surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The examiner rejected original claim 1 as \u201cvague and functional\u201d under section 112, 2nd paragraph, because \u201cthis claim merely lists problems for structural solution, rather tha[n] the arrangement, configuration and/or positioning of the various elements to solve the problems.\u201d In response, the applicant submitted new claims 4 and 12 (issued claims 1 and 9), which recited much more specific details of structure. These amendments added the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Where an amendment narrows the scope of a claim for a reason related to the statutory requirements for patentability, prosecution history estoppel acts as a complete bar to the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the amended claim element. <em>Festo, </em>234 F.3d at 568-69, 56 USPQ2d at 1871-72. Under <em>Festo, </em>amendments made to overcome rejections under section 112, 2nd paragraph give rise to prosecution history estoppel if they narrow the scope of the claim. <em>See Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Ranbaxy Pharms., Inc., </em>262 F.3d 1333, 1338, 59 USPQ2d 1950, 1954 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">There may be cases in which an original claim i\u00a7 so indefinite that it will be difficult to tell whether a claim amendment has \u201cnarrowed\u201d a particular element common to the original and amended claims. Such is not the case here, however. This case is indistinguishable from <em>Festo, </em>in which a limitation requiring \u201ca cylindrical sleeve made of a magnetizable material\u201d was added by amendment to overcome a rejection under section 112, 1st paragraph. Prosecution history estoppel barred the patentee from asserting equivalents to the magnetizable sleeve. <em>Festo, </em>234 F.3d at 588, 56 USPQ2d at 1888. Here, the limitation that the cam lug be \u201claterally offset relative to the axis of said bore\u201d was added by amendment in response to a rejection under section 112, 2nd paragraph. Since the original claim placed no such limitations on the cam lug, adding the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation narrowed the scope of the claim. Prosecution history estoppel bars Saeilo from asserting any equivalents to the \u201claterally offset\u201d limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we agree with the district court that, once properly construed, claims 1 and 9 could not read on Colt\u2019s accused devices, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
