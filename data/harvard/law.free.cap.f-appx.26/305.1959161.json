The court dismissed Perry\u2019s complaint based on his failure to comply with its orders directing him to submit proof that he had exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-21\">Because Perry may proceed with this action by amending his complaint to provide the information requested by the district court, the dismissal order is not final and thus is not subject to appellate review. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
