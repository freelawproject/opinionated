We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">McCoy first contends that the district court erred in its determination that his California conviction for grand theft from a person was a crime of violence, thus mandating application of the career offender provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that defendant is a career offender. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>183 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1174, 120 S.Ct. 1204, 145 L.Ed.2d 1107 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">We ruled in <em>United States v. Wofford, </em>122 F.3d 787, 793-94 (9th Cir.1997), that \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) included a California conviction for grand theft from a person, because the crime by definition presented \u201ca serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>McCoy contends that the career offender sentencing guideline requires a different analysis, one which focuses on the defendant\u2019s actual charged conduct. We have previously rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Young, </em>990 F.2d 469, 471-72 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that if a prior conviction is a crime of violence based on statutory elements, then career offender sentence enhancement allowed regardless of actual charged conduct of the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">Under the categorical approach, McCoy\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence. <em>See Wofford, </em>122 F.3d at 793-94. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the career offender provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">McCoy next contends that the district court should have awarded him a three-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for his crime. <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>15 F.3d 849, 852 (9th Cir.1994). Such determination is entitled to \u201cgreat deference on review.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1 .1 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">McCoy maintains that he only went to trial to preserve his right to appeal whether the <em>Wofford </em>ruling controlled the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. However, McCoy did not need to go to trial to preserve his right to appeal his career offender determination. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>could have pleaded guilty and then challenged the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Regardless of his reasons for going to trial, McCoy still bears the burden of showing how he evidenced an acceptance of responsibility for his actions. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan, </em>265 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.2001). Nothing in the record suggests that McCoy is contrite or remorseful, nor does McCoy\u2019s pre-trial conduct evidence any acceptance of responsibility for his actions. <em>See id. </em>at 842-43 (stating that while a district court cannot deny an acceptance of responsibility reduction <em>because </em>a defendant chooses to exercise his constitutional right to proceed to trial, the court may deny the reduction because of a lack of contrition).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Because McCoy has not clearly demonstrated that he was worthy of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1435-36 (9th Cir.1994) (affirming a denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility after finding \u201cno affirmative evidence of contrition in the record\u201d even though the defendant did not contest that he committed the offense, and went to trial only to present an entrapment defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b769-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">.
