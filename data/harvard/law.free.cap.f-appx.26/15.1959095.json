He appeals the District Court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines; specifically, its enhancement of his sentence based on the finding that his prior conviction in 1993 for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (a conviction under Maine\u2019s misdemeanor assault statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 207), had disqualified him from possessing a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (1994). For the reasons that follow, his sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In sentencing Swain, the district court settled on a base offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) because the offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a), and Swain was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d because his prior Maine assault conviction was a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) and 922(g)(9). After a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Swain was sentenced to twenty-seven months, the minimum of his guideline range, and appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Maine statute under which Swain was previously convicted defines misdemeanor assault as \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another.\u201d Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 207. The federal statute requires that, in order for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to be a sufficient predicate to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm, it must have \u201cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Swain\u2019s appeal was heard as part of a consolidated set of appeals challenging whether or not Maine\u2019s misdemeanor assault statute, tit. 17-A, \u00a7 207, is a sufficient predicate misdemeanor to sustain a conviction, and therefore an indictment, under the federal statute making it a crime for a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (1994). In our Opinion in <em>United States v. Nason, </em>269 F.3d 10 (1st Cir.2001) [No. 01-1440], we held that \u201call convictions under Maine\u2019s general-purpose assault statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 207(1), necessarily involve, as a formal element, the use of physical force.\u201d Therefore, by pleading guilty to an assault against his wife under the Maine assault statute, Swain necessarily pled guilty to a crime with an element of physical force as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (a)(33)(A)(ii). As a result, the district court was correct to find that Swain was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) when it sentenced him for illegal possession of an unregistered short-barreled rifle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">. It is noted that the trial court acted properly in making determinations of fact under the preponderance of the evidence standard at sentencing in rejecting the testimony of the defendant and relying on the certified police report from the prior state court proceedings to find that domestic violence resulting in physical injury to the defendant\u2019s wife was actually involved. <em>See United States v. Shepard, </em>231 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.2000). Clearly, our decision in <em>Nason, supra, </em>would negate any such testimony as prior state convictions may not be attacked collaterally during a federal sentencing hearing. <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 497, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
