Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">Intervenor-Appellant Jeff Price, the former attorney for Plaintiff Joyce Lynn Allen, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Price was Allen\u2019s attorney during the original trial of her \u00a7 1983 claims, but Price withdrew after a jury verdict for the defendants. Allen appealed pro se. This court concluded that she had been arrested without probable cause as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On remand, Allen retained new counsel and successfully sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Price filed notices of claim of a statutory attorney\u2019s lien and a contractual lien against any judgment or settlement for Allen, moved to intervene, and moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The district court awarded fees to Allen\u2019s new attorneys but not to Price, concluding that he had no standing under \u00a7 1988. Price appealed this ruling, and we affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">Allen and the defendants eventually settled, and the district court entered a judgment disbursing the settlement money to Allen and her new counsel, but denying Price any portion of the judgment. Price moved to have the judgment amended, arguing that the district court disposed of his statutory and contractual lien claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>without affording him an opportunity for a hearing, in violation of due process. The district court denied Price\u2019s motion after concluding that, under the law of the case, he lacked standing for any award of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court also concluded that Price\u2019s motion was not filed within ten days of the entry of judgment as required by Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The district court erred in denying Price\u2019s motion. First, Price\u2019s motion was timely. Rule 6(a) of the Federal rules of Civil Procedure provides that weekends do not count when computing time periods of less than eleven days,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Price filed his motion nine days after the entry of judgment if weekend days are disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Second, Price\u2019s lack of standing under \u00a7 1988 does not control his statutory and contractual lien claims. Price\u2019s hen claims arose from a private contingent fee agreement between Allen and Price, and \u00a7 1988 \u201cdoes not interfere with the enforceability of a contingent-fee contract.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Price\u2019s lack of standing under \u00a7 1988 did not mean that he also lacked standing to pursue his hen claims. Accordingly, the district court should have reached the merits of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The district court\u2019s order denying Price\u2019s motion to amend the judgment is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court to rule on the merits of Price\u2019s statutory and contractual hen claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-17\">. <em>Allen v.
