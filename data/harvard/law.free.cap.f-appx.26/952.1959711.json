The decision upheld the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) that Abasta had not established entitlement to a retirement annuity benefit under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Abasta seeks a retirement annuity based on his civilian federal service as a carpenter with the Department of the Navy, Public Works Center at Subic Bay, Philippines. Abasta served under a series of temporary appointments from October 8, 1975, through September 28, 1988. On September 29, 1988, his appointment was converted to an \u201cexcepted appointment,\u201d under Civil Service Rule 8.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Abasta served under this appointment continuously until September 30, 1992, when he resigned in lieu of involuntary separation by reduction in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">On February 8, 1999, Abasta applied for a retirement annuity benefit under the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d). After his application was initially denied by OPM, Abasta sought reconsideration, claiming his \u201cexcepted appointment\u201d was not properly excluded from coverage under the CSRS because the appointment was not qualified with the designation \u201cindefinite.\u201d OPM affirmed its initial decision because, although Abasia\u2019s temporary appointment was converted to an excepted appointment on September 29, 1988, without a limitation or designation of \u201cindefinite,\u201d all of the official personnel action forms evidencing his federal service show that he held a position that was not covered under the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Abasta appealed OPM\u2019s decision to the Board. On June 19, 2000, in an initial decision, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) affirmed OPM\u2019s denial of an annuity under CSRA. The Board noted that, although Abasta\u2019s September 1988 excepted appointment does not contain the designation \u201cindefinite,\u201d \u201cthis appears to be a clerical error.\u201d <em>Abasta v. OPM, </em>SE0831000141I1 at *4 (Initial Decision, June 19, 2000.) To support this finding, the AJ explained that all of the other indications on the official personnel appointment were indicative of an appointment that is not covered by the CSRS. <em>Id. </em>In particular, Box 8 on the Personnel Action Form (\u201cSF-50\u201d), which covers \u201cretirement,\u201d contained the number 5, which means \u201cother,\u201d <em>ie., </em>no federal retirement annuity. <em>Id. </em>at *4-*5. Similarly, the AJ noted that Abasta was not covered under \u201cFICA\u201d and was ineligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>for federal life insurance coverage. <em>Id. </em>at *5. Finally, the AJ referred to the \u201cAnnuitant Indicator\u201d in Box 15, which stated that it was not applicable. <em>Id. </em>Based on these indicators, the AJ concluded that Abasta had not established that he was entitled to an annuity under the CSRS. <em>Id. </em>The full Board denied Abasta\u2019s petition for review and the initial decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Abasta then appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction over appeals from the Board under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). On May 28, 2001, we ordered Abasta to show cause why his petition for review should not be dismissed based upon issues that were decided in <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir. 1995). Both parties responded. Finally, by order dated August 24, 2001, the court directed the parties to submit briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">We must affirm the final decision of the Board unless we determine that it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7703(c)(1),(2). When the Board\u2019s final decision rests on findings of fact, we must accept those findings unless they are shown to lack substantial evidentiary support. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)(3). Under this standard of review, a court will not overturn an agency decision if it is supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Veterans Admin., </em>900 F.2d 233, 234 (Fed.Cir. 1990) (citing <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). The petitioner has the burden of proof of demonstrating entitlement to retirement benefits. <em>See Cheeseman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>791 F.2d 138, 141 (Fed.Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Eligibility for retirement benefits under the CSRA requires that an employee complete at least five years of \u201ccreditable\u201d service and that at least one of the two years of service immediately prior to separation be \u201csubject to\u201d the CSRA, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ccovered\u201d service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333; <em>see also Rosete, </em>48 F.3d at 516. \u201cCovered service only includes an appointment that is subject to the CSRA and for which an employee must deposit part of his or her pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.\u201d <em>See Id. </em>(citing <em>Noveloso v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>45 M.S.P.R. 321, 323 (1990), <em>aff'd </em>925 F.2d 1478 (Fed.Cir.1991)). We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that Abasta has not shown he is entitled to a retirement annuity under CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">First, all of Abasta\u2019s SF-50s indicate that he was not subject to civil service retirement coverage pursuant to the CSRA. Each SF-50 indicates that \u201cRetirement Plan\u201d is \u201c5\u201d or \u201cother,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>no federal retirement annuity. Second, there is no evidence that any civil service retirement deductions were taken from Abasta\u2019s pay during his periods of service. Because Abasto did not deposit part of his pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, his service under any of his appointments cannot be considered covered by the CSRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Because a reasonable mind might accept this evidence as adequate to support the Board\u2019s decision, the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Bradley, </em>900 F.2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Abasta argues that the omission of \u201cindefinite\u201d was not a clerical error and that his last appointment was subject to the CSRA because it was an excepted appointment \u201cwith no qualifications.\u201d This argument is unavailing, however, because prior Board decisions, subsequently affirmed by this court, have addressed the issue of whether applicants whose employment has been converted from temporary (or indefinite) appointments to appointments \u201cwithout limitation\u201d are eligible for benefits under the CSRA. <em>See Reyes v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>60 M.S.P.R. 172 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>29 F.3d 645 (Fed.Cir.1994) (table); <em>Poderes v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>63 M.S.P.R. 642 (1994), <em>aff'd, </em>61 F.3d 919 (Fed.Cir.1995) (table); <em>Lorica v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>63 M.S.P.R. 253, <em>aff'd, </em>66 F.3d 346 (Fed.Cir. 1995) (table). In each of these cases the Board determined that an appellant\u2019s service is not covered by the CSRA where the SF-50s describing that service indicate that he was not subject to the CSRS (for example, where the appellant\u2019s SF-50 retirement system code designation consistently is 5, indicating other than CSRS retirement coverage) and that he received retirement pay in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Reyes, </em>60 M.S.P.R. at 175; <em>Paderes, </em>63 M.S.P.R. at 644-45; <em>Lorica, </em>63 M.S.P.R. at 256. The facts of this case fall squarely within those described above: all of Abasta\u2019s SF-50s show that he was not covered under the CSRS and his final SF-50 shows that he was \u201c[ejntitled to severance pay equivalent to 100% of 16 months basic pay.\u201d Aceordingly, we reject Abasta\u2019s argument that merely because his SF-50 did not say \u201cindefinite,\u201d he was covered by the CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.502, Abasta also argues that his tenure group status when his position was converted, <em>i.e., </em>Group I as of September 29, 1988, is sufficient evidence to warrant entitlement to a CSRS benefit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as we indicated in <em>R\u00f3sete, </em>tenure group status is only relevant if the appellant produces evidence showing that his service was at any time subject to the CSRS and that his personnel record is incomplete as to that issue. <em>See Rosete </em>48 F.3d. at 519-20 (citing <em>Fredeluces v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>57 M.S.P.R. 598, 602 n. 4 (1993)). Here, Abasta has not produced evidence that his service was ever subject to the CSRS or that his records were incomplete. Accordingly, Abasta\u2019s tenure group argument is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">To the extent Abasta argues that <em>R\u00f3sete </em>was incorrectly decided, we must disagree. First, Abasta provides no support for this contention, other than his interpretation of the regulation at issue in that case, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201. Second, even if we found his argument convincing, this panel is bound by <em>R\u00f3sete </em>unless and until it is overturned <em>en banc. See Newell Cos. v. Kenney Mfg. Co., </em>864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir.1988) (citing <em>UMC Elecs. Co. v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 647, 652 (Fed.Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Because there is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [the Board\u2019s] conclusion,\u201d we find that substantial evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>the Board\u2019s determination Abasta was not entitled to a retirement annuity benefit under CSRS. <em>See Bradley, </em>900 F.2d at 234. Therefore, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">. Civil Service Rule 8.3 governs the appointment of persons who are not citizens of the United States to positions overseas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-7\">. In fact, under the collective bargaining agreements between the Federation of Filipino Civilian Employees Associations and the United States Armed Forces Bases in the Philippines, Abasta received retirement benefits, in the form of a severance award, in an amount equal to 100% of 16 months basic pay-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b985-5\">. The relevant portion of the regulation states that \"Group I includes each permanent employee whose appointment carries no restriction or condition such as conditional, indefinite, specific time limit, or trial period.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.502(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b985-6\">. Abasta also argues that at least one of his colleagues, Mr. Quimen, who received a conversion of his appointment to \"excepted\u201d without the \u201cindefinite\u201d designation the same day, September 29, 1988, and whose SF-50 greatly resembles Abasta\u2019s, was eligible for benefits under CSRA. For this reason, Abasta contends, he, too, should be granted benefits. However, Abasta has not provided sufficient evidence or explanation to support this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
