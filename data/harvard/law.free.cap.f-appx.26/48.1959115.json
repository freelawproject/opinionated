The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by initiating a \u201cnegative correspondence order,\u201d which prohibited the plaintiff from mailing legal papers to Alvin McAlpine and thereby prevented him from prosecuting his state court lawsuit against the McAlpines. Pursuant to his complaint, the plaintiff filed two motions. First, the plaintiff requested that his district court filing fee be deducted in part from his \u201cLag Pay/Gate Money trust account\u201d rather than solely from his inmate fund account. Second, the plaintiff moved the district court to enjoin the DOCS defendants from threatening him with disciplinary sanctions for pursuing his legal action against the McAlpines.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The district court denied both motions. On the plaintiffs motion regarding his filing fee, the district court found that the plaintiff had suffered no prejudice from the alleged failure to deduct funds from his \u201cLag Pay/Gate Money trust account\u201d because the plaintiff was permitted to proceed with his action regardless of whether his filing fee was paid in full. And on the plaintiffs motion for an injunction, the district court ruled that the issue was moot because the DOCS employees had eliminated all restrictions on the plaintiffs right to communicate with the McAlpines, including the removal of the plaintiff from the \u201cnegative correspondence list.\u201d The plaintiff now appeals both of these dismissals.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his filing fee motion. A district court order is appealable to this Court only under limited circumstances, including: (1) as a final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) as a certified interlocutory order under \u00a7 1292(b); (3) as an order encompassed by \u00a7 1292(a); and (4) as an interlocutory order under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Schwartz v. City of New York, </em>57 F.3d 236, 237 (2d Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs filing fee motion does not fall into any of these categories. It is not a final order, not certified, and not encompassed under \u00a7 1292(a). It is also not covered by the collateral order doctrine, because it is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>See Schwartz, </em>57 F.3d at 237. We thus dismiss the plaintiffs appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his filing fee motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">As for the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief, we agree with the district court that it was rendered moot by the defendants\u2019 actions. The plaintiff argues that dismissal for mootness is inappropriate because the defendants might again attempt to interfere with his lawsuit against the McAlpines- in the future. However, relief is available should the alleged interference recur, because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>triet court granted the plaintiff leave to file a renewed motion based on future incidents. Because the courthouse door remains open to the plaintiff, we are unable to conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jolly v. Coughlin, </em>76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Having carefully considered the plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 arguments, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court denying the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, and we DISMISS the remainder of the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
