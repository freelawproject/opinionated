This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. Mr. Roberts claims he is entitled to habeas relief because the Oklahoma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Court of Criminal Appeals violated <em>ex post facto </em>principles when it applied <em>Parker v. </em>State<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to his direct appeal. Mr. Roberts argues <em>Parker </em>was an unexpected and unforeseeable new rule of law and the application of <em>Parker </em>in his direct appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied him due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Mr. Roberts acknowledges his argument hinges on whether this court determines <em>Parker </em>was unforeseeable. This court recently held the result in <em>Parker </em>was foreseeable. <em>Sallahdin v. Gibson, </em>275 F.3d 1211, 1228 (10th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Roberts\u2019 arguments are substantially the same as those we considered and rejected in <em>Sallahdin. See id. </em>at 1227-28. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-6\">. <em>Parker v. State, </em>917 P.2d 980, 985-86 (Okla. Crim.App.1996) (defective criminal information raises due process concerns, but is not fatal to jurisdiction), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1096, 117 S.Ct. 777, 136 L.Ed.2d 721 (1997), overruled <em>Miller v. State, </em>827 P.2d 875, 879 (Okla.Crim.App.1992) (criminal information must specifically allege each element of the crime to confer jurisdiction on the trial court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\">. Contrary to the contentions in Mr. Roberts\u2019 brief, the state appellate court did not apply <em>Parker </em>in his direct appeal. <em>Roberts v. State, </em>No. F-93-482, slip op. at 3-4 (Okla.Crim.App. May 1, 1996) (unpublished opinion). Rather, the court relied on an unpublished opinion, <em>Masquat v. State, </em>No. F-93-1369 (Okla.Crim. App. July 26, 1996). <em>Masquat </em>held \u201d[t]he term 'premeditated design\u2019 ... was sufficient in this Information to set forth the element of malice aforethought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Obviously, the result in <em>Masquat </em>does not bode well for Mr. Roberts and may explain his decision to submit an <em>ex post facto </em>argument to this court. Nevertheless, we acknowledge Mr. Roberts' reliance on <em>Parker </em>in his <em>ex post facto </em>argument before this court and dispose of his claim accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AZk\">. <em>Sallahdin </em>was decided after we heard oral argument in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
