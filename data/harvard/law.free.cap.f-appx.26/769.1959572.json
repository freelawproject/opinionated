We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-26\">Hutcherson filed his federal petition over two years after the statute of limitations expired. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (providing a one-year limitations period). Thus, his petition is untimely absent some form of tolling. Hutcherson contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>he is entitled to equitable tolling for his attorney\u2019s dilatory behavior from the time that the limitations period began on April 24, 1996 until he succeeded in hiring replacement counsel in May of 1998. <em>See Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.1997) (equitable tolling granted \u201cif \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time\u201d). Even if his attorney\u2019s conduct rose to the level of \u201cextraordinary conduct\u201d necessary to establish equitable tolling, Hutcherson has not alleged facts sufficient to establish that \u201cexternal forces, rather than [his] lack of diligence, account for his failure to file a timely claim.\u201d <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1999). Hutcherson fails to acknowledge the significance of his access to legal materials, including a \u201cfinal\u201d draft petition that was in his possession as early as October 1995, more than six months before the limitations period even began with the enactment of AEDPA on April 24,1996. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
