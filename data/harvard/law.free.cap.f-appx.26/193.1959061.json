Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">Artice first claims that the inclusion in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) of information provided during his debriefing violated the terms of his plea agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The plain language of the plea agreement simply stated that the Government agreed that the protected statements would not be used against Artice in determining the applicable guideline range. Because Artice concedes that the probation officer calculated drug quantity for purposes of the guidelines by using sources independent from his statements, we find that Artice failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993) (citing burden of proof); <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076 (4th Cir. 1991) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Artice next claims that the federal statutes proscribing drug offenses have been rendered unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi. </em>He also argues that <em>Apprendi </em>should apply to invalidate the trial court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. These arguments are both foreclosed by our recent caselaw. In <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 230 (4th Cir. 2001), we held that 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001) is not unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>Further, we held in <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001), that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to judicial factfinding under the guidelines as long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum term set out in the statute. Artice\u2019s sentence of 150 months was clearly under the twenty year statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 156 (4th Cir.) (en banc) (holding that twenty years is the statutory maximum where drug quantity is not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Sept. 20, 2001) (No. 01-6398). Accordingly, we find that Artice is not entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Artice\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
