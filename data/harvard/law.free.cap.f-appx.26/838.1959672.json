R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-25\">In November 2000, the defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a stolen firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\u00a9. Defendant acquired the firearm during a burglary committed prior to the present offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-26\">According to the record, the defendant\u2019s base offense level was calculated under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which provides for an offense level of 24 if a defendant has at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. His offense level was increased by two points under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because the firearm was stolen, and decreased by three points under \u00a7,3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. He had a total offense level of twenty-three and a criminal history category of VI. The district court sentenced him to 112 months, with the sentence to run concurrently with the remaining portion of his state sentence, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">On appeal, he asserts the district court erred in increasing his offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). He argues that application of this enhancement amounts to impermissible double counting because his offense level already took into account the fact that the firearm was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo, and uphold the court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Arieta, </em>127 F.3d 1267, 1270 (10th Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Application Note 12 to \u00a7 2K2.1 sets forth the criteria establishing when the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) enhancement does not apply. This note, which was amended in 1995, now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">If the only offense to which \u00a7 2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(i), (j), or (u), or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(0 or (m) (offenses involving a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition) and the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7), do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) unless the offense involved a firearm with an altered or obliterated serial number. This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm or ammunition was stolen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.12). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, Note 12 as amended clearly does not preclude application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) enhancement in this case. Although convicted under \u00a7 922(j), the defendant\u2019s base offense level was determined under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), not \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">The defendant further argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rowlett, </em>23 F.3d 300 (10th Cir.1994), rules out application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) enhancement. This argument lacks merit. The court notes that <em>Rowlett </em>was decided before the 1995 amendment to Application Note 12. Further, <em>\u201cRowlett </em>stands only for the proposition that the gun involved must have been stolen prior to and not as part of the offense for which the defendant is being held responsible.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrman, </em>No. 96-3076, 1996 WL 621028, at *1 (10th Cir. Oct.28, 1996) (unpublished).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the offense of possession of a stolen firearm was committed after the firearm was stolen by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">The court concludes that application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) enhancement by the district court was proper and did not constitute impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir; R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-27\">.

The pre-1995 version of Application Note 12 stated: \"If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922[i], (j), or (k), or 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving stolen firearms or ammunition), and is convicted of no other offense subject to this guideline, do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) because the base level itself takes such conduct into account.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2 .1, comment.
