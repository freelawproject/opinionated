George\u2019s civil action against McClure. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. Further, we deny McClure\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus as he has not met the heavy burden of showing he has no other adequate means to attain relief and that his entitlement to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). We also deny George\u2019s request, set forth in his brief, that we tax McClure with the costs of this appeal, George\u2019s costs, and George\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, without prejudice to his right to pursue such relief pursuant to the procedures established by Rules 38 and 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
