The judgment was entered in accordance with a Memorandum and Order dated March 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Robert brought a claim under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, against the DOJ relating to thirteen categories of documents, which he alleged the DOJ improperly withheld from him after he requested them. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the DOJ on various grounds for the different categories of documents. Robert appeals the district court\u2019s ruling as to four of those categories: the \u201cCharles Robert Criminal Investigation\u201d documents, the \u201cNoyer\u201d documents, the \u201cBromwich\u201d documents, and the \u201cOPR Rogers\u201d documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We note that Robert has raised a First Amendment argument for the first time on appeal based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bartnicki v. Vopper, </em>532 U.S. 514, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149 L.Ed.2d 787 (2001), which was decided a few months after the district court\u2019s decision in this case. Robert asks us for a remand with instructions to the lower court to reconsider its reasoning in the light of <em>Bartnicki. </em>\u201c\u2018[I]f subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sporty\u2019s Farm L.L.C. v. Sportsman\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 489, 496 (2d. Cir.2000)(quoting <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 110, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801)). We have considered Robert\u2019s new argument, find <em>Bartnicki </em>to be inapposite to the circumstances of this case, and decline the invitation to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Having reviewed all of Robert\u2019s other contentions, we affirm the judgment for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum of Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
