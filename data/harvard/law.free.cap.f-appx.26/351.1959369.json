We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">As to Burton\u2019s claim that the indictment was so defective as to render his guilty plea invalid, we find that the indictment adequately stated the elements of the offense (prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2001)), and Burton\u2019s co-conspirators did not need to be named in the indictment. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 857 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>United States v. American Waste Fibers Co., </em>809 F.2d 1044, 1046 (4th Cir.1987). Further, as the district court correctly concluded, Burton\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenges are not cognizable in the collateral review proceeding. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 146-51 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 573, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2001). Burton failed to establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Additionally, as the district court noted, the Government is not required to file a notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (1994) where, as here, any increase in sentence was due to the calculations under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>68 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995). Finally, the district court did not err in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Yearwood, </em>863 F.2d 6, 7 (4th Cir.1988). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>Nos. CR-00-16-HO; CA-01-299-5-H (E.D.N.C. Aug. 7, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
