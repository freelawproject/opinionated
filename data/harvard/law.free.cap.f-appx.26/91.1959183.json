Faucette contends that the district court should have suppressed a statement he made to a detective during the search of his home because the detective failed to advise him of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-24\">We review the legal conclusions in a district court\u2019s suppression determination de novo and the underlying facts under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-25\">Under <em>Miranda, </em>prior to a custodial interrogation, government officials must inform a suspect of certain rights. <em>See United States v. Sullivan, </em>138 F.3d 126, 130 (4th Cir.1998). Statements elicited in violation of these rules are inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>Id. </em>The procedural safeguards prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>apply only when there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him in custody. <em>Id. </em>The test for determining whether an individual is in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is whether, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>under the totality of the circumstances, the \u201csuspect\u2019s freedom of action is curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Howard, </em>115 F.3d 1151, 1154 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The facts in this case do not demonstrate that Faucette\u2019s freedom of action was curtailed to such a degree. Faucette was not handcuffed or otherwise restrained. The questioning occurred in the presence of Faucette\u2019s family members and in his own home. Detectives never told Faucette he was not free to leave. Faucette was not arrested until three weeks following the search. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not err when it declined to suppress Faucette\u2019s statements for failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>37 F.3d 276, 281 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Howard, </em>991 F.2d 195, 200 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We therefore affirm Faucette\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
