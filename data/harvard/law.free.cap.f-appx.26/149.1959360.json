New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that \u201c[ojther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The Court decided <em>Apprendi </em>after a jury convicted Wilfredo Gonzalez Lora of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846 (West 1999), the district court sentenced him to a 292 month term of incarceration, and we affirmed the denial of his motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Lora, </em>No. 99-4559, 2000 WL 347101 (4th Cir. Mar. 15, 2000) (unpublished), <em>vacated, </em>531 U.S. 1135, 121 S.Ct. 1071, 148 L.Ed.2d 949 (2001). We grant Lora\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, and, after reviewing his sentence for plain error in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we affirm. <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 154 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (discussing plain error standard of review), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 20, 2001 (No. 01-6398).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In applying <em>Apprendi </em>to drug offenses in \u00a7 846 and 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001), we recently held that \u201cthe specific threshold [drug] quantity must be treated as an element of an aggravated drug trafficking offense, <em>i.e., </em>charged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 156-57 (footnotes omitted). Here, drug quantity was charged in the indictment but not submitted to the jury. We therefore find that there was error and that the error was plain. <em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Although we find plain error, a defendant\u2019s substantial rights are not affected by the \u201cfailure to submit drug quantity to the jury ... if the trial produced \u2018uncontested and overwhelming evidence\u2019 of drug quantity sufficient to sustain the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d 233, 252 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 253 (4th Cir.2001)), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Oct. 11, 2001 (No. 01-6767). Our review of the trial testimony discloses that Lora received more than 600 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 120 times the threshold amount necessary to sustain a sentence under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (providing for ten-year-to-life sentence for at least five kilograms of cocaine). Lora contends that the evidence was not overwhelming because the Government\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony was fabricated, but the trial testimony refutes his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In addition, although Lora objected to drug quantity at sentencing on the ground that the Government\u2019s witnesses did not provide specific amounts or dates for the drug transactions, Lora did not dispute that \u201cthere [were] a lot of drugs floating around.\u201d (Supplemental App. at 5). We therefore find that Lora did not genuinely contest that the amount of cocaine exceeded the five-kilogram threshold amount in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and, therefore, that the evidence was uncontested. <em>See Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d at 252 &amp; n. 10; <em>Stewart, </em>256 F.3d at 253 <em>&amp; </em>n. 17. Because the evidence at trial was overwhelming and uncontested, we hold, following <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Stewart, </em>that the court\u2019s failure to submit drug quantity to the jury did not affect Lora\u2019s substantial rights and that Lora is not entitled to resentencing after <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Lora also raises several other claims in his pro se supplemental brief, none of which has merit. Contrary to Lora\u2019s contention that the indictment was constructively amended by the Government and the district court, Lora\u2019s claims are belied by the record. With regard to his claims that the district court erred in submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>a general verdict form to the jury<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and violated his Fifth Amendment rights by submitting the superseding indictment to the jury with the overt acts redacted, we find that his claims are foreclosed by the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. </em>Bell, 5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Lora\u2019s conviction and 292 month sentence. We deny Lora\u2019s motion for clarification, motion requesting briefs from other cases, and motion to file a courtesy copy of a motion he filed in the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-17\"> <em>See United States v.
