Abendroth suffers from lower back pain. He applied for disability benefits first in 1986 and again in 1996, but each time an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found him not disabled and therefore ineligible for benefits. He appealed only the second determination, which addressed his eligibility during the four-month period from August 28 to December 31, 1987. After the Appeals Council and the district court affirmed that determination, he filed the present appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">Mr. Abendroth, who was bom in 1941, has a history of back pain dating to at least 1974, when he was working full-time as a school janitor. In 1974 he first received surgery, a laminectomy, on his back. The record reflects no further serious back problems until 1982, when he was hospitalized in August. Mr. Abendroth left his job as a janitor in 1982, and did not work again until 1990. Mr. Abendroth\u2019s problems worsened after his 1982 injury. After tests showed herniated discs, he underwent a second back surgery in 1985. Mr. Abendroth then was referred to a rheumatologist, Dr. Mark Stem, who diagnosed him with \u201cmultifactorial back pain\u201d and epicondylitis (\u201ctennis elbow\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-18\">Mr. Abendroth first applied for disability benefits in August 1986. After reviewing Mr. Abendroth\u2019s application and holding a hearing, the ALJ analyzed Mr. Abendroth\u2019s claim under the mandatory five-step process, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520, and determined that Mr. Abendroth was not disabled because he had the residual functional capacity to work at sedentary jobs that would allow him to alternate between sitting and standing. Mr. Abendroth did not appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">After being denied disability benefits, Mr. Abendroth continued to experience back pain. He underwent spinal surgery twice in 1989 and once in 1993. In spite of his pain, Mr. Abendroth handled an assortment of part-time jobs from 1990 to 1995. In 1995, however, he stopped working altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-20\">In 1996 Dr. Stern, who was still treating Mr. Abendroth, prepared a report on Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition at the request of Mr. Abendroth\u2019s lawyer. The report not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ed that Mr. Abendroth suffered from degenerative disc disease, a history of back surgery, and a history of herniated spinal discs. Dr. Stern stated that he did not \u201cbelieve that [Mr. Abendroth] would be able to pursue active work\u201d even with frequent rest breaks. The doctor further stated that he \u201cwould expect\u201d that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s physical impairments would cause him to miss \u201cmore than two or more [sic]\u201d days of work per month. The report also stated that \u201c[Mr. Abendroth\u2019s] lumbar situation really has not changed in the last 10 years since I have known him and these questions ... apply to August 29th of 1987 as well as the present day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Also in 1996 Mr. Abendroth filed a second claim for disability benefits alleging that he became disabled in 1982 and seeking benefits through December 31, 1987, when his eligibility for benefits expired. In his application, Mr. Abendroth submitted medical evidence from 1982-1996, including some of the same evidence he presented with his first application. In 1997 the ALJ assigned to the case held a hearing at which Mr. Abendroth, his wife, and a vocational expert testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The ALJ issued a two-page opinion denying benefits. The opinion stated that the denial of Mr. Abendroth\u2019s first claim was <em>res judicata </em>through August 28, 1987. Mr. Abendroth\u2019s present claim was therefore limited to the four-month period between August 28, 1987, and December 31, 1987. The ALJ went on to state that Mr. Abendroth had provided no medical evidence to show that he became disabled during that four-month span, and that Mr. Abendroth had the same residual functional capacity for sedentary work that he possessed on August 28, 1987. Turning to the evidence, the ALJ found that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s current testimony was less credible than the testimony he had presented in connection-with his first claim, because the testimony he gave in 1987 concerning his first claim was more proximate in time to the four months at issue. The ALJ also suggested that the 1997 testimony was unreliable because Mr. Abendroth erroneously testified that he had not worked since 1987. The ALJ also stated that the evidence did not support Dr. Stern\u2019s opinion that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition had not changed in ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Appeals Council denied Mr. Abendroth\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security. Mr. Abendroth then appealed to the district court, and both parties consented to review by a magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). The magistrate judge concluded that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination, and accordingly upheld the Commissioner\u2019s judgment. Mr. Abendroth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">I. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Mr. Abendroth\u2019s counsel contended at oral argument that <em>res judicata </em>does not bar us from reexamining Mr. Abendroth condition as of August 28, 1987, because the opinion issued by the ALJ in his first claim did not address whether Mr. Abendroth could work on a \u201csustained\u201d basis. Ability to work on a \u201csustained\u201d basis is part of the definition of residual functional capacity to work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)-(b). According to counsel, we may now consider Mr. Abendroth\u2019s ability to work on a \u201csustained\u201d basis, and thus his residual functional capacity, because the issue was not previously raised. We disagree. <em>Res judicata </em>bars relitigation of issues from a first claim during a second claim. <em>See Groves v. Apfel, </em>148 F.3d 809, 810 (7th Cir.1998); <em>see also Casey v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>987 F.2d 1230, 1232-33 (6th Cir.1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The first opinion, though it did not use the phrase \u201csustained basis,\u201d thoroughly discussed Mr. Abendroth\u2019s residual functional capacity. Thus, <em>res judicata </em>bars us from reexamining Mr. Abendroth\u2019s residual functional capacity as of August 28, 1987, and to succeed Mr. Abendroth must prove that his condition deteriorated to the point of disability between August 28 and December 31, 1987; <em>see Groves, </em>148 F.3d at 810; <em>Casey, </em>987 F.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The ALJ found that Mr. Abendroth did not prove that he became disabled, and we must determine whether substantial evidence supported that decision. <em>See Clifford v. Apfel, </em>227 F.3d 863, 869 (7th Cir. 2000). Substantial evidence requires \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Kepple v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 513, 516 (7th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 402, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). We examine the entire record, but do not \u201creweigh the evidence, resolve conflicts, decide questions of credibility, or substitute our own judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ found that there was no evidence that Mr. Abendroth became disabled during the relevant four months. Mr. Abendroth\u2019s only potentially relevant evidence was his testimony to the ALJ that his condition was worse in 1996 than in 1987, and Dr. Stern\u2019s report stating that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition had not changed between 1996 and August 1987. Given the absence of evidence from the relevant time period, the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Casey, </em>987 F.2d 1230 (holding that claimant previously adjudicated not disabled failed to show that she had become disabled when she provided no evidence from the relevant four months).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">II. Adequacy of the ALJ\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Mr. Abendroth also attacks the adequacy of the ALJ\u2019s explanation for the opinion. For this court to affirm a denial of benefits, the ALJ must \u201carticulate\u201d the reasons for a decision at \u201csome minimum level.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 1171,1176 (7th Cir.2001). This means that the ALJ \u201cmust build an accurate and logical bridge from [the] evidence to [the] conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the ALJ need not address every piece of evidence, we must be able to discern the ALJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Id. </em>Here, the ALJ\u2019s ruling comprises only two pages of text, but the ALJ\u2019s rationale is discernible.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Mr. Abendroth argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision was insufficient because it did not delineate the first four steps of the five-step analytical process for determining whether an individual is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. But the ALJ could not reach step five without proceeding through the first four steps. Moreover, all five steps were extensively discussed in the denial of Mr. Abendroth\u2019s first claim, on which the ALJ relied heavily. We will not remand a case to an ALJ \u201cin quest of a perfect opinion unless there is reason to believe that the remand might lead to a different result.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Bowen, </em>869 F.2d 1055, 1057 (7th Cir.1989). Description of the first four steps would not have altered the fact that Mr. Abendroth presented no evidence of a <em>change </em>in his condition during the relevant four-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Mr. Abendroth next argues that the decision is insufficient because the ALJ did not list Mr. Abendroth\u2019s impairments. Mr. Abendroth argues that because the ALJ never specified what impairments he reviewed, this court cannot know whether the ALJ properly considered all of the alleged impairments. The ALJ\u2019s decision, however, states that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>is no evidence that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition changed after his first denial of benefits. If Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition is unchanged, then his impairments are the same as those in the first decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Mr. Abendroth also asserts that there is no indication that the ALJ reviewed the record from his earlier disability claim. An ALJ must consider all the relevant evidence. <em>See Herron v. Shalala, </em>19 F.3d 329, 333 (7th Cir.1994). The first decision, however, is <em>res judicata. </em>Although evidence from the first claim is admissible, <em>see Groves, </em>148 F.3d at 810, <em>res judicata </em>bars the ALJ from redetermining whether Mr. Abendroth was disabled as of August 28, 1987. Moreover, the ALJ stated twice in his decision that he reviewed the record closely. There is every indication, then, that the ALJ sufficiently reviewed the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Mr. Abendroth next contends that we should reverse because the ALJ did not explain his finding that a 1996 report by Dr. Stern, Mr Abendroth\u2019s treating rheumatologist, was not supported by the record. According to Mr. Abendroth, two statements from Dr. Stern\u2019s report support his claim and thus should have been addressed. First, Mr. Abendroth points out Dr. Stern\u2019s statement that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s \u201clumbar situation\u201d was the same on August 29, 1987, as in 1996. Second, Mr. Abendroth contrasts Dr. Stern\u2019s statement that he \u201cwould expect\u201d Mr. Abendroth to miss \u201cmore than two or more\u201d days of work per month with a vocational expert\u2019s testimony that an employer would permit no more than one absence per month. A treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding the nature and severity of a medical condition is entitled to controlling weight if well-supported by medical findings and not inconsistent with other substantial evidence. <em>See Clifford, </em>227 F.3d at 870. Although the ALJ should have discussed his reasoning, <em>see id. </em>at 871, the record does not support Dr. Stern\u2019s claim that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition was unchanged. For example, Mr. Abendroth contradicted Dr. Stern\u2019s claim when he testified to the ALJ during his 1997 hearing that his condition had deteriorated since 1987. Moreover, Dr. Stern\u2019s report that Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition had not changed between 1987 and 1996 does not support Mr. Abendroth\u2019s contention that he worsened to the point of disability during the relevant four months. Once the ALJ determined that Dr. Stern\u2019s report was not credible evidence of Mr. Abendroth\u2019s condition, the ALJ also did not need to accept Dr. Stern\u2019s expectation that Mr. Abendroth would be absent more than two days per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by sufficient evidence and was adequately comprehensive under the circumstances. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
