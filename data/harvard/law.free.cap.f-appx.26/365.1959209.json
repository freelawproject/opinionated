We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Jenkins v. Rinaldi, </em>No. CA-99-629 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 23, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
