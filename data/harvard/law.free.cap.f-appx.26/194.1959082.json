The district court sentenced him to a 12 month term of imprisonment for the counterfeiting charge followed by a 21 month term of imprisonment for revocation of probation. Zhang timely appealed. Zhang\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contends on Zhang\u2019s behalf that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a 12 month sentence for the counterfeiting violation and that the district court\u2019s 21 month sentence imposed for revocation of probation was in violation of law or was plainly unreasonable. Zhang was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief but did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Zhang\u2019s 12 month counterfeiting sentence was within the properly calculated guideline range of 6-12 months and therefore is not appealable. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). Moreover, the district court properly considered the counterfeiting offense that gave rise to the revocation of probation in fashioning the sentence for that revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2) (1994); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 507 (4th Cir.1997). Further, the court properly found, in its discretion, that an upward departure was warranted for the revocation of probation. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 7B1.4, comment. (n.4) (Nov.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in -writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
