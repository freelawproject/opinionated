We reverse. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the ease, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Prior to the commencement of Diaz-Garcia\u2019s trial, the government agreed that it would not introduce expert testimony that there are no unknowing drug couriers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cStipulations freely and voluntarily entered into in criminal trials are as binding and enforceable as those entered into in civil actions.\u201d <em>United States v. Shapiro, </em>879 F.2d 468, 470 (9th Cir.1989) (citing <em>United States v. Gwaltney, </em>790 F.2d 1378, 1386 (9th Cir.1986)). Thus, based on the pre-trial stipulation, expert testimony that there are no unknowing drug couriers became inadmissible. Admission of evidence in violation of a pre-trial evidence stipulation is reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 472. As we noted in <em>Shapiro:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">\u201cThe federal courts have long been cognizant of the responsibility of federal prosecutors meticulously to fulfill their promises.\u201d <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>609 F.2d 1326, 1328 (9th Cir.1979). When the prosecution makes a \u201cdeal\u201d within its authority and the defendant relies on it in good faith, the court will not allow the defendant to be prejudiced as a result of that reliance. <em>United States v. Goodrich, </em>493 F.2d 390, 393 (9th Cir.1974). A prosecuting attorney may not \u201coverstep[ ] the bounds of that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 84, 55 S.Ct. 629, 631, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1934). A prosecutor must prosecute with earnestness and vigor, but while he \u201cmay strike hard blows, he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633.[] This court has never wavered in its obligation to enforce agreements made by prosecutors upon which defendants have justifiably relied to their detriment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">During its direct examination of an expert witness, a Customs Service Senior Special Agent, the government elicited testimony regarding the price of marijuana in Mexico and Imperial County, California, as well as the compartmentalization of functions that characterizes drug trafficking organizations. On cross-examination, defense counsel queried the agent on his compartmentalization testimony by asking several questions about the hierarchical structure of drug trafficking organizations, focusing on the insulation such a structure provides for those at the top of the hierarchy. On re-direct, over the objection of defense counsel that it violated the <em>in limine </em>order, the government elicited testimony that drug traffickers do not use unknowing transporters, specifically that:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Q. In your experience, do organizations always use drivers that know they\u2019re carrying drugs?</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The trial court permitted the testimony in violation of the stipulation because it believed the defense had \u201copened the door\u201d to the testimony by inquiring about the insulation of higher members of a hierarchical drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">\u201cUnder the rule of curative admissibility, or the \u2018opening the door\u2019 doctrine, the introduction of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an opponent, in the court\u2019s discretion, to introduce evidence on the same issue to rebut any false impression that might have resulted from the earlier admission. The doctrine does not permit the introduction of evidence that is related to a different issue or is irrelevant to the evidence previously admitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitworth, </em>856 F.2d 1268, 1285 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling that the defense opened the door to the introduction of evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Tory, </em>52 F.3d 207, 210 (9th Cir.1995). \u201cReversal for an abuse of discretion is required \u2018only if such nonconstitutional error more likely than not affected the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hanley, </em>190 F.3d 1017, 1028 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">A careful review of the cross-examination reveals that the defense did not \u201copen the door\u201d to admission of expert testimony that drug trafficking organizations never use unknowing couriers. Defense counsel inquired as to whether the people \u201cat the lowest levels\u201d were the \u201cones with the most risk\u201d and if the \u201chierarchy system ... want[s] them to be able to reveal who the top guy is.\u201d This examination of compartmentalization was insufficient to warrant a breach of the evidence stipulation, and the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony over the defense objection. Given that the central disputed issue in the case was Diaz-Garcia\u2019s knowledge, the error was not harmless. Thus, reversal is required. <em>Shapiro, </em>879 F.2d at 472. Under <em>Shapiro, </em>the stipulation will still govern the parties\u2019 actions on retrial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">Given our resolution of this case, we need not reach any other issue in the appeal, including the question of whether the testimony would have been admissible absent the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\">. Specifically, Diaz-Garcia\u2019s attorney stated that \u201cwe\u2019ve discussed the expert that the government is going to call and agree that he will not go into <em>Cordoba </em>type matters. Aside from that, I don\u2019t think that there are any other <em>in limine </em>motions.\u201d The government replied that \"we do not intend to introduce blind mule testimony.\u201d The phrase <em>\u201cCordoba-type </em>matters\u201d refers to expert testimony in a complex criminal case that \"drug traffickers do not entrust large quantities of drugs to unknowing transporters.\u201d <em>United States v. Cordoba, </em>104 F.3d 225, 230 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
