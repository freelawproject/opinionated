The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they occasion no need for a published opinion. See D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). For the reasons set forth in the attached memorandum, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. See D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Plaintiff Shinok Park filed suit against her employer, Radio Free Asia (RFA), and her supervisor, Jaehoon Ahn, after she was dismissed from her position as a broadcast journalist. She appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against her on her claims of sexual harassment and slander. She also appeals the district court\u2019s decision, during trial of her other claims, to exclude a translation and transcript of a recorded conversation between her and Ahn. We affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Park argues that Ahn discriminated against her on the basis of sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that the conduct she describes did not create a discriminatory work environment under the standards established by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Clark County School District v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1509-10, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (explaining that \u201csexual harassment is actionable under Title VII only if it is so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (explaining that \u201cin order to be actionable under the statute, a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile and abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so,\u201d considering such factors as the \u201cfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance\u201d) (quoting <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">Park further contends that Ahn committed slander when, after her termination, he made a false statement about her during an RFA management meeting. The meeting was held to discuss the company\u2019s position regarding any legal action Park might initiate. Park concedes that Ahn\u2019s statement at the meeting was presumptively protected by the qualified \u201ccommon interest\u201d privilege, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 12, which applies where a statement is \u201con a subject in which the party communicating has an interest, or in reference to which he has, or honestly believes he has, a duty to a person having a corresponding interest or duty,\u201d and the statement is made \u201cto a person who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>such a corresponding interest.\u201d <em>Moss v. Stockard, </em>580 A.2d 1011, 1024 (D.C.1990). Although the common interest privilege may be defeated by a showing that the statement was made with malice, <em>see id., </em>Park has neither shown that the statement was itself so egregious as to generate an inference of malice nor offered any other evidence of malice. Accordingly, her claim of slander fails. <em>See id.; see also Mosrie v. Trussell, </em>467 A.2d 475, 478 (D.C.1983) (\u201c[I]f the language of the communication and the circumstances attending its publication by the defendant are as consistent with the nonexistence of malice as with its existence, there is no issue for the jury, and it is the duty of the trial court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Finally, Park maintains that the district court erred in excluding a translation and transcript prepared by Park\u2019s expert. The translation and transcript were of a tape, itself admitted into evidence, on which Park and Ahn conducted a heated conversation about Park\u2019s job performance and various promises Ahn had allegedly made concerning her employment terms. The conversation was in both English and Korean. The district court identified various errors in the transcription of the English-language portion of the tape, and concluded that the translation and transcript was too unreliable to be given to the jury. We review a trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Stevenson v. District of Columbia Metro. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>248 F.3d 1187, 1190 (D.C.Cir.2001). Here, we find no reason to overturn the district court\u2019s discretionary judgment that the risk of the transcript\u2019s misleading the jury outweighed its probative value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Ev. 403 (relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Park\u2019s sexual harassment and slander claims, as well as its evidentiary ruling, are</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
