Because the court below erred in its interpretation of the guaranty, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On April 17, 2000, Midwest Markets applied to BB <em>&amp; </em>T for an irrevocable standby letter of credit in favor of Roundy\u2019s, a wholesale supplier of grocery products to Midwest Markets. The purpose of the letter of credit was to induce Roundy\u2019s to sell grocery products to Midwest Markets. The credit was limited to an amount not to exceed $200,000. Pursuant to the terms of the letter of credit, if Midwest Markets failed to pay for goods within ten days of the issuance of an invoice, Roundy\u2019s would then be able to draw on the letter of credit to pay the overdue invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">As a condition to obtaining the letter of credit, Midwest Markets executed a promissory note dated April 17, 2000, in the original principal amount of $200,000, payable\u201d to BB &amp; T. As an additional requirement to obtaining the letter of credit, Roger Camp, who holds a majority interest in Midwest Markets, executed a guaranty agreement dated April 17, 2000 and acknowledged April 18, 2000. The guaranty stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">As an inducement to [BB &amp; T] to extend credit to and to otherwise deal with [Midwest Markets], and in consideration thereof, the undersigned ... hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Bank and its successors and assigns the due and punctual payment of any and all notes, drafts, debts, obligations and liabilities, primary or secondary (whether by way of endorsement or otherwise), of Borrower, at any time, now or hereafter, incurred with or held by Bank, together with interest, as and when the same become due and payable, whether by acceleration or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any such notes, drafts, debts, obligations or liabilities or agreements evidencing any such indebtedness, obligation or liability including all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The guaranty provided Camp three options to define the limits on his liability. The form provided that Camp would simply indicate his choice by marking an \u201cX\u201d in the box next to the option selected. The first option provided that liability under the guaranty would be unlimited and applied to all indebtedness of Midwest Markets. The second option provided that the guaranty would be limited to indebtedness evidenced by a specific promissory note. The third option provided that the guaranty would be limited to a specific dollar amount. The initial guaranty signed by Camp had the first option marked. Later, the third option was checked, and the guaranty was modified to limit his liability to $200,000. At no time was the second option marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">On April 17, 2000, BB &amp; T issued the letter of credit to Roundy\u2019s with an original expiration date of May 1, 2000. Prior to May 1, 2000, Midwest Markets, through Camp, requested an extension of the letter of credit from May 1 to May 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">At this point the parties\u2019 narration of events diverges. On May 12, Camp asked BB <em>&amp; </em>T to prepare the documents necessary for a further extension of the letter of credit. According to Camp, his request was limited to preparing the documents for the extension; he asserts he never actually requested the extension. According to BB &amp; T, Camp made an actual oral request for the letter of credit to be extended until June 15, 2000 and, on May 18, BB &amp; T extended the letter of credit via a letter faxed from E. Neal Crawford, Senior Vice President of BB &amp; T, to Roundy\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Roundy\u2019s resumed shipment of goods to Midwest Markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">On May 23, 2000, Roundy\u2019s demanded payment from BB <em>&amp; </em>T on the letter of credit for payment of overdue and unpaid invoices to Midwest Markets in the amount of $122,030.84. On May 25, BB &amp; T honored Roundy\u2019s demand for payment on the letter of credit, and BB <em>&amp; </em>T paid Roundy\u2019s the full amount demanded. In conjunction with that payment, BB <em>&amp; </em>T took an assignment of the Roundy\u2019s invoices that were unpaid by Midwest Markets. Midwest Markets refused to repay BB <em>&amp; </em>T. Camp refused to honor the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On June 2, 2000, Midwest Markets filed for bankruptcy protection. On July 7, 2000, BB &amp; T filed suit in the Eastern District of Virginia. The parties consented to a bench trial before the Magistrate. On February 9, 2001, four days before the start of trial, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered an Order Allowing Claim in the amount of $122,030.84. The order was endorsed as \u201cagreed\u201d by bankruptcy counsel for Midwest Markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">BB <em>&amp; </em>T asserted at trial that it was entitled to judgment against Camp in the principal amount of $122,030.84, plus interest, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that Camp unconditionally guaranteed \u201call notes, drafts, debts, obligations and liabilities\u201d of Midwest Markets. At trial, the magistrate judge excluded the bankruptcy order because it was produced, in his view, too close to the beginning of trial and because he found it was not relevant to Camp\u2019s guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In an opinion delivered from the bench, the magistrate judge found for Camp. The magistrate judge held that the guaranty was limited to debts incurred pursuant to the letter of credit, and further found that the letter of credit expired on May 12, 2000. The magistrate judge found that he did not need to decide the disputed issue of whether Camp\u2019s oral statements to BB &amp; T were an actual request for an extension or merely a request for the preparation of appropriate documents. Instead, he ruled that any extension of the letter of credit was required to have been in writing. Accordingly, the magistrate judge found Camp not liable to BB &amp; T under the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">We review questions of law de novo. <em>West v. Murphy, </em>99 F.3d 166, 167 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Underlying a large portion of BB &amp; T\u2019s appeal is its assertion that the magistrate judge erred when he ruled that the guaranty is limited to debts incurred pursuant to the letter of credit. BB &amp; T is correct. The magistrate judge erred in his interpretation of the guaranty because the guaranty was unlimited. The guaranty covered all \u201cnotes, drafts, debts, obligations and liabilities ... of [Midwest Markets], at any time, now or hereafter, incurred with or held by [BB <em>&amp; </em>T].... \u201d The form of the guaranty had a mechanism for limiting its coverage to a specific instrument, viz., the check box, but the parties agree that the mechanism was not employed in this case. Accordingly, the guaranty was unconditional, covering all debts of Midwest Markets to BB &amp; T, with the sole limitation that the total amount guaranteed cannot exceed $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">BB <em>&amp; </em>T argues that Camp is liable under the guaranty because Midwest Markets is indebted to BB &amp; T in four distinct ways: (1) the bankruptcy order; (2) the invoices assigned to BB <em>&amp; </em>T from Roundy\u2019s; (3) the letter of credit; and (4) the subrogation of Roundy\u2019s rights against Midwest Markets. Because Midwest Markets was indebted to BB <em>&amp; </em>T by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the assignment of the invoices, we need not consider the other three theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The testimony and evidence at trial unequivocally revealed that Roundy\u2019s assigned Midwest Markets\u2019 unpaid invoices to BB &amp; T. These invoices represented a debt of Midwest Markets to Roundy\u2019s, incurred by the purchase of goods from Roundy\u2019s. The writing evidencing the assignment was introduced at trial. (JA 21.) And Mr. Crawford testified that BB <em>&amp; </em>T took an assignment of the invoices. (JA 72-73.) The assignment transferred to BB &amp; T Roundy\u2019s rights to payment from Midwest Markets. <em>See </em>Va.Code \u00a7 8.2-210(2) (establishing general validity of assignment of rights of buyer and seller); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 317(2) (1979) (generally providing for assignment of contractual rights); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 317, illus. 1. The evidence went unrebutted at trial. Even now, on appeal, Camp does not dispute the validity of the assignment. The assignment of the invoices created a debt of Midwest Markets held by BB <em>&amp; </em>T. We find that the guaranty, which clearly states that Camp guarantees to BB &amp; T all debts of Midwest Markets held by BB <em>&amp; </em>T, was broad enough to cover the assigned debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Accordingly, the judgment below is reversed, and the ease is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
