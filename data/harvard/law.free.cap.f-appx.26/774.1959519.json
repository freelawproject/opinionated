ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b804-23\">On January 11, 2000, Robert L. Grose was indicted and charged with (i) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), (ii) possession with intent to distribute in excess of 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and (iii) possession with intent to distribute in excess of 3 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. As relevant here, on March 23, 2000, a jury con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>victed Mr. Grose on all three drug trafficking counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On December 20, 2000, the district court imposed the minimum sentence applicable to the drug trafficking convictions: three concurrent sentences of sixty-three months each and five years of supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (five-year mandatory minimum) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), 2D1.1(c) and 4A1.1 (base offense level of 26 and criminal history Category I, requiring a sentencing range of 63-78 months). The court did not impose any fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Grose tendered to the court his written <em>pro se </em>motion and brief for substitution of counsel, seeking to discharge appointed counsel who represented him throughout the trial, was successful in continuing the sentencing proceedings for further investigation and preparation, and was present and well-prepared at the sentencing hearing. The district court received the <em>pro se </em>motion but refused to consider it on the ground that it violated the rule against hybrid representation. Tr. of Sentencing Proceedings at 2-3, R. Suppl. Vol. I. In its written order, the court both denied and struck the motion. Sentencing Minutes at 3, R. Vol. I, Doc. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">On appeal, Mr. Grose, through court-appointed appellate counsel, does not contest his conviction. Furthermore, he does not seek to have his sentence vacated or to be resentenced. He specifically states that \u201c[t]he only relief sought is <em>not resentencing, </em>but <em>only </em>a remand for purposes of an inquiry into Mr. Grose\u2019s motion for substitute counsel.\u201d <em>See </em>Sept. 14, 2001, Ltr. from Asst. Fed. Pub. Defender to Clerk of Ct., Tenth Cir. Ct. of App., R. Suppl. Auth. (emphasis in original). As such, Mr. Grose\u2019s sole complaint on appeal is that the district court erroneously failed to consider his <em>pro se </em>motion for substitution of counsel by improperly invoking the rule against hybrid representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Defense counsel is correct in the assertion that the district court must at least consider a <em>pro se </em>motion seeking relief from representation by counsel and the appointment of new counsel, and that the rule against hybrid representation does not generally apply to such limited <em>pro se </em>motions. Indeed, such motions may be the only means of revealing that defense representation has, for all practical purposes, ceased to exist, as, for example, where counsel has become physically or mentally impaired. Nonetheless, Mr. Grose\u2019s appeal must be dismissed because neither the conviction nor the sentence is challenged, and thus this court is not being asked to give, nor can it grant, any meaningful or effectual relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Western Pac. Airlines, Inc. v. Smith Mgmt. (In re Western Pac. Airlines, Inc.), </em>181 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that an \u201cappeal is moot if the court can fashion no meaningful relief\u2019); <em>In re O.J. Osborn, </em>24 F.3d 1199, 1203 (10th Cir.1994) (noting that appeal must be dismissed where it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201cimpossible for the court to \u2018grant any effectual relief whatever\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Church of Scientology of Calif. v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Alternatively, upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to review and make findings regarding Mr. Grose\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion did not result in any prejudice in this case sufficient to support a remand. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Zillges, </em>978 F.2d 369, 372 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that \u201c[t]he denial of a motion for substitution of counsel will be upheld ... if the district court\u2019s error was harmless\u201d). Among other things, the sentence imposed was the minimum applicable to the convicted offenses, and the conviction itself is not appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">. Mr. Grose was also charged and convicted of forfeiture pursuant to21 U.S.C.\u00a7 853. <em>See </em>Indictment, R. Vol. I, Doc. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">. More accurately, consistent with applicable statutory requirements, the district court sentenced Mr. Grose to \u201csupervised release for a term of five years on each of counts one and two and three years on count three, all to be served concurrently.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Proceedings at 34, R. Suppl. Vol. I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b805-13\">. Counsel does not even suggest that meaningful relief is visible down some trail of multiple speculations where, on remand, the district court <em>may </em>appoint new counsel, who <em>may </em>mount some sentencing argument, which <em>may </em>induce the district court to depart downward from the statute and guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-25\">. This holding, of course, does not preclude Mr. Grose from pursuing, in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, collateral claims he may have based on any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-15\">. \"While the question of mootness was not briefed or argued in this case, we must consider this issue <em>sua sponte </em>as it implicates our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cox v.
