We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find Richardson\u2019s appeal is moot. While Richardson challenges the calculation of his release date, he has been released from custody, and he does not allege that collateral consequences warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>relief. <em>See Vandenberg v. Rodgers, </em>801 F.2d 377, 378 (10th Cir.1986). Further, we decline review of his claim for monetary damages raised for the first time on appeal because Richardson has not alleged exceptional circumstances. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Richardson\u2019s appeal as moot. Further, we deny Richardson\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
