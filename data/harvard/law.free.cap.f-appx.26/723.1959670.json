Tosti appeals the district court\u2019s order denying her motion to confirm the validity of her purported lien on property owned by her son, Peter Sacker. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">Tosti first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the lien was a fraudulent transfer under \u00a7 3439.04(a) of the California Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\u201cCUFTA\u201d). <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3439.04(a) (West 1994) (A transfer is fraudulent if made with \u201cactual intent\u201d to defraud.). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Sacker made the transfer with actual fraudulent intent. <em>See In re Acequia, Inc., </em>34 F.3d 800, 805 (9th Cir.1994) (reviewing finding of actual fraudulent intent for clear error). The presence of the following five \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d one or more of which provides \u201cevidence from which an inference of fraudulent intent may be drawn,\u201d sufficiently supported the court\u2019s finding: (1) transfer to an insider, (2) threat of suit, (3) retention of control over property, (4) concealment of the transfer, and (5) an absence of reasonably equivalent value received for the transfer. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 3439.04 (West 1994) (Legislative Committee Comment If 5) (listing the badges of fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">First, it is undisputed that the transfer was to an insider, i.e. the debtor\u2019s mother. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>See In re Serrato, </em>214 B.R. 219, 229 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.1997) (\u201cThe relationship of parent and child, when coupled with other suspicious circumstances, gives rise to an inference of fraud.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Second, Sacker was threatened with suit when the transfer occurred. He had been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on March 17, 1997, and his attorney was notified of a subpoena on Sacker\u2019s company on May 15, 1997, one day before the lien was executed on May 16, 1997. Furthermore, the lien was recorded on December 16, 1997, during the pendency of the enforcement litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Third, Sacker retained control over the property by failing to record it for seven months after it was executed. Fourth, the transfer was concealed and never disclosed before it was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Fifth, as the district court correctly found, Sacker did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the lien. <em>See In re Consolidated Capital Equities Corp., </em>148 B.R. 80, 87 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1992) (holding that what constitutes fair consideration under the 1970 version of \u00a7 8439.03 is a question of fact); <em>Freeman v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>253 F.3d 533, 536 (9th Cir.2001) (reviewing findings of fact for clear error). Tosti argues that the consideration given Sacker for the lien was the securing of a prior debt to her and her promise not to sue him on that debt. Although the securing of an antecedent debt constitutes value under \u00a7 3439.03, that section \u201cdoes not indicate what is \u2018reasonably equivalent value\u2019 for a transfer or obligation.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3439.03 (West 1994) (Legislative Committee Comment 113). Here, Sacker derived little benefit from the securing of his antecedent debt to Tosti. <em>See In re Lucas Dallas, Inc., </em>185 B.R. 801, 807 (9th Cir.B.A.P. 1995) (determining reasonably equivalent value by examining what the debtor received). Any benefit he might have received from Tosti\u2019s forbearance from suit was minimal, particularly in light of Tosti\u2019s declaration that she would not have sued her son in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Because, at oral argument, the SEC abandoned its argument that the transfer was also constructively fraudulent, we need not address Tosti\u2019s appeal from that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Tosti also contends that the lien constituted a valid preference for one creditor over another under CUFTA \u00a7 3432. Even if the transfer could be characterized as a preference, however, a preference is valid only \u201cin the absence of fraud.\u201d <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Postel, </em>64 Cal. App.2d 567, 149 P.2d 183, 185 (Cal.App. 1944). Because Sacker executed the lien with actual fraudulent intent, such a preference would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Finally, Tosti argues that the lien was not voidable because she was a transferee in good faith and for reasonably equivalent value under CUFTA \u00a7 3439.08. We agree that her forbearance from suit on the antecedent debt for an unspecified time period was of minimal value insufficient to support the lien on the entire value of the house. However, the pre-existing debt is sufficient to support a lien to the extent of the amount of the $50,000 note. That is true even if suit were now barred on the note. <em>Ferguson v. Larson, </em>139 Cal.App. 133, 135, 33 P.2d 1061 (1934) (promissory note barred by statute of limitations constitutes valuable consideration). To the extent, then, that Tosti had given fair value, her good faith is irrelevant. Accordingly, we remand to the district court with direction to enter an order confirming the lien to the extent of $50,000. AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b754-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as 9th Cir.
