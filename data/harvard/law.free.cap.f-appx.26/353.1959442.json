Bailey\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenging Bailey\u2019s classification as a career offender. Bailey was informed of his right to file a pro se brief, but he has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Bailey\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We find that Bailey\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertion, the district court was not required to inform him of the possible enhancement to his sentence if he were determined to be a career offender. <em>See United States v. Good, </em>25 F.3d 218, 222-23 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We find no plain error in the district court\u2019s determination that Bailey was a career offender. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2000). At sentencing, Bailey admitted that he was properly sentenced as a career offender; however, on appeal, he challenges the use as a predicate offense of a rape conviction returned when he was seventeen years old. The record supports the finding that Bailey\u2019s rape conviction counts as an adult conviction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l) (advising that an offense committed before age eighteen counts as an adult conviction if the defendant was proceeded against as an adult). Accordingly, we find no plain error by the court in sentencing Bailey as a career offender. Additionally, because Bailey was properly determined to be a career offender, the district court properly overruled \u2014 as irrelevant \u2014 Bailey\u2019s objections to the determination of his relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Bailey\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
