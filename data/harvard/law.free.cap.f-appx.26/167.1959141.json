Talbott appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000) motion. Of the twenty-seven claims Talbott sought to present before the district court, all but three were properly subject to dismissal on procedural default grounds, as Talbott either failed to raise them in his original direct appeal and show cause excusing that failure, see <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 165, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), presented non-constitutional claims which he failed to raise on direct appeal, foreclosing them from consideration on collateral review altogether, <em>see Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 477 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), or duplicated claims raised in his direct appeal, which may not be renewed as a basis for collateral relief. <em>See Boeckenhaupt v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 1182, 1183 (4th Cir.1976). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the majority of Talbott\u2019s claims was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">With respect to Talbott\u2019s three remaining claims, we find none affords a basis for relief. The first of those claims, in which Talbott alleges the Bureau of Prisons is denying Mm non-legal materials necessary to demonstrate that he did not violate federal law, fails to address the validity of his conviction or sentence. Accordingly, it is not an appropriate grounds for relief in a \u00a7 2255 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">In the second claim that was not procedurally defaulted, Talbott contends the district court\u2019s imposition of a three-year term of supervised release represents an Mappropriate upward departure. Specifically, Talbott argues that because the applicable Sentencmg Guideline provided for a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e), and in such circumstances the mandatory mmimum of the statute of conviction becomes the Guidelines\u2019 sentence, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), the total of fifteen years imprisonment plus an additional three-year term of supervised release increases his total sentence beyond the mandatory minimum. However, the district court properly interpreted our mandate in <em>United States v. Talbott, </em>No. 92-6334, 1996 WL 453469 (4th Cir. Aug.13, 1996) (unpublished) as simply limiting the maximum term of <em>imprisonment </em>to which Talbott could be sentenced to fifteen years. In light of that mandate, and the Guidelines\u2019 requirement that the sentencing court \u201cshall order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed,\u201d USSG \u00a7 5Dl.l(a), the district court\u2019s imposition of the required term of supervised release m addition to Talbott\u2019s fifteen-year sentence was appropriate under the Sentencing Guidelines. Because the district court may summarily dismiss any facially meritless claims under Rule 4 of the <em>Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, </em>we find Talbott\u2019s contention that Ms sentence represents an improper upward departure was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Finally, we reject Talbott\u2019s third remaimng claim, that had his attorney objected to the myriad deficiencies enumerated in his twenty-four procedurally barred claims, he would not have been convicted. We reach this conclusion be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>cause Talbott cannot satisfy the prejudice requirement of a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After trial, Talbott stood convicted of a total of eight counts: two counts predicated on his illegal possession of two pipebombs, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c) (1994), two counts predicated on the fact that those pipebombs were unregistered, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1994), one count of making false statements in order to obtain a pistol, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (West 2000), and three counts of possession of the three firearms in question by a felon, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A, \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000). Because there was ample evidence to support these convictions, however, we find Talbott was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s purported failure to raise the aforementioned objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">At trial, the Government presented sufficient evidence to indicate Talbott\u2019s pipe-bombs were intended as destructive devices, and thus constituted firearms as defined by Chapter 26 of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f) (1994). Because the pipebombs were firearms within the meaning of Chapter 26, the additional evidence that Talbott failed to obtain authorization to make or possess them was sufficient to sustain his convictions under \u00a7 5861(c) and \u00a7 5861(d) as to each device.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">With respect to Talbott\u2019s conviction for making false statements in acquiring a firearm, we find the trial testimony as to Talbott\u2019s prior felony conviction and his failure to note that conviction on the federal form he completed in order to purchase the handgun satisfies the elements of \u00a7 922(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Rahman, </em>83 F.3d 89, 92 (4th Cir.1996). As a result, we find there was sufficient evidence to sustain that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Finally, there was sufficient evidence to sustain each of Talbott\u2019s three convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1). The testimony as to Talbott\u2019s design of the pipebombs (which incorporated a principal component that had traveled in interstate commerce), in conjunction with evidence of his prior felony conviction, was sufficient to satisfy Talbott\u2019s convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1) as to each pipebomb. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921 (a)(3),(4) (West 2000) (defining \u201cfirearm\u201d as used in \u00a7 922(g)(1) to include a destructive device or its component parts); <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001) (defining elements of \u00a7 922(g)(1)); <em>United States v. Verna, </em>113 F.3d 499, 503 (4th Cir.1997) (finding the interstate nexus of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is satisfied where the component parts of a destructive device travel in interstate commerce). Likewise, Talbott\u2019s purchase of the pistol that formed the basis for his \u00a7 922(a)(6) conviction was also sufficient to sustain his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) as to that firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">We have conducted a careful review of the transcript of Talbott\u2019s trial, and find that in light of the ample evidence against him as to each count of conviction, Talbott was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s purported failure to raise certain objections at trial. Moreover, our review of Talbott\u2019s particularized objections does not alter that calculus. Accordingly, we find the district court did not err in dismissing Talbott\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Talbott\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the district court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
