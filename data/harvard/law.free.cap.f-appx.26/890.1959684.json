R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-31\">Appellant Amando Padilla pled guilty to a single count of distribution of an unspecified amount of methamphetamine. Based on its findings regarding the quanti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ty of drugs involved, the district court sentenced him to over twenty-four years\u2019 imprisonment, in excess of the statutory maximum of twenty years established by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>Mr. </em>Padilla argues on appeal that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which requires that \u201cany fact that increases a penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The government concedes this error and agrees that Mr. Padilla\u2019s sentence should be reversed and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b920-32\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of. orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
