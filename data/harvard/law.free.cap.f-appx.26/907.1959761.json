R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">This case is before the court on Thomas Lee Taylor\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Taylor seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his petition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Taylor asserted that he was denied procedural due process during his parole revocation hearing, that his parole revocation was based on a citation that was later dismissed in state court, and that the parole board should not have denied him credit for \u201cstreet time\u201d which accrued while he was on parole. In denying Taylor\u2019s petition, the district court concluded that Taylor was afforded all of the process he was due. The district court further concluded it was irrelevant that the citation underlying the parole revocation was eventually dismissed in state court because the burden of proof in parole revocation proceedings was significantly lower than that in criminal prosecutions. This court has undertaken a thorough review of Taylor\u2019s request for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal. That review demonstrates that the district court\u2019s resolution of Taylor\u2019s petition is not debatable or deserving of further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, Taylor has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Taylor\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated June 11, 2001. The appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-9\">. Although Taylor brought his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and the district court docketed it as a \u00a7 2254 petition, Taylor\u2019s petition challenges the execution of his sentence rather than its validity. Accordingly, we construe the petition as arising under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir.2000). No matter how construed, Taylor needs a COA to appeal the denial of his petition. <em>See id. </em>at 869.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
