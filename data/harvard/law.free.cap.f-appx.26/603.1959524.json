McGhghy\u2019s lawsuit is based on constitutional and tort claims arising out of the handling of his property stored in a rental unit in Olin, Iowa. McGhghy also appeals the denial of his requests for postjudgment relief. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the dismissal was proper, and we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of postjudgment relief. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
