We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>387 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appeal-able interlocutory or collateral order. It merely removes the case from the district court\u2019s active docket until the issue of federal funding for stem cell research is settled by the Bush Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">We therefore dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
