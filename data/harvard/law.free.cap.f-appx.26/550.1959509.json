He proceeded through the preliminary steps of the procedure, but his grievance was withdrawn at the arbitration stage by one of the union\u2019s representatives, Jim Hecker. McClimon did not appeal Hecker\u2019s withdrawal through the union\u2019s internal appeals procedure. Instead, he filed this suit against Deere for breach of the collective bargaining agreement, and against his union (International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, Local 434) for breach of the duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Under \u00a7 101(a)(4) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, courts have discretion to require an employee to exhaust his internal union appeals procedure before bringing suit against his employer for breach of a collective bargaining agreement or against his union for breach of the duty of fair representation. <em>Clayton v. Auto. Workers, </em>451 U.S. 679, 689, 101 S.Ct. 2088, 68 L.Ed.2d 538 (1981); <em>NLRB v. Indus. Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers, </em>391 U.S. 418, 426, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968). The district court granted the union\u2019s and Deere\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on McClimon\u2019s failure to exhaust his union\u2019s internal appeals procedure. McClimon appeals, asking us to reverse, but we agree with the district court that exhaustion is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Exhaustion may be excused if any one of four circumstances exist: (i) the appeals procedure itself is inadequate; (ii) the union officials are so hostile to the employee that he could not hope to obtain a fair hearing; (iii) exhaustion would unreasonably delay judicial review; or (iv) exhaustion is otherwise unreasonable. <em>See Hammer v. Int\u2019l Union, et al, </em>178 F.3d 856, 858 (7th Cir.1999). McClimon attempts, but fails, to show each:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">1. A union\u2019s appeals procedure is deemed adequate if it can reactivate the employee\u2019s grievance or independently award him the full relief he seeks. <em>See Clayton, </em>451 U.S. at 689; <em>Miller v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>675 F.2d 146, 149 (7th Cir. 1982). Here, despite McClimon\u2019s argument to the contrary, a binding addendum to the collective bargaining agreement makes clear that grievances ultimately determined meritorious through the appeals procedure may be reinstated, <em>i.e., </em>reactivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>2. McClimon has not pointed to sufficient evidence of hostility. Hecker, the union representative in charge of his claim at the arbitration stage of the grievance procedure, withdrew McClimon\u2019s grievance from arbitration because he believed that McClimon\u2019s defense would not persuade the arbitrator. McClimon argues that this decision was made in bad faith and, for this and other reasons, Hecker, who he alleges would continue to represent him were he required to exhaust, would be likely to withdraw his grievance from arbitration a second time if given the opportunity. Assuming this is true, McClimon\u2019s attempt to show hostility still fails because he has not presented any evidence (or even argued) that the members of the appeals boards with authority to review Hecker\u2019s decision are hostile toward him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Hammer, </em>178 F.3d at 858 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">3. McClimon believes that he has shown unreasonable delay by pointing to the six-and-a-half-month time period between his termination date and Hecker\u2019s decision to withdraw the grievance from arbitration. This argument, however, is waived because it was not presented to the district court. <em>See Dale v. Chicago Tribune Co., </em>797 F.2d 458, 466 (7th Cir.1986). But even if not waived, our focus is on the period between the date of the alleged breach of the duty of representation (here, Hecker\u2019s decision to withdraw) and the date on which the appeals procedure is completed. <em>Cf. Clayton, </em>451 U.S. at 681 (noting distinction between grievance and intraunion appeals procedures). McClimon has said nothing about the intraunion appellate process and it cannot be reasonably inferred from the alleged delay in the grievance process that the appellate process would be delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">4. Finally, McClimon has not presented any evidence to support his assertion that exhaustion is otherwise unreasonable. For example, he argues that exhaustion should not be required because he was not told of his right to appeal. Our ease law clearly establishes, however, that union members have an affirmative duty to educate themselves about their appeal rights. <em>See Hammer, </em>178 F.3d at 858; <em>Miller, </em>675 F.2d at 150. And there is significant evidence in the record that suggests that McClimon knew his rights. He reviewed the union\u2019s constitution and several copies of the union\u2019s magazine that described, in plain english, the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">McClimon\u2019s remaining arguments are foreclosed by prior decisions of this court or do not otherwise warrant discussion. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-5\">. Under the union constitution, a union member may appeal to either of two appeals boards, one of which is comprised of members of the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
