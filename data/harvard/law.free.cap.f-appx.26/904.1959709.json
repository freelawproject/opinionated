R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\"><em>Pro se </em>petitioner Braun filed a \u201cPetition for Writ of Declaratory Judgment\u201d in the district court. Mr. Braun challenged the constitutionality of a state restraining order obtained by his former wife from the Kansas state courts. The district court construed the action as having been filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 and dismissed the action without prejudice pending conclusion of Mr. Braun\u2019s on-going state challenge to the constitutionality of the restraining order. After petitioner filed two motions to alter or amend that judgment and a succeeding judgment, the district court granted a motion for reconsideration and held that to the extent that Mr. Braun\u2019s request for release was filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 it should be dismissed without prejudice pending exhaustion of state remedies. The district court also ruled that to the extent the request for release was characterized as any action other than habeas corpus, the motion to proceed without prepayment of the filing fee was denied and the claims were dismissed for nonpayment of the filing fee. The district court denied a certificate of appealability pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Petitioner now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to pursue his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Determining that Mr. Braun has not met the statutory requirements, we deny his application and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-20\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Braun must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number><em>v.

The petitioner\u2019s motion requesting judicial notice is denied. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
