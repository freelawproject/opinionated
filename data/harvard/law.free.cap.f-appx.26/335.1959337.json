We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, and the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for remission of his fine, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>Nos. CR-97-143; CA-00-792 (S.D.W. Va Aug. 13 &amp; Sept. 4, 2001).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-19\"> To the extent that Harrison raises claims in his informal brief that were not presented to the district court, we note that he cannot raise them for the first time on appeal. See <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
