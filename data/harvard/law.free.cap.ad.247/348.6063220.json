The newly-discovered evidence consists of testimony of the respondent given in proceedings supplementary to execution \u25a0under another judgment previous to the institution of the present action. In those proceedings the respondent testified that his employment by the appellant was at seventy-five dollars per week, that he had no interest in the appellant\u2019s business and no interest or prospect of pecuniary advantage under any contract. That testimony is in irreconcilable conflict with the respondent\u2019s present claim for twenty-five per cent of the profits of the appellant's business. In determining the contested issues the jury is entitled to know that in his previous testimony the respondent persistently denied any interest in the appellant\u2019s business <em>(Arnheim </em>v. <em>Bowser, </em>244 App. Div. 565) even though the entry of judgment in the present action made it necessary for him subsequently to modify that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The judgment and orders should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Present \u2014 Martin, P.
