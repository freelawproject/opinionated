Unlike Robert Frost,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we feel constrained to choose the first road, more traveled as it may be. For the parties here\u2014Jeannine Morse, the appellant, and Erie Insurance Exchange, the appellee\u2014that will make all the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The Acceptance of the Settlement Offer</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">This case arises out of an April 28, 2007 automobile accident between Jeannine Morse and Paula Smallwood in New Castle, Delaware. The accident itself is not relevant to this appeal, and the parties agree that Smallwood was at fault. Smallwood maintained an automobile insurance policy with Nationwide Insurance Company that provided up to $15,000 in liability coverage. Morse maintained her own uninsured motorist coverage through Erie Insurance Exchange. The uninsured motorist endorsement on Morse\u2019s policy contained a consent to settle clause that mirrors the settlement procedures set forth in Md.Code, \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On October 13, 2008, Nationwide offered Morse the full $15,000 policy limit in settlement of her claim against Small-wood. On October 14 or 15, 2008, Morse\u2019s then-attorney notified Erie of the settlement offer by telephone. On October 27, 2008, she notified Erie of the offer by mail. Morse\u2019s attorney did not send the notice by certified mail, however, and Erie claims it did not receive the notice until December 5 or 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In the meantime, on November 3, 2008, without obtaining Erie\u2019s consent to the settlement, Morse accepted Nationwide\u2019s offer and signed a release of all claims against Smallwood. Morse\u2019s attorney stamped the release with a notation: \u201cNothing contained in this release waives, limits, or extinguishes any future claims for UM/UIM or PIP benefits.\u201d Erie learned that Morse had accepted the settlement on February 4, 2009, but did not receive a copy of the executed release agreement until July 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">On November 5, 2009, Erie denied Morse\u2019s claim for uninsured motorist benefits. Erie gave three reasons: 1) \u201cMs. Morse signed the Release agreement and negotiated the Nationwide settlement check prior to sending ERIE the notice as required by [Md.Code, \u00a7 19-511 of the Insurance Article]\u201d; 2) \u201cthe subject release agreement signed by Ms. Morse was a global release and served to preclude any and all claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>including the subject Underinsured Motorists claim\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 3) Morse \u201csettled her claim against the tortfeasor without ERIE\u2019S written consent,\u201d in violation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The Jury\u2019s Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">On June 17, 2011, through her present attorneys, Morse filed suit against Erie in the Circuit Court for Cecil County for breach of the insurance contract. On April 22-23, 2013, the case was tried to a jury on the issues of whether Erie breached the contract by denying Morse\u2019s uninsured motorist claim and, if so, the extent of Morse\u2019s damages resulting from the automobile accident. Morse moved for judgment on the ground that Erie had failed to show any prejudice resulting from her failure to obtain its consent to settle with Nationwide. The court denied the motion. The court also denied Morse\u2019s request for a jury instruction to the effect that her failure to notify Erie of the settlement offer would relieve Erie from its responsibility to provide coverage only if Erie showed actual prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury found in favor of Erie. Morse has appealed from that adverse jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The Statutory Milieu</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Our analysis in this case revolves around two sections of the Insurance Article of the Maryland Code. First, \u00a7 19-110 prohibits an insurer from disclaiming coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that an insured failed to cooperate or to provide \u201crequired notice,\u201d unless the insurer shows \u201cactual prejudice\u201d resulting therefrom. Section 19-110 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">An insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured or a person claiming the benefits of the policy, through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Second, \u00a7 19-511 creates a procedure that allows an injured insured to settle her claim against a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer for full policy limits without prejudice to her claim for uninsured motorist benefits. Upon receiving from its insured a settlement offer from a liability insurer for policy limits, the uninsured motorist insurer is afforded sixty days to choose to consent to the settlement (thereby waiving its subrogation rights against the tortfeasor), or to refuse to consent and instead pay its insured the amount of the offer directly (thereby preserving its subrogation rights). If the injured insured has complied with \u00a7 19-511 but the uninsured motorist insurer has not timely responded or paid out, the injured insured still may accept the settlement offer without prejudice to her uninsured motorist claim, just as if the uninsured motorist insurer had consented to the settlement. See <em>Kritsings v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>189 Md.App. 367, 378, 984 A.2d 395, 401 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>413 Md. 229, 991 A.2d 1274 (2010). See also <em>Buckley v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>207 Md.App. 574, 586-87, 53 A.3d 456, 463 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>437 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>332, 86 A.3d 665 (2014).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>In construing this statutory scheme, we take our guiding principles from <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r of Md., </em>332 Md. 124, 630 A.2d 713 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">[T]he primary goal ... is determining the intent of the Legislature when it enacted the subject statute. We begin our search for legislative intent with the words of the statute to be interpreted, considered in light of the context in which the statute appears. Context may include related statutes, pertinent legislative history and \u201cother material that fairly bears on the ... fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal ...\u201d Where the statute to be construed is a part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention is not determined from that statute alone, rather it is to be discerned by considering it in light of the statutory scheme. When, in that scheme, two statutes, enacted at different times and not referring to each other, address the same subject, they must be read together, i.e., interpreted with reference to one another, and harmonized, to the extent possible, both with each other and with other provisions of the statutory scheme. Neither statute should be read, however, so as to render the other, or any portion of it, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory. In attempting to harmonize them, we presume that, when the Legislature enacted the later of the two statutes, it was aware of the one earlier enacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Even though two statutes may require conflicting results with regard to their common subject, they are not thereby necessarily rendered irreconcilable. Where provisions of one of the statutes deal with the common subject generally and those of the other do so more specifically, the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 131-33, 630 A.2d at 717-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Competing Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Morse contends that the court should have granted her motion for judgment on the breach of contract issue because Erie failed to present evidence of actual prejudice resulting from her failure to obtain Erie\u2019s consent to settle with Nationwide. She does not contend that she complied with \u00a7 19-511. Instead, she asks us to extend the safety net of \u00a7 19-110 to require a showing of actual prejudice for disclaimers of coverage based not only on an insured\u2019s failure to provide required notice, but also on an insured\u2019s failure to obtain consent to settlement. She classifies both as \u201ctechnical\u201d violations that should not merit the harsh sanction of forfeiture of insurance coverage. She asserts that Erie could not have been prejudiced by her settlement with Nationwide because the settlement was for the full limit of the only liability insurance policy Smallwood had.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Erie takes a very different view of the statutory provisions. Erie contends that \u00a7 19-511 created a mandatory procedure that an insured and insurer must follow in order for the insured to accept a settlement offer from a tortfeasor without prejudice to her claim for uninsured motorist benefits. Erie contends that \u00a7 19-110 is strictly limited to denials of liability coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to provide notice or to cooperate, and that it cannot be extended to cover a denial of uninsured motorist coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to obtain consent to settle. Erie views a mere failure to provide notice as something altogether different from Morse\u2019s denial of its opportunity to review the offer and decide whether to grant or refuse consent to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">In a Nutshell</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The issue before us is whether an injured insured\u2019s failure to obtain her uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s consent to settle with a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer for policy limits, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of her insurance policy and \u00a7 19-511, triggers either the \u00a7 19-110 or common law prejudice rules. We hold that it does not. The \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule is not a safe harbor that would excuse noncompliance with \u00a7 19-511. By its terms, \u00a7 19-110 is limited to denials of liability coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to cooperate or failure to provide required notice. Obtaining an uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s consent to settle with a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer is not equivalent to providing required notice. Maryland\u2019s common law prejudice rule is not noticeably broader than \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Section 19-511, by contrast, sets forth a specific procedure an injured insured must follow in order to settle with a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer without prejudice to her uninsured motorist claim. Extending the prejudice rule to also excuse failure to obtain consent to settle would render \u00a7 19-511 a nullity. Reading the statutory provisions in harmony with each other, as we must, we hold that an uninsured motorist insurer may disclaim coverage based on its insured\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 19-511, without having to show actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The Prejudice Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Since 1964, as a matter of statute, and since 2005, as a matter of common law, Maryland has followed a \u201cprejudice rule,\u201d whereby</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">[a]n insurer may not disclaim coverage for either lack of notice or failure to cooperate unless it demonstrates that the deficiency has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq\">See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 106, 122, 767 A.2d 831, 840 (2001). In Maryland, it is the insurer who bears the burden of \u201cestablishing] by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that the delay in giving notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.\u201d See <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>347 Md. 32, 42, 698 A.2d 1078, 1083 (1997). The rule avoids the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d forfeiture that would result \u201cwhen [a] notice provision is enforced in the absence of prejudice,\u201d in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>case \u201cthe insurer suffers no harm and the insured forfeits the premiums and loses coverage.\u201d See <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. 162, 187, 879 A.2d 81, 96 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Although the majority of states follow some form of prejudice rule today,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that was not always the case. In <em>Watson v. U.S.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 272, 189 A.2d 625, 627 (1963), the Court of Appeals rejected a prejudice rule as \u201cnot in accord with the Maryland decisions, nor with the weight of authority elsewhere in this country.\u201d The General Assembly overruled that decision the next year by enacting the forerunner of present \u00a7 19-110, former Article 48A, \u00a7 482. See 1964 Md. Laws Chap. 185. The statute originally was limited to \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d; it was extended to all liability insurance in 1966. See 1966 Md. Laws Chap. 205. According to the Code Revisor\u2019s Note, the current \u00a7 19-110, adopted in 1997, is \u201cnew language derived without substantive change\u201d from former Article 48A, \u00a7 482. In 2005, the Court of Appeals adopted the prejudice rule as a matter of common law. <em>Prince George\u2019s, </em>388 Md. at 187, 879 A.2d at 96 (\u201cIn accordance with the overwhelming weight of authority of courts across the country and the expression of public policy by the Maryland General Assembly as stated in \u00a7 19-110, we adopt the prejudice rule.\u201d). See also <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>418 Md. 300, 322 n. 18, 13 A.3d 1268, 1282 n. 18 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">A. Section 19-110 Applies Only to Failure to Cooperate and Failure to Provide Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Although Maryland courts have now fully embraced the prejudice rule as articulated in \u00a7 19-110, they have uniformly recognized its narrow scope. By its terms, \u00a7 19-110 requires an insurer to show actual prejudice only where the insurer disclaims liability coverage as a consequence of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>insured\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to cooperate with the insurer\u201d or failure to \u201cgiv[e] the insurer required notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Harvey, </em>278 Md. 548, 366 A.2d 13 (1976), the Court of Appeals explained that the General Assembly had already limited the types of failures by an insured that would be protected by the prejudice rule. The version of the statute originally proposed would have required an insurer to show prejudice when it disclaimed liability \u201cfor any reason.\u201d The version of the statute actually enacted restricted application of the prejudice rule to disclaimers based on failure to cooperate or failure to provide notice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">As <em>originally introduced </em>before the General Assembly, <em>\u00a7 182 provided that an insurance company was required to prove actual prejudice </em>in an action under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy <em>where it filed a disclaimer of insurance for \u201cany reason. \u201d The words \u201cany reason\u201d were deleted from the bill prior to final passage. </em>As <em>amended and ultimately enacted, </em>\u00a7 482 required insurance companies to prove actual prejudice <em>only where the disclaimer was based on the insured\u2019s failure \u201cto cooperate with the insurer or by not giving requisite notice to the insurer.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 366 A.2d at 16-17 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In <em>Harvey, </em>the injured insured notified her insurer that she had been in an accident nine days after it occurred. The insurer responded by providing the insured with forms necessary to submit proof of claim with regard to personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) benefits. The insured retained an attorney, and the insurer sent the attorney two reminders that, according to the policy and a statute governing PIP coverage, proof of claim for PIP benefits needed to be submitted within six months of the accident. The insured finally submitted proof of claim seven-and-a-half months after the accident. The insurer denied coverage. The insured brought suit and obtained a judgment in the District Court. The Baltimore City Court affirmed on the ground that the insured\u2019s failure to timely submit proof of claim was protected by the statutory prejudice rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the prejudice statute did not apply to an insured\u2019s failure to provide timely proof of loss, which is \u201cseparate and distinct from a notice of accident.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">We think it clear from the history and language of <em>\u00a7 482 </em>that its provisions <em>do not apply to insurance disclaimers grounded on the insured\u2019s failure to submit proof of loss </em>within the time specified in the policy. <em>That a proof of loss or claim is separate and distinct from a notice of accident is well recognized.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 553, 366 A.2d at 17 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the insurer was entitled to deny the PIP claim solely because the proof of loss was untimely, without having to show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In <em>Phillips Way, Inc. v. American Equity Ins. Co., </em>143 Md.App. 515, 517, 795 A.2d 216, 217 (2002), this Court dealt with a professional liability insurance policy with a no-action clause providing that the insured could not maintain an action to recover under the policy unless and until the amount of loss was fixed by a final judgment rendered after trial or \u201cby agreement between the parties with the written consent of the [insurer].\u201d Instead of trying the case to judgment, however, the insured \u201csettled a claim made against it by a third party but did so without the knowledge or consent of its insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The insured sued to collect on the insurance policy. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer, and this Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">On appeal, we rejected the insured\u2019s argument that \u00a7 19-110 applied to its failure to obtain consent to settle. We recalled the legislative history of \u00a7 19-110, as explained in <em>Harvey. </em>We noted that the General Assembly had \u201cspecifically rejected\u201d an approach that would make \u00a7 19-110 \u201capplicable to any defense raised by the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 795 A.2d at 219. We reiterated the <em>Harvey </em>Court\u2019s conclusion \u201c[t]hat an insurer must show prejudice <em>only if </em>it raises a failure to cooperate defense or a defense based on lack of notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that extending the prejudice rule to an insured\u2019s breach of a no-action clause would \u201cput the nearly impossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>burden on the [insurer] of showing collusion [between the insured and the other party to the settlement] or demonstrating, after the fact, the true worth of the settled claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 795 A.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In <em>Perini/Tompkins Joint Venture v. ACE American Ins. Co., </em>738 F.3d 95 (4th Cir.2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit applied <em>Phillips Way </em>to similar facts and reached the same result, concluding that \u00a7 19-110 did not apply to an insured\u2019s failure to obtain its insurer\u2019s consent to settle in violation of a no-action clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">B. \u201cProviding Notice\u201d Is Not Equivalent to \u201cObtaining Consent to Settle\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Sensing the outer limits of \u00a7 19-110, Morse has attempted to squeeze her situation into one of the statute\u2019s two areas of applicability. She argues only that her failure to obtain Erie\u2019s consent to settle was a form of failure to provide required notice, not that it was a failure to cooperate. In our view, providing required notice and obtaining consent to settle are simply not the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Maryland courts have rejected attempts to equate mere notice violations, which trigger the \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule, with other deficiencies by insureds, which do not trigger the \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule. In <em>Harvey, </em>the Court refused to equate an insured\u2019s failure to timely submit a \u201cproof of loss or claim\u201d with an insured\u2019s failure to provide a \u201cnotice of accident.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">That a proof of loss or claim is separate and distinct from a notice of accident is well recognized. A proof of loss enables the insurer to ascertain the nature, extent and character of the loss and to set reserves accordingly. The chief purpose of a proof of loss \u201cis to acquaint the insurance company with certain facts and circumstances relative to the loss, forming a basis for further steps to be taken by the company, ranging from full settlement to absolute repudiation of liability.\u201d The insurer\u2019s right to a proof of loss, where required by the policy, has been characterized as \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>important one to the insurer, and one in which it is to be protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">278 Md. at 553, 366 A.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In a case that predates \u00a7 19-511, <em>Waters v. U.S. F. &amp; G. Co., </em>328 Md. 700, 616 A.2d 884 (1992), the Court of Appeals noted that a consent to settle clause provides an uninsured motorist insurer with greater protection against undesired settlements than a mere notice clause. The policy in that case contained a notice clause, but not a consent to settle clause. The insured provided notice of a liability insurer\u2019s pending settlement offer, but accepted the offer without obtaining its uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s consent. The Court held that the insurer still was bound by the settlement, even though it did not consent, because it had notice of the pending settlement offer and was a party to the action between the insured and the tortfeasor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\"><em>When the uninsured motorist carrier fails to include a consent to settle clause in the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy, </em>and when the carrier, with notice of the tort suit, does not attempt to litigate at trial the underlying tort issues of liability and/or damages, the carrier will ordinarily be bound by a settlement of the tort suit entered into between its insured and the uninsured tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 719, 616 A.2d at 893 (emphasis supplied). The Court explained that the insurer could have \u201cprotect[ed] itself from an allegedly inappropriate settlement between its insured and the uninsured tortfeasor\u201d by inserting a consent to settle clause into its policy, or by intervening in the action and litigating the liability and damages issues, but it chose not to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 718-19, 616 A.2d at 892-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In <em>West American Ins. Co. v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 723 A.2d 1 (1998), another pre \u00a7 19-511 case, the uninsured motorist policy provided that no judgment against a tortfeasor would be binding upon the uninsured motorist insurer unless the insured had provided \u201creasonable notice of the pendency of the suit\u201d and the insurer had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to protect its interests. The policy did not contain a consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>settle clause. After trial against the tortfeasor proceeded to judgment, the insured made a claim for uninsured motorist benefits. The insurer argued that it could not be bound by the judgment because, at the time, it did not know that an uninsured motorist claim would eventually be made. The Court rejected that argument and held that the insurer was afforded due process because it had notice of the tort suit and an opportunity to intervene prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 723 A.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The insurer also argued that its insured had no right to recover more on a judgment against one of the parties than it already had recovered, because the insured had filed an \u201corder of satisfaction\u201d as to that judgment. The Court reiterated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">that when an insured plaintiff gives his uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier timely notice of the tort action, and <em>when the uninsured/underinsured provisions of the insurance policy do not contain a clause requiring the carrier\u2019s consent </em>before the insured can settle with the tortfeasor, <em>the insured is entitled to enter a settlement or a consent judgment with the tortfeasor without obtaining the consent of or without further notice to the carrier.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 468, 723 A.2d at 7 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In <em>Phillips Way, </em>we rejected an insured\u2019s attempt to equate its failure to obtain consent to settle with a failure to provide notice. As we have noted, the insured in that case had violated a no-action clause in a professional liability policy that, under the circumstances, operated as a consent to settle clause. We explained that, even if the insured had notified its insurer of the pending settlement agreement and had cooperated by giving the insurer an opportunity to decide whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>consent, the policy still would have been breached because the insurer had not consented. Thus, the failure to obtain consent was something more than a failure to provide notice or to cooperate and it did not trigger the prejudice rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">The appellant\u2019s argument, while ingenious, is unpersuasive. First of all, it is not technically true that to obtain American Equity\u2019s consent to the settlement, Phillips Way would have had to notify the insurer of the pending settlement\u2014such notification could have been made by UMCP or even by an officious intermeddler. But even if it were technically true that in order for American Equity to give its consent to the intended settlement, Phillips Way would have had to notify and cooperate with its insurer, that fact is irrelevant. <em>If Phillips Way had notified American Equity of the intended settlement and gave the latter its full cooperation, the condition precedent would still have been breached if American Equity failed to give its written consent to that settlement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">143 Md.App. at 520, 795 A.2d at 218 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">An insurer\u2019s right to consent to settle takes on even greater importance in the context of uninsured motorist insurance. By contrast to a mere right to notice, which does not necessarily trigger anything in terms of the ongoing litigation, an uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s statutory right to consent to certain settlements can effectively put the action on hold for up to sixty days while the insurer makes a decision. See \u00a7 19-511(b). An insurer\u2019s decision whether to grant or refuse consent is not as simple or inconsequential as Morse would have it. The insurer must consider much more than the obvious question whether to waive or to preserve its subrogation rights against the tortfeasor, who may or may not be \u201cjudgment-proof.\u201d By refusing consent and advancing the amount of the settlement offer to its insured, the insurer assumes the risk that it could recover less than that amount, or nothing at all, in a subrogation action against the tortfeasor. Under the law that applies to this case, by granting consent, an insurer became bound by the settlement and waived any right to assert the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of negligence or its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>insured\u2019s contributory negligence as a defense to liability on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">By refusing consent to settle, an insurer takes on the risk that it may later recover less than the non-refundable amount it must advance to its insured, or even that it may later recover nothing at all. In <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Chamberlin, </em>172 Md.App. 229, 914 A.2d 160 (2007), the uninsured motorist insurer refused to consent to a liability insurer\u2019s offer to settle for policy limits of $20,000 and, in accordance with \u00a7 19-511(c), advanced the $20,000 to its insured. The action against the tortfeasor proceeded to trial, and a jury returned a verdict in favor of the insured for only $5,445. The uninsured motorist insurer then sought repayment from its insured of the $20,000 it had advanced. The circuit court denied that request, and we affirmed. We held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">that when a UIM [carrier] chooses to thwart a proposed settlement between a plaintiff and an alleged tortfeasor by substituting payment of the settlement amount, it bears the risk that a jury might return a verdict in an amount less than the amount advanced or in favor of the defendant(s) and it is not entitled to a refund of any amount paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9_\"><em>Id. </em>at 240, 914 A.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">By granting consent to settle\u2014under the law as it stood at the time that, had Morse complied with \u00a7 19-511, Erie would have had to decide whether to grant or refuse consent\u2014an insurer was precluded from later contesting tort liability. In <em>Maurer v. Pennsylvania Nat. Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>404 Md. 60, 945 A.2d 629 (2007), the insured followed the procedures set forth in \u00a7 19-511 and obtained his uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s consent to settle with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. After that settlement, the insured sued his insurer on the policy. The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the insured, ruling that the tortfeasor had been negligent as a matter of law. Nevertheless, the court submitted the case to a jury on the issues of whether the insured had been contributorily negligent or had assumed the risk of his injuries. An affirmative finding on either question would preclude recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ery. The jury found contributory negligence and the insured appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed based on erroneous jury instructions, but went on to address the effect of the uninsured motorist insurer\u2019s consent to settle with the tortfeasor. By consenting to a settlement, an uninsured motorist insurer became bound by it. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 945 A.2d at 637 (quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 739-40, 436 A.2d 465, 476 (1981) (holding that \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clauses in uninsured motorist policies are invalid, but noting that \u201cconsent to settle\u201d clauses have generally been upheld)). A consenting insurer was thus precluded from \u201ccontest[ing] the issues of tort liability\u201d in the insured\u2019s action to recover on the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 945 A.2d at 638. The Court concluded that the insurer in <em>Maurer </em>should not have been allowed to raise the issues of its insured\u2019s contributory negligence or assumption of risk, and the Court directed that \u201c[a]ny new trial shall be limited to the matter of damages.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In 2012, the General Assembly tempered the effect of an insurer\u2019s written consent to settle with a tortfeasor. By 2012 Md. Laws Chaps. 268, 269, the legislature added subsection (f) to \u00a7 19-511, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(f) <em>Construction of written consent to acceptance of settlement </em>offer\u2014Written consent by an uninsured motorist insurer to acceptance of a settlement offer under subsection (b)(1) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">(1) may not be construed to limit the right of the uninsured motorist insurer to raise any issue relating to liability or damages in an action against the uninsured motorist insurer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>(2) does not constitute an admission by the uninsured motorist insurer as to any issue raised in an action against the uninsured motorist insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The legislation provided \u201c[t]hat this Act shall take effect October 1, 2012.\u201d Under current law, an insurer will not be bound by a settlement to which it has given written consent. Notwithstanding its consent, an insurer still may raise in its defense \u201cany issue relating to liability or damages.\u201d Consent to settlement \u201cdoes not constitute an admission ... as to any issue raised in an action against the uninsured motorist insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Although, today, an uninsured motorist insurer may consent to settlement with a tortfeasor without waiving its right to contest tort liability, that was not true at the time Erie would have decided whether to grant consent to Morse\u2019s settlement with Nationwide, had Morse given it the opportunity. By its terms, the 2012 legislation did not take effect until October 1, 2012\u2014well after Morse\u2019s 2007 accident, 2008 settlement, and 2011 filing of suit against Erie. If Morse had complied with \u00a7 19-511 and given Erie an opportunity to grant or refuse consent to settle, Erie would have had to consider the more weighty, pre- \u00a7 19\u2014511(f) consequences of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The 2012 amendment has no effect on this case. Statutes are presumed to apply only prospectively, absent \u201cclear expressions in the statute to the contrary ... particularly ... where the statute adversely affects substantive rights.\u201d See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hearn, </em>242 Md. 575, 582, 219 A.2d 820, 824 (1966). See also <em>Keeney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>130 Md.App. 396, 402-07, 746 A.2d 947, 951-53 (2000). The addition of subsection (f) clearly affected substantive rights, as it drastically altered the effect of an insurer\u2019s granting consent to settle, vis-a-vis both insurer and insured, and did not merely \u201calter[] procedural machinery.\u201d <em>Hearn, </em>242 Md. at 582, 219 A.2d at 824. There is absolutely no indication that the General Assembly intended for 2012 Md. Laws Chaps. 268, 269, to apply retrospectively. On the contrary, the legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>specifically provided that it would take effect October 1, 2012. The 2012 change in the law is immaterial to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In this case, to be sure, Erie never contested Smallwood\u2019s negligence or raised Morse\u2019s contributory negligence as an affirmative defense to its liability on the policy. Even if Erie had determined, before Nationwide extended the settlement offer, that Morse had not been at all negligent and Smallwood was completely at fault, that is not material to our analysis. Although this may be evidence that Erie was not prejudiced by Morse\u2019s settlement with Nationwide, our task here is only to determine whether, in the abstract, obtaining consent to settle is equivalent to providing required notice. As we have determined that they are not equivalent, the prejudice rule is not implicated and Erie\u2019s lack of prejudice in this case is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">C. The Common Law Prejudice Rule is Unavailing</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Morse also invokes <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. 162, 879 A.2d 81 (2005), which, she claims, created a common law prejudice rule that is broader than \u00a7 19-110. In that case, Prince George\u2019s County was found liable for the actions of three county police officers that deprived a citizen of his state and federal constitutional rights. The County did not inform its excess liability insurer, the Local Government Insurance Trust, of the incident or the lawsuit until ten days after the jury returned its verdict. The Trust denied coverage on the ground that the County had failed to give notice, as required by the policy, and the County filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Trust. This Court affirmed, as did the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals held that the County had indeed violated the notice requirements of the policy, but that \u00a7 19-110 did not apply because the Trust did not fit the statutory definition of an \u201cinsurer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Court held that the Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>was required to show prejudice under the common law. In any event, the Trust was prejudiced as a matter of law by the County\u2019s failure to provide notice until after an adverse verdict was rendered, and it was thus entitled to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In holding that the Trust was required to show prejudice under the common law, the Court overruled its earlier rejection of a prejudice rule in <em>Watson v. U.S. F. &amp; G. Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 189 A.2d 625 (1963). The Court took note of the fact that, although no-prejudice was the majority rule at the time <em>Watson </em>was decided, the majority of states now support a prejudice rule. 388 Md. at 182-83, 879 A.2d at 93. Furthermore, the General Assembly\u2019s swift rejection of <em>Watson, </em>by enacting the forerunner of \u00a7 19-110, \u201cannounced the public policy of this state that an insurer must show prejudice before disclaiming coverage based on the insured\u2019s breach of a notice provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 879 A.2d at 96. Thus, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">An insurer may not disclaim coverage to an insured <em>based on the insured\u2019s violation of a notice provision, </em>unless the insurer has been prejudiced by the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Id., </em>388 Md. at 187, 879 A.2d at 96-97 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">To the extent that a common law prejudice rule even exists, it does not extend to an insured\u2019s failure to obtain consent to settle. By its facts, the <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>decision extended the \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule to cover entities that do not meet the strict definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d contained in Ins. \u00a7 1-101, and made clear that the prejudice rule applies to both primary and excess liability insurers. This may support Morse\u2019s argument that the prejudice rule applies to uninsured motorist insurance policies, which are not, strictly speaking, liability insurance policies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s </em>decision remotely suggested that the rule could be extended to anything other than \u201cthe insured\u2019s violation of a notice provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In fact, in a subsequent case, the Court has taken an even more limited view of its <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>holding. In <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>418 Md. 300, 322 n. 18, 13 A.3d 1268, 1282 n. 18 (2011), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxY\">In <em>[Prince George\u2019s ], </em>we\u2014noting \u00a7 19-110\u2019s embodiment of \u201cthe public policy of this state that an insurer must show prejudice before disclaiming coverage based on the insured\u2019s breach of a notice provision\u201d\u2014did \u201cadopt the prejudice rule.\u201d That is not to say, however, that, prior to <em>[Prince George\u2019s], </em>we did not require a showing of prejudice. <em>Section 19-110 requires as much. Rather, we stated merely that, in requiring an insurer to show prejudice when it denies coverage based on a breach of a notice provision, we were not unlike the overwhelming majority of our sister states.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">(Emphasis supplied). Whatever common law prejudice rule Maryland may have, it is not noticeably broader than \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The Statutory Settlement Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Our conclusion that Erie\u2019s denial of coverage did not trigger the \u00a7 19-110 or common law prejudice rules is strengthened by the fact that the procedure for settling with an uninsured tortfeasor is itself a creature of statute. We cannot apply one statute to excuse Morse\u2019s noncompliance with another statute, especially where the two statutes do not overlap or conflict. As we have explained, \u00a7 19-110 requires an insurer to show actual prejudice only where it disclaims liability coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to cooperate or provide required notice. It does not apply where a disclaimer of coverage is based on an insured\u2019s failure to comply with the \u00a7 19-511 settlement procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>In <em>Harvey, </em>the Court held that the \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule did not apply to an insurer\u2019s denial of PIP coverage. Like uninsured motorist insurance, PIP coverage is mandatory in Maryland, unless affirmatively waived, and is governed by its own statutory provisions. See Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 <em>et seq. </em>Consistent with the PIP coverage statute, the insurer had written into its policy a six-month time limit for submitting proof of claim. The Court held that the insurer was entitled to deny PIP coverage based on its insured\u2019s failure to timely submit proof of claim, without having to show prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">In view of the cases, and of the <em>express legislative authorization </em>contained in [Art. 48A, \u00a7] 544(a)(1) [<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] <em>permitting a time limit </em>for submission of the original proof of loss, we think GEICO had a contractual right to deny liability based on appellee\u2019s failure to comply with the condition precedent requiring that proof of claim be made within six months after the accident. <em>This is so, we hold, irrespective of prejudice and notwithstanding the fact that PIP coverage is compulsory.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">278 Md. at 554, 366 A.2d at 17 (emphasis supplied). Similarly, an uninsured motorist insurer may deny coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory settlement procedure, \u00a7 19-511, irrespective of prejudice and notwithstanding the fact that uninsured motorist coverage is compulsory.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">We do not suggest that \u00a7 19-511 removes all uninsured motorist coverage disputes from the ambit of \u00a7 19-110. On the contrary, if an uninsured motorist insurer denies coverage based on an insured\u2019s failure to provide notice or to cooperate, it will have to show actual prejudice. In <em>General Accident Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>107 Md.App. 603, 669 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 115, 673 A.2d 707 (1996), this Court affirmed a circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>insured whose uninsured motorist insurer denied coverage based on the insured\u2019s twenty-nine-month delay in providing notice of the accident. Without deciding whether the forerunner of \u00a7 19-110 actually applied to uninsured motorist coverage, we concluded that \u201can insurer cannot avoid coverage under an uninsured motorist policy on the grounds of an unreasonably late notice, unless the insurer proves that it suffered \u2018actual prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 669 A.2d at 779.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Section 19-511 exists primarily for the benefit of an injured insured. It was first enacted in 1995 as Article 48A, \u00a7 542(b). See 1995 Md. Laws Chap. 516. It was conceived, in part, as a short cut allowing an injured insured to obtain at least some compensation for her injury without having to wait for a global settlement involving both the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer and her own uninsured motorist insurer. See <em>Kritsings v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>189 Md.App. 367, 378-79, 984 A.2d 395, 401-02 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>413 Md. 229, 991 A.2d 1274 (2010). It is a carefully brokered legislative solution that \u201csets forth a settlement procedure to be followed by claimants.\u201d See <em>Brethren Mut. Ins. Co. v. Buckley, </em>437 Md. 332, 86 A.3d 665, 674 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In <em>Keeney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>130 Md.App. 396, 403-04, 746 A.2d 947, 951 (2000), we explained the situation before \u00a7 19-511, when liability insurers\u2019 unwillingness to settle without a release was pitted against uninsured motorist insurers\u2019 unwillingness to grant a release and waive subrogation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We recounted the legislative purpose behind the bill:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Senate Bill 253 [of 1995], which was to become Article 48A, Section 542(b), was sponsored by Senator Vernon Boozer of Baltimore County. The purpose of Senator Boozer\u2019s bill, according to the \u201cSenate floor report,\u201d was to provide a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">remedy to a problem that has existed in Maryland\u2019s tort system for some time. Currently, an injured person who makes a claim against a liability carrier for limits available under the liability policy is frequently not allowed by their uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier to give the liability carrier a full release of their claim. Therefore, if the injured person wishes to make an additional claim for their injuries against their underinsured motorist coverage, they get caught in a situation where the liability carrier will not give them the limits of the at-fault party\u2019s policy without a release and the uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier will not allow them to give a release to the liability carrier. As a result, they are unable to recover funds from either carrier. This dilemma can cause a lengthy delay in settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Senate Bill 253 would eliminate this dilemma by requiring the uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier to: (1) allow their injured insured to settle with the liability carrier and provide a release; or (2) pay their injured insured themselves to fully maintain their subrogation rights against the liable party. Therefore, the insured party gets his money more quickly and the uninsured/underinsured motorist carrier would have \u201cup front\u201d the liability settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The summary of the bill provided in the Senate floor report was terse, <em>viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">SENATE BILL 253 ESTABLISHES A SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN A CLAIMANT IS INJURED BY A PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>INSURANCE LIMIT IS LESS THAN THE CLAIMANT\u2019S UNINSURED MOTORIST LIMITS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 746 A.2d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In exchange for allowing injured insureds to obtain some compensation earlier on in the process, without prejudice to their remaining claims for uninsured motorist benefits, \u00a7 19\u2014511(b) grants an uninsured motorist carrier the right to consent to settlement and a sixty-day period to make that decision. This is true even if the policy does not contain a consent to settle clause. Section 19-511 effectively writes into all uninsured motorist policies a consent to settle clause that applies where the settlement offer would exhaust liability policy limits. See <em>Maurer, </em>404 Md. at 73 n. 4, 945 A.2d at 637 n. 4 (\u201cUnder some circumstances, where the amount of the settlement or settlements, arising out of the same occurrence, would exhaust liability policy limits, the uninsured/underinsured carrier is by statute given the option to consent or not to consent to the settlement. Under such circumstances, there exists a \u2018consent to settle\u2019 clause by statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">If an injured insured follows the settlement procedures of \u00a7 19-511, she cannot lose. If the uninsured motorist insurer grants consent to the settlement, she will obtain prompt compensation from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer. If the uninsured motorist insurer refuses consent to the settlement, it must promptly remit to her the same compensation, as an advance against any future recovery. If the uninsured motorist insurer does not respond within the statutorily established time limit, she may accept the liability insurer\u2019s offer as if her insurer had consented. Upon settling with a liability insurer, pursuant to \u00a7 19-511(e), or accepting equivalent payment from her uninsured motorist insurer, pursuant to \u00a7 19-511(c), the injured insured no longer bears any risk that her claim will later be found to be worth less than the limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. Once she accepts payment, the money is hers to keep.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In short, an injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>insured cannot prejudice her claim for uninsured motorist benefits by following \u00a7 19-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In this case, Morse made no attempt to comply with \u00a7 19-511. Section 19-511 was triggered when Nationwide extended an offer to settle for the full limit of the only liability policy Smallwood had. Instead of sending Erie a copy of Nationwide\u2019s offer by certified mail, as required by \u00a7 19\u2014511(a), Morse\u2019s previous attorney first notified Erie by telephone and later by non-certified mail. Instead of giving Erie sixty days to decide whether to grant or refuse consent to the settlement, as required by \u00a7 19\u2014511(b), Morse accepted Nationwide\u2019s offer and signed a release, twenty-one days after the offer was extended, nineteen or twenty days after her attorney notified Erie by telephone, seven days after her attorney sent notice by non-certified mail, and thirty-two or thirty-three days before Erie actually received the written offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We are mindful that \u201cthe purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u2018that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility law,\u2019 \u201d see, e.g., <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465, 474 (1981), as well as \u201cthe remedial nature of the statutory plan, which dictates a liberal construction in order to effectuate its purpose of assuring recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents,\u201d see, e.g., <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 605, 356 A.2d 560, 562 (1976). Nevertheless, even a liberal construction of a remedial statute cannot excuse total noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Buckley v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>207 Md.App. 574, 53 A.3d 456 (2012), this Court held that an insured\u2019s general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>release, given in exchange for settlement with a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer, that released the tortfeasor \u201cand all other persons, firms or corporations,\u201d did not also release the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist carrier from providing benefits. We explained that to hold otherwise would be contrary to the text, spirit, and purpose of \u00a7 19-511. Nevertheless, we remanded for further factfinding with regard to whether the insurer had consented to the settlement with the tortfeasor. The answer to that question would determine whether the insurer could contest tort liability at trial or be limited to a trial on damages only. The Court of Appeals affirmed our decision in all respects, though it did not reach the question whether the insurer had actually consented to the settlement. <em>Brethren Mut. Ins. Co. v. Buckley, </em>437 Md. 332, 86 A.3d 665 (2014). Nothing in either opinion casts any doubt on an insured\u2019s obligation to comply with \u00a7 19-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">We are not moved by Morse\u2019s assertion that Erie could not have been prejudiced by her settlement with Nationwide because the settlement was for the full limits of the only liability insurance policy Smallwood had. As we have explained, no prejudice rule was triggered in this case and Erie\u2019s lack of prejudice is irrelevant. We note, however, that, if we were to apply a prejudice rule as Morse suggests, such a lack of prejudice would almost always excuse noncompliance with \u00a7 19-511, because \u00a7 19-511 only applies where \u201cthe amount of the settlement offer, in combination with any other settlements arising out of the same occurrence, would exhaust the bodily injury or death limits of the applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities.\u201d \u00a7 19-511(a). We cannot apply a strained construction of the \u00a7 19-110 prejudice rule to eviscerate \u00a7 19-511, a carefully brokered legislative compromise that already is stacked in favor of an injured insured who complies with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Out-of-State Cases are Not Persuasive Here</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Morse presents us with decisions of twenty-eight states which, she claims, apply a prejudice rule to a denial of uninsured motorist coverage based on violation of a consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>settle clause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Those decisions are easily distinguished from the case at bar. Only two of those states, Nebraska<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and North Dakota,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> have statutory provisions concerning consent to settle with a tortfeasor. All the rest have dealt with the matter by common law. Unlike Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 19-511, the Nebraska and North Dakota statutes explicitly contain a prejudice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In <em>Sherwood Brands, Inc. v. Great American Ins. Co., </em>418 Md. 300, 327-28, 13 A.3d 1268, 1285 (2011), the Court of Appeals cautioned against \u201csqueezing] a square peg\u2014that is, Maryland\u2019s notice-prejudice statute, as embodied in \u00a7 19-110, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>and our jurisprudence\u2014into a round hole\u2014that is, the notice-prejudice jurisprudence of other states and jurisdictions.\u201d The Court noted that, \u201c[o]f the more than three-dozen states adopting a notice-prejudice rule, it appears that only two did so legislatively, as Maryland has.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That assessment applies equally to the cases Morse has cited here. We may not read a prejudice rule into \u00a7 19-511 on the authority that other state legislatures have included one in their statutes, or that other state courts have included one in their judicially-crafted remedies, when the Maryland General Assembly has not seen fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Morse argues that our result would be inequitable. Erie, to be sure, made no showing at all that it was prejudiced by Morse\u2019s failure to obtain its consent to settle with Nationwide. The result Morse feels is harsh could have been easily avoided by complying with the straightforward settlement procedure the General Assembly provided in \u00a7 19-511. We will not nullify a finely tuned and completely valid statutory procedure simply to excuse Morse\u2019s noncompliance in this particular case. As Morse\u2019s noncompliance did not trigger a prejudice rule, Erie was entitled to disclaim liability on the basis of that noncompliance, with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-8\">Dissenting Opinion by WOODWARD, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">.

Text is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, viewed in context, considered in light of the whole statute, and generally evaluated for ambiguity. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute.

Similarly, Maryland has a \u201cstrong public policy favoring compensation of those injured by UM drivers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 53 A.3d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The primary reason for enacting \u00a7 19-511 was to eliminate the potential lengthy delay caused by \u201c \u2018a situation where the liability carrier w[ould] not give [the injured persons] the limits of the at-fault party\u2019s policy without a release and the [UM] carrier w[ould] not allow them to give a release to the liability carrier.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 53 A.3d 456 (first and fourth alterations in original) (quoting <em>Keeney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>130 Md.App. 396, 401, 746 A.2d 947 (2000)). Moreover, \u00a7 19-511 sought to strike a balance between the right of the insured to a speedy recovery of the liability policy limits and the protection of the UM carrier\u2019s subrogation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">When the constructions of \u00a7 19-511 advanced by the majority and Morse are considered in the context of the purpose and policy of Maryland\u2019s uninsured motorist statute and the reasons underlying \u00a7 19-511, the result clearly favors Morse\u2019s construction. Morse\u2019s construction would further the public policy of affording protection for innocent victims by allowing recovery of uninsured motorist compensation unless the UM carrier can show actual prejudice occasioned by the insured\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 19-511. Where there is no actual prejudice, an insured who paid for uninsured motorist coverage equal to his or her liability coverage would receive what the statute intended: \u201c \u2018[Compensation equal to that which would have been available had the tortfeasor carried liability insurance in an amount equal to the amount of the injured insured\u2019s UM coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 53 A.3d 456 (quoting <em>Kritsings v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>189 Md.App. 367, 375, 984 A.2d 395 (2009)). In addition, the balance between the insured\u2019s right to speedy recovery and the protection of the UM carrier\u2019s subrogation rights would be maintained by Morse\u2019s construction, because the UM carrier would still be able to deny coverage where its subrogation rights were actually prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>A comparison of the results of the different constructions of \u00a7 19-511 also support Morse\u2019s construction. Adoption of the majority\u2019s view results, in effect, in a windfall to the UM carrier\u2014the UM carrier is allowed to keep the premiums paid for uninsured motorist coverage while avoiding its obligation to pay an otherwise valid claim, where the actions of the insured did not increase the risk inherent with such coverage or prejudice any subrogation rights of the UM carrier. Morse\u2019s construction would protect a UM carrier from any real adverse impact on its subrogation rights while allowing the recovery of compensation under uninsured motorist coverage that was bought and paid for by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Finally, the views expressed in this dissent are consistent with those of Andrew Janquitto, who wrote in his treatise, <em>Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">The issue of whether an unauthorized settlement by a claimant can relieve the claimant\u2019s insurer of its obligation to pay UM benefits is a difficult one.... A short answer is that the 1995 amendment that created what is now Section 19-511 provides a mandatory procedure that must be followed and, if it is not followed, the UM insurer is relieved of its obligation to pay UM benefits. This short answer may not be correct. Of note, Section 19-511 does not indicate that the failure to abide by its provisions relieves the UM insurer of its contractual obligation to pay. Hence, if the UM insurer can escape its obligation, it must do so by relying on a contractual consent-to-settle clause[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] But using a breach of a consent-to-settle clause to avoid the obligation to pay UM benefits is also problematic. Not only is there no provision in the UM Statute that creates an insurer\u2019s subrogation right, there is no provision that states that a claimant\u2019s unauthorized release of a tortfeasor is grounds for the insurer to escape paying UM benefits. Even assuming an insurer could escape its contractual and statutory obligations by enforcing a consent-to-set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tie provision, it should be able to do so only if that is an equitable result. Subrogation, even when it [ ] arises out of a contract or a statute, is equitable in nature.... [A] court must seek to strike a balance between the claimant\u2019s right to compensation and the insurer\u2019s right to subrogation. Certainly, a mere loss of a theoretical right of subrogation rights should not cause the loss of an injured claimant\u2019s right of recovery, for such a holding would not be an equitable one. An insurer, simply put, must show that there was a realistic likelihood that it would have recovered had it exercised the subrogation rights. In other words, an insurer must show that it has been actually or materially prejudiced by the release of the tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Andrew Janquitto, <em>Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance </em>\u00a7 8.12(B), at 471 (3d ed. 2011) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">.
