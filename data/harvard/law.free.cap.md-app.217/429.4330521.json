Has review of the search warrant been preserved for appellate review?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As we shall explain, we answer the first question \u201cno.\u201d We address the second question in the event of a retrial. The third question is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Factual and Procedural History<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">On May 15, 2012, Westray appeared before the circuit court for a hearing to address assigned counsel\u2019s concern that \u201che\u2019s had difficulty speaking with [Westray].\u201d Reminding Westray that an August trial date had been scheduled, the court cautioned Westray and indicated that it \u201cwant[ed] to make sure that [Westray was] well represented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Westray quickly voiced his dissatisfaction with assigned counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">MR. WESTRAY: I mean this man is an idiot, sir. Straight, straight, straight down, he\u2019s an idiot----I\u2019m saying it now. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>You might as well going to kill me. I\u2019m not going into a courtroom with this man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">THE COURT: Have you had the opportunity to meet with [assigned counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">MR. WESTRAY: He don\u2019t do nothing I ask him to do. So what, I mean what, what do I need a lawyer if he here for me, not for himself. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">THE COURT: Are you telling me that you have met with him before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">MR. WESTRAY: Yeah. This man, this man, this man don\u2019t listen to nothing I tell him. I mean he\u2019s an idiot. Look at him. He\u2019s an idiot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">THE COURT: Now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">MR. WESTRAY: Seriously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">THE COURT:\u2014you\u2019ve met, Mr. Westray, you\u2019ve met\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">MR. WESTRAY: Let\u2019s go over\u2014I\u2019m going to tell you this. I\u2019m not coming\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">THE COURT: Just listen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">MR. WESTRAY:\u2014to court with this man, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">THE COURT: Have you met with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">MR. WESTRAY: I will represent myself and I would die first before I, before I, before I, before I come to court with this man, okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">Westray continued until the circuit court turned to assigned counsel for an explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-17\">THE COURT: All right. [Assigned counsel], do you want to be heard on this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-18\">[ASSIGNED COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. I was assigned to represent Mr. Westray. I went out and met him on different occasions. We had a meeting on February 22nd of this year and I was able to get some biographical information from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-19\">I met him on the 28th of February and I got, I got nowhere. He wouldn\u2019t engage with me. <em>I had, I had some </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>doubts as to whether he was competent or not.[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>] I called some family members. I never really got a clear answer about that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">At some point he indicated to me that maybe he was going to try to retain counsel, that maybe family members had the ability to do that. I spoke to his uncle who indicated that Mr. Westray had inherited some money some period of time ago, but his uncle didn\u2019t believe any of that money was still available and that there were no funds in the family for him to retain private counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">I\u2019ve tried to meet with him since. I think I tried to go meet with him two weeks ago and he refused to meet with me at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">THE COURT: Has he ever asked you to do something that you haven\u2019t done to your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">[ASSIGNED COUNSEL]: Not, not to my knowledge. I\u2019ve called family members and I\u2019ve received discovery in the case. I haven\u2019t even had a chance to start to discuss it with him and show him what the different pieces of evidence against him are. He\u2019s indicted in about a dozen first-degree, you know, residential burglaries here in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Counsel\u2019s concerns about the failure to engage with Westray prompted him to request the presence of the District Public Defender for Montgomery County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>[ASSIGNED COUNSEL]: ... I just wanted to let him know that it sounded to me like he, he kept telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re fired, I don\u2019t want you to represent me,\u201d and I\u2019ll go, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s very clear that\u2019s the message I was getting and I was not going to be able to engage him on this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">For Mr. Westray\u2019s benefit, I asked Brian Shefferman to be here. He\u2019s the District Public Defender for Montgomery County. And I\u2019d actually ask Mr. Shefferman to come forward and explain to Mr. Westray how the Public Defender treats requests to discharge counsel at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Mr. Shefferman addressed the court and explained that the Public Defender\u2019s Office \u201cjust can\u2019t assign any lawyer of [a defendant\u2019s] choosing.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">If for some reason, although technically you have the right to represent yourself, Mr. Westray, if you were to say you don\u2019t want [assigned counsel], it would be our policy that we\u2019re not going to assign you a different lawyer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Westray responded that he \u201ccould find\u201d a private counsel and that he would \u201cget money and find one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The circuit court then reviewed the charges and warned Westray that the charges exposed him to substantial penalties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He further advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">So an attorney can be of assistance to you at trial. I mean even if you are guilty of any of these offenses, an attorney can help in the event you\u2019re convicted to explain to the Judge why you should get a lesser sentence. So it\u2019s very important, obviously, that you have an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">Now you already know, because you have been represented by the Public Defender, that you may be entitled to representation by the Public Defender. But as has been pointed out to you by Mr. Shefferman, if you are dissatisfied with [assigned counsel], it is their policy, meaning the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Defender\u2019s policy, that you can\u2019t be represented by another member of the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">In other words, you don\u2019t have the right to choose which Public Defender is going to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">You also have the right to be represented by a private attorney which you\u2019ve indicated to me you\u2019re going to try to do. So it\u2019s very important that you attend to that as quickly as possible, because if you come back here in 30 days when we have the new hearing and you tell me, \u201cJudge, I don\u2019t have a, I can\u2019t afford a private attorney,\u201d then you\u2019re going to have to make that decision which it sounds like you\u2019ve already made, that you don\u2019t want to have [assigned counsel] represent you and you\u2019re going to represent yourself, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend because you\u2019re not a trained lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">Now I\u2019m not suggesting you should discharge [assigned counsel], but I think it would be a good idea for you to at least think about this over the next 30 days. If you get the public, if you get the private attorney, that\u2019s fine. We can deal with that. But if not, in 30 days you\u2019re going to have to tell me, Judge, I want to fire [assigned counsel] or I want to keep him and I\u2019ll respect whatever that decision is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">But that\u2019s the time in which we\u2019ve got to figure out what to do here because I don\u2019t want you to be trying this case by yourself. You\u2019re not a trained attorney. All right? Do you have any questions you want to ask of me at this time?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Westray appeared before the circuit court on June 8 and reiterated his wish to discharge assigned counsel. The circuit court warned him that \u201cfiring the Public Defender\u2019s Office[,]\u201d would mean \u201cdefending yourself or you\u2019re seeking to retain private counsel.\u201d The court indicated that self-representation was ill-advised, and that his reasons for discharging counsel were without merit, but granted Westray\u2019s wish to discharge counsel. The court then cautioned Westray as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">THE COURT: Okay. So what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to confirm with you this trial date which is now August 21st and according to the State\u2019s Attorney it\u2019s going to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>about three days to try this case because I guess there\u2019s a number of allegations. So I certainly still encourage you to get counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">If you get counsel and there\u2019s a genuine reason why that counsel can\u2019t be present and needs a postponement, I would certainly consider that at that time, but for now since you\u2019ve indicated to me that you don\u2019t want counsel, we\u2019re going to keep that court date as it is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">MR. WESTRAY: Okay. No problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Before the trial on August 21, the court took up Westray\u2019s previously filed motion for the appointment of <em>pro bono </em>counsel. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">Your final motion, really two motions, Mr. Westray, are a motion for postponement, which is sort of coupled for a motion for pro bono screening. Now before I hear you in argument, I want to remind you of a couple of things. You were back before me in May because [assigned counsel] was concerned that he was going to be fired and wanted a hearing so I could determine what the status was regarding your counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">And I at that time advised you of your right to counsel because you hadn\u2019t previously been advised since you were represented by counsel. And I explained to you that an attorney could be of assistance to you during the trial. Even if you were found guilty, an attorney would be helpful in explaining to a judge that a lesser sentence might be appropriate in your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">But we set another hearing on June 8th because I actually had tried to dissuade you in May from firing [assigned counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">At the June 8th hearing, I informed you that I would let you discharge [assigned counsel]; however, that you needed to understand that under the law of this state, when you fire your Public Defender, you don\u2019t get the choice of another free attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">And I didn\u2019t find any merit in your reason for firing [assigned counsel]. I think he\u2019s a fine attorney. I know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>you didn\u2019t like him and I appreciate that, but you assured me at that time that you wanted to go ahead and represent yourself. And I told you that if you obtained new counsel and that new counsel had a trial conflict, I would be glad to consider postponing the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">So now here in early August you now say, \u201cWell, I want, I want you to appoint a pro bono attorney for me.\u201d I don\u2019t know that I have any power to do that. The only provision that I\u2019m aware of in a criminal case for representation of the indigent, at least through a state agency, is the Public Defender. And as I said, you\u2019re not allowed to pick and choose Public Defenders. So do you still want me to postpone this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">After Westray responded in the affirmative to the court\u2019s question regarding a postponement, the court denied Westray\u2019s motion for continuance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">The point is now that you\u2019re really, since you let the Public Defender go, you really sort of have the choice of representing yourself or hiring a private attorney, which I understand you\u2019re not able to do. And you did assure me that you wanted to represent yourself. So here we are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">MR. WESTRAY: So be it, man. I represent myself, I don\u2019t need, I don\u2019t need it, brother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">I. Discharge of counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Westray asserts that the circuit court erred by failing to determine and announce on the record that he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d waived his right to counsel in accordance with Md. Rule 4-215(b). The State responds that \u201cRule 4-215 does not require such an announcement when a defendant seeks to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered.\u201d According to the State, the announcement of a \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d waiver requirement is invoked where \u201ca defendant who is not represented by counsel indicates a desire to waive counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The State further maintains that the circuit court did comply with Rule 4-215(b), as mandated by Rule 4\u2014215(a)(4), by conducting a \u201cwaiver inquiry,\u201d and points out that the \u201crecord shows that there was \u2018an examination of the defendant on the record conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, or both.\u2019 \u201d More specifically, the State asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Rule 4-215(b) explicitly refers to a situation where \u201ca defendant who is not represented by counsel indicates a desire to waive counsel.\u201d However, at the June 8, 2012, hearing [appellant\u2019s desire to waive counsel] is the focus of his claim, Westray was represented by counsel. So the language of Rule 4-215(b), by itself, does not apply to Westray\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Westray is correct that Rule 4-215(e) requires compliance with \u201csubsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule\u201d and one of those subsections requires the circuit court to \u201c[c]onduct a waiver inquiry pursuant to section (b) of this Rule if the defendant indicates a desire to waive counsel.\u201d However, the \u201cwaiver inquiry\u201d requirement of Rule 4\u2014215(b) is analytically and chronologically distinct from the \u201cdetermine and announce\u201d requirement. In other words, Rule 4-215(b) requires the trial court to: (1) make an inquiry\u2014that is, ask certain questions, or make sure those questions are asked (\u201can examination of the defendant on the record conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, or both\u201d); and (2) make an explicit decision (\u201cafter\u201d the examination, \u201cdetermines and announces on the record that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">That the \u201cinquiry\u201d is separate and distinct from the decision is confirmed by the plain meaning of the rule and case law construing the rule. An \u201cinquiry\u201d involves asking questions, not making a decision. <em>See </em>American Heritage College Dictionary 716 (4th ed.2007) (defining \u201cinquire\u201d as \u201c[t]o seek information by asking a question\u201d). Moreover, the rule indicates that the determination and announcement is to occur \u201cafter\u201d the inquiry\u2014that is, the \u201cexamination,\u201d indicating that they are chronologically and conceptually distinct. In addition, this Court\u2019s case law has treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cinquiry\u201d as a \u201cstep\u201d that is distinct from the decision made after that inquiry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Synthesizing the case law mentioned above, a lower court should engage in a simple three-step process when determining whether the reasons presented by a defendant who wishes to discharge his attorney are meritorious. The court should first ask the defendant why he wishes to discharge counsel, give careful consideration to the defendant\u2019s explanation, and then rule whether the explanation offered is meritorious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\"><em>Hawkins v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 679, 687 [747 A.2d 759] (2000) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Our review of the circuit court\u2019s compliance with Rule 4-215 is <em>de novo. See Gutloff v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 176, 180, 51 A.3d 775 (2012). \u201c \u2018The provisions of the rule are mandatory\u2019 and a trial court\u2019s departure from them constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 621, 4 A.3d 908 (2010) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 272, 582 A.2d 803 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\n<em>Preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Generally, for an appellate court to review an issue on appeal, the issue must have been raised and decided by the trial court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a). \u201cIn other words, if a party fails to raise a particular issue in the trial court, or fails to make a contemporaneous objection, the general rule is that he or she waives that issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Nalls v. State, </em>437 Md. 674, 691, 89 A.3d 1126 (2014) (internal citations omitted). Here, there was no contemporaneous objection made and the State has not raised the issue of preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">This is not a case where the defendant was represented by counsel and the record reflects a court inquiry that might inform a decision as to whether the defendant\u2019s decision to waive a jury trial was made knowingly and voluntarily. Not only had appellant discharged his lawyer, the record does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>not suggest a meaningful inquiry as to whether his decision to discharge counsel was a knowing and voluntary decision. Moreover, this case extends beyond a court\u2019s failure to use \u201cmagic words\u201d or their synonyms, but rather whether there was a proper inquiry and colloquy to ensure that he was making a knowing and voluntary decision to waive his constitutional right to counsel with a full understanding of the consequences of his decision. As we explain later, that is the purpose of Rule 4-215. Therefore, under the circumstances of this ease, we are persuaded that preservation is not governed by the contemporaneous objection requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>The Right to Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u201c \u2018guarantee the right to counsel, including appointed counsel for an indigent, in a criminal case involving incarceration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>401 Md. 175, 179, 931 A.2d 1098 (2007) (quoting <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 262, 523 A.2d 597 (1987)); <em>see also Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. 623, 634, 980 A.2d 435 (2009). The constitutional rights guaranteed \u201cencompass not only the right of a defendant to the effective assistance of a duly licensed attorney at law but also the right of a defendant to appear <em>in propria persona.\u201d Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 262-63, 523 A.2d 597 (1987) (internal citations omitted). Speaking in regard to the right to counsel in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cConstitution does not force a lawyer upon a defendant. He may waive his Constitutional right to assistance of counsel if he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>(1943) (citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 468, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">To protect a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel, \u201ccourts indulge every reasonable presumption against [a] waiver [of the right to counsel.]\u201d <em>Parren v.

Hence, any decision to proceed without the representation of counsel necessitates a meaningful inquiry into whether an accused has knowingly and voluntarily waived the assistance of counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 272-73, 523 A.2d 597 (internal citations omitted). In other words, the \u201cduty [to conduct a waiver inquiry] cannot be discharged as though it were a mere procedural formality.\u201d <em>Von Moltke v.

Md. Rule 4-215(e). The Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, 13 n. 1, 273 A.2d 156 (1971), regarded \u201cknowingly\u201d as synonymous with \u201cintelligently,\u201d and referencing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed.2004), defined \u201cknowingly\u201d as \u201chaving or showing awareness or understanding.\u201d The Court did so again in <em>Nalls v. State, </em>437 Md. 674, 689, 89 A.3d 1126 (2014). As to \u201cvoluntary,\u201d citing <em>Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 495, 667 A.2d 331 (1995), the <em>Nalls </em>Court stated that a voluntary action is \u201can exercise of \u2018unconstrained will\u2019 and is \u2018intentional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nalls, </em>437 Md. at 689, 89 A.3d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We are not persuaded that the determination and announcement provisions of Rule 4-215(b) are not implicated under the facts of this case. Westray initially had counsel, whom he discharged for reasons found to be without merit. At the hearing he indicated that he would find private counsel. When he later appeared in circuit court before trial he was clearly \u201cindicating] a desire to have counsel\u201d and seeking the appointment of <em>pro bono </em>counsel and a continuance. When the court denied his request for appointed counsel and asked Westray if he still wanted to postpone the case, Westray responded he did \u201cneed\u201d an attorney. The fact that when the court denied his request, he proceeded without counsel did not indicate a voluntary decision to proceed without counsel or that he discharged counsel with full knowledge of the possible consequences. On its face and in context, it appears to be little more than an acknowledgment that the trial will proceed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>That a defendant clearly understands when he or she discharges counsel that the trial may go on if he appears without counsel and that his appearance can be considered as an implied waiver of the right to counsel is essential to a knowing and voluntary discharge of counsel. Even an implied waiver of the right to counsel that is triggered by the discharge of a particular counsel should be grounded in a clear understanding of the consequences attendant to appearing in court for trial without counsel and the court\u2019s inquiry and determination in that regard be reflected on the record. To proceed without counsel because one has discharged counsel with the hope of engaging private counsel may not be knowing and voluntary in the sense that a defendant has made a decision to proceed without counsel, but the discharge of counsel may still be voluntary and knowing in the sense that the defendant chooses to discharge counsel fully aware of that possible outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Valonis v. State, </em>431 Md. 551, 66 A.3d 661 (2013), addressed jury trial waivers governed by Rule 4-246(b). Prior to the 2007 amendment, which took effect on January 1, 2008, Rule 4-246(b) provided that \u201c[t]he court may not accept the waiver until it determines, after an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That Rule, as does Rule 4-215(b), now provides that the court not only make this determination, but also \u201cannounce[] on the record that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Md. Rule 4-246(b). The Rules Committee recommended, and the Court of Appeals approved, similar changes to Rule 4-215(b) and 4-242(c), (d). Prior to these amendments, trial courts \u201clook[ed] to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the waiver was valid.\u201d <em>Valonis v. State, </em>431 Md. 551, 563, 66 A.3d 661 (2013) (internal citations omitted). The <em>Valonis </em>Court, applying Rule 4-246(b) as amended, held that the trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>in the two consolidated cases before it had \u201ccommitted reversible error in failing to comply with the determine and announce requirement of Rule 4-246(b) and thereby failed to demonstrate a valid waiver of [the appellants\u2019] right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 66 A.3d 661 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Just as a jury trial is a fundamental constitutional right, so is the right to counsel and its waiver also requires a knowing and voluntary decision. Confronted with the same language and the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Valonis, </em>we cannot say that the requirement of a determination and announcement on the record of a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel is any less essential than it is in the case of a jury trial waiver. It follows that the \u201cdetermine and announce\u201d provision added to the waiver of counsel provisions in Rule 4-215(b) serves the same purpose, and thus requires no less compliance than the language did in Rule 4-246(b). <em>See generally Valonis v.

State, </em>190 Md.App. at 592, 989 A.2d 785. Concluding that the circuit court was required to inquire whether Walker was eligible for court-appointed counsel, Judge Matricciani, writing for the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Pursuant to Maryland law, two options are available to defendants in criminal cases who are financially unable to retain their own counsel. <em>Davis v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 369, 380, 641 A.2d 941 (1994). The defendant may seek representation from the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Section 16-210(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.) provides that \u201c[a]n individual may apply for services of the Office as an indigent individual, if the individual states in writing under oath or affirmation that the individual, without undue financial hardship, cannot provide the full payment of an attorney[.]\u201d Eligibility for Office of the Public Defender\u2019s services shall be determined by the need of the applicant, which \u201cshall be measured according to the financial ability of the applicant to engage and compensate a competent private attorney and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation.\u201d Section 16-210(b)(l)-(2). The statute lists six factors in determining an applicant\u2019s financial ability: (1) the nature, extent, and liquidity of assets; (2) the disposable net income of the applicant; (3) the nature of the offense; (4) the length and complexity of the proceedings; (5) the effort and skill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>required to gather pertinent information; and (6) any other foreseeable expense. Section 16\u2014210(b)(3)(i)\u2014(vi).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Additionally, defendants may seek representation from a court-appointed attorney. C.P. \u00a7 16-213 provides that \u201c[t]his subtitle does not prohibit the appointment of an attorney to represent an indigent individual by the District Court, a circuit court, or the Court of Special Appeals if ... the Office declines to provide representation to an indigent individual entitled to representation under this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>Walker v.

State, </em>Judge Harrell, writing for the Court of Appeals, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">In conclusion, we hold that, under the prevailing constitutional and statutory framework, it is incumbent upon a trial court, upon learning that a defendant in a criminal case has been denied representation by the OPD and who maintains nonetheless an inability to afford to retain private counsel, to conduct its own independent indigency inquiry, in accordance with the statutory criteria, to determine if the defendant is entitled to court-appointed counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\"><em>State v. Walker, </em>417 Md. at 607-08, 11 A.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Here, the Office of the Public Defender did not decline to represent Westray. In <em>Fowlkes v. State, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cunless the defendant can show a meritorious reason for the discharge of current counsel, the appointment of substitute counsel is simply not an option available to defendant.\u201d 311 Md. at 605-06, 536 A.2d 1149. In short, the court neither erred nor abused its discretion because once appellant discharged his assigned public defender without a meritorious reason, he limited his options to hiring private counsel or representing himself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>III. Search and Seizure warrant based on false information</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Westray also asserts that the search warrants that authorized the seizure of evidence found at his grandmother\u2019s residence and in a vehicle operated by him were based on false or incorrect facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Police obtained warrants to search a residence and a vehicle and ultimately found items belonging to several of the victims of the charged offenses as a result of those searches. In cross-examination, one investigating officer acknowledged that an address listed in the warrant application as Mr. Westray\u2019s address was incorrect and that the warrant application incorrectly stated that Mr. Westray was arrested on January 5, 2012 when, in fact, he was arrested on January 6, 2012. It is well settled that evidence seized pursuant to a warrant may be suppressed when, inter alia, the warrant application contains a false statement of material fact and the person executing the application had either knowledge that the statement was false or executed the application with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See, e.g., Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 [98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667] (1978), <em>Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 226-27, 482 A.2d 886 (1984). It is Mr. Westray\u2019s personal position that the information supporting the warrant in this case rose to this level and, thus, warranted suppression of the fruit of this search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Westray acknowledges that \u201cthis argument was not raised via a formal suppression motion[,]\u201d but urges a \u201climited remand\u201d to \u201cexplore this issue,\u201d or, in the alternative, he blames his failure to bring this to the trial court\u2019s attention on his <em>pro se </em>status.

At the defendant\u2019s first appearance in court without counsel, or when the defendant appears in the District Court without counsel, demands a jury trial, and the record does not disclose prior compliance with this section by a judge, the court shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">(1) Make certain that the defendant has received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">(2) Inform the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">(3) Advise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">(4) Conduct a waiver inquiry pursuant to section (b) of this Rule if the defendant indicates a desire to waive counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. (b) Express Waiver of Counsel. If a defendant who is not represented by counsel indicates a desire to waive counsel, the court may not accept the waiver until after an examination of the defendant on the record conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, or both, the <em>court determines and announces on the record that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. </em>If the file or docket does not reflect compliance with section (a) of this Rule, the court shall comply with that section as part of the waiver inquiry. The court shall ensure that compliance with this section is noted in the file or on the docket. At any subsequent appearance of the defendant before the court, the docket or file notation of compliance shall be prima facie proof of the defendant\u2019s express waiver of counsel. After there has been an express waiver, no postponement of a scheduled trial or hearing date will be granted to obtain counsel unless the court finds it is in the interest of justice to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Md.

We recognize and applaud the efforts made by the trial judge to discourage discharge of counsel in this case and patience shown by him toward appellant in this matter. We further recognize that any omission involved perhaps resulted because the discharge was addressed over several hearings and the motion requesting appointed counsel was not considered until the day of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">.
