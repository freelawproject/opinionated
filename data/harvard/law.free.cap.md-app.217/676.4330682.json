The two stories shared common elements, not least the core fact that Anthony Taylor, the main prosecution witness, was shot and Corey Alexander killed on the night of February 1, 2012. But although there was, as we find below, sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s eventual decision to convict Mr. Jones on a variety of charges, no physical evidence connected Mr. Jones to the shooting, and the case turned heavily on the relative credibility of Mr. Jones versus Mr. Taylor. For that reason, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s reliance during closing argument on a fact not in evidence strayed beyond the bounds of fair advocacy and that the error was not harmless. We reverse Mr. Jones\u2019s convictions, remand for further proceedings, and address one other legal question that could well re-emerge on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Because our analysis relates more to witness credibility than to the jury\u2019s resolution of fact disputes, we begin by recounting the contrasting versions of events that witnesses offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">A. Mir. Taylor\u2019s Account</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Mr. Taylor testified that he and Mr. Alexander were best friends and roommates before the shooting. He knew Mr. Jones, whose friend had been mentored by Mr. Alexander through a program called Life Renewal Services, and testified that Mr. Alexander had begun mentoring Mr. Jones as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">At about 8:45 p.m. on February 1, 2012, Mr. Alexander told Mr. Taylor that he was driving to Mr. Jones\u2019s residence in Baltimore City to give him a ride, and Mr. Taylor decided to join him. When they arrived, Mr. Jones entered the back seat, and they drove toward Cat\u00f3n Avenue, where they had planned to drop Mr. Jones off. However, when Mr. Alexander <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>reached back to shake Mr. Jones\u2019s hand, Mr. Jones pulled out a large caliber automatic gun and said, \u201cyou all know what time it is\u201d and that he \u201cwant[ed] everything out of [their] pocket[s].\u201d Mr. Taylor had about sixteen dollars and Mr. Alexander had \u201ca couple\u201d of dollars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They each threw their money and a phone into the back seat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Jones then demanded they drive to Mr. Alexander\u2019s house, but when they arrived, Mr. Taylor told Mr. Jones that the neighbors had surveillance cameras, so Mr. Jones told him to \u201cpull off,\u201d and they drove instead to a nearby alley. Upon arriving, Mr. Taylor attempted to exit the car, and Mr. Jones shot him in the face; he was able to run to Good Samaritan Hospital, and he said that he thought he heard another gunshot as he ran. While Mr. Taylor was being treated, a Baltimore City police officer asked him to identify the shooter, but he responded \u201cthat it was an unknown assailant\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Good Samaritan transferred Mr. Taylor to University of Maryland Shock Trauma, and while there, he was interviewed by Baltimore City Police officers. During that interview, he explained that Mr. Jones had shot him, and he identified Mr. Jones from a photo array. He remained in Shock Trauma for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">B. Mr. Jones\u2019s Account</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Mr. Jones testified that he knew Mr. Alexander through his brother\u2019s Life Renewal Services mentor, and had met Mr. Taylor through Mr. Alexander.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also said that he began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>purchasing marijuana from them in October or November 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On January 31, 2012, Mr. Jones spoke with Mr. Alexander by phone at 9:37 p.m., then again on February 1 at around 12:30 p.m. During the February 1 conversation, Mr. Alexander informed Mr. Jones that he would be acquiring marijuana later that day and asked Mr. Jones to check back with him later. Mr. Jones called Mr. Alexander at 9:19 p.m., and Mr. Alexander told him he would come to his house with the marijuana. They spoke again at 9:25 p.m. and at 9:34 p.m. After receiving the 9:34 p.m. call from Mr. Alexander, Mr. Jones left the house to meet Mr. Alexander outside. He described a very different interaction with Messrs. Alexander and Taylor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[MR. JONES]: Okay. I got in the car, first [Mr. Alexander] turned around and said hey, what\u2019s up, shook my hand. Then I talked to [Mr. Taylor], he turned around and said hey, what\u2019s up, shook my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">At that moment I noticed my phone had vibrated, so I looked down and saw that it was my girlfriend, when I go to answer it, the phone cut off. So, I said can I use my car charger? [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Plugged my phone up, we began talking, asked me what I was doing all day, I said I was in the house with my girlfriend all day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">Then after that, purchased the marijuana,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] got out of the car, went back in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Now, when you got out of the car\u2014how long do you think you were in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF2\">[MR. JONES:] I want to say I was in the car like ... five minutes tops, but when you talking it could run over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Okay. Now you were in the car five plus minutes, you get out of the car, what happens, if anything, next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">[MR. JONES:] I\u2019m walking back to my house and they honk the horn, they say hey you left your phone. I come back, I get my phone and then I run in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Okay. And do you recall about what time you may have gotten in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">[MR. JONES:] It probably was like 9:40, maybe 9:45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Did you have any situation where you were riding around in the car ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">[MR. JONES:] No. I never left my home. I don\u2019t know where they went when they left, but I went back in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Did you have any involvement with the homicide of Mr. Alexander ... and attempted homicide of Mr. Taylor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">[MR. JONES:] I had no idea what happened to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">According to Mr. Jones, he had no additional communications or interactions with Messrs. Alexander and Taylor that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The State questioned Mr. Jones later on about the make and model phone he had that night, an exchange that will prove important later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And what kind of phone did you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">[MR. JONES:] I can tell you it was a 3G. I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Well, what did it look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">[MR. JONES:] It was a touch screen phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Okay. Was it a Galaxy? [MR. JONES:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Was it an Android?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">[MR. JONES:] I really don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Was it an [iPhone]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">[MR. JONES:] It definitely wasn\u2019t an [iPhone].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">C. The Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">On February 1, 2012, Detective Shawn Reitchenberg of the Baltimore Police Department\u2019s Homicide Unit was assigned to investigate the homicide of Mr. Alexander and shooting of Mr. Taylor. According to Detective Reitchenberg, officers arrived on the scene that night at around 11:00 p.m., and he arrived at 2:00 a.m. When he examined Mr. Alexander\u2019s vehicle, he saw a large amount of blood in the front seat and found two cell phones, some money, a glass bottle, a banana, and shell casings in the back seat. Detective Reitchenberg then described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">We observed the blood from the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. You could clearly see a blood trail that went out of the driver\u2019s side [of the] vehicle] and then up Nasco Place toward Good Samaritan Hospital.... There were several cars that had blood smear marks on them and the blood trail continued on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">The entire scene was processed, photographed and that vehicle was towed to the crime lab bay at the Headquarters Unit to be processed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">By the time we were done, or I was done at the crime scene with the crime lab and other detectives, I responded to Good Samaritan Hospital in an attempt to not only see but speak with the non-fatal victim. But I was advised that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>had already been transported to Shock Trauma based upon the seriousness of his condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Detective Reitchenberg visited Mr. Taylor at Shock Trauma on February 2, 2012. Mr. Taylor provided the detective with the first name of an individual\u2014Antomar\u2014and a description. The detective returned to his office, researched the name Antomar, and \u201ccame up with an individual with the name Antomar who fit the physical description\u201d provided by Mr. Taylor. He then put Mr. Jones\u2019s picture in a photo array and returned to Shock Trauma to show the array to Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor identified Mr. Jones in less than a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Soon after, Detective Reitchenberg obtained a warrant for Mr. Jones\u2019s arrest, and he was arrested on February 3 at about 3:30 a.m. The police executed a search of Mr. Jones\u2019s home, but found nothing of evidentiary value. The detective then spoke with Mr. Jones at 5:50 a.m., and Mr. Jones agreed to make a recorded statement that ultimately was played for the jury. The statement mirrored the testimony that he provided at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The police were unable to find any physical evidence\u2014\u201cno bloody clothes, no gun, no money, or anything else\u201d\u2014tying Mr. Jones to the crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">D. Trial and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Mr. Jones was tried for the murder of Mr. Alexander and the attempted murder of Mr. Taylor, among other crimes, during a three-day trial held between May 13 and 16, 2013. After the court heard testimony from nine witnesses, including the conflicting reports provided by Messrs. Taylor and Jones, the jury found Mr. Jones guilty of felony murder of Mr. Alexander; attempted first-degree murder of Mr. Taylor; robbery with a dangerous weapon; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; possession of a regulated firearm by a person under the age of twenty-one; and wear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ing, carrying, and transporting a handgun in a vehicle. The court sentenced him to life in prison for the felony murder conviction, a consecutive thirty-five year term for attempted murder, a consecutive one-year term for possession of a regulated firearm by a person under twenty-one, and a number of concurrent prison terms. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Mr. Jones presents five questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">1. Did the trial court err in preventing [Mr.] Jones from impeaching a key State\u2019s witness with a prior conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">2. Did the trial court err in forcing [Mr.] Jones to testify before his other witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">3. Did the trial court err in excluding a defense witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">4. Was the evidence of robbery insufficient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">5. Did the trial court err in permitting the State to argue facts not in evidence in closing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">After working through these issues, we find merit in the last, which we address first. Our decision to reverse and remand for a new trial requires us also to address Mr. Jones\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, which we reject. And because his first question presents a discrete legal issue that likely will recur on remand and that has not been addressed by any Maryland appellate decisions, we analyze it as well and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">A. The Circuit Court Erred In Permitting The State To Argue From A \u201cFact\u201d Neither In Evidence Nor A Matter Of Common Knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">Because no physical evidence linked Mr. Jones to the shooting, the outcome of the trial turned heavily on which version of events the jury believed, which in turn hinged on the relative credibility of the witnesses. In the course of closing argument, the State argued that the phone charger in Mr. Alexander\u2019s car, pictured in State\u2019s Exhibit 19, was an iPhone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>charger. This fact, in the State\u2019s view, disproved Mr. Jones\u2019s story because he could not have plugged his phone (which he had said \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t an [iPhone]\u201d) into an iPhone charger during his encounter with Messrs. Taylor and Alexander:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] He said his girlfriend was calling him and he was in the car for maybe five, ten at the most 15 minutes. But his house was just across the way, he said it took him maybe 30 seconds. He was so worried about the phone call from his girlfriend that he needed a charger right then and there, so he charged the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">I asked him, well what kind of phone did you have? He said I don\u2019t know if it was a Samsung, I don\u2019t know. I asked him if it was a Samsung, I don\u2019t know. Was it an [iPhone]? Definitely not an [iPhone]. <em>State\u2019s Exhibit 19, the charger hanging out of the cigarette lighter in the Mr. Alexander\u2019s car is for an [iPhone].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES]: Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: And if any of you have phones you can look at it and see if your non-[iPhone] would fit into this charger. And it was so important for him to charge that phone he had to do it right then and there even though he could go right back into his house where then he charged the phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">(Emphasis added.) Mr. Jones objected, and he argues here, that this argument relied on a fact not in evidence\u2014the \u201cfact\u201d that the charger in the photo was a charger compatible only with iPhones\u2014because \u201cthere was no testimony as to what kind of phone charger it was.\u201d And the State concedes that \u201cthere was no testimony as to the type of phone charger found in the car,\u201d but counters that \u201ca juror applying common knowledge could reasonably conclude that [the] white cord seen in State\u2019s Exhibit 19 ... was an iPhone charger.\u201d We hold that under these circumstances, where there was no testimony one way or the other about the charger and the case turned so heavily on credibility, the prosecutor\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>from facts not in evidence was improper and the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">During closing arguments, \u201c[t]he prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 163, 950 A.2d 125 (2008) (quoting <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429-30, 722 A.2d 887 (1999)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">[I]t is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way----Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the prosecution produces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\"><em>Sivells v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 270, 9 A.3d 123 (2010) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989 (2009)). The prosecutor may also \u201cargue to the jury\u2014even though evidence of such facts has not been formally introduced\u2014matters of common knowledge or matters of which the court can take judicial notice.\u201d <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 438, 326 A.2d 707 (1974). A prosecutor\u2019s artistic license is not unlimited: \u201c[ notwithstanding the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in closing arguments, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial must be protected.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 164, 950 A.2d 125 (citing <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430, 722 A.2d 887; <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 415-16, 326 A.2d 707). But an improper argument does not necessarily require reversal and retrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\u201c[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its independent review of the record, is able to a declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)); <em>see also Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 591, 886 A.2d 876 (2005) (\u201c \u2018[Rjeversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 158, 872 A.2d 25 (2005))); <em>Sivells, </em>196 Md.App. at 271, 9 A.3d 123 (asking \u201cwhether reversal is required because, under the totality of the circumstances, the [comment was] likely to have improperly influenced the verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">1. The prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Although Mr. Jones was asked about the make and model of his phone, the State introduced no evidence at trial about the make, model, or compatibility of the phone charger that appeared in the photograph of the car. In delivering closing arguments, a prosecutor may not \u201c\u2018comment upon facts not in evidence or ... state what he or she would have proven,\u201d\u2019 <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 489, 7 A.3d 84 (2010) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 381, 969 A.2d 989), although she <em>may </em>argue to the jury matters of \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d even if evidence of such facts has not been formally introduced. <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 438, 326 A.2d 707. \u201cMatters of common knowledge\u201d are those matters \u201cwhich every informed individual possesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 326 A.2d 707. Put plainly, \u201c \u2018[j]urors may be reminded of what everyone else knows.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 487, 880 A.2d 288 (2005) (quoting <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 439, 326 A.2d 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Because the State concedes that the trial evidence did not identify the type of phone charger that was in Mr. Alexander\u2019s vehicle, we examine first whether the prosecutor acted improperly in filling that evidentiary gap during closing argument. The State argues that \u201ca juror applying common knowledge could reasonably conclude that [the] white cord seen in State\u2019s Exhibit 19 ... was an iPhone charger,\u201d and the State\u2019s brief on appeal described the widespread use of iPhones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">To say that the iPhone is ubiquitous would be an understatement. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, Apple sold 33.8 million iPhones, up from 26.9 million iPhones in the same quarter last year. As of August 2012, Apple had sold 85 million iPhones in the United States since the product\u2019s launch in 2007. Thus, the fact that iPhones (and other Apple products) use distinctive white cords, like the one depicted in the photographs in this case, is a matter of common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">(Internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted.) But the issue is not whether iPhones are common or popular, or even whether iPhone charger cords are white. The prosecutor argued from the <em>inverse proposition\u2014i.e., </em>that white chargers can <em>only </em>charge iPhones\u2014that Mr. Jones must have been lying when he testified that he charged his non-iPhone in the car. Even if it were true that iPhones can be charged only by white-corded chargers (a proposition we have not attempted to prove or disprove), it would not follow that other brands of phones could be charged only by non-white charger cords.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that \u201cevery informed individual\u201d would know that the charger pictured in State\u2019s Exhibit 19 was an iPhone charger or that it is common knowledge that phone chargers with a white cord can only charge iPhones. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper and the trial court erred in overruling Mr. Jones\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>2. The error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s remark, even if improper, couldn\u2019t have misled the jury to the prejudice of Mr. Jones because \u201c[t]he prosecutor did not ... suggest that she knew based on facts not in evidence that the charger was for an iPhone,\u201d and \u201c[only] directed the jury to a photograph that was in evidence[, so the jurors] could ... decide for themselves whether the white cord was an iPhone charger.\u201d We disagree that the prosecutor gave the jury such a choice. To the contrary, the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cthe charger hanging out of the cigarette lighter in Mr. Alexander\u2019s car is <em>for an [iPhone],\" </em>(emphasis added) and proposed no alternatives. But that aside, the erroneous remark was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">To determine \u201cwhether overruling defense objections to improper statements during closing argument constitutes reversible, or harmless, error,\u201d we focus our attention on three factors: <em>first, </em>\u201cthe weight of the evidence against the accused\u201d; <em>second, </em>\u201cthe severity of the remarks, cumulatively\u201d; and <em>third, </em>\u201cthe measures taken to cure any potential prejudice.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 174, 950 A.2d 125 (citations omitted). \u201cWhile not every impermissible comment by the prosecutor constitutes reversible error, the State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless and must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested error did not contribute to the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\"><em>First, </em>to determine the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark, we examine \u201cthe strength of the State\u2019s case against [Mr. Jones].\u201d <em>Sivells, </em>196 Md.App. at 289, 9 A.3d 123. The stronger the case otherwise, the less likely that an improper closing argument remark causes prejudice, and vice-versa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">If the State has a strong case, the likelihood that an improper comment will influence the jury\u2019s verdict is reduced. <em>See [States v.

Other witnesses testified as to the events <em>following </em>the shooting, but Mr. Taylor and Mr. Jones were the only witnesses to testify regarding what transpired in the hours leading up to it. As in <em>Swells, </em>\u201c[t]here was no confession by [Mr. Jones], nor any fingerprints, photographs, or other circumstantial evidence to corroborate [either witness\u2019s] testimony regarding their observations.\u201d 196 Md. App. at 289, 9 A.3d 123. And although Mr. Taylor\u2019s \u201ctestimony certainly was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, it cannot be characterized as overwhelming,\u201d <em>id., </em>and it was strongly disputed by Mr. Jones. <em>See Donaldson, </em>416 Md. at 499-500, 7 A.3d 84 (holding that where the \u201centire defense centered on the ... credibility [of the State\u2019s witnesses] and the accuracy of their testimony,\u201d and where the evidence was strongly disputed, it could not conclude that the evidence \u201cwas so overwhelming that the prosecutor\u2019s improper statements could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d). This factor weighs in favor of a finding of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><em>Second, </em>we must consider \u201cthe nature of the prosecutor\u2019s remark.\u201d <em>Sivells, </em>196 Md.App. at 290, 9 A.3d 123. \u201cIn assessing this factor, we consider <em>[first,] </em>whether there was one isolated comment, as opposed to multiple improper comments, and <em>[second,] </em>whether the comments related to an issue that was central to a determination of the case or a peripheral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Swells, </em>\u201cthe prosecutor made several improper comments in an attempt to bolster the credibility of [the State\u2019s witnesses, who] were the sole witnesses to events giving rise to the appellant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 9 A.3d 123.

Given the central role of witness credibility, as well as the repeated improper remarks, we found that this factor weighed <em>against </em>a finding of harmless error in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 9 A.3d 123. We compared such a situation to <em>Spain </em>and <em>Donaldson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159 [872 A.2d 25], for example, in finding that the vouching of the prosecutor was harmless error, the Court of Appeals noted that the prosecution made only one improper comment, \u201can isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial.\u201d In <em>Donaldson, </em>416 Md. at 498 [7 A.3d 84], by contrast, the Court found the prosecutor\u2019s improper vouching to be prejudicial error, noting that the prosecutor made several improper comments \u201cthat played an important role\u201d in closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><em>Sivells, </em>196 Md.App. at 290, 9 A.3d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This case does not analogize directly with <em>Swells, Spain, </em>or <em>Donaldson </em>because in each of those cases, the improper remark was either isolated and not critical to a central issue <em>(Spain) or </em>repeated and critical to a central issue <em>(Swells </em>and Donaldson). Here, the prosecutor made a <em>singular </em>remark that related to an issue that was <em>central </em>to the case\u2014witness credibility. The conflicting testimony of Messrs. Taylor and Jones was the centerpiece of this case, so the jury\u2019s view of each witness\u2019s credibility also played a leading role. And \u201cwhere \u2018the case ... was not particularly strong and depended in large measure on witness credibility,\u2019 improper vouching[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] by the prosecutor \u2018present\u00eds] a strong possibility of prejudicial effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 9 A.3d 123 (quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ing <em>United States v.

This factor weighs <em>at best </em>neutrally, and perhaps slightly in Mr. Jones\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Finally, </em>to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s remark misled or was likely to mislead the jury to the prejudice of Mr. Jones, we ask \u201cwhether or not the trial court took any appropriate action ... such as informing the jury that the remark was improper, striking the remark and admonishing the jury to disregard it.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 423-24, 326 A.2d 707. \u201c[T]o be sufficiently curative, the judge must instruct <em>contemporaneously and specifically </em>to address the issue such that the jury understands that the remarks are improper and are not evidence to be considered in reaching a verdict.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 177-78, 950 A.2d 125 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Miller v.

The judge gave the general instruction that closing arguments are \u201cnot evidence and ... should not [be] give[n] any weight or consideration,\u201d but gave that instruction <em>before </em>the prosecutor made the improper remark. Indeed, by overruling Mr. Jones\u2019s objection to the remark, the trial judge exacerbated the resulting prejudice of the comment by giving the remark a tacit stamp of approval. <em>See Lee, </em>405 Md. at 178, 950 A.2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Taken as a whole, we cannot find that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark in no way influenced the jury. \u201cTherefore, \u2018such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and reversal is mandated,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 179, 950 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665), and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">B.

We further decline to second-guess any reasonable inferences drawn by the fact-finder or to reweigh the fact-finder\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence. If the evidence either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then we will affirm the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\"><em>Jones v.

He concedes that the victims, in response to the alleged robber\u2019s gun-point demands, \u201ctossed their phones and some money into the back seat,\u201d but contends that a rational juror could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contents <em>found </em>in the back seat were any less than the contents <em>thrown </em>there.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">At trial, Rodney Montgomery, a Crime Laboratory Technician for the Baltimore City Police, and Detective Reitchenberg testified about the items they found in the back seat of the vehicle. Mr. Montgomery identified most of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] All right, and what was the total of dollar bills that were there in the backseat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">[MR. MONTGOMERY:] Five dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] A total of five dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">[MR. MONTGOMERY:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">[COUNSEL FOR MR. JONES:] Now you said that you recovered two cell phones and a cell phone case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>[MR. MONTGOMERY:] No, I didn\u2019t recover the cell phones. Those were recovered by the detective. I recovered the cell phone case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Then Detective Reitchenberg closed the loop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And could you describe the condition of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">[DETECTIVE REITCHENBERG:] ... There were items in the back of the car. There was two cell phones, there was some U.S. currency, I believe there was a glass bottle back there, or a plastic bottle. There was a banana, I remember it being back there. Shell casings were also found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Between the two officers, the testimony easily supports a finding that five dollars and two cell phones were <em>found </em>in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Mr. Jones argues that \u201cwhile one might speculate that more than $5 and more than 2 phones were thrown into the back seat, there is no evidence from which a rational juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the case.\u201d We disagree. If the State introduced evidence showing that Messrs. Taylor and Alexander threw money and/or items into the back seat in excess of that recovered, it follows logically that a rational juror could have found that the alleged robber took their property. And it doesn\u2019t matter if Mr. Jones took less than all of the property the victims threw into the back <em>seat\u2014if </em>he robbed them of some of it and left some, he still robbed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The testimony of the victims themselves bolsters the point. Mr. Taylor testified that he and Mr. Alexander threw phones and <em>money </em>into the back seat in response to the robber\u2019s gunpoint demands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And do you remember how much money you had on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">[MR. TAYLOR:] I probably had about $16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And then what did you do with your money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>[MR. TAYLOR:] I just threw it in the back seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgI\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And what else, if anything, did you throw back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">[MR. TAYLOR:] A cell phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">[MR. TAYLOR:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] What about Mr. Alexander?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">[MR. TAYLOR:] I know he gave him his phone. I believe he gave him his wallet and some, he had like I guess a couple of dollars in his pocket because I seen him throw some money back there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">By their reckoning, the victims threw, at a minimum, eighteen dollars (sixteen from Mr. Taylor and \u201ca couple\u201d from Mr. Alexander), two cell phones (one from each victim), and a wallet into the back seat. Coupled with the officers\u2019 testimony that five dollars and two cell phones were later found in the vehicle, a rational juror could deduce that the alleged robber took at least thirteen dollars and a wallet from the victims. The first element of robbery with a dangerous weapon\u2014 taking property from the victims\u2014was therefore satisfied. And because Mr. Jones does not challenge the evidentiary support for the crime\u2019s remaining three elements, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Jones committed the crime of robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">C. Attempted Second-Degree Murder Is Neither An Infamous Crime Nor Relevant To Credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\"><em>Finally, </em>Mr. Jones contends that the trial court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>precluding him from impeaching Mr. Taylor with a prior conviction for attempted second-degree murder entered more than fourteen years before trial. He argues that the court incorrectly balanced \u201cthe probative value of this evidence against the possibility of prejudice to [Mr.] Taylor or the State,\u201d and that the court erred by failing to consider attempted second-degree murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>as \u201cthe moral equivalent of an infamous crime.\u201d No reported decision has addressed this particular crime, and we hold that the balancing of probative value and prejudice was unnecessary because attempted second-degree murder fails at the threshold of Maryland Rule 5-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Rule 5-609 governs the admission of evidence of a conviction for the purpose of impeaching a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">(a) Generally. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during examination of the witness, but only if (1) the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and (2) the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or objecting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">(b) Time limit. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this Rule if a period of more than 15 years has elapsed since the date of the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 698, 967 A.2d 790 (2009), the Court of Appeals applied the test it delineated in <em>State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 947 A.2d 519 (2008), which held that the Rule 5-609 analysis stops if the crime underlying the prior conviction does not qualify either as infamous or relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">First, subsection (a) sets forth the \u201celigible universe\u201d for what convictions may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. This universe consists of two categories: (1) \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d and (2) \u201cother crimes relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d Infamous crimes include treason, common law felonies, and other crimes classified as <em>crimen falsi If a crime does not fall within one of the two categories, then it is inadmissible and the analysis ends. </em>This threshold question of whether or not a crime bears upon credibility is a matter of law. If a crime falls within one of the two categories in the eligible universe, then the second step is for the proponent to establish that the conviction was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>more than 15 years old, that it was not reversed on appeal, and that it was not the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. Finally, in order to admit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the trial court must determine that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or objecting party.

Crimes \u201cbearing] upon a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d are crimes that \u201ctend[ ] to show that the offender is unworthy of belief,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 484, 947 A.2d 519, and two types of crimes meet this standard: <em>first, </em>those crimes \u201cwhere \u2018the crime itself, by its elements ... clearly identifies] the prior conduct of the witness that tends to show he is unworthy of belief,\u2019 \u201d <em>Thurman v. State, </em>211 Md.App. 455, 464, 65 A.3d 730 (2013) (quoting <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 484, 947 A.2d 519), and <em>second, </em>those crimes where \u201cthe perpetrator \u2018lives a life of secrecy\u2019 and engages in \u2018dissembling in the course of [the crime], being prepared to say whatever is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>required by the demands of the moment, whether the truth or a lie.\u2019 \u201d <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 484, 947 A.2d 519 (internal citations omitted) (quoting <em>Giddens, </em>335 Md. at 217, 642 A.2d 870). The crime of attempted second-degree murder<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> fits within neither category.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">No Maryland appellate court has addressed whether an attempted second-degree murder conviction has sufficient relevance to a witness\u2019s credibility such that it should be admissible for impeachment, but we draw from cases analyzing a similar crime\u2014assault with <em>intent </em>to murder. In <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 482 A.2d 474 (1984), the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[b]ecause the overt act necessary for an attempt is frequently an assault, the [crimes of attempted murder and assault with intent to murder] have a significant overlap. But the overlap is not complete, because an overt act can qualify as an attempt and yet not rise to the level of an assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 482 A.2d 474. That said, the Court held that \u201cthe two [crimes] are almost identical,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130, 482 A.2d 474 (quoting R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>578 (2d ed.1969)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">[A]n assault with intent to commit a particular crime is, in general, the same as an attempt to commit the crime except for two additional requirements\u2014(1) a greater degree of proximity, and (2) actual present ability to commit a battery (the latter being limited chiefly to states in which this has been added by the statutory definition of assault).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><em>Id. </em>For present purposes, the two crimes are the same at their core: both involve a physical act committed with the intent to cause the death of the victim, if perhaps unsuccessfully, and we see no reason to treat a conviction for these crimes differently in analyzing their relevance to a witness\u2019s credibility-</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>And unlike attempted second-degree murder, Maryland appellate decisions <em>have </em>analyzed the relevance of prior convictions for assault with intent to murder. In <em>State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510 A.2d 253 (1986), the Court of Appeals held that a conviction for assault and battery was inadmissible for impeachment purposes because \u201c[a]cts of violence ... generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty or veracity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 510 A.2d 253 (quoting <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 936, 940 (D.C.Cir.1967)). Later, in <em>Fulp v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 157, 745 A.2d 438 (2000), we extended this principle to the crime of assault with intent to murder, despite accepting that \u201cthe crime of assault with intent to murder is far more serious than the crime discussed in <em>Duckett</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQn\">[T]he fact that an accused has committed [assault with intent to murder] does not tell us anything about the truth telling propensity of the accused. There is simply no relationship between the disposition to commit such a crime and the disposition to be untruthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">Many assaults with intent to murder are committed due to inebriation, bad temper, or jealousy\u2014or a combination of all three. Because it cannot be said, as a generalization, that persons who are guilty of the crime of assault with intent to murder are likely to be dishonest, <em>trial judges should not admit evidence of such convictions for impeachment purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 167, 745 A.2d 438 (emphasis added). In other words, \u201c[t]he impeachment value of the crime of assault with intent to murder is close to zero.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 745 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We see no principled basis on which to distinguish the holdings in <em>Hardy </em>and <em>Fulp, </em>and thus no reason not to apply the principle delineated in Duckett\u2014that \u201c \u2018[a]cts of violence ... generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty or veracity,\u2019 \u201d 306 Md. at 512, 510 A.2d 253 (quoting <em>Gordon, </em>383 F.2d at 940)\u2014to a prior conviction for attempted second-degree murder. We hold, therefore, that a conviction for attempted second-degree murder is not a \u201ccrime relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d <em>King, </em>407 Md. at 698, 967 A.2d 790, and that the circuit court correctly precluded Mr. Jones from impeaching Mr. Taylor with that conviction. And because attempted second-degree murder is neither an infamous crime nor a crime relevant to credibility, \u201cit is inadmissible and the analysis ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699, 967 A.2d 790 (quoting <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 477, 947 A.2d 519).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

Even so, the evidence, viewed in the State's favor, established these remaining elements. Assuming for the moment that Mr. Jones in fact took property from the alleged victims, Mr. Taylor testified that Mr. Jones entered the vehicle, pulled out a large-caliber automatic gun, and said \"you all know what time it is,\u201d and \"let me get your money, your phone, ... your wallet, I want everything out of your pockets.\u201d If Mr. Jones took the property the victims threw into the back seat, Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony would support a finding that he did so by threat of force, used a dangerous weapon in committing the robbery, and intended to deprive the victims of their property. All that remains, then, is whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Mr. Jones took the victims' property in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. Mr. Jones initially argues in his brief that \"[t]here is no doubt that attempted murder is an infamous crime,\u201d yet he backs off this contention in the following paragraph to say that \"while attempted murder is not an infamous crime, it does have some probative value for impeachment based on its similarity to the common law felony of murder, which is categorically included in the rule itself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">.
