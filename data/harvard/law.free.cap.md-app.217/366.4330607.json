(\u201cDr. Moffett\u201d). The trial court dismissed the case because counsel for Ms. Valentine-Bowers had failed repeatedly to comply with discovery deadlines, including orders of the court. We find no abuse of discretion in that decision and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Ms. Valentine-Bowers alleged that between February 2006 and August 2008, TRG and Dr. Moffett, among others, failed to monitor a condition in her right eye that ultimately caused her to lose vision in that eye. The appellees dispute the merits of her claim, but the underlying substance doesn\u2019t matter to this appeal. The procedural history does, beginning after Ms. Valentine-Bowers served her Complaint, <em>first </em>on TRG, on November 4, 2011,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>second, </em>on Dr. Moffett on December 2, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">On December 2, 2011, TRG filed an Answer, along with Interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents. Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s responses were due on December 30, 2011 under Maryland Rules 2-421 (b) (with respect to the Interrogatories) and 2-422(c) (with respect to the Request for Production), but she did not file them. Her failure to comply with the deadline is unremarkable\u2014parties routinely miss this deadline and litigators know that absolute compliance is not always possible (although they do, and should, expect at least a request for an extension and a good faith deadline in return).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>But after nearly two more months had passed with no response, TRG\u2019s counsel wrote to counsel for Ms. Valentine-Bowers on February 29, 2012, asking when he intended to provide discovery responses and when Ms. Valentine-Bowers would be available for her deposition. Her counsel again failed to respond, and TRG\u2019s counsel sent a second letter on March 15, 2012. This time around, counsel upped the ante, warning that if he received no response by March 23, 2012, he would file a motion with the court and unilaterally note the deposition. Neither a response nor a motion followed right away, and counsel for TRG even waited until April 27, 2012 before he called and left follow-up messages for Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel. Again, he received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On May 4, 2012, in what he characterized as \u201can attempt to stir [her] into action,\u201d TRG\u2019s counsel noted Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s deposition for July 6, 2012. Then, on May 7, 2012 TRG filed a Motion to Compel Discovery seeking a court order requiring that Ms. Valentine-Bowers respond to the Interrogatories and Request for Production. Her counsel neither filed an opposition nor contacted counsel for TRG in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On May 31, 2012, the circuit court granted TRG\u2019s Motion to Compel and ordered Ms. Valentine-Bowers to \u201cprovide\u201d answers to interrogatories and \u201cproduce\u201d the requested documents by June 18, 2012\u2014with the express warning that if she failed to do so she \u201cmay be subject to sanctions and/or penalties ordered by this Court.\u201d Evidently, however, this motion was not docketed, and counsel for Ms. Valentine-Bowers claims not to have received it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are prepared to assume for present purposes that counsel never did receive the motion, and that could explain why counsel never complied with the Order. But after more silence followed, TRG filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>another Motion for Sanctions on June 27, 2012 (a motion counsel indisputably <em>did </em>receive), in which it sought dismissal based on Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to comply with the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Dr. Moffett had a similar experience that occasioned a similar series of motions. She filed an Answer on December 29, 2011 and served Interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents on December 20, 2011. Dr. Moffett\u2019s counsel wrote to Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel on January 31, 2012 because he had not received any responses. It appears that one conversation took place thereafter, as a March 7, 2012 letter from Dr. Moffett\u2019s counsel referred to a two-week extension based on a discussion between counsel \u201c[a]t the end of January.\u201d Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel apparently did not comply with that extension, and that letter drew no response. Dr. Moffett\u2019s counsel tried calling counsel on May 4, 2012, and again received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">So on May 8, 2012, Dr. Moffett filed a Motion to Compel based on Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to respond to the Interrogatories or the Request for Production. The court denied that motion because it lacked the required Rule 2-431 Certificate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Moffett filed a Second Motion to Compel on June 5, 2012 that attached a proper Certificate; that motion went unopposed and the Court granted it on July 5, 2012. The July 5 Order contained the same directives and warning as the May 31 Order, <em>i.e., </em>that Ms. Valentine-Bowers was to \u201cprovide full and complete Answers to Interrogatories and to produce all requested documents,\u201d this time to Dr. Moffett, \u201cby or before July 12, 2012,\u201d or she would be subject to sanctions. Handwritten notations on the Order indicate that the trial judge\u2019s law clerk actually <em>called </em>Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel to make him aware of the Order\u2019s contents, a point counsel acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The noted deposition date of July 6 arrived, and, although counsel for all defendants appeared at TRG\u2019s counsel\u2019s offices according to the Notice, Ms. Valentine-Bowers and her counsel did not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, on July 9, 2012, TRG filed a Supplemental Memorandum in support of the Motion for Sanctions, and cited this additional discovery failure as a reason to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The trial court\u2019s second compliance deadline, July 12, came and went, and the appellees heard nothing from Ms. Valentine-Bowers. We say \u201cheard nothing from\u201d because according to her counsel, the appellees \u201cwere served with\u201d Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s answers to \u201call outstanding discovery on or about July 12, 2012,\u201d but that\u2019s not quite true. In fact, Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel <em>mailed unexecuted </em>Answers to Interrogatories on July 12, 2012. Counsel for the appellees received the unexecuted answers on July 16, 2012. Counsel for Ms. Valentine-Bowers mailed the signature page, dated July 13, 2012, on July 17, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After receiving the unexecuted, undated responses, the appellees consolidated all grounds for dismissal in <em>one </em>motion, the \u201cDefendants\u2019 Joint Motion for Sanctions\u201d (the \u201cJoint Motion\u201d), which they filed on July 20, 2012. In support of the Joint Motion, and as a basis for dismissing the case, the appellees cited Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s multiple failures to respond to outstanding discovery, her failure to appear for her deposition, and her failure to comply with the July 5 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The trial court held a hearing on October 5, 2012 (\u201cthe Hearing\u201d). TRG\u2019s counsel argued that the case warranted dismissal <em>first, </em>because of Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to comply with the Court\u2019s July 5 Order by failing to provide interrogatory responses by July 12, and <em>second, </em>because of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>failure to appear at her properly noticed deposition. He also cited counsel\u2019s repeated failure to respond to any inquiries about the status of the discovery responses. Counsel for Ms. Valentine-Bowers argued not only that he had complied with all discovery deadlines but also, perhaps on the theory that the best defense is a good offense, that the <em>defendants </em>delayed discovery by waiting to pursue expert depositions and unjustifiably sought the \u201cwindfall\u201d of dismissal. Counsel blamed delays on his side mainly on his client, whom he evidently had had difficulty contacting.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The court granted the Joint Motion (clarifying as much at the end of the hearing), which rendered TRG\u2019s and Dr. Moffett\u2019s separate motions moot. The court pointed out that Ms. Valentine-Bowers filed the original Complaint on March 24, 2010, and it then reviewed the chronology of the discovery motions, noting her obligation to communicate with, and remain accessible to, her counsel as a plaintiff in litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATz\">A look through the file shows that numerous motions to compel ... were filed by [TRG,] all going unanswered. That the Court issued orders in these cases, one on May 31st, 2012, requiring that [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] ... be and hereby is ordered to provide full and complete answers to interrogatories and produce all requested documents to [TRG] by or before [June 18]. The last order that, if [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] fails to provide said discovery to [TRG] by or before the aforementioned date, [she] may be subject to sanctions and/or penalties ordered by the Court. No discovery was provided by [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Second motions or additional motions to compel were filed by [appellees]. An order again was granted and issued by this Court dated July 5th, 2012. Again, I read from that order. That pursuant to representation by [Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s] counsel, she be and hereby is ordered to provide full and complete answers to interrogatories and produce all requested documents to [Dr. Moffett] by or before July 12th, 2012. The last order paragraph, that if [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] fails to provide said discovery to [Dr. Moffett] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>by or before the aforementioned date, [she] may be subject to sanctions and/or penalties as ordered by this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">And obviously having reviewed the file in the great detail I have, outlining these two order[s] most notably, clearly there\u2019s been a failure to comply by [Ms. Valentine-Bowers]. [Plaintiffs counsel] in his representations to the Court says well, we haven\u2019t complied, we haven\u2019t responded because I just didn\u2019t know where my client was. It certainly appears to the Court that he attempted to reach her by accepting his representations as true. He\u2019s an officer of the court. That he attempted to reach her, was unable to do so despite his numerous attempts. That finally, at some point he was able to reach her, and you know, inquired as to, you know, what\u2019s going on. Are you interested in this case? She says yes, and her information is changed and her e-mail however, appeared to remain the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">Certainly the Court recognizes the duty upon [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] to keep herself in contact with her counsel. If her address changes, her numbers change, as this Court is aware of, and the counsels as well. It\u2019s certainly [her] responsibility to keep her counsel informed. Even though it appeared that at a minimum her e-mail address remained the same and [her] counsel indicates he attempted or many times did send e-mails and had no response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">But nonetheless, the requirement is hers to remain in contact with her counsel, and I would concur with [TRG\u2019s counsel\u2019s] representation that an individual who initiated a complaint such as this, remain interested in its pursuit would at a minimum have remained in contact with her counsel. And it appears many months have gone by where she didn\u2019t. And a simple apology isn\u2019t really, while recognized and accepted, is not the remedy of which the Court can rely upon. Recognize in this case that it\u2019s a medical malpractice action. That it requires discovery. It requires a lot of effort and work be placed on the parties, most notably in this case, [appellees,] to be able to defend against this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The court then detailed the five factors a trial court should consider in determining whether dismissal is the appropriate sanction for a party\u2019s failure to comply with discovery, <em>see Hossainkhail v. Gebrehiwot, </em>143 Md.App. 716, 725-26, 795 A.2d 816 (2002), and concluded that dismissal was justified here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">I was provided and have reviewed <em>[Hossainkhail, </em>which] outlines for the Court ... what we should consider in determining whether to impose discovery sanctions. And it outlines [first,] whether the discovery violation was technical or substantial. And clearly in this case, it was substantial. It was a complete disregard of discovery requests, numerous, as outlined by motions, by a failure to comply with a Court order[. Second,] the timing of the ultimate disclosure. It appears that three to four days after the deadline for the order was, the discovery appeared to be responded, provided. It was unexecuted answers. So I don\u2019t find that the ultimate discovery was provided. I find that it was incomplete and certainly outside, well outside the orders of this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\"><em>[Third, </em>the] reason for the violation as provided, in this case the reason is, they just couldn\u2019t find [Ms. Valentine-Bowers]. They just tried to reach her, couldn\u2019t find her for all these months, didn\u2019t know where she was, and she did not contact her counsel despite knowing that she had filed this medical malpractice [action] against these many defendants. Despite knowing that she would need to remain in contact with her counsel to be able to participate. <em>[Fourth, </em>the] degree of prejudice of the parties offering or imposing the evidence. In this case, the prejudice to [appellees] is great. There\u2019s case law, and I think one of the ones cited was the <em>Hart </em>case, where it talks about the long delay and what the detriment is to the party seeking the discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The memory of witnesses .fade. The ability to locate witnesses becomes an issue. And so, certainly the Court can find prejudice exists to [appellees] in this case when a long time passes, such as in this case, when [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] has failed to respond to discovery. And [fifth&gt;] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement. And I don\u2019t find that a postponement in this case would cure this prejudice. This matter is scheduled for trial in January. It\u2019s certainly a complex medical malpractice case. It involves many parties. And, the fact that at the last minute [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] sent some unexecuted answers doesn\u2019t in and of itself find that she has tried to remedy the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">I also note [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] failed to appear for deposition. [Her counsel] acknowledges that he received that deposition notice, was unable to contact his client, and just assumed [counsel for TRG] would call and say well, are you going to be there. Certainly there is a requirement upon [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] to respond to these requests. I find that it would be fundamentally unfair to allow this continuous disregard for the Court orders. It was a disregard for the scheduling order. A disregard of the order that was granted as to the motion to compel. And we look at the purpose behind requiring the parties to comply -with these order[s], to reply [to] the discovery requests. And certainly, it is to discourage violations of discovery deadlines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">And, in the case provided to the Court, certainly the Court took great length in addressing the fact of the fault. How did this discovery violation occur. In this case, the fault is squarely on [Ms. Valentine-Bowers]. It was a complete disregard of the Court order. All actions or inactions were done at the direction of [Ms. Valentine-Bowers]. And nothing has been presented to the Court to persuade this Court that prejudice would not exist to [appellees] to deny their request for sanctions today. That nothing\u2019s been presented to the Court to show good cause has been demonstrated for [Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s] failure to comply with the Court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">And so for all of those reasons, I grant the [appellees\u2019] request for sanctions and the matter is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Ms. Valentine-Bowers filed a Motion for Reconsideration on October 15, 2012, and the court denied that motion on November 29, 2012.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion posits that \u201c[f|or every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d E.D. Hirsch, Jr., <em>et al., The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy </em>457 (1988). Not so here: nearly every action on the part of TRG\u2019s counsel, Dr. Moffett\u2019s counsel, or the court, whatever their means of communication and on an impressive number of occasions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> induced no reaction at all from Ms. Valentine-Bowers. Her counsel ignored letters, phone calls, notices filed with the court, and court orders, and her brief on appeal neglects to mention these facts. As counsel for TRG put it, perhaps most tellingly, the Hearing marked \u201cthe first time that our office has ever heard [Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s] counsel\u2019s voice, and we\u2019re three months, well, two months from the trial date in this matter.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And while perhaps some of the delays might have been excusable, the circuit court, in its discretion, properly analyzed the relevant factors and ordered dismissal. Ms. Valentine-Bowers attacks that decision on three separate grounds that we address below, but the reply to each is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to dismiss the case after repeated discovery failures and an unambiguous warning from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Maryland Rule 2-33 (a)(3) gives trial courts broad discretion to impose sanctions for discovery violations. The available sanctions range from striking out pleadings to dismissal, id, and the decision whether to invoke the \u201cultimate sanction\u201d is left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Mason v. Wolfing, </em>265 Md. 234, 236, 288 A.2d 880 (1972) (\u201cEven when the ultimate penalty of dismissing the case or entering a default judgment is invoked, it cannot be disturbed on appeal without a clear showing that [the trial judge\u2019s] discretion was abused.\u201d). There need not be \u201cwilful or contumacious behavior\u201d by a party to justify imposing sanctions. <em>Warehime v. Dell, </em>124 Md.App. 31, 44, 720 A.2d 1196 (1998) (quoting <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, 210, 684 A.2d 878 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As we explained in <em>Sindler v. Litman, </em>166 Md.App. 90, 887 A.2d 97 (2005), \u201c[o]ur review of the trial court\u2019s resolution of a discovery dispute is <em>quite narrow; </em>appellate courts are reluctant to second-guess the decision of a trial judge to impose sanctions for a failure of discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 887 A.2d 97 (emphasis added). Differently put, in order to reverse a trial court\u2019s decision, it must be \u201c \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. John Crane, Inc., </em>385 Md. 185, 198-99, 867 A.2d 1077 (2005) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 313, 701 A.2d 110 (1997) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The trial court here decided that Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to comply with discovery deadlines warranted dismissal after reviewing the five factors we articulated in <em>Hossainkhail:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(1) whether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial; (2) the timing of the ultimate disclosure; (3) the reason, if any, for the violation; (4) the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering and opposing the evidence; and (5) whether any resulting prejudice might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance. The factors often overlap and do not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">143 Md.App. at 725-26, 795 A.2d 816 (citations omitted). The trial court noted and analyzed each factor, and pointed generally to counsel\u2019s \u201ccomplete disregard of discovery requests,\u201d and his \u201cfailure to comply with a Court order,\u201d because the only discovery counsel even arguably provided by the court\u2019s deadline consisted of <em>unexecuted </em>Answers to Interrogatories. Although the court acknowledged that counsel may have had problems finding Ms. Valentine-Bowers to execute the interrogatories, it also noted <em>her </em>affirmative obligation to stay in touch with counsel, and that her failure to appear at her deposition placed fault \u201csquarely\u201d on her own shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Ms. Valentine-Bowers breaks down the issues on appeal very specifically, claiming one error with respect to the complaint against each appellee, and one overall error by the trial court. She contends <em>first, </em>that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing the Complaint against <em>Dr. Moffett </em>because delivery of an executed signature page came three days after the deadline; <em>second, </em>that the court likewise abused its discretion by dismissing the Complaint against <em>TRG </em>for failure to comply with the May 31 Order when it was not docketed or received by counsel; and <em>third, </em>that the court erred by dismissing the Complaint against <em>both appellees </em>based on her failure to appear for deposition. TRG and Dr. Moffett, on the other hand, see the case more broadly, and argue that the discovery violations were \u201csignificant,\u201d \u201csubstantial,\u201d and \u201congoing.\u201d As such, they argue, the trial court\u2019s application of the five <em>Hossainkhail </em>factors to Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s aggregate discovery failures amply justified dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We too view the issues more broadly. The trial court granted the parties\u2019 <em>Joint </em>Motion for Sanctions after examining the entire course of discovery and counsel\u2019s chronic inaction throughout, and (properly, in our view) grounded its decision to dismiss the case on the overall impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>multiple breaches. Indeed, the factors the circuit court was required to consider \u201cdo not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis.\u201d <em>Hossainkhail, </em>143 Md.App. at 726, 795 A.2d 816 (citation omitted). We do not look at each incident in isolation, but rather at the entire history and context of the case in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">1. Nature of the disclosure violation\u2014 technical vs. substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The violation here was not technical (let alone, as Ms. Valentine-Bowers puts it in her brief, \u201chyper-technical\u201d), but substantive and substantial. We have explained in the past that \u201cbelated disclosures [are] material and relevant to appellees\u2019 ability to prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Saxon Mortg. Servs., Inc. v. Harrison, </em>186 Md.App. 228, 253, 973 A.2d 841 (2009). Disregard of discovery deadlines constitutes a \u201csubstantial violation\u201d because the plaintiff, as the party initiating suit, has an affirmative duty to move her case toward trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Appellant had a duty to move the case forward. Appellant shirked this duty and offered no good cause for his dilatory conduct. Appellant summarily attributed his absence to personal problems but made no showing why he could not and did not keep in touch with counsel when he obviously knew he had a case pending. The court may grant little weight to appellant\u2019s unsupported explanation for the delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsM\"><em>Hossainkhail, </em>143 Md.App. at 726, 795 A.2d 816 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We disagree with Ms. Valentine-Bowers that <em>Hart v. Miller, </em>65 Md.App. 620, 501 A.2d 872 (1985), suggests a different result. There, we reversed a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a personal injury action for the plaintiffs failure to reply timely to interrogatories. But we did so because the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in the first place, not because of any facts similar to these. The trial court had incorrectly concluded in <em>Hart </em>that it was <em>required </em>to dismiss the case based on delays in the plaintiff\u2019s producing discovery, and did not even consider the fact that the plaintiff (as opposed to plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>counsel) was not responsible for or aware of the delay in providing responses. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 501 A.2d 872. Moreover, the plaintiffs counsel, who had delayed in responding to discovery, had been absent from his solo practice for five months due to an injury, but still corresponded with counsel for the defendants twenty-two times over the less-than-eleven-month period in question. <em>Id. </em>at 623, 501 A.2d 872. The plaintiff, too, had been hospitalized for a large part of the time period in question. Depositions had taken place, and hundreds of pages of medical reports had been provided to the defendants, along with 250 pages of attachments and enclosures to the answers to interrogatories. <em>Id. </em>at 624, 501 A.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Here, on the other hand, Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s violations were substantial. <em>First, </em>she failed to appear for her deposition. Her counsel failed to object to the deposition notice, and he never contacted appellees\u2019 counsel to inform them of his intention not to appear. Although he claimed that in his experience, he expected opposing counsel to call him as that date approached (apparently seeing their failure to do so as excusing him from compliance), the court below in its discretion was entitled to \u201cgrant little weight to [his] unsupported explanation for the delay.\u201d <em>Hossainkhail, </em>143 Md.App. at 726, 795 A.2d 816 (citing <em>Lone v. Montgomery County, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 486, 584 A.2d 142 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Second, </em>Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to file properly executed, responsive interrogatories within the time allotted by the trial court following the July 5 Order also constituted a substantial violation. The appellees had no basis on which to move forward with other discovery until they had Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s deposition testimony in hand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether or not this was a \u201cstrategic call,\u201d as Ms. Valentine-Bowers claims, they were well within their rights to make that decision. Indeed, given Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel\u2019s total failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>respond to their many requests for the most basic discovery, they had no reason to spend time on preparation of further discovery. <em>See Warehime, </em>124 Md.App. at 48, 720 A.2d 1196 (\u201cThe purpose of discovery is to eliminate, as far as possible, the necessity of any party to litigation going to trial in a confused or muddled state of mind, concerning the facts that gave rise to the litigation.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">2. The timing of the ultimate disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Contrary to Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s claim here, the trial court credited her counsel\u2019s assertion that he never received the May 31 Order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He doesn\u2019t claim, though, that he didn\u2019t know about the July 5 Order, and his late compliance with <em>that </em>order properly contributed to the trial court\u2019s conclusion. He claims the trial court\u2019s July 12, 2012 deadline only required that he <em>mail </em>discovery by then, in keeping with Maryland Rule l-321(a), and the fact that the signature page followed after the deadline really meant nothing when \u201c[n]o changes were made to the information contained\u201d in the answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">This argument reveals an unfortunately nonchalant approach to discovery that has become all too common in our profession. <em>See </em>Janet Sidman Eveleth, <em>Court Considers Reforms to Advance Legal Professionalism, </em>40-APR Md. B.J. 42, 45 (2007) (noting the finding of the Maryland Judicial Task Force on Professionalism that the decline in professionalism in lawyers was \u201cmarked by rancorous discovery disputes, a loss of trust between lawyers, ... [and] a lack of civility in and out of the courtroom\u201d). The July 5 Order required Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2014\u201cpursuant to representations made by [her] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>counsel\u201d\u2014to <em>\u201cprovide full and complete </em>Answers to Interrogatories\u201d and <em>\u201cproduce all requested documents </em>\u201d \u201cby or before\u201d July 12, 2012. (Emphasis added.) The court could not have been clearer that the <em>completed discovery </em>had to be <em>in the hands of the appellees </em>by July 12. And it was neither: aside from being incomplete, the answers themselves were woefully inadequate. We do not go into detail here, but their substantive failings added yet another straw onto the back of an already overburdened camel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><em>First, </em>the specific Court Order (the capitals are intentional) trumps any general rule regarding the meaning of the word \u201cservice.\u201d The simple dictionary definition of \u201cprovide\u201d is to \u201csupply or make available,\u201d Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1001 (11th ed. 2011); and of \u201cproduce,\u201d to \u201coffer to view or notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 991. The common-sense definition, too, suggests that putting something in the mail is not the functional equivalent of getting it to someone on a date certain. <em>See Bush v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>212 Md.App. 127, 137, 66 A.3d 1123 (2013) (holding that utility customer\u2019s mailing of a petition did not constitute the \u201cfiling\u201d of the petition, as filing was not effectuated until the petition was received by the clerk).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>Second, </em>counsel\u2019s failure to comply with the July 5 Order\u2019s mandate, even if not deliberate, demonstrates a chronic disregard for the parties and the court in this case. And \u201cwillful\u201d conduct need not be affirmative conduct\u2014neglect or failure to act can be just as \u201cwillful\u201d as affirmative \u201ccontumacious\u201d conduct, and counsel demonstrated that type of willful disregard throughout the life of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Third, </em>even if he <em>had </em>gotten the Answers to Interrogatories to the appellees by July 12, they were still <em>unexecuted, </em>and therefore did not comply with the July 5 Order because they were not \u201ccomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We note <em>finally </em>that, in terms of timing, counsel had the benefit of more than the standard amount of time for discovery: Ms. Valentine-Bowers filed the initial claim before the Maryland Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(\u201cHCADRO\u201d) on January 27, 2010 (where the same counsel represented her). She did not serve the parties here until nearly two years later, in November 2011. Later requests for discovery went unanswered from the time of their filing in December 2011 until Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel\u2019s filing of discovery in mid-July\u2014over seven months later. In light of the appellees\u2019 efforts to get those responses, and the inordinate delay occasioned by Ms. Valentine-Bowers and/or her counsel, the circuit court could readily have decided that the case needed to end.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">3. The reason for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The trial court properly credited counsel\u2019s claim that he could not locate his client, but just as properly pointed out that this placed fault for the continued delay squarely on the plaintiff herself. It is the duty of a plaintiff to \u201cmove [her] case forward,\u201d <em>Hossainkhail, </em>143 Md.App. at 726, 795 A.2d 816, and Ms. Valentine-Bowers (or her counsel) \u201cshirked this duty and offered no good cause for [the] dilatory conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although counsel claims it was Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s failure to respond to inquiries that caused the delays, we find that claim inadequate for two reasons. <em>First, </em>counsel offered absolutely no evidence to support the claim to the trial court; and second\u2014and more to the point\u2014he never saw fit to convey this difficulty to the other side (or, for that matter, to the court) until his back was against the wall. As we pointed out above, counsel failed to respond to letters, calls, or orders on numerous occasions, which meant that throughout the case, only he actually knew whether there <em>was </em>any \u201creason for the violation.\u201d This failure to communicate gave the trial court more than an adequate basis to weigh this factor in favor of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">4. The degree of prejudice to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The trial court acted within its discretion in finding a substantial degree of prejudice. Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel claims on appeal that the time frame for discovery could simply have been enlarged, and somehow manages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>turn the tables and argue that the <em>appellees </em>neglected discovery by failing to note the depositions of experts or other witnesses. Putting aside that we don\u2019t see any reason they would have bothered to do so <em>(first </em>because of counsel\u2019s failure ever to respond to any filing, and <em>second </em>because appellees could justifiably have viewed Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s deposition as a necessary precursor to any other discovery they might have wished to conduct), we agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that prejudice to the appellees was \u201cgreat.\u201d As the court put it, \u201c[t]he memory of witnesses fade. The ability to locate witnesses becomes an issue. And so, certainly the Court can find prejudice exists to [appellees] in this case when a long time passes, as such in this case, when [Ms. Valentine-Bowers] has failed to respond to discovery.\u201d <em>See Warehime, </em>124 Md.App. 31, 49, 720 A.2d 1196 (1998) (\u201c[T]here is prejudice inherent in delaying a trial, because the memories and even the location of witnesses can become problematic when, as here, the years go by.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">As of the date the trial court considered the Joint Motion, October 5, 2012, more than <em>six </em>calendar years had passed since the first alleged underlying act of negligence in this case. Ms. Valentine-Bowers filed the original claim in HCADRO on January 27, 2010, so by the time she produced executed Answers to Interrogatories on July 17, 2012, more than two- and-a-half years had gone by. And contrary to Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s claim in her brief that the appellees simply filed \u201ca bevy of discovery Motions [sic] in search of a windfall\u201d rather than conduct discovery, as we see it and as the trial court properly saw it, the appellees simply filed motions (after letters and phone calls failed to prompt any response) in an attempt to get <em>some </em>response from counsel, who never once replied until he got late, non-compliant discovery to the appellees after July 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Again, <em>Hart </em>does nothing to change the outcome. There, plaintiffs counsel\u2019s health problems were one of many reasons for delay, and the trial court did not demonstrate that it exercised any discretion in choosing the alternative of dismissal over others. We found compelling there, too, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>much work had already been done by counsel for <em>both </em>parties, and \u201c[w]hat remained to be done was trivial in comparison,\u201d so that to dismiss the case would run \u201ccounter to valid societal preference for a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>65 Md.App. at 628, 501 A.2d 872. That certainly was not the case here\u2014 much work had <em>not </em>been done, because Ms. Valentine-Bowers had not provided the responses that would have allowed counsel for the appellees to conduct follow-up discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><em>Finally, </em>we note that whatever the trial court <em>could </em>have done by way of a postponement, it was not <em>required </em>to do so. Discretion means just that\u2014it was up to the trial court to fashion a remedy that it deemed appropriate in light of the course of discovery here. Given the path the case took, and the plaintiffs contribution to the delays, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in selecting the remedy of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">5. Whether a continuance would cure prejudice and is desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The trial court found that a continuance would not cure prejudice, in light of the complexities of the case and counsel\u2019s half-hearted attempts to respond to the July 5 Order, and we agree. Counsel\u2019s track record in this case gave the court no reason to think he would suddenly start cooperating or responding to the appellees in the event the court permitted postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We also cannot let this case pass without remarking on the substance of Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s brief as it relates to that track record. Counsel neglects to mention in his own recitation of the events that he did not reply to repeated requests for discovery. His decision to leave out many of the pieces of the puzzle that ultimately revealed a picture of utter disregard on his part renders the brief misleading, to say the least. But it also misconstrues the whole point of making available as a discovery sanction the \u201cdraconian remedy\u201d of dismissal. The trial court did not apply that sanction here, as he claims, on a \u201chyper-technicality\u201d\u2014the court appropriately dismissed a case where counsel\u2019s failure to respond to numerous and repeated inquiries from the opposing parties\u2019 counsel, coupled with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>all-too-nonchalant failure to comply with a court order, revealed a pattern of conduct that made dismissal eminently justifiable, and well within the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">. That Complaint actually was not the first. Ms. Valentine-Bowers initially filed a Statement of Claim with the Maryland Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office on January 27, 2010. She then filed one Complaint in circuit court on March 23, 2010, against Dr. Moffett (along with two other parties whom she later voluntarily dismissed). She filed a separate Complaint on September 14, 2010, naming TRG as a defendant. The trial court consolidated the two cases on September 12, 2011, and the referenced Complaint followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">. Although at oral argument counsel blamed problems with his fax machine on the derecho that raced through the eastern half of the country that year, the order granting TRG's motion to compel predated that storm by nearly a month. <em>See </em>Nat\u2019l Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Admin., <em>The Historic Derecho of June 29, 2012 </em>(January 2013), http:// www.nws.noaa.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/derecho 12 .pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. Rule 2-431 requires that a party certify with specificity counsel's good faith attempts to resolve a discovery dispute before resorting to court intervention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">. She argues here that counsel believed the deposition notice was facially defective because it noted the deposition outside the jurisdiction where the action was pending, <em>i.e., </em>at the office of TRG\u2019s counsel in Anne Arundel County. It does not appear that he ever shared this belief with TRG\u2019s counsel or the trial court until he filed the Motion for Reconsideration on October 15, 2012, nor did counsel ever seek a protective order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">. Although the \u201cAppellant's Record Extract\u201d purports in the Table of Contents to include a copy of the trial court's denial of the Motion for Reconsideration, it does not cite to a page, and our review of the extract did not reveal it. Moreover, according to counsel for Dr. Moffett, Ms. Valentine-Bowers\u2019s counsel never consulted him about preparation of the record extract\u2014another instance of noncompliance that might not merit dismissal of the appeal on its own, but that bolsters our conclusion that the circuit court was well within its discretion to dismiss this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. By our count, counsel did not respond to at least ten letters, phone calls, or notices, and five separate motions; and, of course, Ms. Valentine-Bowers failed to appear for her deposition or comply with either Court Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. To be fair, one letter in the Record Extract from Dr. Moffett\u2019s counsel purports to memorialize a conversation with Ms. Valentine-Bowers's counsel in which the former agreed to a two-week extension of time for the latter\u2019s discovery responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. Although Ms. Valentine-Bowers did file her expert witness disclosure in a timely fashion, this did not relieve her of the obligation to respond to the rest of the appellees\u2019 discovery requests or their requests for dates to take her deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">. To the extent counsel complains that the May 31 Order could not serve as the basis of a finding that he committed a discovery violation, he argues the wrong point. At the hearing, the trial court referred only to his failure to comply with the <em>July 5 Order, </em>and counsel does not contend that he was unaware of <em>that </em>Order\u2019s contents. The court referenced the \"failure to comply with a Court order,\" and in the next sentence explains that \u201cthree to four days after the deadline for the order was, the discovery appeared to be ... provided.\u201d The court plainly was referring to the July 5 Order, not to the May 31 Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
