(collectively, \u201cUBS\u201d) and Gordon Witherspoon (\u201cMr. Witherspoon\u201d). Appellees alleged in their complaint that appellants\u2019 tortious conduct denied them the full value of a life insurance policy purchased by appellees\u2019 parents, Nancy (\u201cMs. Thompson\u201d) and Albert Thompson (\u201cMr. Thompson\u201d and, together, \u201cthe parents\u201d). Appellants filed various post-trial motions challenging the jury\u2019s award, all of which were denied by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">UBS filed a timely appeal and presents four questions for our review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while Mr. Witherspoon appealed and presented six.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4We consolidate these questions into a single inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Did appellees suffer legally recoverable injuries as a result of UBS\u2019 and/or Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">For the following reasons, we determine that (1) appellees did not establish a sufficient claim for conversion; (2) appellees did not establish a sufficient claim for constructive fraud; (3) the circuit court erred by excluding appellants from introducing certain evidence regarding the parents\u2019 financial gifts to their children; (4) the circuit court erred by improperly instructing the jury on duty, and (5) the circuit court erred by entering a speculative and flawed jury award. We therefore reverse the judgments against appellants, and remand for a new trial on appellees\u2019 claims for negligence, negligent supervision, negligent misrepresentation, and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">This case stems from an insurance policy purchased by the parents on September 28, 1990. The policy was a \u201csecond to die\u201d life insurance policy from The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (\u201cManulife\u201d). It listed \u201cthe owner\u201d as the beneficiary and listed the children, Kathy, Karen, Susan Witherspoon (\u201cSusan\u201d), Carol Lareuse (\u201cCarol\u201d), and Barbara as the owners. The premium schedule indicated that premiums were \u201cpayable at annual intervals to second death, or to age 99 of the younger of the surviving lives, as follows!.]\u201d Under a section marked \u201cPAYMENT OF PREMIUMS!,]\u201d the policy explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>If a premium is not paid by the end of the grace period, your policy terminates, unless it has a value called a cash value. What happens then is explained in the \u201cAutomatic Premium Loan\u201d and \u201cGuaranteed Options\u201d provisions. The \u201cSurrender for Cash\u201d provision describes the cash value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALA\">The \u201cGUARANTEED OPTIONS\u201d section referenced above stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">If a premium is not paid and your policy has a cash value, you can chose a \u201cguaranteed option\u201d instead of resuming premium payments. The guaranteed options are (a) and (b) below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">If you do not choose a guaranteed option before the end of the grace period (or such other time as may be required by the law of the state in which this policy was delivered), and had not asked for the automatic premium loan option, we will apply option (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(a) Paid-up life insurance. You can continue the policy as paid-up life insurance payable on the second death. We will use the cash value, less any policy debt, as a net single premium on the due date to compute the amount of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">(b) Surrender for Cash. You can surrender the policy for cash according to the \u201cSurrender for Cash\u201d provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The policy also contained a section entitled \u201cAUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOAN\u201d which stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">We automatically will grant a loan to pay all or part of an unpaid premium if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(a) the premium is still unpaid at the end of the grace period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">(b) you asked for this loan option in the application, or we receive your signed request for it before the end of the grace period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">(c) the loan value exceeds the policy debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">We will loan the whole premium if at the end of the premium period the policy debt will not exceed the loan value. Where required by the law of the state in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>policy was delivered, we will advise you of the initial interest rate within the stipulated period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">If loaning the whole premium would make the policy debt at the end of the premium period greater than the loan value, we will loan only a part of the premium. The amount we loan will keep your policy in force from the due date of the premium until the policy debt equals the loan value. Then, if the balance of the premium is still unpaid, the policy will terminate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">You can write to us and cancel your request for the automatic premium loan. This cancellation will apply from the date when we receive your notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Other pertinent provisions of the policy read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azqs\">CONTRACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">Your whole contract is in the policy and the application. A copy of the application is attached to the policy and deemed a part of it. We will not be bound by any statement that is not in the application or the policy. Only our President or one of our Vice-Presidents can amend or modify the policy, and only in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Statements by you or either of the lives insured are representations, not warranties, unless fraud is involved. We will not use any statement by you or either of the lives insured to deny a claim, unless it is written in the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">BASIS OF VALUES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">The table of values on page 3 shows the basic values and the amount of paid-up whole life participating insurance. The basic value at any time is equal to the then present value of the paid-up insurance, and is calculated by the standard nonforfeiture method. The table assumes premiums are paid to the end of the policy year shown. It does not take into account any dividends, paid-up additions or policy debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">The table shows values for a number of consecutive anniversaries. For each of the values shown and beyond the last of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>those anniversaries we compute all values and benefits by the standard nonforfeiture method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">All these values and benefits are at least as much as those required by the State in which this policy is delivered. We have filed a detailed statement of our method of computing them with your State\u2019s insurance department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">On your request we will state values and benefits for dates not shown. For a specific date in a policy year, we will allow for the time elapsed in that year and the date to which premiums have been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">Basic values and net single premiums are based on the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Smoker or NonSmoker Mortality Table, without select factors. We assume interest at 6.25% per year in calculating basic values, paid-up values and paid-up additions; and that deaths occur at the end of the policy year of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The policy was signed by the parents, as well as Susan, Kathy, Karen, Carol, and Barbara. The parents, in order to avoid estate taxes, constructed a complex process involving cash gifts to the children/owners that would subsequently be used to pay the premiums on the policy. This process was managed by Mr. Witherspoon, Susan\u2019s husband, an insurance broker and the parents\u2019 financial advisor. Mr. Witherspoon arranged for the premiums to be paid out of the children\u2019s bank accounts after a cash gift was deposited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For many of the years that the premiums were not paid, Mr. Witherspoon arranged for the premium notices to be sent to an address \u201cin care of\u2019 him. It was never envisioned that the children would pay the premiums with their own funds, and they never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The parents, through cash gifts to their children, paid premiums on the policy until 1996. However, the premium due that year was not paid, and payments were also neglected in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. During these years, Manulife borrowed approximately $900,000 against the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to cover the premiums. Appellees discovered that the policy had been devalued by these loans after Mr. Thompson\u2019s death in 2005. They, along with some of their fellow siblings, placed the blame on Mr. Witherspoon, UBS, and other financial companies associated with the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Appellees filed their original complaint with a demand for a jury trial on August 29, 2008. Appellees filed an amended complaint on October 1, 2008, alleging counts of negligent misrepresentation (Count One), deceit (Count Two), conversion (Count Three), negligence (Count Four), and constructive fraud (Count Six) against Mr. Witherspoon and negligence pursuant to a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>(Count Nine), negligence (Count Ten), and deceit (Count Thirteen) against UBS. The following chart illustrates the relationship between the relevant parties in the instant case:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">UBS filed a petition to compel arbitration and motion to stay all proceedings on November 26, 2008, arguing that the insurance policy at issue was part of an agreement subjecting the case to arbitration. It subsequently filed an answer to appellees\u2019 amended complaint on December 15, 2008. The circuit court conducted a hearing regarding UBS\u2019 petition to compel arbitration on January 23, 2009. It entered an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>granting appellants\u2019 motion and stayed the case that same day. Appellees appealed from that order to this Court. Appellants\u2019 arguments on that appeal were rooted in the fact that the parents had signed a Master Account Agreement and an InsightOne Brokerage Account Agreement with UBS that contained arbitration clauses. Neither appellees nor their other siblings were parties to this agreement. Therefore, in <em>Thompson v. Witherspoon, </em>197 Md.App. 69, 12 A.3d 685 (2011), we determined that the circuit court erred when it entered an order compelling arbitration. Following our vacating the circuit court\u2019s order compelling arbitration, appellees filed a motion to lift the stay of proceedings on May 27, 2011. The circuit court granted that motion on July 19, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Mr. Witherspoon thereafter filed an answer to the amended complaint on March 3, 2011. UBS re-filed their answer on March 10, 2011. Appellees subsequently dismissed all claims against Manulife, pursuant to a settlement, on June 6, 2012. Discovery commenced, and UBS filed a motion for complete summary judgment on September 11, 2012. Mr. Witherspoon also filed a motion for summary judgment on appellees\u2019 claims for negligent misrepresentation, deceit, conversion, negligence and constructive fraud on September 12, 2012. Appellees filed a motion for partial summary judgment on September 12, 2012. Following a hearing on October 15, 2012, those motions were denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Following an eleven day jury trial, Mr. Witherspoon was found liable for negligence, negligent misrepresentation as to both Kathy and Barbara, but also found that he was not acting within the scope of his employment at UBS, thereby relieving UBS of liability under a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory. However, the jury concluded that UBS was negligent in its supervision of Mr. Witherspoon. The jury also determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Witherspoon \u201cconcealed a material fact that he had a duty to disclose\u201d to Kathy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Barbara and that he engaged in constructive fraud. They also found him liable for conversion and determined that he acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d The verdict sheet indicated the following concerning damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">20. What do you find is the total reduction of value of the Policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">Answer: $1,482,899</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">21. Of the amount set forth in your answer to 20, how much do you award to [Kathy]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">Answer: $741,449</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">22. By how much, if any, should [Kathy]\u2019s award be increased to account for taxes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Answer: $0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">23. Of the amount set forth in your answer to 20, how much do you award to [Barbara]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">Answer: $741,449</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">24. By how much, if any, should [Barbara\u2019s] award be increased to account for taxes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-13\">Answer: $0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Predicated on their finding that Mr. Witherspoon acted with actual malice, the jury also considered evidence on the issue of punitive damages. After testimony from Mr. Witherspoon, the jury awarded $150,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">Mr. Witherspoon moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict [\u201cJNOV\u201d], new trial or remittitur, to alter or amend judgment, to reduce award of punitive damages or remittitur or new trial on the punitive damages, and to stay enforcement of the judgment on December 6, 2012. UBS filed a motion for JNOV, new trial or remittitur and to alter or amend the judgment on December 20, 2012. All post-trial motions were denied on April 23, 2013. Appellants thereafter noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">Additional facts will be discussed as necessary to resolve the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We begin by examining appellees\u2019 claim for conversion against Mr. Witherspoon, since this tort is fundamentally different from appellees\u2019 remaining fraud and negligence claims. As these arguments were presented in motions for judgment pursuant to Md. Rule 2-519<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and motions for JNOV pursuant to Md. Rule 2-532,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we review the circuit court\u2019s evaluation of these arguments <em>de novo. Mahler v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., Inc., </em>170 Md.App. 293, 317, 907 A.2d 276 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u201cConversion is an intentional tort that requires an exertion of ownership or dominion over another\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with the owner\u2019s right to that property.\u201d <em>Nickens v. Mount Vernon Realty Group, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>LLC, </em>429 Md. 53, 77, 54 A.3d 742 (2012) (citing <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>379 Md. 249, 261, 841 A.2d 828 (2004)). The element of ownership may be proved by evidence that the defendant \u201c \u2018initially acquirfed] the property or ... retain[ed] it longer than the rightful possessor permits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lasater v. Guttmann, </em>194 Md.App. 431, 446-47, 5 A.3d 79 (2010) (quoting <em>Darcars Motors, </em>379 Md. at 261-62, 841 A.2d 828). Although money is usually not subject to an action for conversion, \u201cif the monies alleged to have been converted are \u2018specific segregated or identifiable funds[,]\u2019 \u201d the action may lie. <em>Lasater, </em>194 Md.App. at 447, 5 A.3d 79 (quoting <em>Allied Inv. Corp. v. Jasen, </em>354 Md. 547, 564, 731 A.2d 957 (1999)). Similarly, the common law rule that only tangible property could be the subject of a conversion claim was modified to include certain intangible rights. <em>Jasen, </em>354 Md. at 560, 731 A.2d 957. However, the Court of Appeals has limited claims for conversion under this theory to situations where \u201c[the] tangible documents evidenced [the] property interests and ... the documents were transferred improperly to\u201d the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d 957. The <em>Jasen </em>Court specified the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">We agree that the tort of conversion generally may extend to the type of intangible property rights that are merged or incorporated into a transferable document. We refuse, however, to extend the tort further, to cover completely intangible rights or as section 242(2) of the Restatement [ (Second) of Torts (1965) ] contemplates, to situations in which the relevant document itself has not been transferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 562, 731 A.2d 957. Section 242 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u00a7 242. Conversion of Documents and Intangible Rights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(1) Where there is conversion of a document in which intangible rights are merged, the damages include the value of such rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">(2) One who effectively prevents the exercise of intangible rights of the kind customarily merged in a document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>is subject to a liability similar to that for conversion, even though the document is not itself converted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">During trial, evidence was introduced that Mr. Witherspoon arranged for policy premium notices to be sent to his address for several of the years that the premiums were not being paid. Appellees presented expert testimony that this deviated from the standard of care expected of an insurance agent. Accordingly, appellees argued throughout trial that their \u201cownership\u201d was converted by Mr. Witherspoon through his handling of the premium notices and his concealment of the fact that loans were being taken out against the value of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In light of the holding in <em>Jasen, </em>we do not perceive how a jury could reasonably conclude that Mr. Witherspoon was liable for conversion. The <em>Jasen </em>Court explained that the tort of conversion extends to a wrongful exercise of control over \u201ca document in which intangible rights are merged.\u201d 354 Md. at 562, 731 A.2d 957. An insurance policy falls into this category. However, the <em>Jasen </em>Court expressly declined to extend this line of reasoning to intangible rights \u201ccustomarily\u201d merged into a document when the document was not actually converted. Appellees\u2019 theory of conversion is, in substance, a rearticulation of the theory of liability espoused by the Second Restatement and rejected by the <em>Jasen </em>Court. By failing to forward the notices to appellees and their siblings, Mr. Witherspoon may have interfered with their rights as policy owners. However, he is not liable for conversion unless he exercised dominion over the policy itself, which appellees never alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Appellees were \u201cowners\u201d of the insurance policy to the extent that they were nominally paying the premiums through cash gifts from the parents. However, this ownership was in theory, not in reality. By appellees\u2019 own admission, the parents were actually in full control of the policy. It is not clear what \u201ccontrol\u201d Mr. Witherspoon <em>could </em>take from the sisters. Beyond this limitation, appellees cannot claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Mr. Witherspoon converted any specific funds, as there exists no agreed-upon, \u201cidentifiable\u201d monies to be converted. Furthermore, there was no unauthorized transfer of a tangible document to allow conversion under this theory. Therefore, the circuit court erred by submitting the conversion claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Constructive Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Mr. Witherspoon argues that appellees\u2019 constructive fraud claim also fails, as Mr. Witherspoon did not share a \u201cconfidential relationship\u201d with appellees. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cConstructive fraud\u201d is defined as a \u201cbreach of a legal or equitable duty which, irrespective of moral guilt of the fraud feasor, the law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests.\u201d <em>Canaj, Inc. v. Baker and Division Phase III, LLC, </em>391 Md. 374, 421-22, 893 A.2d 1067 (2006) (quoting <em>Md. Envtl. Trust v. Gaynor, </em>370 Md. 89, 98, 803 A.2d 512 (2002)) (some quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted). It is a tort that is often applied in tax and lending cases where a \u201cconfidential relationship\u201d exists. <em>See Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav. F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995); <em>Scheve v. McPherson, </em>44 Md.App. 398, 408 A.2d 1071 (1979). A confidential relationship is one in which \u201c \u2018two persons stand in such a relation to each other that one must necessarily repose trust and confidence in the good faith and integrity of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Upman v. Clarke, </em>359 Md. 32, 42, 753 A.2d 4 (2000) (quoting <em>Green v. Michael, </em>183 Md. 76, 84, 36 A.2d 923 (1944)). Some relationships, such as the one between an attorney and a client and a trustee and a beneficiary, are presumed to be confidential. <em>Id. </em>In other situations, a confidential relationship must be established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Shih Ping Li v. Tzu Lee, </em>210 Md.App. 73, 110, 62 A.3d 212 (2013), <em>aff'd, </em>437 Md. 47, 85 A.3d 144 (2014). \u201c \u2018[T]he mere existence of a familial relationship is not indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>tive of a confidential relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Latty v. St. Joseph\u2019s Soc. of Sacred Heart, Inc., </em>198 Md.App. 254, 266, 17 A.3d 155 (2011) (quoting <em>Orwick v. Moldawer, </em>150 Md.App. 528, 538-39, 822 A.2d 506 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Here, appellants did not establish a sufficient case for constructive fraud. As we will explain <em>infra, </em>Mr. Witherspoon initiated a duty towards appellees by taking it upon himself to receive the premium notices and coordinate payment of the premiums. However, this duty was limited in nature. Mr. Witherspoon was obligated to pay the premiums when he received the funds to do so and to notify appellees and their siblings when the premiums were unpaid. These duties are not fiduciary in nature, and we are not persuaded to expand the concept of fiduciary duty to provide appellees a remedy when a cause of action for negligence is available to them. Any fiduciary duty owed by Mr. Witherspoon was to the parents and their respective estates. <em>See Thompson, </em>197 Md.App. at 88-89, 12 A.3d 685 (where we determined that appellees, \u201cas putative heirs of the Thompsons, may potentially gain some benefit from the financial advice given by [Mr.] Witherspoon to their parents but such possibilities are too attenuated to be the basis for ... concluding that [appellees] are third party beneficiaries\u201d of that relationship). Therefore, we determine that no reasonable jury could have found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Witherspoon committed constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">UBS and Mr. Witherspoon present separate evidentiary issues that they aver impacted the trial and prejudiced the jury. We will address both parties\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">A. Appellees\u2019 Cross-Examination of UBS\u2019 Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">UBS avers that evidence elicited during the cross-examination of Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s expert witness John Duval (\u201cMr. Duval\u201d) that UBS generally did not supervise their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>brokers was a \u201cprior bad act\u201d in violation of Md. Rule 5-404(b). That rule is entitled \u201cCharacter evidence not admissible to prove conduct; exceptions, other crimes.\u201d and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts including delinquent acts as defined by Code, Courts Article, \u00a7 3-8A-01 is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Such evidence, however, may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Unfortunately for UBS, it failed to cite Md. Rule 5-404(b) in objecting to the evidence, and is therefore precluded from arguing it here. <em>See Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 924 A.2d 1112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">B. Evidence on \u201cEqualizing\u201d Gifts</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Appellants also argue that they should have been allowed to present evidence that the parents sought to \u201cequalize\u201d gifts among the children. The circuit court issued a broad ruling excluding this evidence as irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. For the following reasons, we determine that the circuit court erred in this pre-trial ruling and subsequent, related evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Md. Rule 5-401 outlines the standard for relevance at trial, and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u201cGenerally, the [circuit] court has wide discretion when considering the relevancy of evidence.\u201d <em>In re Adriana </em>T., 208 Md.App. 545, 568, 56 A.3d 814 (2012) (citing <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724, 25 A.3d 144 (2011)). Md. Rule 5-403 guides the circuit court\u2019s discretion, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The circuit court ruled, pre-trial, that evidence of \u201cequalization\u201d of gifts among the children would be excluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">I, frankly, with respect to testimony and the exhibits regarding equalization, don\u2019t see how there\u2019s relevance there. I don\u2019t agree with defense counsel that there\u2019s any relevance in that. And frankly, to the extent that there is some modest degree of value in giving some sort of framework or context as to what Mr. Witherspoon was doing, the [c]ourt finds that the probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">So the motion on that point with respect to evidence and testimony that there was an attempt for equalization, and what the parents wanted to be fair, and that Kathy Thompson was obsessed about it, and there were charts and figures and graphs, the [cjourt\u2019s going to grant the motion to exclude that evidence based on the [appellees\u2019] [m]otion in [l]imine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">During specific evidentiary arguments, the circuit court admitted some evidence of the parents\u2019 cash gifts to the children. However, it repeatedly indicated that it would not allow appellants to discuss \u201cequalization.\u201d Significantly, the circuit court redacted a memo that UBS offered into evidence indicating that the father sought to \u201cequalize\u201d each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The crux of appellees\u2019 claims against Mr. Witherspoon is that his personal interest in securing money from the parents for his family prompted Mr. Witherspoon to act carelessly, or even intentionally, by exerting control over the premium notices. Thus, the evidence that the parents sought to provide the children with equal gifts was crucial for the defense. This intent to \u201cequalize\u201d tends to negate appellees\u2019 claims that Mr. Witherspoon and his wife were treated differently from the other children and their spouses, or that Mr. Witherspoon was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>exploiting his position as the parents\u2019 financial advisor. Furthermore, the chilling effect that the circuit court\u2019s pre-trial ruling had on appellants\u2019 ability to argue their defenses effectively cannot be overstated. Mr. Witherspoon, and by extension UBS, should have been able to place the parents\u2019 cash gifts to Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s wife in context. Preventing Mr. Witherspoon from presenting evidence that placed his relationship with the parents in context was severely prejudicial, and the error permeated the circuit court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. In our view, these rulings significantly affected all aspects of the jury\u2019s verdicts regarding liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Jury Instructions and Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">UBS argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in omitting its requested jury instructions. Many of these instructions related to the duty that Mr. Witherspoon, as an insurance producer, owed appellees. Both appellants argue that the circuit court erred in holding that Mr. Witherspoon owed a broad, legal duty to appellees. As both of these issues concern the circuit court\u2019s handling of the concept of \u201cduty,\u201d we believe that these arguments are best addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">UBS argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by failing to provide \u201cbasic\u201d jury instructions concerning insurance policies, specifically Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions [\u201cMPJI-CV\u201d] 14:1,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 14:2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 14:4,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 14:6.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>contends that the circuit court should have instructed the jury regarding the duty that insurance agents and brokers owe to relevant parties, which is covered by the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u2022 MPJI-CV 14:5, \u201cINSURANCE AGENT AND BROKER-DEFINED\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">An insurance agent is one who the insurance company authorizes to act for and bind it in matters relating to insurance. The agent\u2019s authority to act for the insurance company may be expressly given or may be implied from the insurance company\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">An insurance broker is one who obtains insurance for a person seeking insurance. A broker is considered to have been engaged by the person seeking insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">An insurance broker is to be distinguished from an insurance agent since the broker does not act for and cannot bind the insurance company. However, in a transaction, a person may be an insurance broker for some purposes and an insurance agent for other purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u2022 MPJI-CV 14:7, \u201cINSURANCE AGENT\u2019S DUTY TO INSURED\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">Although an insurance agent acts on behalf of the insurance company and not the insured, the agent owes the insured a duty of reasonable care if the agent undertakes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to act for the insured and the insured may rely on the agent to perform this duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u2022 MPJI-CV 14:9, \u201cINSURANCE BROKER\u2019S DUTY TO INSURED\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">A broker owes the insured a duty to act with good faith, reasonable care, and skill. The insured may rely on the broker to perform this duty. The broker is responsible to the insured for any loss sustained by the insured as a result of the violation of this duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We review the circuit court\u2019s decision regarding which jury instructions to employ for abuse of discretion. <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Pitts, </em>430 Md. 431, 458, 61 A.3d 767 (2013). \u201cA party is entitled to an instruction that correctly states the law only if that law is applicable to some issue in the case, i.e., if there is testimony in the case which supports it[.]\u201d <em>Wilbur v. Suter, </em>126 Md.App. 518, 525, 730 A.2d 693 (1999) (citing <em>Kessler v. Equity Mgmt. Inc., </em>82 Md.App. 577, 593, 572 A.2d 1144 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by declining to give the above referenced instructions, as we agree with appellees that these instructions were not correct statements of the law. While this State once distinguished between the terms \u201cinsurance agent\u201d and \u201cinsurance broker,\u201d the General Assembly abolished that distinction in 2001. Now, Maryland, unlike many other states, does not distinguish between these terms. <em>Compare </em>Md.Code (1995, 2011 Rep.

The plaintiff, 100 Investment Limited Partnership (\u201cthe Partnership\u201d), employed two title companies to search titles for certain land in Howard County. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 60 A.3d 1. The title companies failed to uncover a previous conveyence of the land in question. <em>Id. </em>The Partnership subsequently sued the title companies for negligence, claiming solely economic damages. <em>Id. </em>at 206-07, 60 A.3d 1. In discussing whether the title search companies were liable for those damages, the Court outlined case law discussing the rationale behind the \u201cintimate nexus\u201d rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">We explained in <em>[Walpert, Smullian &amp; Blumenthal, P.A. v.

[is] to avoid \u2018liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.\u2019 \u201d A defendant can protect itself from such unpredictable and unlimited liability in cases where there is a close nexus between the parties. Such a relationship might stem from a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the plaintiffs identity, the class in which a plaintiff belongs, and the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the prospective plaintiff may be relying on the information provided by a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 218, 60 A.3d 1 (modifications in original) (some citations omitted). The Court subsequently concluded that the title search companies were in an \u201cintimate nexus\u201d with the Partnership, as they knew that the Partnership would be relying on the title search to purchase the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Compare that case with <em>Noble v. Bruce, </em>349 Md. 730, 709 A.2d 1264 (1998). <em>Noble </em>examined the analogous concept of \u201cstrict privity\u201d between attorneys and clients, and involved two sets of beneficiaries who sued the attorneys who prepared the will that the beneficiaries were expected to take from. <em>Id. </em>at 734, 737, 709 A.2d 1264. In the first case, the suit alleged that Charles A. Bruce, Jr. (\u201cAttorney Bruce\u201d) committed legal malpractice by failing to advise the testators (who were also the beneficiaries\u2019 parents) of certain tax-avoidance tactics that could have benefitted the estate. <em>Id. </em>at 734, 709 A.2d 1264. In the second, the beneficiaries averred that T. Hughlett Henry, Jr. (\u201cAttorney Henry\u201d) prepared the tax structure of the will contrary to the testator\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 709 A.2d 1264. Attorney Bruce prevailed on summary judgment, while the circuit court granted Attorney Henry\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 709 A.2d 1264. The Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>in each case. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 737, 709 A.2d 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Court determined that the \u201cstrict privity\u201d rule, which states that \u201ca third party not in privity with an attorney has no cause of action against the attorney for negligence in the absence of fraud or collusion[,]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 709 A.2d 1264 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Savings Bank v.

Thus, the Court concluded that the non-client beneficiaries could not pursue a malpractice suit against the attorneys in question. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53, 709 A.2d 1264. In making this determination, the Court rejected the beneficiaries\u2019 arguments that they were \u201cthird party beneficiaries\u201d under an exception to the strict privity rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">As we stated earlier, [under the third party exception to the strict privity rule,] the client\u2019s intent to benefit the nonclient must be a direct purpose of the transaction or relationship in order for the nonclient to be considered a third-party beneficiary. In cases involving wills, the beneficiary of a will is not necessarily the beneficiary of the attorney-client relationship....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>As the Supreme Court of Virginia noted, \u201c[t]here is a critical difference between being the intended beneficiary of an estate and being the intended beneficiary of a contract between a lawyer and his client----A promise to prepare a will pursuant to the instructions of a testatrix states a direct obligation to render a performance beneficial to her, i.e., the creation of a document which would enable her upon her death to effect the transfer of her assets to the beneficiaries named in her instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 709 A.2d 1264 (modification in original) (some internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">As the extent of UBS\u2019 liability is predicated on its supervision of Mr. Witherspoon, we will first address the issue of Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s duty to appellees. This is a complex question, in part because Mr. Witherspoon was a party to the insurance contract. We first note that appellees did not present a nexus between the alleged duty and the alleged breach. Mr. Witherspoon certainly owed a duty to appellees <em>under the insurance contract. </em>However, appellees did not allege a breach of that contract. Rather, their causes of action related to Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s actions as a financial advisor. Mr. Witherspoon never contracted with appellees to act in that manner. To the contrary, record evidence indicates that the expectation of all relevant parties was that the parents would manage the policy and that appellees \u201cpaid\u201d the premiums only as a fiction, since in reality, the parents either paid the premiums directly, or provided cash gifts to the children to pay the premiums. During oral argument, counsel for appellee even stated that the parents\u2019 never expected appellees to truly pay the premiums themselves. This is bolstered by the fact that appellees never presented evidence at trial indicating that they were in a position to pay the premiums. Thus, at the inception of the contract, Mr. Wither-spoon was clearly under no duty to remind appellees to pay the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Our conclusion is supported by a survey of law from sister states. Even in states where there is a distinction between an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201cinsurance broker\u201d and an \u201cinsurance agent,\u201d the focus is on the agent or broker\u2019s duty while obtaining the insurance, not after. <em>See, e.g., Mark Tanner Constr., Inc. v. HUB Int'l Ins. Services, Inc., </em>224 Cal.App.4th 574, 584, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d 39 (2014) (\u201c \u2018Insurance brokers owe a limited duty to their clients, which is only to use reasonable care, diligence, and judgment in procuring the insurance requested by an insured.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted in original); <em>Indiana Restorative Dentistry, P.C. v. Laven Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>999 N.E.2d 922, 933 (Ind.App. 2013) (\u201cAn insurance agent or broker who undertakes to procure insurance for another is an agent of the proposed insured, and owes the principal a duty to exercise reasonable care, skill, and good faith diligence in obtaining the insurance[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Importantly, many other jurisdictions emphasize that the onus for paying the premiums is on the insured, not the insurer or its agents. <em>See, e.g., Webb v. American Employers Group, </em>268 Neb. 473, 483, 684 N.W.2d 33 (2004) (\u201c[T]he burden is on an insured to keep a policy in force by the payment of premiums and is not on the insurer to exert every effort to prevent the insured from allowing a policy to lapse through failure to make premium payments.\u201d); <em>Walker v. Federal Kemper Life Assur. Co., </em>828 S.W.2d 442, 449 (Tex. App.1992) (\u201cThe payment of the premium in accordance with the provisions of an insurance policy is a condition precedent to the establishment of liability of the insurer.\u201d); <em>Parlier Fruit Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>151 Cal.App.2d 6, 22, 311 P.2d 62 (1957) (\u201cThere is implied an agreement to pay the usual premium.\u201d); <em>but see Paul v. Columbian Nat. Life Ins. Co., </em>125 N.J.L. 350, 356, 15 A.2d 636 (1940) (\u201cA premium is not an obligation of the policy holder\u201d). Although states differ on what the consequences of failing to pay a premium are, our survey indicated that in all cases, the insured and the policy holders have a sense of agency in the decision of whether to pay the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">We determine that a similar rule applies in this case as well. Appellees presented no evidence to indicate that either Mr. Witherspoon or UBS had a duty to inform appellees that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>premiums were not being paid. On the contrary, the circumstances indicate that the ultimate responsibility to pay the premiums on the life insurance policy rested on the parents and appellees, as owners of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Appellees\u2019 theories of recovery are ultimately contradictory. They attest that they, as policy owners, were owed a duty by Mr. Witherspoon. However, they sought damages as beneficiaries of the policy who had not received its full value. Analogizing the \u201cstrict privity\u201d rule explored in <em>Noble </em>is useful here. Although <em>Noble </em>involved attorney malpractice suits stemming from will drafting, we observe significant parallels to the instant case in its reasoning. While not a formal will, the parents\u2019 life insurance claim was essentially a vehicle for dividing their considerable estate amongst their children. Mr. Witherspoon was in a similar position as an attorney drafting a will. A similar duty rule therefore applies here when analyzing appellees\u2019 roles as beneficiaries, and we determine that Mr. Witherspoon was under no duty to ensure that appellees, as <em>beneficiaries, </em>received as much of the proceeds as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If the above facts were the only ones presented at trial, our analysis would end here. However, by directing the premium notices to his address, Mr. Witherspoon interjected himself and assumed a duty to forward the premium notices onto the appellees, as owners of the policy. This is a very specific and narrow concept that the jury should have been apprised of. Thus, while we determine that a recitation of the outdated civil pattern jury instructions was unwarranted, the circuit court erred by declining to define Mr. Witherspoon (and, by extension, UBS\u2019) duty, as it was required to do. There was evidence presented that Mr. Witherspoon owed a duty to appellees, but the circuit court\u2019s instructions failed to accurately explain the scope of that duty to the jury. Accordingly, appellants are entitled to a new trial on appellees\u2019 claim for negligent supervision regarding UBS, as well as appellees\u2019 claims for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and deceit against Mr. Witherspoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">For the purposes of clarity, we will also address pertinent issues concerning the jury award. As explained <em>infra, </em>the jury award did not reflect the accurate measure of damages and should have been corrected by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"> Appellees were awarded both compensatory and punitive damages. Those awards are fundamentally different in nature. While \u201c[t]he award of compensatory damages is an attempt to make the plaintiff whole again by monetary compensation!,]\u201d punitive damages \u201cpunish the wrongdoer for misconduct and ... deter future egregious conduct by others.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Yarema, </em>69 Md.App. 124, 137, 516 A.2d 990 (1986) (citing <em>Cheek v. J.B.G. Properties, Inc., </em>28 Md.App. 29, 43-44, 344 A.2d 180 (1975)). \u201cOrdinarily ... damages for economic loss are not available in a tort action and are recoverable, if at all, in contract causes of action and, in the case of fraud, in actions for deceit.\u201d <em>Lloyd, </em>397 Md. at 123, 916 A.2d 257 (citing <em>U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>336 Md. 145, 156, 647 A.2d 405 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">This general rule does not apply in tort cases involving fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. The Court of Appeals has cited four \u201crules\u201d for damages in these cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">(1) If the defrauded party is content with the recovery of only the amount that he actually lost, his damages will be measured under that rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(2) If the fraudulent representation also amounted to a warranty, recovery may be had for loss of the bargain because a fraud accompanied by a broken promise should cost the wrongdoer as much as the latter alone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">(3) where the circumstances disclosed by the proof are so vague as to cast virtually no light upon the value of the property had it conformed to the representations, the court will award damages equal only to the loss sustained; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(4) where ... the damages under the benef\u00edt-of-the-bargain rule are proved with sufficient certainty, that rule will be employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><em>Hinkle v. Rockville Motor Co., </em>262 Md. 502, 511-12, 278 A.2d 42 (1971) (citing <em>Selman v. Shirley, </em>161 Or. 582, 609, 85 P.2d 384 (1938)). These four \u201crules\u201d form the basis of the \u201cflexibility theory\u201d of damages in fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, where the victim of those torts \u201cmay elect to recover either \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019 expenses or \u2018benefit-of-the-bargain damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goldstein v. Miles, </em>159 Md.App. 403, 422, 859 A.2d 313 (2004). An enforceable bargain is a necessary prerequisite to recovering benefit-of-the-bargain damages. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 859 A.2d 313. A bargain \u201cis \u2018[a]n agreement between parties for the exchange of promises or performances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 143 (7th ed.1999)) (modification in original). It is \u201cnarrower in scope than an agreement but broader in scope than a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 859 A.2d 313. \u201cA \u2018legal\u2019 promise has been defined as \u2018[t]he manifestation of an intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified manner, conveyed in such a way that another is justified in understanding that a commitment has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 859 A.2d 313 (quoting Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1228).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>Goldstein, </em>159 Md.App. at 403, 859 A.2d 313, is a useful illustration of this concept. In <em>Goldstein, </em>attorneys Scott B. Goldstein (\u201cMr. Goldstein\u201d) and James K. MacAlister (\u201cMr. MacAlister\u201d and, collectively with Mr. Goldstein, the \u201cformer associates\u201d) sued their former employer, Stephen L. Miles (\u201cfirm owner\u201d). Mr. Goldstein alleged that the firm owner expressed interest in selling the firm to Mr. Goldstein from the beginning of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 859 A.2d 313. The firm owner also persuaded Mr. MacAlister not to take another job offer by stating that he would sell his practice to Mr. MacAlister, Mr. Goldstein, and another associate upon the firm owner\u2019s retirement. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16, 859 A.2d 313. The former associates produced written communications where the firm owner indicated that he expected them to purchase the firm. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 859 A.2d 313. In subsequent years, the firm owner engaged in negotiations, including price terms, with Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Goldstein and another attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 417-19, 859 A.2d 313. Mr. MacAlister was not aware that these negotiations were taking place. <em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 859 A.2d 313. In turn, Mr. Goldstein was unaware that the firm owner was negotiating with the law firm of Saiontz &amp; Kirk, which eventually bought the firm in question. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 859 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The former associates subsequently filed suit, alleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 859 A.2d 313. They claimed damages based on expert testimony that they would have earned $9,510,068 from purchasing the firm. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 859 A.2d 313. They also requested the difference between the value of the firm at the time of the sale and the reduced price promised to them by the firm owner. <em>Id. </em>The firm owner moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the circuit court on the basis that the firm owner and former associates never \u201cstruck a \u2018bargain\u2019 \u201d for the firm\u2019s purchase. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 859 A.2d 313. The former associates thereafter appealed to this Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On review of the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we determined that there was no enforceable bargain between the firm owner and the former associates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">[The firm ownerj\u2019s statements that he would sell [the former associates] his firm for a price below market value, upon his retirement, were not enforceable promises. These assertions did not contain any material terms of the sale such as purchase price, date of sale, interest rate, or terms of payment. Without these terms, it is impossible to determine what \u201cthe nature and extent of the parties\u2019 obligations\u201d were, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">Because of the vague and indefinite nature of [the firm owner]\u2019s assertions, [the former associates] could not have reasonably relied on them. Rather, [the firm owner]\u2019s assertions amount to no more than statements of intention because they were not \u201ccommunicated in such a way that the addressee of the expression [could] justly expect performance and ... reasonably rely thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 859 A.2d 313 (citations omitted). We therefore affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 859 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">One of the first cases in Maryland examining the tort of negligent misrepresentation, <em>Ward Development Co., Inc. v. Ingrao, </em>63 Md.App. 645, 493 A.2d 421 (1985), is also instructive. There, several homeowners sued the developer of their subdivision, Ward Development Co., Inc. (\u201cWard\u201d), along with the relevant real estate firm and selling agent. <em>Id. </em>at 649, 493 A.2d 421. The homeowners alleged that they were told that the subdivision, along with a road running through it, would remain a certain size. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 493 A.2d 421. They were also provided an estimated sewer and water connection charge in their contracts. <em>Id. at </em>651, 493 A.2d 421. However, after the homeowners purchased their residences, the subdivision was developed past the point that they were promised. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 493 A.2d 421. Furthermore, the actual utilities charges were significantly larger than the estimates provided. <em>Id. </em>at 651, 493 A.2d 421. Following a trial, a jury found Ward liable for negligent misrepresentation as to (1) the extension of a road in the subdivision and (2) the amount of the sewer and water charges. <em>Id. </em>at 652, 493 A.2d 421. Ward appealed to this Court, asserting first that the water and sewage estimates were not a viable \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d to support the homeowners\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim. <em>Id. </em>at 654, 493 A.2d 421. We determined that the circuit court did not err in denying Ward\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on that issue for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Ward, as the developer of the subdivision ... held [itself] out as knowledgeable in matters such as the charge for a sewer and water connection. The homeowners were entitled to rely on that estimate to a reasonable extent. But the charge stated in the contract was so far removed from the actual charge it cannot properly be termed a reasonable estimate and can only be explained as a misrepresentation. Therefore, we hold that the estimate of the sewer and water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>connection charge was actionable under a theory of negligent misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 656, 493 A.2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Ward also challenged the circuit court\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial on the subject of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 493 A.2d 421. We held that the flexibility theory applied to negligent misrepresentation as well as fraudulent misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 493 A.2d 421. We therefore concluded that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cinsupportable under any theory of damages[ ]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">The jury apparently chose to award the homeowners the present value of their actual house connection charge and front foot benefit assessment. This result is contrary to Maryland law and the facts of this case. We note that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding damages failed to state that the jury must subtract the amount stated as the sewer and/or water connection charge in each homeowner\u2019s contract from the actual charge, to arrive at the proper measure of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 660, 493 A.2d 421 (citations omitted). The case was remanded for a new trial on damages. <em>Id. </em>at 663, 493 A.2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Our courts have a long history of upholding jury verdicts that are based on record evidence. <em>See Southern Mgmt. Corp. v. Mariner, </em>144 Md.App. 188, 197, 797 A.2d 110 (2002) (\u201cWe will not question the jury\u2019s determination where there is ample evidence in the record to support the award[]\u201d); <em>Butkiewicz v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 412, 425, 732 A.2d 994 (1999); <em>Kirkpatrick v. Zimmerman, </em>257 Md. 215, 218, 262 A.2d 531 (1970). However, the law of recovery for economic damages stemming from negligence and intentional tort claims indicates that damages in those cases must be measured in a specific way. Appellees\u2019 theory of recovery relies on their assertion that they would have paid the premiums if they had known what Mr. Witherspoon was concealing. Thus, any recovery should have been reduced by the present value of the premium payments, and the jury should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>been instructed accordingly. In other words, appellees were entitled to only what they would have received had Mr. Witherspoon timely forwarded each premium notice and had appellees, <em>and their siblings, </em>made those payments. Furthermore, appellees were only entitled to a <em>pro rata </em>share of the proceeds of the policy, minus the present value of the premiums. The jury\u2019s award did not reflect these principles. The value of appellees\u2019 damages may be established by expert testimony, and those experts may differ in their calculations. However, the award appellees received ignored the adjustment necessary to give appellees the benefit of their bargain. It should have been corrected by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY ARE REVERSED.
