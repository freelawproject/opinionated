Count Y: Mr. Bontempo\u2019s Equal Compensation Claim........................................136</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Like marriages, business relationships sometimes fail, and the process of disentanglement can be messy and painful. The relationship in this case revolves around an information technology company called Quotient, Inc. (\u201cQuotient\u201d) that was owned by longtime business associates Clark Lare (and his wife, Jodi) and David Bontempo. Like a new romantic relationship, the business flourished in its early stages. Like some marriages, the relationship between Mr. Lare and Mr. Bontempo eventually became strained, then unraveled. And not unlike those marriages that end up in the courts, the parties could not agree on how to distribute their respective assets and manage the company going forward after Quotient terminated Mr. Bontempo\u2019s employment in 2008, and Mr. Bontempo brought suit, both individually and on behalf of Quotient, in the Circuit Court for Howard County.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">For the reasons we explain below, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s core liability findings in Mr. Bontempo\u2019s favor, and we disagree with Mr. Bontempo\u2019s contention that the court abused its discretion in declining to dissolve and dismember Quotient. We hold as well, however, that the circuit court erred in the way it allocated liability for monetary damages and attorneys\u2019 fees arising from Mr. Bontempo\u2019s derivative claims. And because, similar to divorce cases, the damage and attorneys\u2019 fees awards are inextricably intertwined, we vacate the awards for damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs relating to Count III and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">A. A Promising Start</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Mr. and Ms. Lare formed Quotient in 1999. At first, they operated the business out of their home and financed it with personal savings and cash advances on their credit cards. Under their initial shareholder agreement, which they executed in November 2000, Mr. Lare held forty-nine percent of the stock and Ms. Lare owned the rest. At first, Mr. Lare traveled to solicit clients for their fledgling company while Ms. Lare continued to support the couple as a pharmacist and part-owner of Watermont Pharmacy (\u201cWatermont\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Early on, Mr. Lare successfully converted a referral from his former co-worker, David Bontempo, into a contract to provide informational technology services to the United States Census Bureau.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Soon after, Mr. Lare hired Mr. Bontempo to work for Quotient and made him a minority shareholder. The parties executed an amendment to the shareholder agreement (the \u201cShareholder Agreement\u201d) that gave Mr. Bontempo forty-five percent of Quotient, Mr. Lare four percent, and Ms. Lare fifty-one percent. In exchange, Mr. Bontempo executed a promissory note in the amount of $46,800. Although Mr. Lare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>testified that he expected the note to be repaid, Mr. Bontempo claimed that it existed only for accounting purposes:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A41\">[COUNSEL FOR THE LARES:] Now, do you remember that at one point in time though, you did execute a promissory note to pay for that stock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">[MR. BONTEMPO:] Ido.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE LARES:] [Exhibit 7] is a nonnegotiable promissory note dated effective March 21, 2001, for forty-six thousand eight hundred dollars, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">[MR. BONTEMPO:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">* Hi ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">[COUNSEL FOR THE LARES:] Okay, and ah, that was for the stock that he conveyed to you, isn\u2019t it? Wasn\u2019t that the purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">Hi Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-12\">[MR. BONTEMPO:] Um, the purpose of this more was for an accounting record, that there was some value transferred to me, and that there was\u2014Clark and I had an agreement, there was no money to be exchanged for this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The parties never signed a written employment agreement, but they agreed orally that Mr. Bontempo would receive an initial salary of $20,000, and he received his first paycheck in February 2000. The Lares, on the other hand, did not draw a salary until December 2001. Mr. Bontempo contended that he and Mr. Lare reached an additional understanding that once the Lares started to draw a salary, he would draw a salary equal to the <em>combined </em>salaries of the Lares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-14\">[COUNSEL FOR THE LARES:] ... [I]s there a piece of paper anywhere that you have seen in this case that says that there will be equivalent salaries that I, Dave Bontempo, will receive the same amount in salary as the Lares, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Clark Lare, the Lares in combination, is there any such agreement that you are aware of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">[MR. BONTEMPO:] No, there is not, on paper, written down. But, we did have an oral agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Lares disputed that such an agreement ever existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE LARES:] Ah, did you have discussions during the period of 2000 to 2003 about, ah, whether your salaries should be equal to, or commensurate with Mr. Bontempo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">[MR. LARE:] No, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">From April 2004 through August 2008, Mr. Bontempo\u2019s salary was comparable, and sometimes equal, to the salary received by the Lares. At all other times, however, their salaries differed significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Mr. Lare\u2019s and Mr. Bontempo\u2019s respective responsibilities for running Quotient also evolved over time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At first, they both focused on soliciting clients and building new business. Later on, Mr. Lare focused more on management and operations, while Mr. Bontempo pursued new business and built and maintained client relationships. Later, on March 20, 2004, the three shareholders entered an Amended and Restated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement (the \u201cARSA\u201d). The ARSA restated (and did not alter) the parties\u2019 stock ownership and set forth the events that would trigger a compulsory stock sale to the other shareholders, including \u201c[t]ermination of a Shareholder\u2019s employment ... for good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">B. Growing Revenue And Growing Perks</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Quotient ultimately qualified for a General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) schedule, which meant that the company could submit bids as a prime contractor for federal government contracts, and it quickly secured contracts with a num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ber of large public and private organizations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With revenue growing, Quotient moved into office space in Columbia, Maryland in 2001, and has moved several times since to accommodate its continued growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In addition to the salaries Quotient paid to Messrs. Lare and Bontempo, the company covered cell phone expenses for both the Bontempos and the Lares. Quotient purchased automobiles for Mr. Bontempo\u2019s wife and for Ms. Lare. The Bontempos were issued company credit cards that they used for gas, meals, and entertainment. And Quotient paid for Mr. Lare and other Quotient employees to train with a corporate fitness training company, and for the Lares\u2019 personal trainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In 2006, the Lares also began paying household employees from Quotient\u2019s payroll account,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> using Quotient funds for personal legal fees, and advancing interest-free loans to Watermont and Broadway Equities, LLC (\u201cBroadway\u201d), a company Mr. Lare formed with his brother to own a beach house in New Jersey. In December 2007, Mr, Lare borrowed $205,586 from Quotient to fund renovations to the Lares\u2019 home. This loan originally was to be repaid by March 1, 2009, but on February 1, 2009, Mr. Lare executed a new note in the amount of $497,267.00, with the balance due on January 1, 2016.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Lares eventually agreed that many of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>expenses should have been treated as additional income, and they filed amended tax returns both for themselves and Quotient for tax years 2006 through 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">C. The Relationship Sours And Unravels</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The once-fruitful partnership between Mr. Lare and Mr. Bontempo eventually began to spoil. Mr. Lare\u2019s personal use of Quotient funds fueled a growing friction between him and Mr. Bontempo, and their mutual animosity became apparent to other employees. Mr. Bontempo blamed the discord on a series of unilateral decisions Mr. Lare made regarding distributions and salaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">Bontempo alleges that, in 2007, Lare took a $100,000.00 distribution and asked Bontempo to wait until the end of the year to take his distribution, but then [Lare\u2019s] distribution was converted to a loan which obviated the need to make a similar distribution to Bontempo. According to Bontempo, this also happened in 2008. Another source of conflict was the disparity in Bontempo and Lare\u2019s salaries in 2008. Bontempo\u2019s salary increased to $244,791.73 that year, and Lare\u2019s increased to $323,958.46. Bontempo believed that the difference in salary was supposed to be made up to him, but it never was. Bontempo alleges that in 2009, Lare took a distribution without telling Bontempo, and that Bontempo never received his proportionate distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Mr. Lare, on the other hand, attributed the strained relationship to his view that Mr. Bontempo\u2019s job performance had lagged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">Lare began to doubt Bontempo\u2019s commitment to Quotient in 2007, when Lare\u2019s own workload increased. Lare felt that as Quotient grew, more and more work fell on his shoulders and he needed more support from Bontempo, but was not receiving it. He felt that Bontempo was pursuing outside interests, such as his interest in jazz music and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>commercial ventures with his brother, to the detriment of Quotient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">To \u201clight a fire under\u201d Mr. Bontempo, Mr. Lare lowered his salary by ten percent in June 2009.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was not well received.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Another source of tension arose in September 2009, when Mr. Lare rejected Mr. Bontempo\u2019s suggestion that Quotient hire John O\u2019Leary, a technology professional with whom Mr. Bontempo was familiar. Mr. Lare contended that Quotient did not have the funds to hire an additional business development employee, although it turns out that he was simultaneously directing Quotient to advance funds to Watermont and Broadway. Mr. Bontempo disagreed with this decision even before learning about Mr. Lare\u2019s investment of Quotient funds into the other companies, and the tension grew.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The two men aired their grievances in November 2009. Mr. Lare expressed his concerns about Mr. Bontempo\u2019s performance and Mr. Bontempo raised his concerns about Mr. Lare\u2019s financial decisions (although he felt that his concerns were \u201cbrushed off\u2019). They met again in January 2010 to discuss salaries and distributions. According to Mr. Bontempo, after he asked Mr. Lare about his 2009 distribution, Mr. Lare responded that \u201c[t]here is no distribution.\u201d In response, Mr. Bontempo told Mr. Lare that they needed to work out an exit strategy, and proposed that they split the company. Mr. Lare refused, and instead told Mr. Bontempo to sell back his stock: \u201cYou need to sell your stock, Dave. You need to sell it. We need to come up with a price. You need to name a price, and sell it.\u201d Mr. Bontempo refused. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lare presented Mr. Bontempo with a proposal for Mr. Bontempo\u2019s departure from Quotient. Mr. Bontempo again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Mr. Lare and Mr. Bontempo held another meeting on March 26, 2010. Mr. Lare handed Mr. Bontempo a separation agreement that Mr. Bontempo refused to sign, then informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Mr. Bontempo that his employment was being terminated. Neither Mr. Bontempo nor Quotient\u2019s employees were informed that Mr. Bontempo was terminated \u201cfor cause,\u201d but at trial, Quotient contended, through the testimony of Mr. Lare, that Mr. Bontempo\u2019s firing resulted from his poor job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">D. The Aftermath</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">After termination, Mr. Bontempo remained an officer and director of Quotient. On March 29, 2010, while still in those roles, Mr. Bontempo revoked his personal guarantee of Quotient\u2019s credit facility with Branch Banking &amp; Trust (\u201cBB &amp; T\u201d). He claimed that he did this to limit the risk that he and his family would face if Quotient failed and because he thought that Mr. Lare \u201cwould just flat-out take [his] distributions.\u201d Shortly thereafter, BB &amp; T notified Quotient that its loan was in default as a result of multiple violations of the terms of the loan documents, including Mr. Bontempo\u2019s revocation, the filing of this lawsuit, and Quotient\u2019s loans to Watermont. Quotient had difficulty obtaining alternative financing, but ultimately entered a new credit facility with Wells Fargo Business Credit on less favorable terms than the original agreement with BB &amp; T; the difference cost the company $85,000 in additional finance charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On August 23, 2010, six months after his termination, Mr. Bontempo voluntarily resigned as an officer and director of Quotient. However, he remained (and remains to this day, so far as the record reflects) a shareholder, and he continued to receive distributions totaling $466,044 in 2009, $252,665 in 2010, and $465,000 in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">After his resignation as an officer and director, Mr. and Mrs. Bontempo started a new business, Siloquent LLC. Although Mr. Bontempo met with contacts he developed through Quotient and informed them that he was starting a new business, he claimed that he had no intention of soliciting business during those meetings. Because Siloquent did not have a GSA schedule, it struggled to compete with Quotient.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>E. The Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">1. Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On April 2, 2010, Mr. Bontempo filed his initial complaint against Quotient and the Lares in the Circuit Court for Howard County, which sought relief pursuant to Maryland\u2019s corporate dissolution statute, Md.Code (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol), Section 3\u2014413(b)(2) of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cCA\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 12, 2010, he amended the complaint to add counts of constructive trust, breach of fiduciary duty, and constructive fraud, and Quotient filed a counterclaim requesting a declaration that Mr. Bontempo was fired for cause, an order that he was accordingly required to sell his stock, and a finding that he breached fiduciary duties he owed to Quotient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mr. Bontempo amended his complaint again on December 21, 2010, and the trial court\u2019s overview of this second amended complaint (which remains the operative complaint and to which we will refer from here on as the \u201cComplaint\u201d) provides a helpful framework for the disputes before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Count I of [the Complaint] seeks relief pursuant to [CA \u00a7] 3-418.... Bontempo requests the following relief:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">1) Prompt appointment of a receiver or trustee to take charge of the assets and operate the business of the corporation, as necessary and proper to preserve Quotient\u2019s assets, pending a final determination as to potential judicial dissolution of Quotient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">2) An Order reinstating Bontempo as an employee of Quotient and appointing him as an officer of the Court to assist in preservation of Quotient\u2019s assets and customer relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>3) An Order requiring dissolution of Quotient at a specified future date, to become effective in the event that the stockholders fail to resolve their differences;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">4) An Order requiring the Lares to promptly and fully account to Quotient and Bontempo for any and all uses or transfers of Quotient assets to the Lares for their direct or indirect personal benefit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">5) An Injunction to prohibit continuing acts of oppressive conduct and to cease or reduce salary and distribution payments to the Lares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">6) An Order dividing Quotient\u2019s assets, including customer accounts, and awarding Bontempo 45% of Quotient\u2019s assets to manage independently of the Lares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">7) Damages to Bontempo as compensation for the Lares\u2019 illegal, oppressive, and fraudulent conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">8) Attorney\u2019s fees, including expert\u2019s fees, interest, and costs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">9) Further relief as may be just and appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">In Count II of the [Complaint], Bontempo alleges Constructive Trust against the Lares on behalf of Quotient. First, Bontempo requests that a constructive trust be established for any and all monies or property obtained for the benefit of the Lares outside of the auspices of Quotient, that the Lares convey to Quotient any such monies or property, and that Bontempo be awarded expenses for prosecuting this complaint on behalf of Quotient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">In Counts III and IV of the [Complaint], Bontempo alleges Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud against the Lares on behalf of Quotient. Bontempo requests the same relief for both Counts\u2014that the Lares be directed to pay compensatory damages to Quotient, punitive damages, and Bontempo\u2019s expenses for prosecuting the complaint on behalf of Quotient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">Bontempo alleges Breach of Contract in Count V, based on the alleged agreement that his salary would be equivalent to the combined salaries of the Lares and an alleged failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>receive his proportionate share of stockholder distributions. Bontempo seeks compensatory damages in the among of $528,000.00 for unpaid salary and $118,000.00 for distributions, as well as punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Before trial, each party filed a motion for partial summary judgment and the court held a motions hearing on March 3, 2011. <em>First, </em>Mr. Bontempo sought summary judgment on the portion of Quotient\u2019s counterclaim arguing that Mr. Bontempo breached his fiduciary duties to Quotient by filing this lawsuit in bad faith and by revoking his personal guarantee of Quotient\u2019s line of credit with BB <em>&amp; </em>T. The court denied this motion, finding that facts on the issue remained subject to dispute and that Mr. Bontempo was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Second, </em>Quotient sought summary judgment on two remedies sought by Mr. Bontempo\u2014his reinstatement as an officer and director of Quotient and dissolution of Quotient. The court denied this motion as well, declining, at that point, to find these remedies unavailable. <em>Finally, </em>the Lares sought summary judgment on Mr. Bontempo\u2019s request for employment-based remedies against them personally under CA \u00a7 3-413. The court granted this motion, finding employment-based damages <em>from a shareholder </em>impermissible under CA \u00a7 3-413 without a clear allegation of fraud on the part of that shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">A nine-day bench trial<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was held between March 14 and March 31, 2011, during which the parties presented 146 exhibits and the court heard testimony from eighteen witnesses. After trial, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on September 29, 2011. After timely post-trial motions and further hearings, the court issued three follow-up orders\u2014a Posh-Trial Memorandum and Order dated May 8, 2012, a Supplemental Memorandum and Order dated May 22, 2012, and a Clarification Order dated June 13, 2012\u2014that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>made additional findings and altered some of its original decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">2. The Trial Court\u2019s Initial Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In the circuit court\u2019s initial order, dated September 29, 2011, the court found in favor of Mr. Bontempo and against Quotient on Count I; in favor of Quotient and against Mr. Bontempo on Count II; in favor of Quotient and against the Lares on Count III; in favor of the Lares and against Quotient on Count IV; and in favor of Mr. Bontempo and against Quotient on Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">a. Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Under Count I, Mr. Bontempo requested equitable relief, including the dissolution of Quotient, pursuant to CA \u00a7 3-413(b)(2), based on the Lares\u2019 \u201cillegal, oppressive, and fraudulent\u201d conduct. The court applied <em>Edenbaum v. Schwarcz-Osztreicherne, </em>165 Md.App. 233, 885 A.2d 365 (2005), in which we held that a plaintiff alleging oppressive conduct was required to prove that those in control of the corporation oppressed \u201cthe reasonable expectations of the minority shareholder\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">[A] minority shareholder who reasonably expects that ownership in the corporation would entitle him to a job, a share of the corporate earnings, and a place in corporate management would be \u201coppressed\u201d ... when the majority seeks to defeat those expectations and there exists no effective means of salvaging the investment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 885 A.2d 365 (quoting <em>Balvik v. </em>Sylvester; 411 N.W.2d 383, 387 (N.D.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The court found that Mr. Lare\u2019s conduct, particularly his threat to fire Mr. Bontempo if he did not voluntarily resign and sell his shares, met the standard for oppressive conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>It reasoned that Mr. Lare attempted to defeat Mr. Bontempo\u2019s \u201creasonable expectations ... that [Quotient] would employ him, that he would participate (as a stockholder) in the company\u2019s profit distributions and that he would not be terminated for subjective reasons,\u201d and that Mr. Bontempo\u2019s reasonable expectations arose from the \u201csweat equity\u201d he contributed to Quotient.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In finding Mr. Bontempo\u2019s expectations\u2014specifically, his expectations to be an owner, to be employed, and to have a role in Quotient\u2014to be objectively reasonable, the trial court recognized that it had \u201can array of remedies available to it under <em>Edenbaum, </em>including \u2018alternative equitable remedies not specifically stated in the statute.\u2019 <em>[Edenbaum, </em>165 Md. App.] at 260 [885 A.2d 365].\u201d At the same time, the court specifically declined to dissolve Quotient:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">One of the remedies requested by Bontempo is dissolution of Quotient after a specified period of time if the parties are unable to resolve their <em>differences____The [court] is of the</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\n<em>opinion that this remedy would be inappropriate and that less drastic measures are available as remedies to address the harm caused by the oppressive conduct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">(Emphasis added.) Instead, the court ordered relief designed to assess the extent of the financial harm caused by the Lares\u2019 \u201coppressive conduct\u201d and to make Mr. Bontempo whole for redressing it:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">1. The ordering of a full and complete accounting by the Lares ... for misappropriated funds, <em>i.e., </em>all funds advanced or expenses paid that were for their direct or indirect benefit and not related to Quotient\u2019s legitimate business purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">2.

Reimbursement of the expert witness fees and expenses ... incurred by Bontempo in the total amount of $81,455.50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">b. Count II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In Count II, Mr. Bontempo brought a derivative claim on behalf of Quotient, requesting that the court establish a constructive trust<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and order the Lares to return all assets transferred to them from Quotient for their benefit and for the benefit of Broadway and Watermont. Mr. Bontempo sought to collect the fees and expenses he incurred in prosecuting this claim on Quotient\u2019s behalf. The trial court\u2019s order found in favor of Quotient but against Mr. Bontempo on this count and declined to order a constructive trust because it had awarded damages to Mr. Bontempo and ordered an accounting in connection with Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">c. Counts III and IY</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In Count III, Mr. Bontempo, again on behalf of Quotient, alleged that Mr. Lare breached his fiduciary duties to Quotient by giving interest-free loans to Broadway and Watermont in violation of its covenant with BB &amp; T, by giving himself a significant stockholder loan, by including his household employees in Quotient\u2019s healthcare plan, and by giving himself a $26,000 advance after Quotient had defaulted under the BB <em>&amp; </em>T financing agreement. The court cited <em>Storetrax.com, Inc. v. Gurland, </em>397 Md. 37, 915 A.2d 991 (2007), which held that directors of a corporation \u201c \u2018[ojccupy a fiduciary relation to the corporation and its stockholders,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 53, 915 A.2d 991 (quoting <em>Booth v. Robinson, </em>55 Md. 419, 436 (1881)), and \u201c\u2018are entrusted with powers which are to be exercised for the common and general interest of the corporation, <em>and not for their own private individual </em>benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 915 A.2d 991 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Booth, </em>55 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>436-37). The court found that Mr. Lare\u2019s personal use of corporate funds was contrary to the best interests of Quotient, contrary to Quotient\u2019s financial health, and constituted a breach of his fiduciary duty to Quotient. The court entered judgment in favor of Quotient and against the Lares, then found that \u201cthe damages for this breach are those previously awarded as a remedy to Lare\u2019s oppressive conduct,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>for Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In Count IV, Mr. Bontempo sought damages on behalf of Quotient for constructive fraud, which the court defined as \u201ca breach of legal or equitable duty that, irrespective of the moral guilt of the fraud feasor, the law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests,\u201d and recognized that \u201c[njeither actual dishonesty of purpose nor intent to deceive is an essential element of constructive fraud.\u201d <em>See Scheve v. McPherson, </em>44 Md.App. 398, 406, 408 A.2d 1071 (1979). Although the court found Mr. Lare to have exercised poor judgment and to have mismanaged corporate assets, it found that Mr. Bontempo had not proven that Mr. Lare\u2019s conduct was fraudulent, and it entered judgment for the Lares and against Quotient.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">d. Count V</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Mr. Bontempo alleged two breaches of contract. <em>First, </em>he alleged that he and Mr. Lare had reached an oral agreement that his salary would be equivalent to the Lares\u2019 combined salaries, and that his actual salary was lower by $528,000. <em>Second, </em>he alleged that he received $118,000 less than his proportionate share of shareholder distributions. Although Mr. Bontempo presented evidence that his salary equaled that of the Lares from 2004 through 2008, the court recognized that their salaries varied significantly during the early and later years of Mr. Bontempo\u2019s tenure with Quotient, and without written documentation to reflect the agreement or other evidence of a meeting of the minds, the court found that Mr. Bontempo failed to meet his burden of proving the existence of the salary equalization agreement. The court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>find, however, that Mr. Bontempo was entitled to the $118,000 for unpaid distributions, and entered judgment on this portion of Count V against Quotient. The court also ordered that Quotient pay attorneys\u2019 fees on this count, but denied punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">To sum up, then, the circuit court awarded the following to Mr. Bontempo and/or against Quotient in its initial post-trial order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">1. A full and complete accounting by the Lares (the majority in control of the corporation) for misappropriated funds, <em>i.e., </em>all funds advanced or expenses paid that were for their direct or indirect benefit and not related to Quotient\u2019s legitimate business purposes. (Count I\u2014 Judgment against Quotient; Count III\u2014Judgment against the Lares)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">[2.] Reimbursement of the legal fees and expenses incurred by Bontempo in the total amount of $211,267.34 (Count I\u2014Judgment against Quotient; Count III\u2014 Judgment against the Lares)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">[3.] Reimbursement of the expert witness fees and expenses billed for Robert A. Garvey incurred by Bontempo in the total amount of $81,455.50. (Count I\u2014 Judgment against Quotient; Count III\u2014Judgment against the Lares)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">[4.] Judgment in the amount of $118,000 in favor of Bontempo and against Quotient. (Count V)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">3. The Trial Court\u2019s Subsequent Findings Pursuant To The Parties\u2019 Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">a. The Motions To Alter Or Amend The Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">In response to the trial court\u2019s order, Mr. Bontempo filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment, in which he argued that the court failed to grant relief that vindicated his reasonable expectations pursuant to <em>Edenbaum. </em>Mr. Bontempo asked the court to revise its order and grant additional relief that the trial court later summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[1.] Appoint an Agent to supervise, and to report to the Court, concerning a Court-ordered allocation of Quotient\u2019s accounts and other assets on a 55/45 basis, \u25a0with the Court retaining equitable jurisdiction to grant further relief at a later date or, alternatively direct the Lares to sell their stock to Bontempo under the provisions of the [ARSA]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">[2.] Establish accounting procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">[3.] Allocate certain [Quotient] contracts to Bontempo as a subcontractor to Quotient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">[4.] Award Bontempo the salary he has not received since March 2010, in an amount equal to the combined salaries of [the Lares].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">[5.] Award Bontempo additional attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">[6.] Make a finding of fraud and award Bontempo punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">[7.] Require Jodi Lare (majority shareholder) to terminate Clark Lare (minority shareholder) for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">[8.] Impose personal liability on [the Lares] for the damages the Court awarded to Bontempo under Count I of the [Complaint].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">[9.] Imposition of a constructive trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">[10.] Make a finding of constructive fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">[11.] Award other various forms of short-term relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">The Lares and Quotient also filed together a Motion to Alter or Amend seeking a clarification of the order for an accounting, modification of the judgment to avoid double-counting, and elimination of the award of litigation costs. The court held a hearing on the post-trial motions on January 4, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">b. The May 8, 2012 Post-Trial Order</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">The trial court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order addressing the parties\u2019 posttrial motions on May 8, 2012. The court declined to grant the additional relief Mr. Bontempo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sought, but granted a portion of the relief sought by Quotient and the Lares. In denying Mr. Bontempo\u2019s motion, the court reiterated its decision not to remedy the Lares\u2019 misconduct by micromanaging the internal affairs of a prospering company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">a. The court found the compensation as proportionate to the services rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">b. The court declined to order dissolution because the remedies it had imposed addressed the oppressive conduct Mr. Bontempo had proven;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">c. The court would not reallocate Quotient\u2019s contracts to Mr. Bontempo because doing so would go far beyond his reasonable expectations for joining the company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">d. The court found no legal basis to award Mr. Bontempo, an at-will employee, employment-based damages such as back pay for a statutory oppression claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">e. The court found that any expectation of lifetime employment was unreasonable. Although the court emphasized that Mr. Bontempo had a subjective expectation of employment without termination and participation as a stockholder in the company\u2019s distributions, the court found that he knew he was a minority shareholder and an at-will employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">f. The court declined to direct that the majority shareholders sell their stock to Mr. Bontempo because it found no fraudulent conduct on the part of the Lares; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">g. The court declined to order Ms. Lare to sell her shares of Quotient because it had found oppressive conduct only on the part of Mr. Lare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">In response to the Quotient/Lare motion, the court clarified its order directing an accounting of \u201cmisappropriated funds\u201d under Count I. And in lieu of the damages it had ordered the Lares to pay to Mr. Bontempo under Count III, the court directed that the accounted-for amount should be characterized as a distribution to the Lares and that Mr. Bontempo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>should receive a proportionate distribution under Count I.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court also amended the previous equitable disbursement it had ordered under Count V and revised the unpaid distributions to $81,818.18. Finally, the court vacated the attorneys\u2019 fee, expert witness fee, and litigation expense awards because it had not held a hearing before awarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">c. The May 22, 2012 Supplemental Memorandum Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The trial court revisited the fee awards in a Supplemental Memorandum Opinion, which it issued on May 22, 2012, after holding another hearing. Mr. Bontempo had requested a fee award totaling $426,741.18 for winning on Counts I and III, and the court declined his request. The court declined to award fees under Count I because that count was not a derivative claim, and the court found no exception to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that would support fee-shifting to Quotient on that count. The court did find that Mr. Bontempo was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under Count III, the derivative claim, and that Quotient was responsible for these costs pursuant to the \u201ccommon fund doctrine\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cIf a derivative action is successful, in whole or in part, or if anything is received by the plaintiff as a result of a judgment, compromise, or settlement of an action or claim, the court may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and shall direct him to remit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the [close corporation] the remainder of those proceeds received by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Garcia v. Foulger Pratt Dev., Inc., </em>155 Md.App. 634, 664, 845 A.2d 16 (2003) (quoting CA \u00a7 10-1004). The court examined the fees and expenses sought by Mr. Bontempo, removed charges unrelated to the successful claims, reduced the total <em>pro rata </em>to reflect a 16.2% average success rate in the litigation, and entered a fee and expense award totaling $109,012.76.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">4. The Final Tally</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">When the post-trial dust settled, Mr. Bontempo prevailed (either personally or on behalf of Quotient) on Counts I, III, and V:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u2022 Under Count I, the court ordered Quotient to pay Mr. Bontempo $167,638;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u2022 Under Count III, the court ordered Quotient to treat the misappropriated funds (the same damages calculated by the accounting in Count I) as a distribution from Quotient to the Lares, from which Quotient would pay a proportionate distribution to Mr. Bontempo, and ordered Quotient to pay Mr. Bontempo attorneys\u2019 fees totaling $109,012.76; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">\u2022 Under Count V, the court directed Quotient to pay Mr. Bontempo $81,818.18 in unpaid distributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Mr. Bontempo filed a timely notice of appeal, and Quotient filed a timely cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Overall, nobody is wholly pleased with the decisions below, which in a complicated and heated case like this is usually a sign that the circuit court was on to something. Mr. Bontem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>po believes that he won the case below, but that the package of remedies the circuit court awarded does not reflect the full scope of the victory he won or the harms he and Quotient suffered. He raises the following questions for our review (which we have reworked for clarity):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">I. Whether the circuit court erred by declining to award all of the relief sought by Mr. Bontempo under Count I, despite having found that the Lares violated Mr. Bontempo\u2019s reasonable expectations as a minority shareholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">II. Whether the circuit court erred by declining to award Mr. Bontempo any damages from the Lares, personally, under Count I as a result of their oppressive conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in finding the Lares not liable to Quotient for constructive fraud in connection with Count IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">IV. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that the Lares\u2019 conduct was not \u201cfraudulent\u201d for purposes of justifying the imposition of punitive damages under Count IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">V. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that Mr. Bontempo had failed to carry his burden of proof on his equal compensation claims under Count V.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">For its part, Quotient doesn\u2019t challenge the circuit court\u2019s findings regarding Mr. Lare\u2019s oppressive conduct or the core remedies the circuit court imposed, but does contest the court\u2019s decision to award litigation fees and expenses to Mr. Bontempo under Count III. Quotient also raises an additional question bearing on the respective responsibility of the different parties (which we have renumbered to make it consecutive): <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">VI. Whether the trial court erred by requiring a corporation to pay a derivative plaintiffs litigation costs from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>its own funds where there was no recovery of funds for the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We affirm the overwhelming bulk of the circuit court\u2019s decisions. There was ample evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s findings that the Lares wrongfully blurred, and even ignored, the boundaries that Maryland corporate law draws between Quotient and the Lares\u2019 personal affairs, and that they did so to the detriment of Quotient and Mr. Bontempo. But as straightforward as the foregoing sentence may seem, it is a good bit harder to translate that general conclusion into specific findings of liability and remedies, particularly since, much as they did in real life, the Lares continue to characterize their rights and interests in this litigation as fully aligned with Quotient\u2019s. And they aren\u2019t, as we will see when we parse through the actual claims and findings, most notably in connection with the derivative claims Mr. Bontempo brought on behalf of Quotient to redress the Lares\u2019 overstepping. At the same time, the record amply supports the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Bontempo overstated his direct injuries, and the court quite reasonably declined his invitation to remedy the Lares\u2019 injuries to Quotient by dissolving the company and handing its customers over to him. The circuit court erred not through any errors of judgment or abuses of discretion regarding the nature or extent of the wrongs or injuries, but only in how it assigned responsibility for the damages among the parties, a tricky task given the confluence of individual and derivative claims the court faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"> As a general matter, we review the circuit court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Dynacorp Ltd. v. Aramtel Ltd., </em>208 Md.App. 403, 451, 56 A.3d 631 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 Md. 645, 62 A.3d 731 (2013).

We discuss more specific standards and sub-standards of review as they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">A. Rights, Duties, And Litigation In Closely Held Corporations</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">This case grows out of a relationship\u2014a business relationship defined by the parties\u2019 respective roles as directors, officers, and shareholders of Quotient. As the relationship unraveled and (d)evolved into litigation, the existence of the corporate form and the parties\u2019 respective roles in that corporation defined their rights and obligations among each other and vis-a-vis Quotient. Like most corporate divorces, this case involves an array of allegations, claims, and legal theories. Unlike most corporate divorces, Mr. Bontempo pursued not only the usual counts, but also asked the circuit court to dissolve Quotient or impose alternative remedies. Because his various claims are meant to serve different purposes under Maryland corporate law, it is worth pausing briefly to set the analytical stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Quotient is a Maryland corporation. Mr. Bontempo and the Lares are its shareholders; the Lares hold the majority of the shares. At all times, Mr. and Ms. Lare were officers; at most relevant times, Mr. Bontempo was as well. Corporations are creatures of statute that are owned by their shareholders, and \u201c[t]he directors of a corporation stand in a fiduciary relationship to the corporation and its stockholders.\u201d <em>Mona v. Mona Elec. Grp., </em>176 Md.App. 672, 695, 934 A.2d 450 (2007). A director is required to act reasonably and in the <em>corporation\u2019s </em>best interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">A director shall perform his duties as a director ...: (1) In good faith; (2) In a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation; and (3) With the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>CA \u00a7 2-405.1(a). Under the historic \u201cbusiness judgment rule,\u201d now codified at CA \u00a7 2-405.1(e), directors are <em>presumed </em>to act in a manner consistent with these duties, and the party challenging a director\u2019s decision(s) bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. <em>Mona, </em>176 Md.App. at 696, 934 A.2d 450 (citing <em>Bender v. Schwartz, </em>172 Md.App. 648, 667, 917 A.2d 142 (2007)); <em>see also </em>James J. Hanks, Jr., <em>Maryland Corporation Law </em>\u00a7 6.8, at 207 (2013 Supp.) (\u201cHanks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Maryland corporate law anticipates the possibility that majority shareholders might misuse their authority to the detriment of the minority or the corporation itself or both:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aua\">Maryland common law recognizes that minority shareholders are entitled to protection against fraudulent or illegal action of the majority. Especially in closely held corporations, the majority shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to the minority shareholder (or shareholders) \u201cnot to exercise [their] control to the disadvantage of minority shareholders.\u201d Ler<em>ner v. Lerner Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 53 [750 A.2d 709] (2000). A majority shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to minority shareholders not to use his voting power for his own benefit or for a purpose adverse to the interests of the corporation and its stockholders. <em>Coop. Milk Serv., Inc. v. Hepner, </em>198 Md. 104, 114 [81 A.2d 219] (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Mona, </em>176 Md.App. at 697, 934 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Accordingly, Maryland law recognizes three categories of options for minority shareholders aggrieved by the actions of the majority, each with a different remedial purpose. <em>First, </em>to the extent a minority shareholder suffers an injury personal to him, he can bring a direct action against the corporation, its officers, directors, or other shareholders and recover damages directly. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cTo maintain a direct action, the shareholder must allege that he has suffered \u2018an injury that is separate and distinct from any injury suffered either directly by the corporation or derivatively by the stockholder because of the injury to the corporation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Hanks \u00a7 6.8, at 183 (2005))). <em>Second, </em>and perhaps most commonly, a minority shareholder can bring a derivative action, \u201c \u2018an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>traordinary equitable device to enable shareholders to enforce a corporate right that the corporation failed to assert on its own behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698, 934 A.2d 450 (quoting <em>Werbowsky v. Collomb, </em>362 Md. 581, 599, 766 A.2d 123 (2001)). Unlike a direct action, however, \u201c[a]ny recovery in a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit is in favor of the <em>corporation, </em>not the individual shareholder (or shareholders) who brought the derivative action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). And <em>third, </em>as we discuss next because Mr. Bontempo started his complaints with such a request, any shareholder (minority or otherwise) can ask a circuit court to dissolve the corporation, CA \u00a7 3-413, or to order alternative equitable relief available in Maryland under the dissolution statute- since our decision in <em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. 233, 885 A.2d 365. This case features claims falling into the latter two categories although, as we shall see, the boundaries can get blurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">B. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Crafting Alternative Equitable Relief For Count I, The Dissolution Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Mr. Bontempo alleged in Count I that the Lares engaged in \u201coppressive conduct,\u201d as that term is used in CA \u00a7 3-413(b)(2), and asked the circuit court to order broad equitable relief in response. He prevailed on the merits of this count, but challenges the relief that the circuit court awarded him, which we review for abuse of discretion. \u201c[W]e will not reverse a ruling ... simply because we would have made a different ruling had we been sitting as trial judges,\u201d and we will only vacate a decision if \u201cno reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. at 254, 885 A.2d 365 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">1. The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement Defines The Parties\u2019 Rights And The Range Of Appropriate Remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We start, as we must, with the statute. Section 3-413(b)(2) of the Corporations and Associations Article provides that \u201cany <em>stockholder </em>entitled to vote in the election of directors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>a corporation may petition a court of equity to dissolve the corporation on the grounds that ... [t]he acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.\u201d CA \u00a7 3\u2014413(b)(2) (emphasis added). The key word is <em>stockholder: </em>Mr. Bontempo\u2019s standing to seek relief under \u00a7 3-413 arises from his status as a shareholder of Quotient. And although <em>Edenbaum </em>may not have used these precise words, his status as a shareholder of Quotient (as defined by his shareholder agreement) defines and bounds the rights he is entitled to vindicate in this count and informs the analysis of the appropriate equitable remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Liability </em>is not in dispute at this point. Neither Mr. Lare nor Quotient challenges the finding that Mr. Lare committed \u201coppressive conduct,\u201d a concept we defined in <em>Edenbaum </em>as turning on the objectively reasonable expectations of the shareholder going into the enterprise: conduct is oppressive if it \u201c \u2018substantially defeats expectations that, objectively viewed were both reasonable under the circumstances and were central to the [minority shareholder\u2019s] decision to join the venture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. at 258, 885 A.2d 365 (quoting <em>Matter of Kemp &amp; Beatley, Inc., </em>64 N.Y.2d 63, 484 N.Y.S.2d 799, 473 N.E.2d 1173, 1179 (1984)). Mr. Bontempo contended at trial that he \u201creasonably expected to be employed by Quotient, to share in its earnings per his agreements with the Lares, and to have a place in its day-to-day management.\u201d And the circuit court largely agreed as a factual matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Lare\u2019s assertions that Bontempo\u2019s job performance was poor and that he had \u201cchecked out\u201d of the company strains credulity and is totally against the weight of the evidence. By all accounts, Bontempo was a responsible and dedicated employee. Bontempo\u2019s commitment to the company (as an employee, director and stockholder) was further evidenced by his willingness to reduce his own salary in order to bring in an employee (O\u2019Leary) who he believed would contribute to Quotient\u2019s success. Lare told Bontempo that Quotient could not afford O\u2019Leary\u2019s salary during the same time he was directing that Quotient funds be diverted to Watermont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and Broadway, two entities in which the Lares had a personal financial interest. There is no support for Lare\u2019s position that Bontempo was well aware of\u2014and approved\u2014 the multitude of transactions that took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">Lare\u2019s testimony regarding his reasons for terminating Bontempo is not credible. Lare\u2019s feeling that he and Bontempo could no longer work together was obvious to other key Quotient employees. The professional incompatibility that developed cannot be attributed to Bontempo\u2019s job performance. Bontempo testified that Lare threatened to fire him if he would not voluntarily resign and sell his stock. When Bontempo refused, Lare followed through on his threat. Lare testified that he never told Bontempo that he was being fired for cause under the ARSA. It is significant that there was no indication by Lare to Bontempo that he was being terminated for cause until after the threat of litigation loomed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">The Court finds that Lare\u2019s actions were oppressive, particularly as they related to the credible testimony that Bontempo would be fired if he did not voluntarily resign and sell his shares of Quotient stock. Bontempo\u2019s reasonable expectations were that this <em>start-up company would employ him, </em>that he would participate (as a stockholder) in the company\u2019s profit distributions and that <em>he would not be terminated for subjective reasons. </em>Bontempo was more than a mere employee of Quotient\u2014he was, in all respects, a founding member of the company and made significant contributions to the company\u2019s later successes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">(Emphasis added.) Mr. Lare and Quotient fought these points at trial, but neither challenges the circuit court\u2019s conclusions now.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The harder part comes in evaluating the <em>relief </em>the circuit court awarded in connection with this count. Mr. Bontempo argues that despite finding oppressive conduct, the circuit court effectively gave him no relief. He argues that the court found that Mr. Lare had no cause to terminate him, but awarded no damages for his lost employment, and limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>his recovery only to an accounting and <em>post hoc </em>distribution that would have been required anyway. We disagree that the court abused its discretion by fashioning the relief in this manner, but it takes a few steps to explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>Edenbaum, </em>which bears a strong structural resemblance to this case, frames our analysis. In that case, two owner-operators of an assisted living facility entered into a shareholders\u2019 agreement that, among other things, provided that the plaintiff (the minority shareholder) would be employed as its Director of Operations and that each shareholder would receive equal salaries and profits. 165 Md.App. at 239, 885 A.2d 365. The defendant (the majority shareholder) became dissatisfied with the plaintiffs performance, offered her two buyout options, and threatened to fire her if she did not agree to one of them. The plaintiff refused, was fired, and sued for breach of contract and for dissolution pursuant to CA \u00a7 3-413(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 241, 885 A.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We agreed in <em>Edenbaum </em>with the trial court that the plaintiff was oppressed because \u201c[h]er termination substantially defeated her reasonable expectations that she would be employed by the corporation, receive a salary, and take part in [the business\u2019s] management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 885 A.2d 365. But we also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to dissolve the corporation. Because dissolution is an irrevocable all-or-nothing remedy, <em>id. </em>at 259, 885 A.2d 365 (\u201c \u2018[T]he demise of a corporation is regulated as an extraordinary action under Title 3 of the Article.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 48-49, 871 A.2d 554 (2005))), we expressed a concern shared by courts in other states: allowing minority shareholders to force dissolution too easily risked shifting too much power to them. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cMoreover, \u2018[i]n a sense, a forced dissolution allows minority shareholders to exercise retaliatory oppression against the majority.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Alaska Plastics, Inc. v. Coppock, </em>621 P.2d 270, 274 (Alaska 1980))). We decided, therefore, to join other states that recognize remedial measures short of dissolution, and we adopted a list of alternative remedies described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Baker v. Commercial Body Builders, Inc., </em>264 Or. 614, 507 P.2d 387, 395-96 (1973), for the circuit court to consider on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">(a) The entry of an order requiring dissolution of the corporation at a specified future date, to become effective only in the event that the stockholders fail to resolve their differences prior to that date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">(b) The appointment of a receiver, not for the purposes of dissolution, but to continue the operation of the corporation for the benefit of all the stockholders, both majority and minority, until differences are resolved or \u201coppressive\u201d conduct ceases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">(c) The appointment of a \u201cspecial fiscal agent\u201d to report to the court relating to the continued operation of the corporation, as a protection to its minority stockholders, and the retention of jurisdiction of the case by the court for that purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">(d) The retention of jurisdiction of the case by the court for the protection of the minority stockholders without appointment of a receiver or \u201cspecial fiscal agent\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">(e) The ordering of an accounting by the majority in control of the corporation for funds alleged to have been misappropriated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">(f) The issuance of an injunction to prohibit continuing acts of \u201coppressive\u201d conduct and which may include the reduction of salaries or bonus payments found to be unjustified or excessive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">(g) The ordering of affirmative relief by the required declaration of a dividend or a reduction and distribution of capital;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">(h) The ordering of affirmative relief by the entry of an order requiring the corporation or a majority of its stockholders to purchase the stock of the minority stockholders at a price to be determined according to a specified formula or at a price determined by the court to be a fair and reasonable price;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(i) The ordering of affirmative relief by the entry of an order permitting minority stockholders to purchase additional stock under conditions specified by the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">(j) An award of damages to minority stockholders as compensation for any injury suffered by them as the result of \u201coppressive\u201d conduct by the majority in control of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. at 260-61, 885 A.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Two overarching principles emerged from <em>Edenbaum. First, </em>and notwithstanding the title of the statute, dissolution is not the only remedy available to a court that finds oppressive conduct in a dissolution proceeding under CA \u00a7 3-413. If a minority shareholder proves that a majority has committed oppressive conduct, as the circuit court found here, the court can fashion remedies anywhere along a broad spectrum that individually or in combination, in its equitable discretion, best redress the minority shareholder\u2019s thwarted expectations. <em>Second, </em>the terms of the shareholders\u2019 agreement define the reasonable expectations of the minority shareholder that the majority can oppress and the boundaries of the remedies the court can award for oppressive conduct. <em>Edenbaum </em>recognized that it is possible for a shareholders\u2019 agreement to constitute an employment agreement\u2014or, put another way, to articulate a minority shareholder\u2019s expectation to employment on agreed terms\u2014but that the outcome will turn on the specific agreement. 165 Md.App. at 248-50, 885 A.2d 365. In general, shareholders\u2019 agreements will <em>not </em>contain operational terms like that\u2014it is much more common for companies to enter into separate employment agreements with key employees. But closely held corporations like the one in <em>Edenbaum, </em>and like Quotient, can and sometimes do manage their affairs more flexibly. The question here is what Quotient and its shareholders actually agreed to, and specifically whether this agreement included any rights to employment Mr. Bontempo could vindicate under the dissolution statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The circuit court did not decide this question in its analysis of Count I, so applying the <em>Edenbaum </em>principles to this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>requires us to interpolate that step now. The circuit court\u2019s initial opinion says that Mr. Bontempo had reasonable expectations about his role in the company: that \u201cthis <em>start-up company would employ him, </em>that he would participate (as a stockholder) in the company\u2019s profit distributions and that <em>he would not be terminated for subjective reasons\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This language seems to have thrown the parties an analytical head-fake\u2014by emphasizing the termination decision in reaching the conclusion that Mr. Lare had behaved oppressively, the opinion could be read to suggest that those expectations included an enforceable right to employment. Had the circuit court found, as in <em>Edenbaum, </em>that the shareholders\u2019 agreement doubled as an employment agreement, Mr. Bontempo would have a good argument that the circuit court should have made him whole in that regard (or, at the very least, that the court would have abused its discretion by not addressing it). But unlike <em>Edenbaum, </em>the shareholders\u2019 agreement in this case makes no mention whatsoever of employment rights. And the circuit court reached exactly the opposite conclusion in the course of rejecting Quotient\u2019s request for a declaratory injunction, when it found that Mr. Bontempo did not have an employment agreement and, therefore, was <em>an at-will employee. </em>As an at-will employee whose shareholders\u2019 agreement created no expectations of employment, Mr. Bontempo could not, as a matter of law, have recovered employment-related damages under Count I. Mr. Lare\u2019s frustration of Mr. Bontempo\u2019s expectations of employment and participation in the company\u2019s management and affairs absolutely informed the broader question of whether his rights as a shareholder were oppressed, and thus whether he was entitled to some form of relief (as we discuss below). But the terms of the agreement itself did not include an enforceable right to employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">What, then, were Mr. Bontempo\u2019s reasonable expectations as a shareholder? He obviously was entitled to participate fully in Quotient\u2019s shareholder distributions, even after his employment was terminated and even after he resigned as an officer and director\u2014which he did, and he does not claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>otherwise. Beyond that, the circuit court\u2019s findings support an expectation of continued participation in the affairs and decisions of Quotient consistent with his status <em>a,s a shareholder. </em>Again, we recognize that the circuit court\u2019s initial opinion couched Mr. Bontempo\u2019s expectations substantially in terms of employment. But the final sentence of the circuit court\u2019s discussion of Mr. Bontempo\u2019s expectations states them in terms more consistent with the agreement\u2019s actual scope: \u201cBontempo stated that his expectations were that he would be an owner of the company, work for the company and would have a <em>role in the company </em>as long as he was a stockholder.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And because he was (and remains) an owner of the company and did work for the company, the reasonable expectations Mr. Lare thwarted, and for which Mr. Bontempo was entitled to relief, relate to his ongoing role in the company <em>as a shareholder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In that context, we see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision not to dissolve or dismember Quotient. Unlike <em>Renbaum, </em>386 Md. 28, 871 A.2d 554, a case involving a family-owned corporation that had an evenly and irreconcilably divided board, the court found that Quotient\u2019s board was not so deadlocked, and also that Quotient was a prosperous going concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">The Court is of the opinion that [dissolution] would be inappropriate and that less drastic measures are available as remedies to address the harm caused by the oppressive conduct. The court also notes that since Bontempo resigned from the Board of Directors, there is no evidence that the current directors are \u201cso divided\u201d regarding the management of the corporation\u2019s affairs that involuntary dissolution of the corporation is warranted.... Reinstatement of Bontempo as an employee of Quotient is also not a viable remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">There was also no evidence presented that Quotient is\u2014or is likely to become\u2014insolvent. The company\u2019s revenues have continued to increase over the years and O\u2019Leary opined that, in his view, the pending litigation has not had an impact on Quotient\u2019s ability to get business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Dissolution is an extreme remedy, and by acknowledging the availability of alternatives, <em>Edenbaum </em>cautions strongly against dissolving corporations when a less drastic remedy will address the oppressive conduct and resulting harm. 165 Md.App. at 259-61, 885 A.2d 365. Quotient grew and paid Mr. Bontempo hundreds of thousands of dollars in distributions during the course of these disputes, even after he ceased to have any role in its business or success (indeed, while he tried to compete with it). A reasonable trial court easily could have decided on this record not to dissolve Quotient, and the circuit court acted well within its discretion in declining to do so here. The same reasoning applies to the court\u2019s decision not to divide Quotient\u2019s customers between Messrs. Bontempo and Lare, which would have had the same effect as an outright dissolution\u2014the record readily could support a finding that dividing Quotient (or allocating forty-five percent of its customers to Mr. Bontempo\u2019s new company) would overpenalize the Lares, overcompensate Mr. Bontempo, needlessly break up a thriving company, or all of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">This brings us to the relief the court did order, which focused on the money Mr. Lare misappropriated from Quotient. Initially, the court ordered an accounting in order to determine how much the Lares had diverted. After the accounting was completed (the accounting first identified $118,000 in diverted funds, later amended to $81,818.18), and in response to post-trial motions, the court structured the award as a distribution from Quotient to the shareholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYk\">It is the Court\u2019s intention to clarify that the Court-ordered accounting is with respect to unreimbursed expenses paid by Quotient for the Lares\u2019 household employees or their personal litigation expenses. The Court is also of the opinion that the amount should be characterized as a distribution and that Bontempo should receive his proportionate share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">The Court\u2019s Decision shall be modified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">A full and complete accounting by the Lares (the majority in control of the corporation) for misappropriated funds, <em>ie., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>all funds advanced or expenses paid by Quotient for the Lares\u2019 household employees or personal litigation expenses; judgment is entered for Bontempo and against Quotient on Count I in a proportionate share of the accounted-for amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Mr. Bontempo contends that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting equitable relief to the \u201cproportionate distribution\u201d and argues that this \u201crelief would have been legally required even absent [Mr.] Bontempo\u2019s firing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We disagree, and are persuaded that the court\u2019s decisions to award money damages determined by an accounting and to fashion the award as a distribution, in which Mr. Bontempo would share <em>pro rata </em>as a shareholder, fell within its discretion. There is nothing unusual about the format of the award\u2014indeed, we specifically included \u201c \u2018[t]he ordering of affirmative relief by the required declaration of a dividend or a reduction and distribution of capital\u2019 \u201d among the alternative relief options we adopted in <em>Edenbawn. See </em>165 Md.App. at 261, 885 A.2d 365 (quoting <em>Baker, </em>507 P.2d at 396). And aside from the timing and rationale of Mr. Bontempo\u2019s termination, which we have addressed above, the circuit court found that Mr. Lare acted oppressively in misappropriating funds from Quotient for his and Ms. Lare\u2019s personal use. To the extent those misappropriations took money from Quotient that should have been available for distributions to shareholders, Mr. Bontempo is made whole personally by a distribution that pays him his proportionate share of the misappropriated funds.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">And <em>finally, </em>and putting aside that the <em>Edenbaum </em>list of alternative remedies does not include punitive damages, the record supports the circuit court\u2019s findings in the initial opinion that \u201c[although the Court has found that [Mr.] Lare\u2019s conduct was oppressive, the Court does not find that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fraudulent,\u201d and again, after post-trial motions, that \u201c[t]he evidence does not support Bontempo\u2019s claim that the Lares engaged in a long course of acts that were illegal or fraudulent.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Of course, \u201cminority shareholders are entitled to protection against fraudulent or illegal action of the majority.\u201d <em>Mona v. Morm Elec. Grp., Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 672, 697, 934 A.2d 450 (2007). This is particularly true in closely held corporations, in which a \u201cmajority shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to the, minority shareholder (or shareholders) \u2018not to exercise [their] control to the disadvantage of minority stockholders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lerner v. Lerner Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 53, 750 A.2d 709 (2000)). And to be sure, a majority shareholder may not use his position of power \u201cfor his own benefit or for a purpose adverse to the interests of the corporation and its stockholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Coop. Milk Serv., Inc. v. Hepner, </em>198 Md. 104, 114, 81 A.2d 219 (1951)). But we find no clear error in the circuit court\u2019s findings that the Lares\u2019 specific conduct qualified as oppressive and compensable under <em>Edenbaum, </em>rather than illegal or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">2. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Granting Summary Judgment For The Lares In Their Personal Capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Mr. Bontempo and the Lares each submitted a motion for summary judgment early in the proceedings, and a hearing on the motions was held on March 3, 2011. The trial court granted the Lares\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and released them from potential personal liability under CA \u00a7 3-413(b)(2), based on the same alleged oppressive, fraudulent, and illegal conduct we addressed above. Mr. Bontempo challenges this1 decision on appeal and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The Lares moved for summary judgment on two grounds: <em>first, </em>that a shareholder cannot be held personally liable for damages under CA \u00a7 3\u2014413(b)(2), even with a showing of fraud, and <em>second, </em>even if personal liability was possible, that Mr. Bontempo had failed to allege fraud. In response, Mr. Bontempo contended personal liability was warranted because <em>Edenbaum, </em>supported personal liability and because he <em>did </em>allege fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Although the Court [in <em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. 233, 885 A.2d 365,] concluded that the majority shareholder in that case would not be held personally liable for back-salary, the Court discussed the fact that in that case there was no allegation of fraud by the majority shareholder, which is relevant to the issue of whether personal liability should attach. And here Mr. Bontempo\u2019s complaint, and the evidence he\u2019s cited on the Summary Judgment Record are replete with allegations that the Lares, as majority shareholders, engaged in fraudulent conduct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We see no opportunity for personal liability on the part of the Lares here. Remember, again, the purpose of this statute: to vindicate the reasonable expectations of minority shareholders, in their capacities <em>as shareholders </em>and as defined by their shareholders\u2019 agreement, against oppression by majority shareholders. Here, we have already affirmed the circuit court\u2019s finding that the Lares did not act illegally or commit fraud, so Mr. Bontempo\u2019s argument here fails at the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The argument also fails as a matter of law. None of the discussion of personal liability in <em>Edenbaum </em>arose in our analysis of the CA \u00a7 3-413 claims, but rather in connection with the plaintiffs breach of employment agreement claim. To the extent we suggested that personal liability might be available if the plaintiff proved fraud, we made that suggestion in an altogether different context that does not generalize to claims under CA \u00a7 3-413. Regardless, CA \u00a7 3\u2014413(b)(2) and <em>Edenbaum </em>authorize the circuit court to impose any or all of the available equitable remedies, including dissolution, and to direct those remedies to the offending majority shareholders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>See Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. at 260, 885 A.2d 365. The rights a minority shareholder can assert (or a majority shareholder can oppress) under CA \u00a7 3-413 arise under a corporate document that defines the parties\u2019 rights and obligations <em>as </em>shareholders\u2014a relationship each holds primarily with the company and indirectly with each other\u2014and the available suite of remedies re-balances those relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">This case is a good example. Mr. Bontempo\u2019s injuries manifested themselves here in the form of lost shareholder distributions from Quotient\u2014and, had we agreed with him that he had a reasonable shareholders\u2019 agreement-based expectation of employment, his remedy would have taken the form of lost salary and benefits owed to him by Quotient. None of this bears, of course, on the altogether separate question of whether the majority shareholders, <em>ie., </em>the Lares, are liable to Quotient in connection with these allegations\u2014 indeed, as we discuss in Section II.C.l, they are, albeit under a different theory. But on the specific claim under CA \u00a7 3-413, we agree with the circuit court that the Lares could not have been liable personally to Mr. Bontempo.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">C. The Damages Awarded Under Count III Did Not Make Quotient Whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In contrast to his shareholder claim against the Lares in Count I, Mr. Bontempo brought the claims alleged in Counts II, III and IV on behalf of Quotient.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This group of claims sought to enforce the Lares\u2019 obligations to the <em>company, </em>not Mr. Bontempo\u2019s rights vis-a-vis the Lares. This difference matters\u2014not, as we will explain, with regard to the circuit court\u2019s liability findings, with which we agree, but with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to the remedies the circuit court ordered in response to its findings in Mr. Bontempo\u2019s favor on Count III. We find no error in the circuit court\u2019s findings that the Lares\u2019 actions breached their fiduciary duties to Quotient and that their specific breaches did not rise to the level of fraud, constructive or otherwise. But after the circuit court found for Quotient and against the Lares on Count III, the ensuing relief should have required the Lares, the parties who breached duties, to make <em>Quotient, </em>the victim, whole. By combining the remedies for Counts I and III, the circuit court\u2019s relief package left this critical purpose unrequited.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">1. The Lares Breached Duties, But Did Not Remedy The Breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We start from the fact (which they do not dispute) that as officers and directors of Quotient, the Lares owed statutory fiduciary duties to the company. <em>See </em>CA \u00a7 2-405.1(a); <em>Storetrax.com, Inc. v. Gurland, </em>397 Md. 37, 53-54, 915 A.2d 991 (2007) (directors of a corporation \u201c[ojccupy a fiduciary relation to the corporation and its stockholders\u201d); <em>Wasserman v. Kay, </em>197 Md.App. 586, 609, 14 A.3d 1193 (2011). Mr. Bontempo\u2019s allegations that the Lares breached those duties created a dispute (that this count was meant to resolve) about the alignment between the Lares\u2019 financial interests and the company\u2019s. Had the Lares prevailed, they might be able to argue that their interests and Quotient\u2019s were in sync. But once the circuit court found that the Lares breached those duties, and thus that they were liable to Quotient under Count III,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the court found by definition that Quotient\u2019s interests <em>diverged </em>from the Lares\u2019 when they diverted company assets to their personal use, the same transactions that the circuit court found oppressive for purposes of CA \u00a7 3\u2014413(b)(2). A divergence is not <em>per se </em>improper, <em>see Storetrax, </em>397 Md. at 53-61, 915 A.2d 991, but the circuit court found it improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>here, and we agree. The question now is whether the accounting and distribution the circuit court had ordered under Count I also remedied the Lares\u2019 breach of the fiduciary-duties they owed to Quotient. We conclude that they did not, because the accounting and distribution the court ordered in Count I did not require the Lares to make Quotient whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The essence of the breach here was that the Lares diverted corporate funds to their personal use: they took money from Quotient to which they otherwise were not entitled and used that money to pay personal expenses. At the most fundamental level, then, the circuit court should have required the Lares to repay Quotient from their personal funds. And at first, the circuit court did exactly that. At the post-trial motions hearing, however, counsel for Quotient\u2014the corporation from whom the Lares misappropriated funds\u2014asked the court to treat the misappropriated funds as a distribution to shareholders, which would forgive the Lares and pay a proportionate share to Mr. Bontempo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">Whatever that number is that you come with [through the accounting], let\u2019s just say $200,000 just for purposes of the discussion, there are several ways you can handle that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">One way is to treat it as a distribution to the Lares and then there would be an offsetting distribution back to Mr. Bontempo. That is the simplest way to deal with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">If it\u2019s going to be\u2014if you\u2019re going to ask that that money be repaid to the company, then it\u2019s got to be clear that it not go out in full to Mr. Bontempo because that would be sort of a double recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">The simplest way, we think, is just treat it as a distribution. They will then deal with it on their taxes. Mr. Bontempo will get his share and he can deal with it on his taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">In its post-trial order, the circuit court agreed, concluding \u201cthat the amount established [pursuant to the accounting] should be characterized as a distribution [under Count III] and that [Mr.] Bontempo should receive his proportionate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>share [through the damage award ordered under Count I].\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">This remedy rewarded the Lares at the expense (yet again) of Quotient. A distribution may have had some appeal for accounting purposes, and we recognize that Quotient, acting properly through its board, could have decided after a judgment to declare an equivalent distribution. We also agree that Mr. Bontempo was not entitled to recover directly the full amount of the funds the Lares took from Quotient. But by allowing Quotient to distribute the misappropriated funds back to the Lares, the distribution approach absolved the Lares of their obligation to reimburse Quotient and spared the Quotient board the obligation to justify any distribution on the merits. Indeed, the Count III relief left Quotient <em>worse off: </em>the order required Quotient to forgive the Lares <em>in toto, </em>and it only got to \u201ckeep\u201d <em>55% </em>of the money the Lares diverted\u2014it had to pay the remaining 45% out of pocket to Mr. Bontempo. By failing to require the Lares to make Quotient whole, the remedies ordered for Count III fell \u201c \u2018beyond the fringe of what [we deem] minimally acceptable,\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastside Vend Distribs., Inc. v. Pepsi Bottling Grp. Inc., </em>396 Md. 219, 239, 913 A.2d 50 (2006) (quoting <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603 (2005)), and we vacate the damages award under Count III and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. On remand, the circuit court should determine the value of the Lares\u2019 diversion (the outcome of the accounting may well provide that figure, but we leave it to the court to decide if that is true) and order the Lares to repay that sum to Quotient. What Quotient does or does not do thereafter is its business, although the board would, of course, need to act in a manner consistent with Maryland corporate law, and specifically would need to be able to justify any post-judgment decision to re-distribute recovered funds against the directors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>duties to Quotient at the time and under the circumstances of any such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">As we look back at it (a luxury we have on appeal), this proposal suffered all along from a fundamental conflict of interest. Mr. Bontempo was the plaintiff, but <em>Quotient </em>was the victim whose rights and injuries Mr. Bontempo sought to redress in Count III. In this important regard, Quotient\u2019s interests not only diverged from the Lares\u2019, but stood in direct conflict: the Lares took <em>Quotient\u2019s </em>money, not Mr. Bontempo\u2019s. The Lares and Quotient nominally recognized their adverse positions by hiring separate counsel, but seem (incorrectly, in our view) to have treated their interests as fully aligned throughout the litigation, and especially so with regard to the Count III remedy proposal, which benefitted the Lares at Quotient\u2019s expense. We recognize and do not mean to diminish the value of settlement. But where, as here, the court has found as a matter of fact that the Lares breached fiduciary duties to Quotient, the court should consider any remedies the Lares and Quotient might propose jointly against the backdrop of this inherent conflict. <em>See Tydings v. Berk Enters., </em>80 Md.App. 634, 639, 565 A.2d 390 (1989) (\u201cRepresentation of a corporation as an entity and the majority of its directors, individually, creates a possible conflict of interest for the attorney, particularly where the corporation\u2019s interests are adverse to those of the directors.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Hanks \u00a7 7.21[g], at 276.48 (2012 Supp.) (\u201c[I]n attempting to settle [a derivative suit against a corporate director], the defendant has an interest in reaching the lowest possible settlement while the corporation, represented by the plaintiff, wants the highest possible settlement.\u201d); Md. Rule 16-812 Rules of Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">2. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Declining To Find Fraud Or Impose Punitive Damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">With regard to Count IV, Mr. Bontempo contends that the trial court erred in declining to find that the Lares engaged in constructive fraud, \u201ca breach of legal or equitable duty which, irrespective of the moral guilt of the fraud feasor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests.\u201d <em>Scheve v. McPherson, </em>44 Md.App. 398, 406, 408 A.2d 1071 (1979) (quoting 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 2c (1943) (predecessor to current 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7 5 (2008))); <em>see also Crawford v. Mindel, </em>57 Md.App. 111, 120-21, 469 A.2d 454 (1984). It is true that constructive fraud commonly arises from a breach of a fiduciary duty in the corporate context. <em>See </em>Pleading Causes of Action in Maryland, Torts, Paul Mark Sandler 91 (4th ed.2010) (citing <em>Crawford, </em>57 Md.App. 111, 469 A.2d 454). But the two are not equivalent: a director can breach fiduciary duties without committing fraud.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In this case, the circuit court\u2019s factual findings, which we are persuaded are not clearly erroneous on this copious record, fall short of finding an intention or tendency to deceive. The Lares\u2019 actions might better be characterized as brazen, since they seem to have made no effort to hide their use of Quotient\u2019s funds for their own purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">The Court found\u2014and remains convinced\u2014that the evidence presented does not support an award of punitive damages. The evidence does not support Bontempo\u2019s claim that the Lares engaged in a long course of acts that are illegal or fraudulent. Bad judgment, such as including household employees on Quotient\u2019s payroll, without more does not rise to the level of being fraudulent conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">All of the transactions at issue were recorded on the books of the corporation and it is undisputed that Bontempo had access to these books and records. The Lares\u2019 household employees\u2019 names were recorded on the payroll records and several of the employees testified that they were aware of this and had never been told to not mention it to Bontempo. Some of the evidence presented was to the effect that Bontempo was not only aware of some of these improper transactions but had, in fact, given his approval for them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Based upon the extensive testimony and evidence presented at the trial, the Court found that although Clark Lare\u2019s actions were oppressive, they were not fraudulent. There was nothing new that was presented during the motions argument to convince the Court that the Plaintiff was defrauded. Bontempo failed to meet his burden of showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that a fraud was perpetuated upon him or Quotient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">These findings are consistent with the structure of a corporation held as closely as this one, where the universe of shareholders and board members and officers is small and, if people aren\u2019t careful, the personal and corporate boundaries can easily be blurred. The circuit court had the opportunity to hear the testimony and review the evidence first-hand, and we see no basis to second-guess the court\u2019s finding that the Lares did not commit fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">For the same reason, then, the circuit court did not err in declining to award punitive damages. Beyond fraud, \u201c \u2018actual malice must be proven for recovery of punitive damages in an action for fraud,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav., F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 236, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995) (quoting <em>Fairfax Sav., F.S.B. v. Ellerin, </em>94 Md.App. 685, 710, 619 A.2d 141 (1993)), and actual malice can be \u201cevidenced by malicious, deliberate, gross or wanton conduct [accompanying] the fraud,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>57 Md.App. at 126, 469 A.2d 454, or a showing of an \u201c \u2018evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garcia v. Foulger Pratt Dev., Inc., </em>155 Md.App. 634, 684-85, 845 A.2d 16 (2003) (quoting <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 454, 601 A.2d 633 (1992)). Constructive fraud, on its own, would not serve as an independent ground for finding actual malice and would not have been sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award, <em>Ellerin, </em>337 Md. at 236, 652 A.2d 1117 (constructive fraud \u201cfalls short of the act of deliberate deception required for actual malice in this context, and is not sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award\u201d), even if Mr. Bontempo had succeeded in proving some form of fraud, which he didn\u2019t. Mr. Bontempo contends that the circuit court should have inferred a wrongful motive from its finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that Mr. Lare used Quotient funds to meet personal financial obligations, that he breached his fiduciary duties to Quotient, and that he failed to disclose his improper conduct to Mr. Bontempo. But this argument conflates wrongful acts and wrongful motives. The fact that the Lares breached fiduciary duties does not compel the conclusion that they did so maliciously. Moreover, a trial court sitting without a jury \u201chas discretion to deny punitive damages even where the record otherwise would support their award.\u201d <em>Adams v. Coates, </em>331 Md. 1, 15, 626 A.2d 36 (1993) (citing <em>Nast v. Lockett, </em>312 Md. 343, 349, 539 A.2d 1113 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds, Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633); <em>see also </em>Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions 10:13 (2009). Even if we were to assume that the fiduciary breaches could support a punitive damages award (and we make no such finding), the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by declining to make an award on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">3. On Remand, The Circuit Court Must Reconsider The Attorneys\u2019 Fees Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Our decision to vacate and remand the damages award relating to Count III requires the same direction with regard to the circuit court\u2019s order that Quotient reimburse Mr. Bontempo, the derivative plaintiff, for the attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses he incurred in litigating that count, a total of $109,012.76.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Quotient contends on appeal that the circuit court erred as a matter of law by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Mr. Bontempo under Count III because, it claims, there was no \u201ccommon fund.\u201d That might have been true under the original award, since Quotient would not have recovered the money the Lares diverted. But because we now have directed the circuit court on remand to require the Lares to repay Quotient, Quotient will recover a common fund and an award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses would be appropriate under the common fund doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Maryland courts follow the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d for granting attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Garcia, </em>155 Md.App. at 660, 845 A.2d 16; <em>see also Hess Constr. Co. v. Bd. of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 159, 669 A.2d 1352 (1996). Under the American Rule, \u201cin the absence of a statute, rule or contract expressly allowing recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, a prevailing party in a lawsuit may not ordinarily recover attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 590-91, 735 A.2d 1081 (1999). However, the \u201ccommon fund doctrine\u201d is one of the few exceptions to the American Rule. <em>See Garcia, </em>155 Md.App. at 661-63, 845 A.2d 16. As applied and described by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 100 S.Ct. 745, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980), the common fund doctrine recognizes that plaintiffs who file suit and recover on behalf of others will have benefitted a group or class that has not contributed to the effort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[A] litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee <em>from, the fund as a whole. </em>The common-fund doctrine reflects the traditional practice in courts of equity, and it stands as a well-recognized exception to the general principle that requires every litigant to bear his own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>The doctrine rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its costs are unjustly enriched at the successful litigant\u2019s expense. </em>Jurisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent this inequity by assessing attorney\u2019s fees against the entire fund, thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefited by the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 478, 100 S.Ct. 745 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Maryland courts have applied the doctrine when a plaintiff has prevailed in a lawsuit on behalf of a class that benefits a group of others in the same manner as himself. And although \u201cit is infrequently invoked,\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>155 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>App. at 663, 845 A.2d 16, the doctrine has applied \u201cwhere a stockholder\u2019s derivative action benefitted all of the shareholders.\u201d <em>Hess, </em>341 Md. at 168, 669 A.2d 1352 (citing <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712 (1891)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The application of the common fund doctrine in an individual case lies \u201cwithin the discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>155 Md.App. at 662, 845 A.2d 16, but whether a prevailing party is <em>actually entitled </em>to fees under the doctrine is, as a pure conclusion of law, an issue we review for legal correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 845 A.2d 16. We accord no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether the doctrine actually applies. <em>See Oliver v. Hays, </em>121 Md.App. 292, 306, 708 A.2d 1140 (1998); <em>see also Garcia, </em>155 Md.App. at 667, 845 A.2d 16 (applying a two-prong approach, first determining, as a matter of law, whether the common-fund doctrine applied, then, as a matter of fact, reviewing whether the doctrine was applied correctly).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Quotient argues on appeal that the trial court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Mr. Bontempo under Count III pursuant to the common-fund doctrine for two reasons: (1) the trial court did not order that the Lares pay monetary damages to Quotient under Count III, and (2) Quotient was ordered to reimburse Mr. Bontempo for legal fees and expert witness costs from funds outside of any supposed \u201ccommon fund.\u201d To be sure, there must be a recovered \u201cfund\u201d from which the fee award can be derived. <em>Boeing, </em>444 U.S. at 478, 100 S.Ct. 745 (\u201c[A] litigant ... <em>who recovers a common fund </em>for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee <em>from the fund as a whole.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)). And although the circuit court\u2019s original handling of damages under Count III may have left some question in this regard, our decision above requires the circuit court to revisit the damages award and, more specifically, to define the common fund that Mr. Bontempo will have recovered on behalf of Quotient. At that point, the court should determine anew, and against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>backdrop of that common fund and this opinion, whether and to what extent to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">D. Count Y: Mr. Bontempo\u2019s Equal Compensation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>Finally, </em>in Count V, Mr. Bontempo alleged that the Lares had breached two separate agreements between them and him: <em>first, </em>an oral agreement under which Quotient would pay him a salary equivalent to the Lares\u2019 combined salary; and <em>second, </em>an agreement providing that Quotient would pay him shareholder distributions proportionate to his ownership interest. The second of these is not in dispute, and the trial court granted Mr. Bontempo a monetary award of $81,818.18 for unpaid distributions. The court declined, however, to find that an oral equal-compensation agreement existed, and denied any relief for unpaid salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">A contract can be formed orally or in writing. <em>See Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 94, 747 A.2d 600 (2000) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>323 (6th ed.1990)). \u201c[T]he existence and terms of an oral contract, when disputed, are for the trier of facts to determine,\u201d <em>Globe Home Improvement Co. v. McCarty, </em>204 Md. 513, 517, 105 A.2d 216 (1954), and we will not overturn those findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Eisenberg v. Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>225 Md. 324, 331, 170 A.2d 743 (1961). Mr. Bontempo bore the burden of establishing the contract\u2019s existence. <em>See Corry v. O\u2019Neill, </em>105 Md.App. 112, 125, 658 A.2d 1155 (1995); <em>see also Boyle v. Steiman, </em>429 Pa.Super. 1, 631 A.2d 1025, 1033 (1993) (\u201cThe burden of proving an oral contract is on the party seeking to establish it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">At trial, Mr. Bontempo and his wife testified that the equal compensation agreement had been formed, and Mr. Bontempo testified about conduct by Mr. Lare that, in his view, proved it, most notably the fact that he was paid a salary equal to the Lares\u2019 from 2004 through 2008, through multiple salary changes. The trial court acknowledged this evidence, but also recognized the multiple years in the beginning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>toward the end where their salaries differed significantly. Mr. Bontempo argues that at trial he \u201coffered cogent explanations for the periods in which compensation was not equal,\u201d but the court nevertheless found that he failed to meet his burden of proving that there was an equal-salary agreement, and reasoned that \u201c[t]here was no evidence of a meeting of the minds on this issue, which is a prerequisite to contract formation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On appeal, Mr. Bontempo contends that the trial court failed to give appropriate weight to the parties\u2019 credibility and to the equalized salary from April 2004 through February 2008. But it is the trial judge\u2019s role in a bench trial to determine whether the weight of the credible evidence presented was <em>sufficient </em>to support the existence of the equal-compensation agreement, and, here, the trial judge was not persuaded. As we explained above, we review this finding for clear error, and \u201c \u2018[i]f any competent material evidence exists in support of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins/Snoops </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v.

This is particularly true when the trial judge is <em>not </em>persuaded of something:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cAlthough it is not uncommon for a fact-finding judge to be clearly erroneous when he [or she] is affirmatively PERSUADED of something, it is, as in this case, almost impossible for a judge to be clearly erroneous when he [or she] is simply NOT PERSUADED of something.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"><em>Omayaka v.

In addition, the record contains competent material evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual finding that no equal-compensation agreement existed, particularly the unequal compensation in the early days of Quotient and toward the end of Mr. Bontempo\u2019s tenure there.

Mr. Lare and Mr. Bontempo worked together from 1992 through 1998 at a company called Maxim Health Care Services (\"Maxim\u201d). Each of them left Maxim that year, Mr. Bontempo to join AETEA Information Technology, Inc., and Mr. Lare to start Quotient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b114-15\">. Mr. Bontempo never paid on the note, but the Lares paid approximately $12,000 in taxes on the income from it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-13\">. Although Ms. Lare was Quotient\u2019s majority shareholder, she had little to no role in Quotient's business. When the circuit court used the term \u201cLare\u201d in the singular, it referred to Mr. Lare.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. Quotient's clients included the United States Census Bureau, Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the Maryland Department of Education, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Library of Medicine and the Clinical Center (each a division of the National Institutes of Health), AARP, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the University of Maryland Medical Systems, and TAJ Technologies, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. The Lares listed these household employees as employees of Quotient, and Quotient paid their wages and medical insurance, along with approximately $15,000 in payroll taxes associated with those expenditures. The household employees were not listed on Quotient's financial statements, though, and were not reported to the IRS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\">. Despite the fact that Mr. Lare, Mr. Bontempo, and Quotient\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Fred Landy, reviewed the company's financial statements each month, and despite the availability of the company's rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ords, Mr. Bontempo testified that he was unaware of the Lares' expenditures and that he did not consent to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\">. According to Mr. Lare, he also secretly lowered his own salary by ten percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\">. Under CA \u00a7 3\u2014413(b)(2), \"[a]ny stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors of a corporation may petition a court of equity to dissolve the corporation on the grounds that ... [t]he acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.\u201d CA \u00a7 3-413(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\">. Each count of the Counterclaim was denied and Quotient did not appeal any of the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">. Mr. Bontempo initially demanded a jury trial, but the Lares moved the court to strike his demand. On February 7, 2011, the parties ultimately entered a stipulation under which they agreed that all claims and counterclaims would be tried by the bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">. Although Mr. Lare contended that he terminated Mr. Bontempo for poor job performance, the testimony of current and former employees of Quotient weighed against this contention. The court found that Mr. Lare's testimony regarding termination was not credible and that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>assertions regarding Mr. Bontempo\u2019s poor job performance \"strain[ed] credulity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b124-13\">. The trial court declined to award punitive damages because it did not find the Lares\u2019 conduct to be fraudulent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">. The trial court defined a constructive trust as \u201cthe remedy employed by a court of equity to convert the holder of the legal title to property into a trustee for one whom in good conscience should reap the benefits of the possession of said property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. The trial court amended the relief granted under Count III as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">A full and complete accounting by the Lares (the majority in control of the corporation) for misappropriated funds, <em>i.e., </em>all funds advanced or expenses paid by Quotient for the Lares\u2019 household employees or personal litigation expenses; judgment is entered for Bontempo and against Quotient on Count I in a proportionate share of the accounted-for amount. The accounting shall be completed no later than August 15, 2012.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. The trial court recognized that under the \"American rule,\u201d \"absent a statute or contractual provision to the contrary, each party should bear his/her/its own attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b131-14\">. Based on a calculation error, the trial judge initially awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $71,619.65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b131-15\">. The accounting was completed while post-trial motions were pending and was accepted by the court on September 18, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\">. The appellees\u2019 other two questions restate questions presented by Mr. Bontempo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Wc will deal below, in connection with the derivative claim in Count III, with the harms Mr. Lare's behavior caused to Quotient as a company and whether the circuit court\u2019s relief made <em>Quotient </em>whole (sneak preview: it did not).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. Mr. Bontempo alleged that the Lares acted illegally when: (1) for tax years 2006 through 2009, Mr. Lare knowingly signed corporate tax returns that mischaracterized certain expenditures made for the Lares\u2019 personal use as business expenses; (2) Mr. Lare oversaw the submission of false and misleading financial information to federally-insured financial institutions and to the Internal Revenue Service; and (3) Mr. Lare took bonuses and other compensation without approval of the board. In addition, he alleged that the Lares acted fraudulently by failing to disclose the self-dealing transactions to Mr. Bontempo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">. In Count II, Mr. Bontempo asked the court, on behalf of Quotient, to impose a constructive trust in Quotient\u2019s favor for the money, property, and services the Lares diverted to their personal use. The court declined to impose a constructive trust, but in its Order, the court erroneously noted that it had entered judgment in favor of <em>Quotient </em>and against Mr. Bontempo. By denying Quotient\u2019s request for a constructive trust, the court actually entered judgment in favor of the Lares and <em>against Quotient, </em>but either way, Mr. Bontempo does not appear to appeal from this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. There does not appear to have been any dispute about whether Mr. Bontempo satisfied the normal demand requirement or whether such a demand would have been futile. <em>See generally Wasserman, </em>197 Md.App. at 610-12, 14 A.3d 1193.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b151-5\">. Quotient contends that Mr. Bontempo consented to this proposal, but the record reveals that his counsel commented only that \"[t]he return of the money in distributions, those are things that would have been appropriate if Mr. Bontempo was still at the company, no doubt about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. The inverse seems impossible, but we need not decide that here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. The trial court initially awarded attorneys' fees under both Counts I and III, but the award for Count I was later vacated by the court upon a finding that there was no legal basis for fee-shifting under that Count. This ruling was not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
