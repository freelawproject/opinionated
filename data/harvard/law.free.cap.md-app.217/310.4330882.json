The Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cPlanning Board\u201d) approved the Comprehensive Design Plan (\u201cCDP\u201d) and Specific Design Plan (\u201cSDP\u201d) of appellee, Zimmer Development Company (\u201cZimmer\u201d), to construct a retail center. Thereafter, the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as the District Council (the \u201cDistrict Council\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reversed the decision of the Planning Board. Zimmer petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for judicial review. The circuit court reversed the decision of the District Council and reinstated the Planning Board\u2019s approval of Zimmer\u2019s CDP and SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">On appeal, the District Council presents four questions for our review, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">1. Whether Zimmer had the requisite standing to maintain a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">2. Whether the District Council is vested with appellate jurisdiction or original jurisdiction over zoning issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">3. Whether the District Council exceeded the scope of its authority when it reviewed matters other than the issues identified for remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">4. Whether the District Council erred in expanding its consideration of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 beyond determining whether the Planning Board\u2019s approval was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The disputed property (the \u201cEdwards Property\u201d) is a triangular 4.14 acre property that is zoned for retail as a Local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Activity Center Zone (L-A-C Zone).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Edwards Property abuts Adelphi Road, Edwards Way, and Riggs Road in Prince George\u2019s County along Maryland Route 212 (Powder Mill Road).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Zimmer is a national real-estate developer with its headquarters located in Wilmington, North Carolina. Zimmer proposes to construct a retail center located on the Edwards Property, which will be anchored by a CVS.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Approval or denial of a proposed zoning plan begins with the Planning Board. The Planning Board requires that an applicant obtain three approvals: 1) a Comprehensive Design Plan (\u201cCDP\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 2) a Preliminary Plan of Subdivision (\u201cPPS\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 3) a Specific Design Plan (\u201cSDP\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 14, 2011, Zimmer filed Comprehensive Design Plan-1001 (\u201cCDP-1001\u201d) and Specific Design Plan-1001 (\u201cSDP-1001\u201d) with the Planning Board as part of its application to build the retail center. The Planning Board accepted CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 for joint review. The Planning Board formally reviewed the plans at a public hearing on July 28, 2011 and subsequently approved both CDP-1001 and SDP-1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Despite the Planning Board\u2019s approval of Zimmer\u2019s application, the District Council, nevertheless, elected to exercise its discretion, pursuant to Prince George\u2019s County Code (hereinafter \u201cPGCC\u201d) \u00a7 27-523(a) and \u00a7 27-528.01(b), to \u201ccall-up\u201d the case for review by the District Council.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>2011, the District Council held a public hearing and entertained oral argument regarding CDP-1001 and SDP-1001. One week after the hearing, the District Council issued an order remanding the case to the Planning Board to reconsider three issues (\u201cthe three remand issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Specifically, the Planning Board was directed to \u201creconsider its decision in light of the [following] reasons,\u201d namely: 1) whether the lack of a community center on the Edwards Property could be \u201cmitigated through amenities benefitting the surrounding community\u201d; 2) whether the proposed location of replacement trees to mitigate \u201cthe loss of the existing tree canopy\u201d was sufficient; and 3) \u201cwhether access for Edwards Way residents can be improved, to compensate for the increases in traffic to and from the [Edwards] Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On February 9, 2012, the Planning Board held a hearing for the express purpose of considering the three remand issues. Approximately four weeks after the hearing, the Planning Board issued an amended resolution. Satisfied with Zimmer\u2019s proposed solutions to the three remand issues, the Planning Board again approved Zimmer\u2019s application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">After the Planning Board\u2019s second approval of Zimmer\u2019s application, the District Council exercised its authority to \u201ccall up\u201d the case for a second time. On May 21, 2012, the District Council heard oral argument. Approximately thirty days later, the District Council issued a written opinion reversing the decision of the Planning Board and again denying Zimmer\u2019s applications for both CDP-1001 and SDP-1001. In support of its decision, the District Council set forth fourteen specific grounds for denying Zimmer\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>As a result of the denial of its application, Zimmer filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The circuit court held a hearing on January 11, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">On March 15, 2013, the circuit court, through a comprehensive written opinion, reversed the District Council.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In its memorandum opinion, the circuit judge first concluded that Zimmer had the requisite standing to seek judicial review. Specifically, the circuit court concluded that Zimmer is not \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland and, therefore, is not subject to Maryland\u2019s laws governing unregistered foreign companies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Next, the circuit court concluded that the District Council exercised appellate jurisdiction from the Planning Board and not original, <em>de novo, </em>jurisdiction. The circuit court found that \u201cthe [District] Council\u2019s authority is limited to appellate review of the Planning Board\u2019s decisions\u201d and that its \u201cauthority is limited to determining whether the Planning Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d As such, the circuit court judge found that the District Council is prohibited from \u201csecond guessing\u201d the Planning Board\u2019s judgment, absent a showing that the Planning Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The circuit court further found that the District Council was limited in its review to the three remand issues. As a result, the circuit court held that the District Council improperly exceeded the scope of its review. Specifically, the circuit court noted that \u201cit was improper for the [District] Council to expand its review in the second \u2018call-up\u2019 to consider new issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>outside the scope of remand and that were never even discussed at oral argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Finally, the circuit court considered the District Council\u2019s fourteen reasons for denying Zimmer\u2019s application. The circuit court observed that only two of the fourteen stated reasons for denial were raised in the District Council\u2019s initial order of remand. After reviewing each of the fourteen grounds for denying Zimmer\u2019s application, the circuit court further observed that none of the District Council\u2019s grounds for denial were supported by substantial evidence. As such, the circuit court reversed the decision of the District Council and reinstated the Planning Board\u2019s approval of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">This timely appeal followed. We shall recite the relevant standard of review in the applicable section of our \u201cDiscussion,\u201d <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The District Council first contends that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Specifically, the District Council argues that, because Zimmer does not own property or operate a business in Prince George\u2019s County, it is not a \u201cperson\u201d under Maryland law whose interests are subject to judicial review. As such, the District Council asks us to remand this case with an order instructing the circuit court to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Zimmer maintains that the District Council failed to raise this issue before the circuit court and, therefore, the issue is not preserved for our review. Zimmer claims that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Council\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction argument \u201cis a thinly veiled [ ] attempt to pursue a standing challenge that it failed to preserve below.\u201d Indeed, Zimmer contends that the only standing argument advanced by the District Council was entirely unrelated to the argument it presents on appeal. Zimmer further argues that, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>this issue is somehow preserved for our review, Zimmer has the requisite standing to challenge the District Council\u2019s decision. We agree with Zimmer that this issue concerns one of standing and further agree that it is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) expressly provides that we normally will not decide an issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(a). The Court of Appeals has regularly held that \u201cthe primary purpose of Rule 8-131 (a) is to ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d <em>Elliott v. State, </em>417 Md. 413, 434, 10 A.3d 761 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u201cLack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including initially on appeal\u201d and \u201cthe issue of subject matter jurisdiction need not be raised by a party, but may be raised by a court <em>sua sponte.\u201d Dutcher, supra, </em>365 Md. at 405, 780 A.2d 1137. The preservation rule, however, clearly applies to standing issues and \u201c[w]e ordinarily do not decide issues of standing not raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>Garner v. Archers Glen Partners, Inc., </em>405 Md. 43, 55, 949 A.2d 639 (2008); <em>see also Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E. Church, </em>375 Md. 59, 71, 825 A.2d 388 (2003) (\u201c[A]ny dispute concerning [a party\u2019s] standing should have been raised and litigated in the [c]ircuit [c]ourt, not the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">At the outset, we agree with Zimmer that the issue advanced before us by the District Council is one of standing, not subject matter jurisdiction. The District Council admits as much in its brief as it repeatedly refers to the issue as one of standing, including arguing that \u201cZimmer had no standing to seek a petition for judicial review.\u201d Moreover, Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Code (2012) \u00a7 22-407 of the Land Use Article (\u201cL.U.\u201d), which governs judicial review of decisions of the District Council, clearly contemplates standing, not subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Turning to the substantive merits of the District Council\u2019s argument, the record before us clearly reflects that the District Council failed to raise the issue of Zimmer\u2019s standing under L.U. \u00a7 22-407 in the circuit court. Although the District Council argued that Zimmer lacked standing in the circuit court, the District Council\u2019s standing argument was expressly premised under Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 4A of the Corporations and Associations (\u201cC.A.\u201d) Article, not L.U. \u00a7 22-407. Specifically, the District Council argued that Zimmer was in violation of C.A. \u00a7 4A-1002(a), which requires that, before doing business in Maryland, \u201ca foreign limited liability company shall register with the [Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation].\u201d <em>See </em>C.A. \u00a7 4A-1002(a). Indeed, the record is devoid of any argument before the circuit court related to L.U. \u00a7 22-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Ultimately, the District Council failed to raise the issue of Zimmer\u2019s standing based on L.U. \u00a7 22-407 before the circuit court. The District Council failed to challenge Zimmer\u2019s standing based on L.U. \u00a7 22-407, and because the District Council now bases its standing argument on L.U. \u00a7 22-407, the issue is not preserved for our review. As such, inasmuch as the question is one of standing\u2014and not of subject matter jurisdiction\u2014and because the issue was not raised before the circuit court, the District Council\u2019s standing argument is not preserved for our review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The District Council next contends that the circuit court improperly determined that the District Council\u2019s review of the Planning Board is limited to that of appellate jurisdiction and not original, <em>de novo, </em>jurisdiction. The District Council maintains that the circuit court erred in applying the reasoning of <em>Cnty. Council of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Curtis Regency, </em>121 Md.App. 123, 708 A.2d 1058 (1998), to this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Specifically, the District Council argues that <em>Curtis Regency </em>is inapplicable to the case at bar because the holding of <em>Curtis Regency </em>is limited to that of subdivisions, not zoning issues. As shall be discussed, we hold that the District Council is vested with appellate jurisdiction and not original, <em>da novo, </em>jurisdiction. We further hold that the circuit court did not err in applying the reasoning of <em>Curtis Regency </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"> In reviewing the decision of an agency, we \u201clook[ ] through the circuit court\u2019s ... decision[ ], although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate[ ] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007). We are \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Hamza Halici v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>180 Md.App. 238, 248, 949 A.2d 85 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">When applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, a reviewing court must decide \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Layton v. Howard Cnty. Bd. of Appeals, </em>399 Md. 36, 48-49, 922 A.2d 576 (2007) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test ... [we] must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are <em>prima fade </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Pollock v. Patuxent Inst. Bd. of Review, </em>374 Md. 463, 476-77, 823 A.2d 626 (2003). \u201cFurthermore, not only is the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 823 A.2d 626 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cWe are less deferential in our review, however, of the legal conclusions of the administrative body and may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>reverse those decisions where the legal conclusions reached by that body are based on an erroneous interpretation or application of the [applicable] statutes, regulations, and ordinances____\u201d <em>Surina, supra, </em>400 Md. at 682, 929 A.2d 899 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cWhen determining the validity of those legal conclusions reached by the [administrative] body, however, \u2018a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency\u2019 whose task it is to interpret the ordinances and regulations the agency itself promulgated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Thus, \u201c[e]ven though the decision of the Board of Appeals was based on the law, its expertise should be taken into consideration and its decision should be afforded appropriate deference in our analysis of whether it was \u2018premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682-83, 929 A.2d 899 (internal citations omitted). Finally, in an administrative appeal, the appellant bears the burden of establishing an error of law or that the agency\u2019s final decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Taylor v. Harford Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 222-23, 862 A.2d 1026 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">B. Jurisdiction of the District Council</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The District Council argues that it is vested with original jurisdiction and that it is not limited in the scope of its review to the standard of review for appellate jurisdiction. The District Council further maintains that the circuit court improperly relied upon <em>Curtis Regency </em>in rendering its decision. Specifically, the District Council contends that the application of <em>Curtis Regency </em>is limited to that involving subdivisions and does not extend to zoning matters, such as the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The Maryland Regional District Act (the \u201cRDA\u201d) was enacted by the General Assembly to empower Prince George\u2019s County to create zoning enabling legislation. <em>Cnty. Council of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Council v. Billings, </em>420 Md. 84, 96, 21 A.3d 1065 (2011) (quoting <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. 632, 635-36, 922 A.2d 495 (2007)). The RDA specifically provides for the creation of a county Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Board. L.U. \u00a7 20-202(a)(l). The RDA further provides that the Planning Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">(i) <em>\u201cis responsible for planning, subdivision, and zoning junctions that are primarily local in scope; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">(ii) shall exercise, within the county planning board\u2019s jurisdiction, the following powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">1. Planning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">2. <em>Zoning;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">3. Subdivision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">4. Assignment of street names and house numbers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">5. Any related matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">L.U. \u00a7 20-202(a)(l). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The District Council, pursuant to PGCC \u00a7 27-523,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is <em>only </em>authorized to affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Planning Board, or to return the case to the Planning Board to take further testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, the District Council is expressly limited in its consideration to \u201cthe facts and information contained within the record made at the hearing before the Planning Board.\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c). In our view, based on the testimony, documents, and evidence presented at the hearing before the Planning Board, the District Council is limited to determining whether the Planning Board\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d <em>See Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 137-38, 708 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Indeed, if the District Council were vested with <em>de novo </em>review, the Planning Board\u2019s legal responsibility to engage in fact finding would be rendered meaningless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Planning Board\u2019s thorough evidentiary process could be simply discarded in favor of the review by the District Council, which neither conducts its own evidentiary hearing nor develops its own record. Further, the Planning Board\u2019s decision is final if no appeal is taken from the decision of the Planning Board. <em>See </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-523(d) (\u201cIf the [District] Council fails to act within the specified time, the Planning Board\u2019s decision is automatically affirmed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The District Council argues that the circuit court erred in extending our reasoning in <em>Curtis Regency </em>to include zoning issues. In <em>Curtis Regency, </em>the Planning Board preliminarily approved a subdivision plat proposed by Curtis Regency Service Corporation and Rose Valley Limited Partnership (\u201cCurtis Regency\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 126, 708 A.2d 1058. A local citizens\u2019 group appealed the Planning Board\u2019s decision to the District Council, which reversed the approval by the Planning Board. <em>Id. </em>Curtis Regency subsequently sought judicial review of the District Council\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court reversed the decision of the District Council and reinstated the Planning Board\u2019s approval of the subdivision plat submitted by Curtis Regency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On appeal, we concluded that the District Council possessed appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction, over subdivision matters. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 708 A.2d 1058. The District Council, therefore, \u201cacted contrary to its statutorily defined power\u201d and should have \u201cgiven deference to the Planning Board\u2019s decision, except as to matters of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 708 A.2d 1058. We expressly held that \u201cthe District Council should have used its power to determine whether the action of the [Planning Board] was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or illegal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 708 A.2d 1058 (citing <em>People\u2019s Counsel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>for Baltimore Cnty. v. Beachwood I Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>107 Md.App. 627, 648-49, 670 A.2d 484 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we reasoned that \u201c[s]ince the District Council does not have the power to create the cause, but, instead, hears the cause to correct and revise proceedings already instituted, it does not exercise original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 708 A.2d 1058. Rather, the District Council is \u201cconfined to exercise its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, in concluding that the District Council is vested with appellate jurisdiction, we observed that the District Council</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">may not substitute its judgment for that of the [Planning Board], even if it, had it been so empowered, might have made a diametrically different decision. The circumstances under which it may overturn or countermand a decision of the [Planning Board] are narrowly constrained. It may never simply second guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 137, 708 A.2d 1058 (quoting <em>Beachwood I, supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 638, 670 A.2d 484).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In the instant case, the District Council fails to provide any legal support for its contention that <em>Curtis Regency </em>applies only to subdivision issues, not zoning issues. Instead, the District Council baldly sets forth the applicable standard of review that courts use to evaluate agency decisions and argues that its determinations are entitled to deference. We are unpersuaded. Indeed, nowhere in <em>Curtis Regency </em>do we suggest that the case be limited to subdivision matters. In fact, we broadly framed the issue in that case as \u201cwhether, as an appellate forum, the [District] Council owed deference to the fact finding and conclusions flowing therefrom of the Planning Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 708 A.2d 1058. We did not then\u2014nor do we now\u2014expressly limit our holding in <em>Curtis Regency </em>to cases involving subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The District Council subsequently amended the PGCC in an effort to grant itself original jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(f) Jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">(1) In deciding an appeal to the District Council, ... <em>the [District] Council shall exercise original jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(2) For any appeal or review of a decision made by ... the Planning Board, the [District] Council may, based on the record, approve, approve with conditions, remand, or deny the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">PGCC \u00a7 27\u2014132(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In <em>Curtis Regency, </em>however, we expressly observed that, if the District Council were to adopt an ordinance such as PGCC \u00a7 27\u2014132(f), \u201cwe would strongly question its validity, since it would appear to contradict the exclusive jurisdiction given to the Planning Board by public general law.\u201d <em>Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 135, n. 4, 708 A.2d 1058 (citing <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he [District] Council is not empowered to augment the administrative appeal process beyond that provided for in [Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 28,] \u00a7 7-117.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 425, 780 A.2d 1137. Moreover, the RDA \u201cis the <em>exclusive source of zoning authority </em>in those areas of Prince George\u2019s County which it covers.\u201d <em>Cnty. Council of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Brandywine Enterprises, Inc., </em>350 Md. 339, 342, 711 A.2d 1346 (1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>A plain reading of the RDA reflects the unassailable conclusion that the General Assembly expressly empowers the Planning Board with the authority to administer \u201czoning functions that are primarily local in scope.\u201d L.U. \u00a7 20-202(a)(l)(I). The RDA further provides that zoning issues are subject to the Planning Board\u2019s jurisdiction. L.U. \u00a7 20-202(a)(l)(ii). Zimmer, therefore, suggests that PGCC \u00a7 27-132\u00a9 is invalid because it is an attempt to use a local ordinance to contravene the state enabling act, the RDA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Bill Summary of the 1996 amendment provides that the District Council\u2019s purpose in enacting the amendment was to grant itself original jurisdiction based on its own independent understanding of its responsibility in examining zoning issues. The Bill Summary provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[Section 27-132\u00a9 ] clarifies] what has <em>always been assumed and Ms historically been the [District] Council\u2019s practice regarding jurisdiction </em>of the [District] Council when hearing appeals. The bill states that when hearing an appeal from the Planning Board ... the [District] Council is exercising original jurisdiction. This means that in deciding an appeal, [the District Council] may make the decision based on their own judgement [sic] rather than simply determining whether the [Planning Board] made an error of law or had before it substantial evidence to support its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">CB-76-1996, 1996 Leg. Sess. (Prince George\u2019s County Council 1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Bill Summary goes on to note that the District Council shall not accept new evidence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Bill Summary, therefore, explains that PGC Code Section 27\u2014132(f) permits the District Council to substitute its judgment and decide the case differently from the Planning Board, but it must do so based on the record presented to the Planning Board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Tom Haller, representing the Chamber of Commerce, ... asked for clarification regarding the ability of the [District] Council to accept new evidence under the provisions of this bill. Joyce Nichols, Principal Counsel to the District Counsel [sic], pointed out that the language [amended PGC Code \u00a7 27-132\u00a9 ] states that the decision of the [District] Council shall be based on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Nevertheless, the District Council argues that it has \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d over appeals from Planning Board decisions. Critically, the District Council cannot grant itself original jurisdiction when the General Assembly has expressly entrusted the Planning Board with the authority to decide preliminary zoning issues. In enacting subsection (f) of PGCC \u00a7 27-132, the District Council <em>assumed </em>that it possessed original jurisdiction. In so doing, however, the District Council failed to consider the applicability of the RDA. Indeed, <em>\u201cno custom, however long and generally it has been followed by officials of the State, can nullify the plain meaning and purpose of a statute.\u201d Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 132, 48 A.2d 754 (1946) (emphasis added). Although the District Council has long <em>assumed </em>that it possesses original jurisdiction, a plain reading of the RDA reflects that the Planning Board, not the District Council, is vested with original jurisdiction over zoning matters. The District Council simply cannot insert the magic words \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d and assume that such an amendment authorizes itself with original jurisdiction, especially in light of the provision\u2019s conflict with the RDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Moreover, the express provisions of the PGCC provide that: 1) the decision of the Planning Board is final if there is no appeal to the District Council; 2) the District Council is limited in its review to the facts and information established at the hearing before the Planning Board; and 3) the District Council is only authorized to affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Planning Board based on the record. Indeed, \u201cthe District Council does not have the power to create the cause, but, instead, hears the cause to correct and revise proceedings already instituted ____\u201d before the Planning Board. <em>Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 134, 708 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Similarly, the Court of Appeals has acknowledged the internal inconsistency of Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s attempt to confer original jurisdiction on the District Council through the District Council\u2019s enactment of PGCC \u00a7 27\u2014132(f). Specifically, Judge Harrell, writing for the majority in <em>Dutcher, </em>cogently observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">PGCC \u00a7 27\u2014132(f) ... is not a subdivision regulation under PGCC subtitle 24, but rather a zoning regulation under PGCC subtitle 27. As such, we do not review PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f) here, <em>but do note that it is confusing and internally inconsistent </em>as regards the nature of the jurisdiction the District Council purports to exercise in matters addressed by [PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Dutcher, supra, </em>365 Md. at 411, n. 13, 780 A.2d 1137. The Court, in <em>Dutcher, </em>highlighted that the District Council grants itself \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d under PGCC \u00a7 27\u2014132(f)(1), but, nevertheless, confines itself to examining the Planning Board\u2019s decision \u201cbased on the record.... \u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-132(f)(2). Indeed, it is inherently inconsistent for the District Council to grant itself \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d when it is limited to reviewing the record established before the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Taken together, the pertinent provisions of the PGCC, read in conjunction -with the RDA, leads us to conclude that the District Council is vested with appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction, over zoning matters. As such, the District Council is limited to deciding whether the Planning Board\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d <em>Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 137-38, 708 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The District Council next contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the District Council was limited to reviewing the three remand issues when it \u201ccalled-up\u201d the case for a second time. Moreover, the District Council asserts that it was proper for the District Council to expand its review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>beyond the three issues that were initially remanded to the Planning Board. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">As mentioned, <em>supra, </em>PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) expressly provides: The District Council shall schedule a public hearing on the appeal or review. <em>Testimony at the hearing shall be limited to the facts and information contained within the record made at the hearing before the Planning Board.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) (emphasis added). Thus, a simple reading of PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c) leads to the unassailable conclusion that the District Council must constrain its review of decisions of the Planning Board \u201cto the facts and information contained within the record made at the hearing before the Planning Board.\u201d PGCC \u00a7 27-523(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In the instant case, the Planning Board approved CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 on September 15, 2011. Subsequently, the District Council \u201ccalled-up\u201d the case and, upon review of Zimmer\u2019s application, remanded the case to the Planning Board to expressly consider the three remand issues.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Satisfied with Zimmer\u2019s proposed solutions to the three remand issues, the Planning Board issued an amended resolution that specifically addressed each issue upon remand and again approved CDP-1001 and SDP-1001. As such, when the District Council exercised its discretion to \u201ccall-up\u201d the case for a second time, it was limited to the three remand issues expressly considered by the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Clearly, therefore, when the District Council set forth its fourteen grounds for denying CDP-1001 and SDP-1001, it was acting outside its statutorily defined powers. Indeed, the express terms of \u00a7 27-523(c) could not be any clearer. The District Council\u2019s scope of review is narrowly constrained to the facts and information presented at the hearing before the Planning Board. More fundamentally, however, the District Council was not authorized to set forth any grounds for denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>other than the grounds specifically advanced before the Planning Board, namely, the three remand issues. Rather, the District Council was authorized to determine whether the Planning Board\u2019s approval of Zimmer\u2019s application was \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d <em>Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 137-38, 708 A.2d 1058. Accordingly, the District Council erred, as a matter of law, in expanding its consideration of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 beyond the scope of the three remand issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The District Council next argues that each of its fourteen grounds in support of its decision to deny Zimmer\u2019s application is supported by substantial evidence. In light of our holding in Part III of our \u201cDiscussion,\u201d this issue is moot. Critically, as addressed previously, the District Council\u2014as an appellate forum\u2014is limited to determining whether the decision of the Planning Board was \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d <em>See Curtis Regency, supra, </em>121 Md.App. at 137-38, 708 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Accordingly, when the District Council exercised its discretion to \u201ccall-up\u201d CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 for a second time, it was limited to determining whether the Planning Board\u2019s approval of CDP-1001 and SDP-1001 was \u201carbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clearly, therefore, when the District Council set forth additional grounds for reversing the Planning Board, it was acting outside its statutorily defined power by substituting its judgment for that of the Planning Board. As such, the District Council erred\u2014as a matter of law\u2014in reversing the Planning Board and denying Zimmer\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.
