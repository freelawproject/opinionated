To the third defendant answered by a general denial excepting an admission that an agreement was made between the parties on April 24, 1884.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-15\">An order was thereafter made severing the causes of action, and judgment having been entered on the two first named the action was continued as if it had originally been brought on the third cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-16\">\u25a0 The referee found as a fact that plaintiff was delayed by defendant in the performance of the work for. twenty-two days, during which time she was obliged to keep a number of men and her tools and machinery ready to engage in the work, and to pay said men their wages and board, and awarded damages for such expenditure and the value of the use of the tools and machinery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-17\">Further facts appear in the opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-18\"><em>Thomas Gr. Shearman, </em>for app\u2019lt; <em>Edward S. Clinch, </em>for resp\u2019t.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-16\"> Reversing 34 St. Rep., 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b660-19\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aux1\">The judgment awarded by the referee to the plaintiff was predicated upon a breach of the contract by defendant in two respects. First, the failure to deliver the iron called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>for by the plans and specifications in sufficient quantity or as rapidly as the progress of the work required, and second, the failure to lay the floor of the pier as fast as it was practicable to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\">The appellant contends that it was not liable for the delay in the laying of the floor of the pier, and if this contention is sound the judgment must be reversed, as it is impossible to determine what portion of the damages is properly attributable to the delay in furnishing the iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">At the defendant\u2019s request the referee found that on April 24, 1884, the parties entered into the written agreement set out in the preceding statement, and he refused to find, \u201c That the defendant did not agree to lay the floor of the pier as fast as the plaintiff might require it for the erection of the iron.\u201d And to this refusal the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In his formal decision the referee found that the defendant\u2019s obligation included the delivery of the iron at the site of the pier as rapidly as the progress of the work required, and the laying of the floor of the pier as fast as practicable. It appeared from the evidence that the floor of the pier was the subject of a separate contract which had been made with a carpenter at Cape May, of which plaintiff was informed before she made her agreement. If, however, defendant agreed that such work should be done within .a certain time, it would be of no importance by what instrumentality it sought to perform it, and it would be equally liable for the -delays of an independent contractor as it would if it had undertaken to do the work itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">And so upon the trial plaintiff was permitted to give evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection and exception that defendant did undertake and agree by paroi that the floor of the pier should be laid so that plaintiff could complete her work within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We are of the opinion that this evidence was clearly incompetent. The conversations testified to were had before the written agreement was executed, and the subject was made a part of that agreement. All prior negotiations and oral promises on the same subject were merged in the written contract and the rights and duties of the parties are to be determined by that instrument. It must be presumed to contain the whole engagement of the parties. -</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">To bring a case within the rule admitting paroi evidence to -complete an entire agreement of which a wilting is only a part, two things are essential. First, the writing must appear on inspection to be an incomplete contractand second, the paroi evidence must be consistent with and not contradictory to the written instrument.. <em>Engelhorn </em>v. <em>Reitlinger, </em>122 N. Y., 76; 33 St. Rep., 275 ; <em>Thomas </em>v. Scutt\u201e 127 N. Y., 133; 38 St. Rep., 692. 'This case does not fall within the rule and the exception t'a the .admission of the evidence was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">This exception would not, however, be fatal to the judgment if the written agreement was susceptible of the conclusi\u00f3n reached \u2019\u25a0by the referee in his findings. But we do not think that it is and that the conclusion that the defendant agreed \u201c to lay the floor of tihe pier as fast as possible \u201d cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>There is \"a clear distinction made ,in the contract between the-iron work and the floor of the pier. There is a positive stipulation \u201c to deliver all iron at the site of the pier,\u201d and it is a fair inference that this was to be done \u201cas rapidly as the progress of the-work required,\u201d as found by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\">But there is no positive agreement to lay the floor of the pier. The only reference to that work is as a condition to the performance of plaintiff\u2019s work within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">It may be assumed that the defendant desired the iron work to-be done in thirty days, and this plaintiff agreed to do provided, or on condition that the floor was laid as fast as required for the-erection of the iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">It was essential to the performance of plaintiff\u2019s work that the-laying-; of the floor of the pier should follow rapidly the driving of the piles as the pier extended into the ocean. But defendant, did not obligate itself to do that work. Plaintiff knew that it had been made the subject of a separate contract with other parties, and she was under no obligation to perform her contract within thirty days if the floor was not laid. Delay in the laying of the floor of the pier had therefore no other effect, than to relieve her from her obligation to perform in thirty days. It could not be made the basis of a\" claim for damages against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">So far, therefore, as the judgment proceeds upon any delay inlaying the floor of the pier, we think it is erroneous ana must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">This conclusion renders unnecessary any consideration of the other questions argued, as the exceptions upon which they rest may not arise upon a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">judgment reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
