His sole contention on this appeal is that the trial judge interjected his own comments and questions into the examination of various witnesses in such a way as to \u201cabandon his position as a disinterested judge\u201d and give the jury the impression he was \u201can advocate in the government\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\">Central to appellant\u2019s case is a rhetorical question by the trial judge. In response to the defendant\u2019s assertion that his statement previously given to the F.B.I. was a lie because given early in the morning when he was drowsy, while his trial statement, on the other hand, was truthful, the Judge said \u201cYou mean by that you lie early and speak the truth late, is that right?\u201d This is the basis of the instant appeal. We find the Judge\u2019s question in the circumstances natural and proper. The appeal is devoid of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
