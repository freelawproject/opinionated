If America\u2019s environment is to be preserved in accordance with the national policy expressed by the Congress the gap will have to be filled with state and local legislation. Indeed, there already exists a statute of North Carolina looking toward the preservation of ecological values. N.C.G.S. 113A. Nothing contained in our decision is intended to foreclose resort to state and local remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">We hold that the failure and refusal of the district judge to issue a preliminary injunction was not an abuse of his discretion. The partial preliminary injunction pending appeal is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1016-22\">CRAVEN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-23\">I agree with my brothers that the present record fails to establish sufficiently \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d When the United States insists it is a nonparticipant, it is difficult to prove the contrary. But government is so big that it sometimes occurs that the left hand honestly does not know what the right hand is doing. <em>See </em>Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-24\">Because of circumstances beyond his control, the district judge necessarily accelerated the hearing below. Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>right of discovery was abbreviated. Even so, illustratively, they were able to show a state application for $3 million of federal funds for construction of a nearby project, of which the Federal District Highway Engineer had no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">I would remand to allow further inquiry into the extent of federal involvement in this project. The federal financial contribution ($91,000) to the Smith Plan, which recommends the widening of Sharon Lane and its inclusion in the sixth circumferential route; the federal expenditures ($463,642) for projects at four points of the sixth circumferential; and the likelihood that federal funds will be requested for the construction of portions of the sixth circumferential indicate to me that further discovery might reveal that this project is part of a \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
