Plaintiff blamed the occurrences on turnover of employees in his stores and on his negligence in failing to set up a program to instruct new employees when they were hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The District Court upheld the disqualification of the two stores but undertook to reduce the period of disqualification from six months to thirty days. It was the view of the Court that the suspension of six months ordered by the Secretary was too harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">The Secretary has appealed. The only question raised in the appeal is as to the authority of the District Court to modify the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">Section 4(a) of the Act provides that food stamps \u201cshall be used only to purchase food\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The applicable regulation contains the same provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">Section 11 of the Act provides for the disqualification of a store from participation in the program for violation of the Act or any regulation. The period of disqualification was authorized to be fixed by regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The regulation authorized suspension from participation in the program for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed three years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-20\">Thus, we have a clear case .of admitted violations and sanctions imposed by the Secretary well within the range of his authority, expressly conferred on him by statute and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">Judicial review is provided under Section 13 of the Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-22\">\u201cIf the store or concern feels aggrieved by such final determination he may obtain judicial review thereof by filing a complaint against the United States . . . requesting the court to set aside such determination. . The suit . . . shall be a trial de novo by the court in which the court shall determine the validity of the questioned administrative action in issue. If the court determines that such administrative action is invalid it shall enter such judgment or order as it determines is in accordance with the law and the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-26\">The statute authorizes a review only on the merits of the case, and not on the period of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>It will be noted that the review is de novo of the \u201cfinal determination\u201d of disqualification. The reviewing court is authorized to \u201cdetermine the validity of the questioned administrative action in issue.\u201d The Court did make that determination by holding that the stores were disqualified from participation in the Food Stamp Program because of the admitted repeated violations. Upon making that determination the jurisdiction of the Court ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The statute authorized the Court to \u201center such judgment or order as it determines is in accordance with the law and the evidence\u201d only if it determined that the administrative action is invalid. Here the Court made no such determination of invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In the Act, no authority was conferred on the District Court to change the period of suspension ordered by the Secretary, or to impose new sanctions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The sanctions imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Commodities Exchange Act have been held to be not subject to judicial review. G. H. Miller &amp; Co. v. United States, 260 F.2d 286, 296 (7th Cir. en banc 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 582, 3 L. Ed.2d 572 (1959). To the same effect under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, Eastern Produce Co. v. Benson, 278 F.2d 606, 610 (3d Cir. 1960). We see no substantial difference between the review provided by these Acts and that provided by the Food Stamp Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We hold that the reviewing court lacked authority to change the sanctions imposed by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-12\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\">. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.6(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-14\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\">. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-27\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-28\">. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b359-29\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b360-18\">. In mentioning that the sanctions imposed by the Secretary were too harsh, the Court referred to lesser sanctions imposed in reported cases (two District Court cases), and the practice in his District of granting probation in untaxed liquor cases and in other similar criminal cases. The Court also mentioned the fact that since the disqualification, plaintiff had sold one of his stores and opened two new stores, both of which had been qualified by the Secretary under the Act. We think the comparisons were irrelevant. The fact that new stores were qualified cannot excuse violations in the other stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b360-9\">EDWARDS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Congress saw fit to provide for \u201ca trial de novo\u201d in the District Court. Under any normal construction of legal language, such a grant of power gives to the reviewing court all the power that the court or agency below possessed, including the power to enter a disposition or judgment different from that originally entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The usual definition of trial de novo is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">\u201ctrial de novo. A trial anew, a re-trial in a superior court on an appeal of the case from an inferior court.\u201d Ballen-tine\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (2d ed. 1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Corpus Juris Secundum heads its section on Trial De Novo with these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">\u201cA trial de novo is a trial had as though no action whatever had been instituted in the court below, a new trial in an appellate tribunal.\u201d 5 C.J.S. Appeal &amp; Error \u00a7 1524 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">My brothers construe the language which follows \u201ctrial de novo by the court\u201d as a limitation upon that term. On its face,, however, the phrase \u201cin which the court shall determine the validity of the questioned administrative action in issue\u201d describes but does not limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">As I read the statute the majority\u2019s construction reads into the statute the word \u201csolely\u201d which Congress saw fit not to employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">I do not deny that there is force to the arguments of my brethren. But rather than accept what I believe to be misuse of the term \u201ctrial de novo\u201d I would refer the Secretary to Congress to seek amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ment of the statute in the event his construction proves to represent Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
