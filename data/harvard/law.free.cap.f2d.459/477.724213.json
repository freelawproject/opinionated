He alleged that in denying him a parole, the Board members violated his Constitutional rights by not advising him of the reasons for their action. The district court granted defendants summary judgment and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-25\"> At the time the Board acted, the New Jersey case law did not require the Board to state its reasons for a denial. Mastriana v. New Jersey Parole Board, 95 N.J.Super. 351, 231 A.2d 236 (App.Div.1967). This Court has held that the absence of such a requirement does not constitute a Constitutional violation. Madden v. New Jersey State Parole Board, 438 F.2d 1189 (3rd Cir. 1971). In these circumstances we are therefore satisfied that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>We are advised that plaintiff was recently granted a parole. Furthermore, since the district court decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled as a matter of New Jersey law that its Parole Board must give reasons when it denies a parole. Monks v. New Jersey State Parole Board, 58 N.J. 238, 277 A.2d 193 (1971). Thus, to the extent the complaint may seek other relief, it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
