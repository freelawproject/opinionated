Although no direct appeal was taken, he subsequently attacked his conviction in collateral proceedings in both state and federal courts. On a number of previous occasions habeas corpus relief was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-25\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s habeas petition, filed in the Western District in January of 1971, alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-26\">1) that the state and federal courts failed to grant full and fair hearings on certain factual issues; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>2) that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because of counsel\u2019s failure to conduct a pre-trial investigation into certain facts as well as his absence during the charge to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In a memorandum opinion filed on February 11, 1971, the District Court denied appellant\u2019s Petition for a Writ and his Motion for a Certificate of Probable Cause on the basis that these very allegations had already been reviewed' by another judge of the Western District as well as by this Court. We granted appellant\u2019s Motion for a Certificate and Leave to Proceed on Forma Pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Initially, it is erroneous to suggest, as does appellant, that he has not had his day in court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor is there any indication whatsoever that the various hearings held below were anything but fair and dispositive of the issues raised. Finally, appellant does not indicate what \u201cmaterial facts\u201d were not developed at any of these hearings or how these \u201cfacts\u201d bear on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Appellant\u2019s claim of denial of effective assistance of counsel is equally without merit. Our review of the record as a whole convinces us that appellant\u2019s representation was equal to the standard of \u201cnormal competency\u201d mandated by this Circuit in Moore v. United States, 432 F.2d 730 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">. Chambers attacked this conviction in a state habeas action alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>the failure of the Commonwealth to call a witness at trial, that he was never informed of the crime with which he was charged, and that he was not represented by counsel at his preliminary hearing. The petition was dismissed without a hearing. In July of 1966, appellant filed a petition pursuant to the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 to 1180-14, raising various issues, the Court again denying the petition without a hearing. This decision was appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court and was affirmed Per Curiam. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, granted allocatur and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the specific issue of Chambers\u2019 right to appeal. The trial court subsequently permitted appellant to file a direct appeal <em>nunc pro tuno. </em>The appeal was filed in the Supreme Court and that court gave appellant the right to file <em>nuno pro tune </em>post trial motions. The motions were heard at the trial level and dismissed. This order was also appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed the Judgment of Sentence Per Curiam, 216 Pa.Super. 801, 264 A.2d 196 (1970). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied allo-catur on May 8, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"adc-dedup-0\">Petitioner\u2019s actions in the federal courts began with a habeas action filed in the Western District July 2, 1970, Civil Action No. 70-778. Relief was denied. We denied his Motion for Certificate of Probable Cause and Leave to Proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on November 2, 1970. Appellant then sought habeas relief in the instant case, Civil Action No. 71-11, raising the same issues, as in 70-778.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
