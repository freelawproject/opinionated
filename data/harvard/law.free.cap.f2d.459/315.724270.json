Appellant argues that certain testimony concerning prior statements of a witness for the defense should not have been admitted, and that the evidence as a whole is insufficient to support a guilty verdict. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">As substantive evidence of guilt, the Government presented the testimony of two police officers, Saunders and Harris. Officer Saunders\u2019 testimony, in pertinent part concerning the first narcotics transaction may be summarized as follows: On June 24, 1970, Saunders entered a bar at about 2:55 P.M. and found the appellant Lewis engaged in conversation with an unknown person. Saunders approached Lewis and asked if he could purchase 20 bundles of heroin. He also asked him \u201cif he could stand it\u201d whereupon Lewis told him to wait a minute. Lewis left the front exit of the bar and walked west on Wallace Street. About fifteen minutes later, Austin walked in the bar, approached Saunders and asked him if he wanted 20 bundles. Saunders replied in the affirmative and Austin then fixed the price at $1300. Saunders asked Austin \u201cwhere is Butch,\u201d referring to the appellant Lewis, to which Austin replied that he was outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Saunders, Harris and Austin then left the bar and walked west on Wallace Street. As they walked along Wallace Street, Officer Saunders observed the appellant Lewis talking to several unknown men. He turned to Lewis and inquired what he meant by a price of $65 a bundle. Lewis pointed to Austin and said: \u201cSee him.\u201d As Saunders, Harris and Austin departed, Lewis said to Austin: \u201cDon\u2019t forget what I told you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">This testimony was substantially corroborated by Officer Harris. The officers purchased heroin from Austin on the same day as the incident related in Saunders\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Officer Saunders testified concerning the second narcotics transaction as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Then [I] asked Lewis how many bundles could he get for the price of $2500, at which time the defendant, Lewis, asked for a piece of paper and a pen and figured up the price. The price came to \u2014 he said we could get thirty-nine bundles for the $2500, and even at that he would be losing money, $35 or $40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">I then asked the defendant Lewis, could he go any lower. Lewis then stated to me that he didn\u2019t bag his own stuff, and if I wanted weight, he could get it for me, but he said that I would have to cut it and bag it myself, and this is time-consuming. I agreed to the .fact that it was time-consuming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">Then I also said to Lewis, \u201cLike on the other deal,\u201d referring back to 6-24-70, \u201cthat we asked for twenty bundles but you only came across with fifteen.\u201d Lewis then stated that, \u201cI had to do it that way because I couldn\u2019t let my boys up here starve. I had to save some for the fellows up here,\u201d at which time the defendant then asked me what my name was. I stated to him my name was Robert Smith. He also asked Officer Harris what his name was. He told him his name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Again, this testimony was substantially corroborated by Officer Harris. And, again, the officers purchased heroin from Austin on the day on which the incidents related above took place. The amount of heroin received was thirty nine bundles, corresponding to the terms of the conversation held between Lewis and the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">The defense sought to rebut this testimony by presenting Austin as a witness. Austin testified that the transactions were his own, admitted pleading guilty to the sale of narcotics and stated that Lewis had had nothing to do with the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">The Government then called the officers to the stand, and proceeded to introduce testimony concerning prior statements made by Austin. The judge allowed these statements, but at the same time cautioned the jury that they were for impeachment purposes only. The statements not only contradicted Austin\u2019s testimony for the defense, but also indicated that Lewis had been involved in the narcotic transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the substantive evidence outlined above is insufficient to sustain a verdict. Appellant places his primary reliance upon Orozco-Vasquez v. United States, 344 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1965). There, the court summarized the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">At best we know Molano [the defendant] on one day twice watered a guilty defendant\u2019s lawn, and drove that same defendant (his girl friend) to and from an appointment where narcotics were sold, but in which sale he did not participate, and at which he was not present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-17\">There was never any proof Molano ever had any personal, actual possession of narcotics, nor constructive possession of them, nor knowledge of their presence in someone else\u2019s possession in the car he drove (if they were present). He never received, nor had even temporarily in his possession, any fruit of a sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">Id., at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>In the instant case the jury, believing the officers\u2019 testimony, had evidence that after asking Lewis if they could purchase narcotics and after Lewis had told them to wait, they were approached by Austin, with whom they consummated a sale. There was testimony that after discussing the price of the narcotics with Lewis, Lewis told the officers to: \u201cSee him,\u201d indicating Austin. Moreover, the officers testified that Lewis stated that he \u201chad\u201d to give them less bundles because \u201cI couldn\u2019t let my boys up here starve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">This was evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that Lewis and Austin were collaborating in the sale of heroin, and although Lewis was careful to avoid being present when the money and narcotics passed, that he was nonetheless aiding Austin in the entire transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Secondly, appellant contends that the court erred in allowing impeachment of Austin, by the use of his prior inconsistent statements, since they tended to incriminate the defendant in the commission of the offense for which he was being tried, in violation of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Lewis v. Yeager, 411 F.2d 414 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 923, 90 S.Ct. 256, 24 L.Ed.2d 204 (1969), directly answers appellant\u2019s contention. In <em>Lewis, </em>this court considered the applicability of <em>Bruton </em>where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\"><em>the appellant himself called </em>as a witness in his defense <em>an alleged confederate who thereupon gave testimony tending to exculpate the appellant. </em>The prosecution was then permitted to impeach the witness by introducing into evidence his prior inconsistent statement incriminating the appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Id., at 414 (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">We held that this was not error, since:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Q\"><em>the appellant himself had created the occasion </em>for the use of the incriminating prior statement of the alleged conference and the appellant was permitted to cross-examine the witness about that statement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Id., at 414 (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Of course, in <em>Lewis, </em>\u201c[t]he court accurately instructed the jury concerning the limited permissible use of this statement for impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 414. Similarly, in the instant ease, the judge, at the time of the admission of the impeachment evidence, carefully instructed the jury concerning the \u201cpermissible use\u201d of the impeachment evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">Appellant\u2019s third contention is that in failing to include an instruction to the jury in the court\u2019s charge concerning the limited use of this evidence, the court erred. However, appellant took no objection to the charge. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>over, the court took pains to insure that his instructions met with counsel\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the court had previously, on two occasions, instructed the jury as to the limited use of Austin\u2019s testimony, this is not such a flaw as could be considered \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.Proc. Sykes v. United States, 373 F.2d 607 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 1172, 18 L.Ed.2d 138 (1967). Thus, appellant\u2019s failure to object precludes his raising the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The final argument of appellant concerns the summation of the United States Attorney. During this summation, appellant\u2019s counsel entered into a discussion with the court. Appellant believes that this discussion constituted a promise by the court to include an \"\"instruction concerning the use of the impeachment testimony. As we have noted, no objection was taken to the court\u2019s charge. But, in any event, the colloquy between counsel and the court constituted no promise by the court. The court merely noted that it would \u201cinstruct the ladies and gentlemen of the jury as to what relevant, substantive weight of testimony is.\u201d A reading of the transcript shows that this appeared to satisfy appellant. In any event, no explicit objection was taken during the colloquy, and as we have noted, no objection was taken to the court\u2019s charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. The court instructed the jury as follows when the impeachment evidence was introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cNow we are permitting the testimony, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in relationship now as to what Mr. Austin said for your evaluation of Mr. Austin\u2019s testimony. I tried to explain to you yesterday when Austin was not present that you could not consider that as substantive evidence against Mr. Lewis, but you may consider the statements now as to what Mr. Austin said to Mr. Saunders in your making your judgment of the credibility or the believability of Mr. Austin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">As the court noted in instructions given above, it had previously instructed the jury on the matter of how they were to treat evidence of Austin\u2019s testimony concerning statements by Lewis. The substance of that instruction was: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, somewhere in the process I will have to explain to you some rules of evidence, part of which relate to hearsay. Now, what Mr. Saunders is saying that purportedly the defendant said, you will not be able to consider at this point as any evidence against the defendant. Now, I don\u2019t know what the facts of this case are going to develop. So, that I am just giving you this cautionary instruction, and to that extent I sustain it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-18\">. At the close of the judge\u2019s charge, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: . . . [a]ny exceptions, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-21\">MR. McBRIDE: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-22\">MR. SANTAGUIDA: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-24\">THE COURT: No exceptions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-25\">MR. SANTAGUIDA: General exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-26\">THE COURT: Will you please come up to side bar? Do you want to take the jury out for a minute? (Jury out at 11:39 o\u2019clock A.M.) (And at side bar:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-27\">THE COURT: When you say \u2018general exceptions,\u2019 general exceptions mean absolutely nothing to me. If you have something very specific\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-28\">MR. SANTAGUIDA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4\">MR. McBRIDE: Then no exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMG\">MR. SANTAGUIDA: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3\">THE COURT: All right. Bring the jury back in.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-32\">. The substance of appellant\u2019s comments, and the court\u2019s reply is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-33\">MR. SANTAGUIDA [counsel for Mr. Lewis] : Your Honor, excuse me. I think that certain testimony that was elicited from Mr. Austin was only for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Austin\u2019s credibility, and can\u2019t be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-34\">THE COURT: I will instruct the ladies and gentlemen of the jury as to what relevant, substantive weight of testimony is. Mr. McBride nor you do not have to give the rule of law in terms of what the evidence is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-35\">MR. SANTAGUIDA: Right. I feel the way he is reviewing it\u2014</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
