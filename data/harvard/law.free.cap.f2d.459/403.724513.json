CARTER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Plaintiff Pickering appeals from the district court\u2019s holding that his patent was invalid in that it was described in a printed publication more than one year prior to the filing of the application for the patent. He also appeals from the court\u2019s award of taxable costs to defendants. Defendants Holman, Huey and Fenton (hereafter defendants) cross-appeal on the basis of the court\u2019s refusal to award them attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pickering\u2019s appeal raises two issues: (1) Whether publication pursuant to experimental activity is exempt from the 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) bar against publication more than one year prior to application for patent protection; (2) Whether costs may be awarded where they were paid for by one not a party to the litigation. The cross-appeal raises the issue as to whether the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant attorney\u2019s fees to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">I. PATENT VALIDITY</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Thomas Pickering is a co-inventor and owner of patent 3,266,015 directed to a plastic blinker light, which is useful as a traffic warning device. Pickering filed his application with the Patent Office on March 19, 1962. Defendants were sued on the basis of their trading in warning lights covered by the Pickering patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">In the suit below, defendants challenged the validity of the Pickering patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that the patent was \u201cdescribed in a printed publication\u201d and in \u201cpublic use\u201d and \u201con sale\u201d more than one year prior to the date of application for a patent. A separate trial under Rule 42(b) F.R. Civ.P. was held on this issue and the jury was required to return special verdicts under Rule 49(a) F.R.C.P. The jury, by way of answer to written interrogatories, found that the claimed invention was described in detail in a printed publication and in public use and on sale prior to March 19, 1961, i. e., more than one year prior to the filing of the application for a U.S. patent. The jury also determined that the \u201cmain purpose of the patentee\u2019s activities prior to March 19, 1961 [was] for experimentation and testing\u201d and that \u201cone of the purposes of the patentee\u2019s activities prior to March 19, 1961 [was] for trade and profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">The court, pursuant to these verdicts, concluded that the patent was invalid under the publication bar of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), and that this bar was not avoided by the so-called \u201cexperimental use exception.\u201d While the court\u2019s order does not explicitly so provide, it appears that the court was of the opinion that the public use and sales were excused as experimental.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">Pickering claims error, arguing that the experimentation doctrine should be applied to the prohibition against \u201cprinted publications\u201d in exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the same manner and to exactly the same extent as it is applied to the \u201con sale\u201d and \u201cin public use\u201d prohibitions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not agree. Their argument confuses the policies which underlie these statutory prohibitions and misunderstands the reason for the experimental use doctrine. As we explain below, that doctrine is a logical application of the public use prohibition and not an exception to it. The doctrine is inapplicable to publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\n<em>The Public Use Bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) provides that an inventor shall not be entitled to a patent if \u201cthe invention was in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States.\u201d The policy underlying this provision is clear. It prevents an inventor from extending the period of his monopoly by exploiting his invention before his application for a patent. Pennock v. Dialogue, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 1, 19, 7 L.Ed. 327 (1829); Super Mold Corp. v. Clapp\u2019s Equip. Div., Inc. (9 Cir. 1968), 397 F.2d 932, 933; Tool Research &amp; Eng\u2019r Corp. v. Honeor Corp. (9 Cir. 1966), 367 F.2d 449, 454; Koehring Co. v. National Automatic Tool Co. (7 Cir. 1966), 362 F.2d 100, 103; Metallizing Eng\u2019r Co. v. Kenyon Bearing &amp; Auto Parts (2 Cir. 1946), 153 F.2d 516, 520, cert. den., 328 U.S. 840, 66 S.Ct. 1016, 90 L.Ed. 1615; Aerovox Corp. v. Polymet Mfg. Corp. (2 Cir. 1933), 67 F.2d 860, 862; Ushakoff v. United States (Ct.Cl.1964), 327 F.2d 669, 672, 164 Ct. Cl. 455; Note, The Public Use Bar to Patentability: Two New Approaches to the Exception, 52 Minn.L.Rev. 851, 864-865 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">A use which commercially exploits an invention constitutes a public use (i. e. either \u201cin public us\u00e9 or on sale\u201d). The use may be exposed to the public or hidden. Hall v. Macneale, 107 U.S. 90, 97, 2 S.Ct. 73, 27 L.Ed. 367 (1882). Commercial exploitation of the product of a secret process or machine constitutes public use, regardless of whether the process or machine could have been known by familiarity with the product. Tool Research Eng\u2019r Corp. v. Honcor Corp. (9 Cir. 1966), 367 F.2d 449, 454; United States Chem. Corp. v. Plastic Glass Corp. (3 Cir. 1957), 243 F.2d 892, 894; Huszar v. Cincinnati Chem. Works (6 Cir. 1949), 172 F.2d 6, 10; Metallizing Eng\u2019r Co. v. Kenyon Bearing &amp; Auto Parts Co. (2 Cir. 1946), 153 F.2d 516, 520, cert. den. 328 U.S. 840, 66 S.Ct. 1016, 90 L.Ed. 1615.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\"> A use which is primarily experimental and no more than incidentally for trade or profit is not a public use. <em>E. g. </em>Smith &amp; Griggs Mfg. Co. v. Sprague, 123 U.S. 249, 88 S.Ct. 122, 31 L.Ed. 141 (1887). This is the so-called \u201cexperimental use exception\u201d. Viewed in light of the policy underlying the public use provision, however, it is no exception at all. A bona fide experimental use involves no commercial exploitation. \u201cThe use [of an invention] ceases to be experimental when the motivation of the inventor is to exploit the invention and gain a competitive advantage over others.\u201d Solo Cup Co. v. Paper Mach.-Corp., D.C., 240 F.Supp. 126, 131, quoted in Super Mold Corp. v. Clapp\u2019s Equip. Div., Inc. (9 Cir. 1968), 397 F.2d 932, 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\n<em>The Publication Bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The 102(b) bar against \u201cpublication in this or a foreign country more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States\u201d serves other policies. Anything that is printed and made accessible to any part of the public is a printed publication. 1 Deller\u2019s Walker on Patents \u00a7 60 at 278 (2 ed.). Confidential documents are not publications. <em>Id. </em>The key is disclosure by way of a medium capable of providing wide public access, In re Tenney (1958), 254 F.2d 619, 626, 45 CCPA 894, not commercial exploitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> Publication without seasonable application for patent protection thus operates as a constructive abandonment. The policy here goes to the nature of the patent grant. A patent is in the nature of a contract between the public and the inventor. A patentee \u201cgives something of value to the community by adding to the sum of human knowledge. ... In consideration of its disclosure and the consequent benefit to the community, the patent is granted.\u201d United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178, 186, 53 S.Ct. 554, 557, 77 L.Ed. 1114 (1933). The publication bar goes upon the theory that the idea is already in the public domain and there can be no consideration offered in exchange for the grant of the monopoly. In re Ekenstam (1958), 256 F.2d 321, 323, 45 CCPA 1022; In re Tenney (1958), 254 F.2d 619, 624, 45 CCPA 894; Cottier v. Stimson (C.C.D.Or.1884), 20 F. 906, 910. The one-year grace period is the only recognized exception to this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The publication bar also protects the reasonable expectations of the public. An inventor is not expected to disclose his invention without seeking a patent within a reasonable time thereafter. The publication bar prevents patent rights from springing up which might prejudice those who practice the invention, reasonably assuming it was not or could not be the subject of a monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The experimental use doctrine is out of place here. Any publication, regardless of the purposes behind it, violates the policies behind the publication bar. Publication pursuant to experiment is no exception. Experiment does not insulate against or limit the scope of public disclosure, for similar to \u201cpublic use\u201d, experimentation may or may not be public. Experimental use merely negatives the commercial exploitation necessary for public use. Such exploitation is irrelevant to whether a printing has been made accessible to a part of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">In re Hassler (1965), 347 F.2d 911, 52 CCPA 1546, lends support to our position. There the court held a newspaper article to be \u201cprior art\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, where the article did no more than report the progress of experiments by appellant and his co-workers. <em>Id. </em>347 F.2d at 913. The court rejected the notion that the hospitality accorded to experimental inventions should except such publication. As Judge Smith stated in his concurring opinion, \u201cCongress has seen fit to fix the time period for such \u2018hospitality\u2019 at one year from the date of publication describing the invention and we can do nothing about it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 919-920. <em>See </em>Browning Mfg. Co. v. Bros., Inc. (D.Minn.1962), 134 USPQ 231, 235, aff\u2019d on other grounds, (8 Cir.) 317 F.2d 413. We agree. We hold that publication pursuant to experiment is not exempt from the statutory bar against printed publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">II. GRANT OF COSTS TO DEFENDANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Pickering finds error in that a third party \u2014 the manufacturer of the infringing device \u2014 -was footing defendants\u2019 litigation and thus their costs were paid for by that party. For this reason, he argues, he should not be required to pay defendants\u2019 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Tidewater Patent Dev. Co., Inc. v. Kitchen (4 Cir. 1970), 421 F.2d 680, is the closest case. There the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to defendant even though a third party paid for the litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion expenses. We think the same principle should apply here. The arrangement between the defendants and the manufacturer is a common one in patent litigation. We see no reason to penalize it. Pickering, who obtained his patent without full disclosure to the Patent Office and sued upon an invalid patent, is the wrongdoer. If he is not charged costs he gains a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">III. DEFENDANTS\u2019 CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Defendants, by way of cross-appeal, argue that they should have received attorney\u2019s fees. Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 such fees \u201cmay\u201d be awarded only \u201cin exceptional cases.\u201d The award \u201cis a matter of discretion, and the court cannot be reversed except for abuse of discretion.\u201d Hayes Spray Gun Co. v. E. C. Brown Co. (9 Cir. 1961), 291 F.2d 319, 327. Our review of the record does not disclose an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-17\">. Tbeir cross-appeal also attacks the district court\u2019s holding that the patent was not invalidated, by prior public use or sale. In view of our decision to affirm, we need not consider this part of their cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-19\">. A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-20\">(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States . . . .\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (1970).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. We note that, under the jury\u2019s verdicts, it is not clear whether the experimental use doctrine should apply in either case. That doctrine permits an inventor to avoid the public use or sale provision by showing that his use 'of the invention was primarily experimental and only <em>incidentally </em>for trade or profit. Smith &amp; Griggs Mfg. Co. v. Sprague, 123 U.S. 249, 256, 8 S.Ct. 122, 31 L.Ed. 141 (1887). The jury\u2019s finding that \u201cone purpose of the patentee\u2019s activities [was] for trade and profit\u201d is ambiguous. They did not determine whether this purpose was merely incidental to experimentation. For purposes of this appeal, however, we assume that the patentee\u2019s profits were merly incidental to experimentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
