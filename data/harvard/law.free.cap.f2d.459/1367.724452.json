We are by no means confident that the difference of two seconds in the stamped filing time of the petitions filed in this Circuit and in the 5th Circuit is sufficiently meaningful to establish the automatic application of the mandate of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), or whether a different disposition might be permissible.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However the matter need not be explored so far as the instant controversy is concerned since the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is \u201cfamiliar with the background of the controversy through review of the same or related proceedings\u201d by virtue of its consideration in Southern Louisiana Area Rate Cases v. FPC, 428 F.2d 407 (1970), and accordingly transfer to that circuit is in the public interest under the approach followed in Eastern Air Lines v. CAB, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 354 F.2d 507 (1965). The motion to transfer is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>We do not pass on the contention of petitioner Municipal Distributors Group, in opposition to the motion to transfer, that the petitions to review filed in the Fifth Circuit represent \u201cblatant forum shopping\u201d in a case involving hundreds of millions of dollars in rates for natural gas produced in Southern Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and that these petitions to review, filed by Placid Oil Company and its co-petitioners, various Hunt interests, reflect only a technical \u201caggrievement\u201d and that any shortfall in the relief they requested of the Federal Power Commission is not significant enough to support their determining choice of forum. This court has recognized that sound doctrine resists \u201cforum shopping\u201d in a case of mere technical aggrievement, see International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, U.A.W.-A.F.L.-C.I.O. et al. v. NLRB, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 373 F.2d 671, 674 (1967). However, it is for the Fifth Circuit where the pertinent petition to review was filed, to study it and consider whether that doctrine is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1426-11\"> See International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v.
