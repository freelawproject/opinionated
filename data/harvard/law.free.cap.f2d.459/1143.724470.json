We must determine the effect which a member\u2019s resignation from the union, before, during, or after such conduct, has upon the union\u2019s disciplinary authority. We are also requested to consider the legal implications of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the fines imposed, where the union has threatened enforcement thereof, or has actually sought collection through legal means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Booster Lodge No. 405, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (hereinafter sometimes referi\u2019ed to as the Union), and The Boeing Company, (hei\u2019einafter sometimes referred to as the Company), were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which was effective from May 16, 1963, through September 15, 1965.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon the expiration of the contract, the Union commenced a lawful strike against Boeing at its Michoud plant, as well as at various other locations. This work stoppage lasted 18 days. On October 2, 1965, a new bargaining agreement was signed, and the economic strikers returned to work the following day. Both the expired agreement and the newly executed contract contained maintenance-of-membership clauses, which required all new employees to notify both the Union and the Company within 40 days of their acceptance of employment if they elected not to become Union members. It also required those who were Union members to retain their membership during the contract term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">During the strike period, approximately 143 employees, of the 1900 production and maintenance employees represented by the Union at the Michoud plant, crossed the picket line and reported to work. All of these persons had been Union members during the 1963-1965 contract period. Some of the employees who worked during the strike made no attempt to resign from the Union during the strike. The remaining 119 submitted their voluntary resignations, in writing, to both the Union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Company. About 61 of the employees who resigned did so <em>before </em>they crossed the picket line and returned to work. Another 58 resigned during the course of the strike, but <em>after </em>they had crossed'the picket line in order to work. All resignations were submitted after the expiration of the 1963-1965 contract, and before the execution of the new agreement, and all wei\u2019e submitted prior to the imposition of any Union discipline. Union members had not been warned prior to the strike that disciplinary measures could, or would, be taken against those who ei-ossed the picket line to woi\u2019k, nor had any such discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>been imposed on members by Booster Lodge 405 prior to this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">In late October or early November of 1965, the Union notified all members and former members who had crossed the picket line to work during the strike that charges had been preferred against them under the International Union Constitution, for \u201cImproper Conduct of a Member\u201d due to their having \u201caccept[ed] employment ... in an establishment where a strike exist [ed].\u201d They were advised of the dates of their Union trials, which were to be held even in their absence if they did not appear, and they were notified of their right to be represented by any counsel who was a member of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Pursuant to the International Union Constitution provision which permitted the imposition of disciplinary measures, including \u201creprimand, fine, suspension, or expulsion from membership, or any lesser penalty or combination,\u201d where a member had been found guilty of misconduct after notice and a hearing, fines were imposed on all employees who had worked during the strike. No distinction was drawn between those persons who had resigned from the Union during the course of the strike and those who had remained Union members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Employees who did not appear for trial before the Union Trial Committee and those who appeared but were found guilty were fined $450.00 each, the amount determined by the membership, and they were barred from holding a Union office for a period of 5 years. The fines of about 35 employees who appeared for trial, apologized, and pledged loyalty to the Union, were reduced to 50 percent of the earnings they <em>received </em>during the strike.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In some of these cases the time period during which these persons were prohibited from holding Union office was decreased to a period based upon the number of days of strikebreaking activity each respective person had engaged in. None of the disciplined individuals processed intra-Union appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">Although none of the $450.00 fines has been paid, reduced fines have been paid in some instances. The Union has sent out written notices that the matter has been referred to an attorney for collection, that suit will be filed if the fines remain unpaid, and that reduced fines will be reinstated to $450.00 in the event of nonpayment. The Union has also filed suit against nine individual employees to collect the fines (plus attorney\u2019s fees and interest). None of these suits has yet been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">On February 18, 1966, the Company filed a charge with the N.L.R.B., alleging that the Union had violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the N.L.R.A.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a complaint was issued by the General Counsel. The Labor Board decided that the Union violated section 8(b) (1) (A): (1) by fining those employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>had resigned from the Union before they returned to work during the strike; and (2) by disciplining those employees who had resigned after returning to work, to the extent that the fines were imposed for their working during the strike after their resignations. The Board further found that the Union did <em>not </em>violate the Act (3) by fining members for crossing the picket line to work, and by fining those employees who had resigned after returning to work during the strike, for work .they performed during the strike prior to their resignations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\">Finally, the Board determined (4) that it was not the intention of Congress to have the N.L.R.B. regulate the size of such disciplinary fines and establish standards with respect to their reasonableness, and it dismissed the claim that otherwise legal fines may be rendered violative of the N.L.R.A. if unreasonably large. A cease and desist order was issued, and the Union was ordered to refund any fines collected from employees who had resigned before returning to work. The Union was also required to refund a pro rata portion of those fines collected from employees who had resigned after first engaging in work during the strike, so that the part of the fines retained would only reflect pre-resignation conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Booster Lodge 405 challenges the Board\u2019s conclusion that a mid-strike resignation from a union relieves an individual from the burden of union discipline with respect to his post-resignation activity, while The Boeing Company contends that the N.L.R.B. should have examined the reasonableness of the fines imposed by the Union. The Board seeks enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Part I of this opinion discusses the legality of the imposition of the disciplinary fines by the Union in response to the strikebreaking by the approximately 143 employees involved. Part II considers the effect the reasonableness of the fines has upon their propriety under the N.L.R.A., and the proper function of the N.L.R.B. in this area. Finally, Part III deals with the propriety of the Board\u2019s remedial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\"><em>The Legality of the Disciplinary Fines </em>A. <em>The Employees Who Did Not Resign</em></p>\n<p id=\"aum-dedup-1\">As early as 1954, in Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co., 109 NLRB 727 (1954), the Labor Board held that a union did not violate Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act by imposing a fine on a member for his failure to perform picket duty during the course of an authorized strike. The Board declared that the <em>proviso </em>to 8(b) (1) (A) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> precluded any interference by it with the internal affairs of a labor organization in such a situation. In N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., 388 U.S. 175, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967), a divided Supreme Court similarly determined that a union did not violate the N.L.R.A. when it imposed, and attempted to enforce through court action, reasonable fines against members for their failure to honor an authorized picket line. Instead of relying upon the express language of the <em>proviso, </em>however, the Supreme Court carefully analyzed the entire legislative history of Section 8(b) (1) (A), and it concluded that Congress did not intend to prohibit such internal union discipline by the prohibition against \u201crestraint\u201d or \u201ccoercion.\u201d See 388 U.S. at 183-195, 87 S.Ct. 2001.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-10\">National labor policy has been built on the premise that by pooling their economic strength and acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority, the employees of an appropriate unit have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in wages, hours, and working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>conditions. The policy therefore extinguishes the individual employee\u2019s power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interests of all employees. \u201cCongress has seen fit to clothe the bargaining representative with powers comparable to those possessed by a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those whom it represents ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">388 U.S. at 180, 87 S.Ct. at 2006. See J. I. Case Co. v. N.L.R.B., 321 U.S. 332, 64 S.Ct. 576, 88 L.Ed. 762 (1944). The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-5\">Integral to this federal labor policy has been the power in the chosen union to protect against erosion [of] its status under that policy through reasonable discipline of members who violate rules and regulations governing membership. That power is particularly vital when the members engage in strikes. The economic strike against the employer is the ultimate weapon in labor\u2019s arsenal for achieving agreement upon its terms, and \u201c[t]he power to fine or expel strikebreakers is essential if the union is to be an effective bargaining agent <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">388 U.S. at 181, 87 S.Ct. at 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\"> In more recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the right of a union to impose and enforce reasonable fines against members who engage in strikebreaking activities. In Scofield v. N.L.R.B., 394 U.S. 423, 428-430, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 22 L.Ed.2d 385 (1969), the Court emphasized the right of a union to enforce a properly adopted rule which reflects a legitimate union interest, impairs no statutory labor policy, and is reasonably enforced against union members. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Industrial Union of Marine etc. Workers, 391 U.S. 418, 423, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968). <em>See also </em>Rocket Freight Lines Co. v. N.L.R.B., 427 F.2d 202, 205-206 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 241, 27 L.Ed.2d 246 (1970); Silard, Labor Board Regulation of Union Discipline After Allis-Chalmers, Marine Workers and Scofield, 38 Geo.Wash.L. Rev. 187 (1969). In light of these developments,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is clear that the Union acted within the sphere of its lawful authority when it decided to impose fines on the 24 strikebreaking members who did not resign from the Union.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, the Union\u2019s threats to enforce these fines, as well as its actual efforts to achieve court enforcement thereof, were not prohibited by the N.L.R.A. However, a more difficult question arises with respect to the 119 employees who resigned from the Union during the strike period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">B. <em>The Employees Who Did Resign</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkqU\">As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>when Section 8(b) (1) (A) was enacted, \u201cCongress was operating within the context of the \u2018contract theory\u2019 of the union-member relationship which widely prevailed at that time.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 192, 87 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>Ct. at 2013. <em>See </em>International Association of Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U.S. 617, 618, 78 S.Ct. 923, 2 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1958). Under this theory union membership was deemed in effect to create a \u201ccontract\u201d between the labor organization and the member which imposed certain obligations on the member, and the decision emphasized \u201cthat \u2018The courts\u2019 role is but to enforce the contract.\u2019 \u201d 388 U.S. at 182, 87 S.Ct. at 2008. <em>See </em>Summers, <em>The Law of Union Discipline: What the Courts Do in Fact, </em>70 Yale L.J. 175, 180 (1960). It is, therefore, obvious that <em>membership </em>in the labor organization is the <em>sine qua non </em>to the authority of a union to impose disciplinary burdens upon the employees it represents. This has been widely recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\">In <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>the Court expressly limited its holding to \u201creasonable discipline of <em>members </em>who violate rules and regulations governing <em>membership.\u201d </em>N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 181, 87 S.Ct. at 2007 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also id. </em>at 195-196.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Labor Board specifically recognized this indispensable prerequisite in <em>Scofield, </em>145 NLRB 1097, 1104 (1964), where it noted that \u201c[a] union rule that a <em>member </em>is subject to a fine if he [violates a valid union rule] does not mean that he is subject to such a fine as an <em>employee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) This membership requirement for union disciplinary authority was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Scofield v. N.L.R.B., 394 U.S. 423, 429, n. 5, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 1157, 22 L.Ed.2d 385:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgZT\">As an employee, [an individual] may be a \u201cgood, bad, or indifferent\u201d member so long as he meets the financial obligations of the union security contract. * * * But <em>as a union member, so long as he chooses to remain one, he is subject to union discipline. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-10\"><em>See </em>394 U.S. at 435, 89 S.Ct. at 1160. Thus the Court recognized that \u201cunion members . . . are free to leave the union and escape the [union] rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 89 S.Ct. at 1158.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is therefore apparent that <em>Booster Lodge U05 only had the authority to discipline those employees who were in fact Union members at the time they engaged in the complained of activity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-12\">Approximately 58 of the employees who worked during the strike submitted their resignations to the Union <em>after </em>they had already engaged in some of the conduct proscribed by the International Union Constitution. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>light of the above discussion regarding union authority over action undertaken by full members, we must concur in the Board\u2019s determination that the Union did not violate Section 8(b) (1) (A) <em>so far as its imposition of disciplinary fines concerned this preresignation conduct. </em>The fact that the fines were not officially imposed for these pre-resignation breaches of Union regulations until after the strikebreakers had resigned, in no way negated the authority of the Union over these persons with respect to these acts, as the N.L.R.B. properly recognized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1210-4\">The provisions of a contract are enforceable, and a cause of action can be brought upon them, even after the expiration or termination of the agreement. The rights and duties created by an agreement are extinguished only prospectively by the termination thereof. Thus the termination of some employees\u2019 membership here did not affect the Union\u2019s subsequent assertion of rights which had accrued to the Union during their earlier period of membership, such as the right to discipline the employees for prior strikebreaking. The effect of these employees\u2019 resignations was only to extinguish the Union\u2019s future authority over them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Booster Lodge No. 405, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, 185 NLRB No. 23, 1970 CCH NLRB \u00b6 22,259, at p. 28,693 (1970).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">C. <em>Fines Imposed for Post-resignation Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">An extremely difficult question is presented with respect to the fines which were imposed upon employees for their posi-resignation conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Booster Lodge 405 has made a sophisticated argument which would expose persons who were members at the commencement of a particular strike to union discipline with respect to any strikebreaking action undertaken during that specific work stoppage. Although it concedes that such a restriction is not contained in any of the express language of the International Union Constitution or Bylaws, the Union urges this court to \u201cflesh out\u201d such documents by imposing such an obligation by implication. We must decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-11\">It must be emphasized that in situations like this, while \u201cthe function of the court is to determine, as far as is possible, the intention of the contracting parties and to give legal effect thereto,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is generally recognized that courts will not usually imply offenses not specified in a union\u2019s constitution or by-laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We believe that this latter consideration is controlling with respect to the instant case. As the union recognizes, there is nothing in the record which evidences any intention on the part of the approximately 119 persons who resigned during the strike in question that their initial acceptance of Union membership would impose upon them the type of continuing obligation which Booster Lodge 405 now asks this court to impose. Furthermore, the very fact that they resigned during this period, in an obvious attempt to escape the disciplinary authority of the Union, belies this proposed line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-12\">In addition, an extremely important national labor policy militates against the imposition of such an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>plied obligation. Section 7 of the N.L.R. A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> expressly protects the right of any employee to refrain from any or all of the concerted activities guaranteed to employees under the Act. While <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>and <em>Scofield </em>recognized the legality of certain <em>express </em>union provisions limiting an employee\u2019s freedom where he had voluntarily accepted full union membership, nothing in those decisions supports the Union\u2019s theory of implied, post-resignation restrictions. In fact, language in <em>Scofield </em>expressly indicates otherwise. The Supreme Court only recognized the right of a union \u201cto enforce a properly adopted rule which reflects a legitimate union interest, impairs no policy Congress has imbedded in the labor laws, and is reasonably enforced against union <em>members who are free to leave the union and escape the rule.\u201d </em>Scofield v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 430, 89 S.Ct. at 1158 (emphasis supplied). As the Board properly concluded below, after resignation, \u201c[b]oth the member\u2019s duty of fidelity and the union\u2019s corresponding right to discipline him for breach of that duty are extinguished.\u201d Booster Lodge No. 405, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, <em>supra, </em>1970 CCH NLRB \u00b6 22,259, at p. 28,692.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">The Union has relied heavily upon the First Circuit\u2019s holding in N.L.R.B. v. Granite State Joint Board, Textile Workers Union, Local 1029, 446 F.2d 369 (1st Cir.1971), but we believe that the decision is inapposite to the present fact situation. Although the court in <em>Granite State </em>upheld the right of the union involved to impose fines on strikebreakers for post-resignation activity, it emphasized that a specific set of facts was present which it believed rendered such a result equitable, and it specifically recognized that these considerations were not present with respect to the instant Booster Lodge 405 case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Granite State, </em>the Board conceded that all of the fined employees had voted in favor of the strike in question.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is also important to note that the fines had not been imposed pursuant to a general provision in the union constitution, as here, but rather in accordance with a specific proclamation which had been unanimously adopted by the membership after the work stoppage commenced. <em>See </em>446 F.2d at 370, 372 n. 5. Furthermore, all of those who were disciplined in <em>Granite State </em>had been expressly pre-warned of possible punishment for strikebreaking,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> while the employees with whom we are herein concerned received no such pre-strikebreaking notification. Because of these distinguishing facts, we refuse to apply the rationale of <em>Granite State </em>to the instant factual situation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The strong equities which weighed in favor of the union there, are clearly not present here. In fact, their very absence powerfully supports the result which we have accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">Since the International Union Constitution and By-laws contained no express restriction upon a member\u2019s right to resign it is clear that the strikebreaker/employees were free to resign at will, subject only to their being bound by any permissible collective bargaining agreement provision limiting this right. Local Union 621, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum and Plastic Workers of America, 167 NLRB 610 (1967); Communications Workers v. N.L.R.B., 215 F.2d 835 (2d Cir.1954); N.L.R.B. v. Mechanical and Allied Produc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>tion Workers, Local 444, 427 F.2d 883 (1st Cir.1970). Furthermore, since the resignations all occurred after the termination of the 1963-1965 agreement and before the execution of the new contract, the maintenance-of-membership provision was not applicable to limit this right either. N.L.R.B. v. Mechanical and Allied Production Workers, Local 444, <em>supra, </em>427 F.2d at 884-885; N.L.R.B. v. Granite State Joint Board, Textile Workers Union, Local 1029, <em>supra, </em>446 F.2d at 372. Under these circumstances we concur in the reasoning of the Second Circuit in Communications Workers v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra, </em>215 F.2d at 838:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-4\">We agree that the proviso [to \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A)] protects the Union\u2019s right to make its own rules with respect to membership, but assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that a rule wholly prohibiting voluntary resignations would be valid, we think that in the absence of any rule on the subject of voluntary resignation, the <em>proviso </em>is inapplicable. Concededly the Union Constitution and by-laws are absolutely silent as to whether a member can voluntarily resign. Hence we think that the common law doctrine on withdrawal from voluntary associations is apposite.

R.A. This conclusion was based upon the Board\u2019s belief that Congress did not intend to empower the Labor Board with the authority to examine the severity of union discipline when ascertaining its legality, and it indicated that it thought that local courts were the most logical tribunals for the establishment of standards of reasonableness. The Board therefore refused to examine the question of reasonableness in the present case, despite an express determination by the Trial Examiner that the imposed fines were impermissibly excessive. We reject the position of the Board,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and remand the case for further proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>in conformity with the views set out below.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The Board\u2019s belief that it does not have the obligation of examining the reasonableness of union fines in Section 8(b) (1) (A) proceedings is based upon a clear misconception of the law and the Supreme Court\u2019s relevant decisions. In <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-6\">It is no answer that the proviso to \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) preserves to the union the power to expel the offending member. Where the union is strong and membership therefore valuable, to require expulsion of the member visits a far more severe penalty upon the member than a <em>reasonable fine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 183, 87 S.Ct. at 2008 (emphasis supplied). The Court further recognized that \u201cthe proviso preserves the rights of unions to impose fines, <em>as a lesser penalty than expulsion </em>...\u201d 388 U.S. at 191-192, 87 S.Ct. at 2012 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This implicitly recognized that, for a disciplinary fine to be less coercive than expulsion from the union, the fine imposed must be a \u201creasonable\u201d one, for it is intuitively obvious that enforcement of a grossly excessive fine might visit a far greater burden upon an individual than would mere expulsion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Supreme Court also expressly recognized this fact in its recent <em>Scofield </em>decision, wherein it concluded that the enforcement of a proper union rule \u201cby <em>reasonable fines </em>does not constitute the restraint or coercion proscribed by \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A).\u201d Scofield v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 436, 89 S.Ct. at 1161 (emphasis supplied). The <em>Scofield </em>Court emphasized that under <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>\u201c[a] union rule, duly adopted and not the arbitrary fiat of a union officer, forbidding the crossing of a picket line during a strike [is] . . . enforceable against voluntary union members by expulsion or a <em>reasonable fine.\u201d </em>394 U.S. at 428, 89 S. Ct. at 1157 (emphasis supplied). In light of the Court\u2019s emphasis on the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>qu i remen t of \u201creasonable fines\u201d if a union is to avoid a violation of the Act in these circumstances, we must conclude that the imposition of an unreasonably large fine, at least where the union threatens or actually attempts court enforcement of the fine, may be coercive and restraining within the meaning of section 8(b) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">Since the imposition of an unreasonably excessive disciplinary fine is violative of Section 8(b) (1) (A), it is clearly the obligation of the N.L.R.B. to resolve the question of reasonableness where such an issue is appropriately raised. The Board asserts that such a result might cause conflicts between it and state courts which attempt to examine the reasonableness issue in actions to collect such fines. However, we do not believe that this possible problem detracts from the Board\u2019s obligation under the N.L.R.A.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">We recognize that \u201cstate courts have been adjudicating internal union disputes for more than 60 years.\u201d Summers, The Law of Union Discipline: What the Courts Do in Fact, 70 Yale L.

N.L.R. B. v. American Bakery and Confectionery Workers, Local 300, 411 F.2d 1122, 1126 (7th Cir.1969). <em>See </em>Local Union No. 167, Progressive Mine Workers of America v.

There is something to be said for having the reasonableness of fines determined by standards that are as nearly uniform as national standards promulgated by the N.L.R.B. can be. Furthermore, access to the Labor Board is more readily available than meaningful access to state courts. Before the Board, the employee is represented by the General Counsel, and the agency bears the expense of the litigation. If the same employee wants a complete resolution of the reasonableness issue in a state court collection action brought by the union, he must be prepared to accept at least some financial burden. \u201cThe danger that the legal rights of a disciplined member will go by default because of the cost of asserting them in court is obvious . . . \u201d Summers, The Law of Union Discipline: What the Courts Do in Fact, 70 Yale L.J. 175, 220 (1960). We therefore reject the argument that the N.L.R.B. is required to defer to state tribunals with respect to the reasonableness issue. Such \u201creverse preemption\u201d would not, in our view, be consonant with the principles underlying the N.L.R.A.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-15\">Although the Board has not previously had to examine the reasonableness of union fines, it is not without experience in a related area. Under Section 8(b) (5),<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it is required to determine whether initiation fees required by a labor organization under a union-security agreement are excessive.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The fact that Section 8(b) (1) (A) does not provide the Board with specific standards to be applied in determining the reasonableness of a union fine, while Section 8(b) (5) does include several express standards, does not detract from the N.L.R.B.\u2019s authority under 8(b) (1) (A). <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers Union, 364 U. S. 573, 582-583, 81 S.Ct. 330, 5 L.Ed.2d 302 (1961). \u201cExperience and common sense will supply the grounds for the performance of this job,\u201d which we have concluded was implicitly entrusted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>Congress to the Board. 364 U.S. at 583, 81 S.Ct. at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-3\">The Board must remember that a fine imposed for the violation of a legitimate union rule should be viewed as presumptively protective, and therefore privileged, when the amount of the fine, taking into account the character and importance of the ends served by the rule being enforced, is reasonably related to the need for protection. On the other hand, if the amount of the fine is such as to be inordinately disproportionate to the needed protection, an inference is warranted that the fine was imposed upon the member, not in vindication of a legitimate union interest, but rather as a reprisal for his having exercised a statutorily protected right. In the latter situation, as we have previously indicated, the fine would be \u201ccoercive\u201d within the meaning of Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act. In determining whether an imposed fine is privileged or prohibited, due to its size, many factors may properly be considered by the Board. We shall mention several obvious factors which might be considered on remand, along with others the Board may consider to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">The reasonableness of a fine would necessarily have to be determined in light of the circumstances- leading to its imposition. Such factors as the compensation received by the strikebreakers, the level of strike benefits made available to the striking employees, the individual needs of the persons being disciplined, the detrimental effect of the strikebreaking upon the effectiveness of the strike effort, the length of time of the work stoppage, the strength of the particular union involved, the availability of other less harsh union remedies, and many other similar considerations would clearly be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-14\"> One additional consideration is worthy of mention. In its original <em>Scofield </em>decision, 145 NLRB 1097, 1104 (1964), the Board expressly indicated that a union had no right to impose any penalty which would \u201cimpair the member\u2019s status as an employee.\u201d This prohibition against union disciplinary action adversely affecting an employee\u2019s employment status has been approved by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 195, 87 S.Ct. 2001; Scofield v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 423, 428, 89 S.Ct. 1154. While this principle clearly prohibits a union from seeking the suspension or termination of an employee by his employer due to his strikebreaking,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> its implications may have further application which might be relevant to the present case. Where a disciplinary fine is unreasonably excessive, it may possibly affect the employee\u2019s employment status as adversely \u2014 and possibly even more adversely \u2014 as an illegally obtained employment suspension. On remand, the Board might also consider this protective policy of the Act in determining the reasonableness of the fines in question under Section 8(b) (1) (A).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\"><em>Labor Board Remedy </em>Although we are remanding this case to the N.L.R.B. for further consideration of the reasonableness question, it is apparent that the other aspects of the Board\u2019s decision below should be immediately affirmed. As was noted earlier in this opinion, the cease and desist order prohibiting further Union action pertaining to post-resignation strikebreaking conduct is granted enforcement. A more difficult question arises with respect to the affirmative aspects of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">\u201cIn \u00a7 10(c) of the Act<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Congress has given the Board broad power to fashion remedies to effectuate the policies of the Labor Act. So long as the Board exercises responsibility in its judgment, courts should not interfere with its remedy, since this is \u2018peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u2019 Phelps-Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, at 194, [61 S.Ct. 845, at 852, 85 L.Ed. 1271] . . . (1941).\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> \u201cThe Board\u2019s power to fashion remedies places a premium upon agency expertise and experience, and the broad discretion involved is for the agency and not the court to exercise.\u201d Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. N.L.R.B., 125 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 281, 371 F.2d 740, 746 (1966).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">With these considerations in mind, we clearly must affirm that part of the Board\u2019s order which requires the Union to reimburse the approximately 35 employees who apologized and pledged loyalty, thereby obtaining a reduction in their respective penalties, for any amounts paid which were based upon post-resignation strikebreaking earnings.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We similarly affirm that portion of the order requiring the total reimbursement of any fines paid by employees who effectively resigned before engaging in any strikebreaking activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">With respect to the Board\u2019s order as it relates to the remaining employees who resigned, the Board established a reimbursement formula which pro rated each employee\u2019s respective fine, thereby limiting the collectable portion to that part which reflects the amount Of pre-resignation conduct. It obviously believed that this was the most reasonable manner in which to rectify the effects of the Union\u2019s unfair labor practice with respect to these persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-15\">The utilization of remedial formulas has been approved by the Supreme Court. N.L.R.B. v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 73 S.Ct. 289, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953).

This would include the Union\u2019s effort not only to discipline those employees who had resigned from membership before engaging in any strikebreaking, but also the organization\u2019s imposition of fines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>on those who resigned during the period of their strikebreaking, to the extent that such discipline was imposed as a result of their post-resignation conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">. The fact that the fines imposed upon the employees for conduct undertaken after they had severed their ties with the Union might not have been collectable in a subsequent collection suit, does not detract from the fact of their eoerciveness at the time they were imposed. <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. American Bakery and Confectionery Workers, Local 300, 411 F.2d 1122, 1126 (7th Cir. 1969). <em>See also </em>Local Union No. 167, Progressive Mine Workers of America v. N. L. R.

This result also supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Union fines which were imposed upon the approximately 35 persons who apologized and pledged loyalty, should be confined to 50% of their <em>pre-resignation </em>strikebreaking earnings, since any attempt to enforce the discipline with respect to <em>post-resignation </em>remuneration could be reasonably construed as an effort to punish the very conduct which we have held the Union may not so regulate. \u201cWhile it is true that [the Board\u2019s] retroactive order might afford [these] employees a better position . . . the Board can hardly be said to be effectuating policies beyond the purposes of the Act by resolving the doubt against the party who violated the Act.\u201d Leeds &amp; Northrop Co. v. N. L. R. B., 391 F.2d 874, 880 (3rd Cir. 1968). We therefore grant enforcement to that part of the Board\u2019s order which limits enforcement of such fines to 50% of pre-resignation earnings, which we believe results in the enforcement of a reasonable fine. Similarly, the prohibition against holding Union office, which, with respect to these persons, was calculated on a pro rata basis reflecting the number of strikebreaking days each worked, must necessarily also be restricted so that the length of such prohibitions will only reflect pre-resignation activity. <em>See </em>expanded discussion of the Board\u2019s remedial authority in Part III of this opinion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1213-16\">.

We emphasize the fact that in the instant case, the Union not only threatened to utilize court action to enforce the fines imposed, but in several instances, actual collection suits were begun. Under such circumstances, we believe that the reasonableness of the fines in question is highly relevant to the question of their legality under \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A). We intimate no view regarding the need for an examination of the reasonableness of disciplinary fines where the only enforcement mechanism contemplated by the union involves the expulsion of the individual from the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">. Although the Union has argued that the aggrieved employees should not have the right to have a Board determination concerning the reasonableness of the fines imposed, due to the fact that they have not exhausted all available internal Union remedies, we reject this contention. An individual need not, in all eases, exhaust all internal union procedures before seeking the services of the N. L. R. B. <em>See </em>N. <em>Li. Lt. </em>B. v. Industrial Union of Marine etc. Workers, 391 U.S. 418, 88 S. Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706 (1968); Local 138, International Union of Operating Engineers, 148 NLRB 679 (1964). The imposition of such a requirement in this case concerning the reasonableness issue would not, in our opinion, best serve the interests of justice or further the objectives of the N. L. R. A. The issue here involves public policy and thus transcends the pure internal affairs of the Union. 391 U.S. at 422 \u2014 428, 88 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">. Justice White, in his concurring opinion, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-14\">[S]inee expulsion would in many cases \u2014certainly in this one involving a strong union \u2014 be a far more coercive technique for enforcing a union rule and for collecting a <em>reasonable fine </em>than the threat of court enforcement, there is no basis for thinking that Congress, having accepted expulsion as a permissible technique to enforce a rule in derogation of \u00a7 7 rights, nevertheless intended to bar enforcement by another method [court action] which may be far less coercive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-17\">388 U.S. at 198, 87 S.Ct. at 2016 (emphasis supplied). It is also informative to note the express interpretation given to the <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>opinion by the dissenting members of the Court: \u201c[T]he Court\u2019s holding boils down to this: a court-enforced <em>reasonable fine </em>for nonpar-ticipation in a strike does not \u2018restrain or coerce\u2019 an employee in the exercise of his right not to participate in the strike.\u201d 388 U.S. at 200-201, 87 S.Ct. at 2017 (dissenting opinion of Black, J.)
