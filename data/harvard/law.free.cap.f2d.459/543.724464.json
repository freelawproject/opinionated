Mrs. Bodin was represented by the Office of the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands. Defendant responded to the petition by denying any paternal relationship with the child. The case then was removed to the district court where, after the court overruled defendant\u2019s legal objections, the jury found that defendant was the father of the child. On the basis of this finding, the court entered the judgment for support from which the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">Defendant does not contest the jury\u2019s finding of paternity or the reasonableness of the amount of support allowed. Instead, his appeal rests on two independent contentions raised in the district court at the outset of those proceedings, namely, that regardless of paternity: (1) the court was without jurisdiction to act on Mrs. Bodin\u2019s petition since she was not a \u201cresident\u201d of the Islands as required by \u00a7 291(a); and (2) assuming jurisdiction, the applicable statute of limitations barred the maintenance by Mrs. Bodin of any action against the defendant for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Defendant first contests the district court\u2019s ruling that Mrs. Bodin was a \u201cresident\u201d of the Virgin Islands within the' meaning of that term in \u00a7 291(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court has noted that the term \u201cresident\u201d has no precise meaning. See Willenbrock v. Rogers, 255 F.2d 236, 237 (3d Cir. 1958); United States v. Stabler, 169 F.2d 995, 998 (3d Cir. 1948). See generally Restatement of Conflicts of Law 2d, \u00a7 9(e). Rather, its definition varies with each statutory usage. See 28 C.J.S. Domicile \u00a7 2b. We have been presented with only one case purporting to interpret \u201cresident\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 291(a). In Government of the Virgin Islands v. Bradshaw, 6 V.I. 386, 390 (1968), the Municipal Court concluded in dictum that \u201cactual presence in an established home, whether for a definite or indefinite period of time, [was] sufficient.\u201d Defendant contends that this standard is incorrect as a matter of law. We cannot agree. Indeed, it is recognized that residence may be taken to indicate merely one\u2019s momentary factual place of abode. See I Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 10.3(135). Therefore, we sustain the district court\u2019s conclusion that the residency requirement of \u00a7 291(a) was satisfied by Mrs. Bodin\u2019s proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>physical presence in the Islands coupled with her intent to remain there for a measurable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The district court found that Mrs. Bodin filed her petition personally five months prior to trial. And as of the date of the hearing she had been living in the Islands continuously for approximately four months. Defendant is quick to point out the lack of proof demonstrating that Mrs. Bodin intended to continue her Virgin Islands residency once the trial proceedings concluded. However, such evidence would have bordered on pi\u2019oof of domicile or indefinite residency and was not neeessaiy to sustain the court\u2019s conclusion that it had jurisdiction under \u00a7 291(a) as properly construed. On the basis of the facts as found by the district court we cannot find error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Bodin was a resident of the Virgin Islands under \u00a7 291(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Defendant\u2019s second contention requires further development of the factual background of this litigation. The son for whom Mrs. Bodin seeks support was born on September 22, 1958, in Aruba, Netherlands Antilles. At this time both defendant and Mrs. Bodin were living there. In 1966 defendant moved to the Virgin Islands and the evidence would have justified the jury in finding that between the date of the child\u2019s birth and the date of Mrs. Bo-din\u2019s petition defendant contributed sporadically toward the child\u2019s support. Defendant contends that the action for support arose in Aruba and that its five-year statute of limitations is controlling. The Aruban statute provides that a claim for support filed on behalf of an illegitimate child \u201cexpires after five years, starting to count from the day on which the child is born. . . .\u201d The district court agreed that this provision was applicable. Nevertheless, it concluded that, despite the lapse of over eleven years between the child\u2019s birth and the filing of Mi's. Bodin\u2019s petition, her cause of action alleging defendant\u2019s paternity was timely since it did not \u201carise\u201d until defendant for the first time denied paternity in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">We agree that Mrs. Bodin\u2019s petition was timely. However, our conclusion is based on reasoning different than that adopted by the district court. We do not believe that the Aruban statute of limitations controlled Mrs. Bodin\u2019s action under \u00a7 291(a) to any extent. Rather, we think that her petition seeking future child support involved consideration solely of Virgin Islands law. The parental obligation to provide child support is a continuing one and is transitory in the sense that it follows the parents throughout the period of years while their child remains within the scope of any applicable support statute. Here, Mrs. Bodin maintained her action exclusively under \u00a7 291(a). And, as a \u201cresident\u201d of the Islands she was entitled to institute support proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Assuming without deciding that the Aruban statute of limitations would have barred Mrs. Bodin\u2019s action in Aruba, it did not prevent consideration of defendant\u2019s paternity by the Virgin Islands courts for purposes of awarding child support under \u00a7 291(a). The sole basis presented by defendant for invoking the Aruban statute was 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 41, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">\u201cWhen the cause of action has arisen in any State, Commonwealth, territory, or country between nonresidents of the Virgin Islands, and by the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or country where the cause of action arose an action cannot be maintained thereon by reason of the lapse of time, no action shall be maintained thereon in the Virgin Islands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZe\">Mrs. Bodin\u2019s cause of action under \u00a7 291(a) did not \u201carise\u201d until after her arrival in the Virgin Islands. And, at the time she filed her petition for future support for the child, defendant clearly was a resident of the Islands.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>V.I.C., \u00a7 41 here has no application and, consequently, the Aruban statute of limitations does not apply. Since defendant does not contend that any applicable Virgin Islands statute of limitations barred Mrs. Bodin\u2019s petition, we conclude that the district court properly determined that her action was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-13\">. \u201c(a) Proceedings under <em>this </em>chapter may be instituted by any female resident of the Virgin Islands who has delivered an illegitimate child or who is pregnant with a child which, if born alive, would be illegitimate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">.

She does happen to be here within the jurisdiction physically. So for the time being, she is residing here and has been so residing for the past few months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The majority approve this finding, but add the gloss that the district court also found an \u201cintent to remain there for a measurable period of time.\u201d The district court found, and it is not controverted, that at the time of trial, Mrs. Bodin had been \u201cso residing for the past few months.\u201d I find no reference by the district court to the critical issue of intent. Although I agree there are no chronological limitations in order to qualify as a resident, either temporary or permanent, that which distinguishes mere physical presence in a community from residence therein, is intention. An airline stewardess who intends to remain overnight in St. Thomas is not a female resident of the Virgin Islands. If she intends to stay two weeks or one month for a vacation, she still has not transferred her visitor status to that of resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Mrs. Bodin came to the Virgin Islands from Sweden, filed this paternity suit, and then departed. Later she returned to await trial. Thereafter, she departed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">The Virgin Islands statute requires that the proceedings \u201cbe <em>instituted </em>by any female resident.\u201d Thus, the critical issue was the status of Mrs. Bodin at the time she instituted the proceedings, not at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">I find that the decision of the district court was predicated solely upon (1) her physical presence in the Islands, and (2) the fact that she was living there for a \u201cfew months\u201d prior to trial. This was not sufficient to qualify Mrs. Bodin as a \u201cfemale resident\u201d under the statute without an additional finding and supportive evidence that at the time she instituted the proceeding she intended to be a resident, whether temporary or permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">Because I find no jurisdiction, I would vacate the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
