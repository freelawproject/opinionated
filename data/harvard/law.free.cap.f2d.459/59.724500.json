ROSINSKI, Petitioner-Appellant, v. UNITED STATES of America, Respondent-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b117-6\">No. 71-2005.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b117-7\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b117-8\">May 5, 1972.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-13\">James C.

His petition was denied by the District Court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">Rosinski was represented in the original criminal case by retained counsel. Following conviction, he was advised by the court of his right to appeal. According to his verified petition, he informed counsel of his desire to appeal. Upon learning that Rosinski\u2019s funds had been exhausted, counsel informed him that the court would appoint counsel for him and would forward the necessary papers to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-20\">Trial counsel did nothing to perfect the appeal, but assured Rosinski that all was proceeding according to the rules, informing him by letter that the court \u201cwas going to allow you to file the necessary papers for a timely appeal . . . [and] that the necessary papers had been mailed to you.\u201d Under these circumstances, failure of counsel to perfect an appeal amounts to ineffective assistance. <em>See </em>Woodall v. Neil, 444 F.2d 92 (6th Cir. 1971); Goodwin v. Cardwell, 432 F.2d 521 (6th Cir. 1970); Benoit v. Wingo, 423 F.2d 880 (6th Cir. 1970). Although these cases involved habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners, we perceive no reason to apply a different rule in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-22\">Accordingly, the District Court is directed to grant petitioner\u2019s motion, vacate the sentence imposed, and resen-tence petitioner on the original conviction in order to start the time for appeal running again. The District Court at the time of resentencing will again in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>struct Rosinski of his right to appeal in accordance with R. 32(a) (2), Fed.R. Crim.P. If Rosinski so requests, the Clerk of the District Court shall prepare and file a timely notice of appeal on his behalf. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Smith, 387 F.2d 268 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
