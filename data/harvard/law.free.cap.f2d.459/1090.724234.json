The facts, as found by the district court and supported by substantial evidence, are set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>Plaintiff, a Florida corporation, is a manufacturer and seller of golf equipment. In 1968, plaintiff began advertising its specialized Bomann Bomber golf club in several golf magazines and thereafter sold Bombers to more than 600 golf pros and country clubs. Pursuant to a mail order campaign already begun, in December, 1969, plaintiff contacted defendant Dynaflyte Corporation, a mail order house primarily engaged in selling golf equipment, through its chief executive officer, defendant Silver, in order to gain access to a larger mailing list. Through this contact, Dynaflyte and plaintiff embarked on what the district court found to be a joint venture based in Florida to sell Bombers by mail order, using Bomann advertising materials on Dynaflyte stationery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">In June, 1970, Dynaflyte, after a period of cooperative efforts with Bomann, mailed circulars advertising a \u201cmystery\u201d Bomber based on material identical to that in the Bomann advertisements. From this mailing, Dynaflyte received some 6,000 orders which it sought to fill through another manufacturer. Dyna-flyte soon began receiving complaints that these new Bombers were of inferior quality and was eventually forced to send an apology letter to its customers explaining that the \u201cmystery\u201d manufacturer was at fault. Many of these \u201cmystery\u201d circulars and letters went to the same persons who had previously received the Bomann material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">The district court, after a five-day ev-identiary hearing, enjoined Dynaflyte from further use of Bomann\u2019s advertising materials and prohibited its filling further orders for \u201cBombers\u201d with any golf club other than the original Bo-mann Bomber on grounds that defendants\u2019 practices were harming plaintiff\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">Defendants first urge that the service of process was defective under Florida law. Suit was filed on February 5, 1971. On February 6, 1971, plaintiff mailed a copy of the complaint and a court summons to the Florida Secretary of State. On the same day, plaintiff sent a copy of these documents to each defendant along with a Notice of Service advising defendants that process had been served on the Secretary of State that same day by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">Defendants first argue that under the Florida statute plaintiff was required to personally serve, rather than mail, the process papers to the Secretary of State. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 48.161, F.S.A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not necessary to rule on this point inasmuch as defendants failed to allege this defect before the trial court prior to appeal. We, therefore, have no choice but to deem the alleged defect waived. <em>See </em>Marston v. American Employers Insurance Company, 1st Cir. 1971, 439 F. 2d 1035; Guardian Title Company v. Sulmeyer, 9th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">Secondly, defendants allege that notice of <em>actual </em>service on the Secretary of State was required. The old Florida nonresident service statute provided that service on the Secretary of State would be sufficient <em>\u201cprovided, </em>that notice of <em>such </em>service and a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>process are forthwith sent\u201d to the defendant. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 47.30. In Conway v. Spence, 119 So.2d 426 (Fla.App.1960), involving facts similar to the instant case, the Florida court held that mailing the papers to defendants before <em>actual </em>service on the Secretary of State was insufficient. <em>See also </em>Green Manor Construction Company v. Punta Gorda Ready Mix Concrete, 159 So.2d 255 (Fla.App.1964). This statute, however, was repealed in 1967 by Fla.Stat. \u00a7 48.161, F.S.A., which provides simply that service may be made on the Secretary of State. The statute then provides, \u201cNotice of service . . . shall be sent forthwith\u201d to defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The district court held that the omission of the words \u201cprovided\u201d and \u201csuch\u201d from the original statute had the effect of overruling <em>Conway </em>and making plaintiff\u2019s service sufficient in the instant case. This was based on the district court\u2019s reasoning that personal service under \u00a7 48.161 is no longer a technical requirement for sufficiency of service; rather it is a procedural due process requirement, which was fulfilled in the instant ease by actual notice to defendants. There are no Florida cases as yet construing Section 48.161 in this regard. In light of the great weight to be given the determination of local law by the district court in diversity cases and our own belief in the reasoning of the district court\u2019s opinion, we find no error in this construction. <em>See </em>Vaughn v. Chrysler Corporation, 10th Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 619; Delduca v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, 5th Cir. 1966, 357 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>F.2d 204; Hogue v. Pellerin Laundry Machinery Sales Company, 8th Cir. 1965, 353 F.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Defendants further argue that the district court erred in finding that they had the minimal contacts in Florida necessary for the district court\u2019s maintaining jurisdiction over their persons and that the district court had no discretion to enter an injunction under the facts as presented. Both allegations clearly are without merit. <em>See </em>Local Rule 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">. <em>See also </em>Miami National Bank v. Realty Equities Corp., 35 Fla.Supp. 178 (Cir. Ct. Dade County, June 9, 1971). This defect in the statute has been cured as of January 1, 1972 by an amendment to Section 48.161, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-9\">Section 1. Subsection (1) of Section 48.161, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-10\">48.161 Method of substituted service on non-resident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-11\">(1) When authorized by law, substituted service of process on a nonresident or a person who conceals his whereabouts by serving a public officer designated by law shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with a fee of $2.00 with the public officer or in his office <em>or by mailing the copies by certified mail to the public officer with the fee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-17\">*1* ik -i5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-18\">Section 2.

Sess. 1075 (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 47.30 provided as follows: Method of service upon nonresident.\u2014 Service of such process shall be made by the plaintiff or his attorney by either leaving a copy of the process with a fee of two dollars ($2.00) in the hands of the secretary of state, or in his office, or by mailing a copy of such process with a fee of two dollars ($2.00) to the secretary of state; and such service shall be sufficient service upon a defendant who has appointed the secretary of state as his agent for the service of such process; provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the process are forthwith sent by registered mail by the plaintiff, or his attorney, to the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s return receipt and the affidavit of the plaintiff, or his attorney, of compliance herewith are filed with the papers in the ease on or before the return day of the process or within such further time as the court may allow, or that such notice and copy are served upon the defendant, if found within the state, by an officer duly qualified to serve legal process, or, if found without the state, by a sheriff or deputy sheriff of any county of this state or by any duly constituted public officer qualified to serve like process in the state or jurisdiction where the defendant is found; and the officer\u2019s return showing such service to have been made is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process or within such further time as the court may allow.

Notice of service and a copy of the process shall be sent forthwith by registered or certified mail by the plaintiff or his attorney to the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s return receipt and the affidavit of the plaintiff or his attorney of compliance herewith, filed on or before the return day of the process or within such time as the court allows, or the notice and copy shall be served on the defendant, if found within the state, by an officer authorized to serve legal process, or, if found without the state, by a sheriff or deputy sheriff of any county of this state or by any duly constituted public officer qualified to serve like process in the state or jurisdiction where the defendant is found. The officer\u2019s returns showing service to have been made shall be filed on or before <em>the </em>return day of the process or within such time as the court may allow.
