On June 22, 1970, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first degree murder count, fifteen years to life on the second degree murder count, and ten years to life on the armed robbery count, all sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Appellant\u2019s conviction arose from an attempted robbery of a Safeway store on September 16, 1969, when an armed man entered the store, confronted a security guard, struggled with him, and finally shot and killed the guard before making his escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-17\">One Owens testified that on the day of the shooting he was employed with another carpenter to install a turnstile at the Safeway store. Owens related that he saw the struggle between the guard and robber, went to the guard\u2019s aid by hitting the gunman on the back of the head with a hammer, and then took refuge outside of the store. He stated that he had taken a good look at the gunman while inside the store and then again while outside, from a distance of about three to five feet, under good lighting conditions, for a period of three to four minutes. Wilbert Lee testified that he had known appellant for a period of two years because they had at one time been incarcerated together. He testified that he had seen appellant near the entrance to the Safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>way store on the day in question. Soon thereafter, he heard two shots and saw appellant flee from the store, bleeding from his head and carrying a gun. Lee then entered the store and saw the victim lying on the floor. Later that night he saw appellant standing outside a restaurant. Appellant inquired whether Lee wanted to buy a pistol for $40, but he did not indicate from where he had obtained the weapon. At the time of his testimony, Lee himself was being prosecuted for robbery. Lieutenant Robert M. Boyd of the Homicide Squad told the jury that when arrested on October 8, 1969, appellant had a band aid on the left rear of his head, covering a freshly healed three-fourths inch laceration. Aside from the purported admission of appellant next mentioned, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the appellant was the armed man.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">When the ease was first called, the following exchange took place out of the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-5\">\u201cMR. BONNER [Defense Counsel]: In this particular case, having spoken to the defendant, I think it would be well to have the defendant address the Court out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. \u201cDEFENDANT ROBINSON: How</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-7\">are you doing, Your Honor? The lawyer came to start the trial, but he has never told me, only about a year and I feel personally I am not ready to start trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I can\u2019t understand the words you are speaking. Did you get that, Mr. Reporter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-11\">\u201c(Record read.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-13\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROBINSON: I feel this way, because like he has never really talked to me on the grounds, you know, as far as how he is setting up this defense concerning my case. I feel I am going in blind, you know, just going to start this trial, although personally I know I am guilty. I know the consequences of the trial. I know the time involved \u2014 I would like to confer, to go over with him this case, you know, really get the trial together. Really, I don\u2019t know what he has in mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-14\">The admission of this statement into evidence before the jury created the decisive problem in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-15\">Before admitting the statement the court, out of the jury\u2019s presence, gave appellant an opportunity for explanation. Appellant claimed that he had meant to say that he was innocent. The court ruled: \u201cIt is clearly an admission. . . . It is admissions or conclusions against the party making them. I will permit him to explain to the jury what he meant by that.\u201d The jury was then brought in and the court stated: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is an official transcript of what transpired in this Court this morning when the case was first called.\u201d The record containing appellant\u2019s statement was then read to the jury by the reporter. Thereafter, defense counsel questioned appellant about the statement. Appellant testified that he had meant to say that he was innocent but because of his nervousness had misstated his thoughts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The goveim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>ment attorney placed a great deal of emphasis on appellant\u2019s statement, referring to it a number of times in his final summation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Appellant contends that the court erred in allowing the pre-trial statement to be introduced into evidence during the trial. This contention is based on appellant\u2019s right to remain silent, the necessity of expressly waiving this right, and an alleged conflict between appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and his right to have effective counsel under the Sixth Amendment. For reasons to be discussed below, we agree that the admission of the statement into evidence before the jury constituted prejudicial error and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The phrase \u201calthough personally I know I am guilty\u201d is somewhat unique. It was not a typical admission obviously intended to concede or establish an element of the crime or the presence or absence of a needed fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It hardly appears to be a confession since there was no identification of any particular offense referred to in the statement and appellant clearly intended to have a jury trial on the merits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of all of the specific charges with which he was confronted. Nor can it be considered a plea of guilty for similar as well as other obvious reasons. Yet in practical effect as far as the jury was concerned the statement likely partook of the nature of all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">It has been stated that the distinctions between confessions and admissions are \u201csubtle and questionable\u201d. People v. Chessman, 52 Cal.2d 467, 341 P.2d 679 (1959). The United States Supreme Court has indicated that admissions should receive the same cautious treatment accorded confessions. Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954). With this similarity in mind and the statement occurring as it did in the course of judicial proceedings before the judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>its examination in the light of standards applicable to confessions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and pleas of guilty<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">It is universally recognized, that a confession of a person accused of a crime may be admissible in evidence against the accused only if it was freely and voluntarily made, without duress, fear, or compulsion in its inducement and with knowledge of its nature and possible consequences. United States v. Carignan, 342 U.S. 36, 72 S.Ct. 97, 96 L.Ed. 48 (1951). \u201c[T]he term \u2018voluntary\u2019 means that the confession must be the product of the defendant\u2019s own judgment and operation of his own mind, uninfluenced by methods and devices which are denounced by law or by any extraneous disturbing cause which deprives him of his free will and volition.\u201d 29 Am. Jur.2d Evidence \u00a7 543, 595 (1970). Federal law commands that the trial judge shall \u201cout of the presence of the jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness\u201d of a confession. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 (1970). A \u201cconfession\u201d is defined as \u201cany confession of guilt of any criminal offense or any self-incriminating statement made or given orally or in writing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (e). The trial judge in determining the issue of volun-tariness \u201cshall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">Viewing the circumstances surrounding the \u201cadmission\u201d in the instant case, we find appellant speaking to the trial court in order to obtain more time to prepare his defense and to consult with his counsel. It seems unreasonable to assume that he had a knowledgeable and intentional purpose to confess the crimes charged, or any of them, challenging as he was his counsel\u2019s diligence in preparing defense in furtherance of the pleas of not guilty. Appellant\u2019s explanation as a slip of the tongue appears more reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\"> Even if appellant had intended the statement as a confession of his guilt, it was still improperly admitted. There is no indication in the record that appellant had knowingly and intentionally waived his right against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the appellant made the statement \u201calthough personally I know I am guilty\u201d he appeared to be incriminating himself; there is no indication that he had waived his right to remain silent. A waiver \u201cis ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Concerning waiver, this court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-5\">\u201cAs with the right of counsel, waiver of the privilege [Fifth Amendment self-incrimination] must be informed and intelligent. There can be no waiver if the defendants do not know their rights. The rule must be the same, we think, when the record is silent or inconclusive concerning knowledge. Basic constitutional protections, especially in criminal cases, should not be suspended by mere inferences from indifferent facts or doubtful presumptions, whether of law or of fact. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">Wood v. United States, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 286, 128 F.2d 265, 277 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Appellant argues that when the court agreed to hear appellant \u201cout of the presence of the jury\u201d it impliedly indicated that any statement made by the appellant would not be used against him in court. Whether this implication be valid or not, the fact remains that the record fails to disclose that appellant was aware that by personally speaking to the court he was waiving his Fifth Amendment protection against the use to his prejudice of any statement he might make. In fact, the record is barren of any indication that he was advised, either before or during the pretrial hearing, of his constitutional right to remain silent<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the possible use against him before the jury of any statement he might make to the court out of the presence of the jury. The totality of circumstances strongly suggests lack of any waiver; it would seem that any waiver could be found at best only from \u201cmere inferences from indifferent facts or doubtful presumptions\u201d. Wood v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">It is again evident that appellant\u2019s statement made at the pre-trial hearing should not have been admitted in the jury trial in view of established principles governing the acceptance of guilty pleas before the court. Although pre-trial factual \u201cadmissions\u201d out of court are generally admissible at the trial, in-court statements not intended for the jury should be allowed into evidence only when procedures developed to insure their considered and voluntary nature have been followed. By having his statement in the nature of a plea of guilty introduced into evidence at the jury trial, appellant was in the worst possible position. Had he pled guilty in the usual manner he would have been entitled to judicial inquiry concerning his knowledge of the crime, the waiver of his constitutional rights, the voluntariness of the plea, and consequences of the plea.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Had he later applied for and been granted permission to withdraw his plea, the withdrawn plea could not have been used in evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">Appellant argues also that by the admission of his pre-trial statement he was unlawfully compelled to surrender his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to assert his Sixth Amendment right to adequate representation. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s testimony in support of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds may not be used against him on the issue of guilt, Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), it seems not yet to have directly resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>such possible conflicts between Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The record before us does not sufficiently present such a problem as to warrant our further discussion of it. The appellant really was not compelled to do anything. One of the main difficulties of the attorney was an overspeaking client.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Although admission of the pre-trial statement by itself requires reversal, appellant\u2019s second and third grounds for reversal will be noted since one touches upon the record relevant to the statement and the other throws into question the representation of the defendant by appointed counsel by reason of which as above noted appellant says he was required personally to address the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">It is contended that the failure of the court reporter to supply him with a complete transcript of the proceedings violates federal law and thus in and of itself requires a new trial. The reporter\u2019s failure to' supply a full transcript resulted from the theft of the reporter\u2019s notes covering the first day of trial. The reporter was, however, able to transcribe a tape recording made on that day except for eleven bench conferences, seven inaudible omissions, and several garbled passages. After the appeal was noted, appellant moved this court for summary reversal on the ground that the defective transcript was such as to deprive appellant of an effective appeal. By <em>per curiam, </em>order, a motions division of this court denied appellant\u2019s motion without prejudice to resubmission of the issue on appeal and with an order directing the parties to make an effort to settle the record. Pursuant to this order a supplemental hearing was held by the trial judge in an attempt to reconstruct the proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Reporting of criminal trials in the federal district courts is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b) (1970) which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-10\">\u201cOne of the reporters appointed for each such [district] court shall attend at each session of the court . and shall record verbatim by shorthand or by mechanical means which may be augmented by electronic sound recording . . . (1) all proceedings in criminal cases had in open court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">The term \u201cproceedings\u201d has been said to include voir dire examination of the jury, evidentiary presentations before the judge or jury, bench conferences, and arguments of counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-13\">Appellant relies upon United States v. Workcuff, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 422 F.2d 700 (1970). In that case a jury instruction had been given in the absence of the court reporter. Even though the prosecutor submitted his notes of what he believed the court had said, this court held that the notes were not a sufficient record since neither trial counsel had any independent recollection of the instruction\u2019s content nor could either side recall whether defense counsel had made any objections to it. We stressed in <em>Workcuff </em>that exceptions to the Court Reporter Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 (b) (1970) <em>supra) </em>should be narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>applied. We reaffirm this view; but there are factors in the case at bar which render the transcript problem of lesser impact than in <em>Workcuff. </em>There was a court reporter present in the case at bar during all times in question and presumably he recorded \u201cverbatim by shorthand or by mechanical means . all proceedings\u201d. The mandatory language of the statute may have been at least literally complied with unlike the failure in <em>Workcuff </em>to have a court reporter present during the jury instruction. It is clear again, however, that a stilted interpretation of the reach of the statute could defeat its very purpose \u2014 to make available to litigants, their attorneys, and the court when needed an accurate record of the proceedings, to remove uncertainty and speculation and to protect the rights of litigants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet in the limited context of this case we are not prepared to hold that every inability to furnish complete reporter transcripts upon request is necessarily reversible error, especially in cases such as this where the unavailability of the transcript is not shown to have been the fault of either the court, the government, or the reporter and where a fair review upon appeal has not been frustrated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Although it is unfortunate that gaps existed in the record, the only ones critical to the points raised on appeal are some testimony and bench conferences regarding the pre-trial statement above discussed. There is still a sufficient record regarding this issue to permit full and considered appraisal on review, and for this purpose the reconstructed record may not be thought unacceptable within boundaries now seemingly approved by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">Appellant\u2019s final point is that he was denied his constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to the effective assistance of counsel. In support of this contention appellant cites several examples of alleged incompetency: the failure of counsel to restrain appellant from addressing the court; the failure of counsel to object to the procedure employed during the in-court lineup; and the interrogation by counsel of appellant concerning past offenses. After careful review of the record we conclude that this point of appellant is not meritorious. At the time appellant addressed the court he was seeking a continuance with an implied criticism of his counsel in order that he might better prepare his defense. Had counsel prevented appellant from speaking he might have been, or might have been accused of being, in the position of protecting himself from appellant\u2019s charges and thus concealing from the court ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>pellant\u2019s viewpoint concerning counsel\u2019s preparation. While precautions could well have been taken against such a statement as his client made \u2014 and the record really does not preclude the possibility that attempts to do so were made \u2014 yet any failure here may have been no less that of the court than of counsel; probably neither was bound to anticipate that such an unusual statement would be made by the appellant. Other claims of ineffectiveness on the part of counsel relate rather to tactical judgments and are not deemed substantial. It seems sufficient to observe that notwithstanding diligent efforts during the demands and exigencies of a trial it frequently occurs both before and after-wards that counsel\u2019s as well as his client\u2019s \u201clot is not a happy one\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">. We find it unnecessary to discuss various collateral arguments or questions concerning the validity or persuasion of the identification which appellant advances in his brief in support of his claims that his counsel was ineffective and which we regard as going purely to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">. \u201cQ.

For example, in a case relied upon by the Government for supporting the statement, the admission in that case concerned the factual location of the appellant at the scene of the robbery.

During the days of March 11, 12, and 15, 1971, the trial judge conducted hearings in open court. Present at those hearings were appellant\u2019s trial counsel, the trial prosecutor, the court reporter, appellant\u2019s counsel on this appeal, and on the latter two days appellant himself. Appellant was not present on March 11 because through inadvertence no one had arranged for him to be brought up from the jail. His appellate counsel, however, waived appellant\u2019s presence with the agreement that the hearing would deal only with the untranscribed bench conferences. Court and counsel worked through the transcript, giving their recollections of the bench conferences, exploring those portions of the record which were inaudible, and attempting to fill in any other gaps which existed on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">.
