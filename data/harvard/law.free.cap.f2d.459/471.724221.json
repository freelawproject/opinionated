Delgado claims that the only witness who testified to his possession and negotiation of the check which was the basis for two of the four counts was incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>to do so, lacking personal knowledge of the transaction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The witness, Albert Cohen, testified that he received the U. S. Treasury check for $126.82, payable to Mike and Casilda Morales, from his delivery man, to whom Delgado had given it in payment for merchandise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The check bore several endorsements, the last of which was \u201cBlackie,\u201d appellant\u2019s nickname.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cohen, a fruit and vegetable wholesaler, testified that it was routine practice in his business to require the delivery men to accept no checks in payment for goods unless either the customer or the employee wrote the former\u2019s name on the reverse of the check. Given this habit or custom of the business, appellant\u2019s name on the check was circumstantial evidence of negotiation by him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> United States v. Oddo, 314 F.2d 115, 117 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 833, 84 S.Ct. 50, 11 L.Ed.2d 63 (1963); McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 162 at 343.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">We note that even were the convictions on the two counts deriving from this transaction reversed, the resentencing which appellant requests would not be appropriate. His twelve-month sentence was well within the statutory maximum of five years under section 1708 and ten years under section 495. In light of the numerous transactions in stolen cheeks, extending over a considerable length of time, revealed by the evidence, this court is \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d that the absence of these two counts would not have affected appellant\u2019s sentence. United States v. Febre, 425 F.2d 107 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 849, 91 S.Ct. 40, 27 L.Ed.2d 87 (1970); United States v. Marino, 421 F.2d 640 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\">. Delgado was sentenced to a twelve-month term of imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. We have jurisdiction to review a challenge to conviction on two of the counts despite the concurrent nature of the sentences. Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\">. Casilda Morales testified that she expected the tax refund cheek but never received it nor authorized anyone to sign her name to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">. The address of Delgado\u2019s store was also written on the check.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">. Cohen also testified that the check was returned from the bank unpaid and that he then asked Delgado for reimbursement, which the latter agreed to provide. Although there was some doubt about whether this check was the subject of that conversation, as Cohen did not show Delgado a photocopy of the check when requesting payment and as another of Delgado\u2019s checks had previously \u201cbounced,\u201d the jury could have found that the Morales check was the item being discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">. In addition, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732, the name on the check is admissible as a business record of the transaction \u201cif [it was] made in regular course of business, and if it was the regular course of such business to make such . . . record. .\u201d The maker of the record need not testify if, as here, the trustworthiness of the evidence is established through testimony about the business practice in general and the fact that this record in particular was made as part of that routine. Cullen v. United States, 408 F.2d 1178 (8th Cir.1969); United States v. Dawson, 400 F.2d 194, 198-199 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1023, 89 S.Ct. 632, 21 L.Ed.2d 567 (1969); United States v. Re, 336 F.2d 306 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 904, 85 S.Ct. 188, 13 L.Ed.2d 177 (1964). The endorsement on the .check is also therefore under the statute evidence which the trier could consider of negotiation by Delgado.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
