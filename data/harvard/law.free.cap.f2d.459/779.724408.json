The challenge relies on (1) the Seventh Amendment, (2) F.R.Civ.P. 48, and (3) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072. We uphold the validity of the local rule. See Colgrove v. Battin, 9 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 1379 rejecting similar attacks on a local rule adopted by the District Court for the District of Montana providing that, \u201cA jury for the trial of civil cases shall consist of six persons . . . See also Devitt, The Six Man Jury in the Federal Court, 53 F.R.D. 273 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The plaintiff-appellant, Mrs. Lois Cooley brought a diversity suit on behalf of herself and her minor children for damages resulting from the death of her husband. The case was tried to a six-member jury over the objection of all parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a nine-day trial, the jury found for the defendants. Mrs. Cooley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">The appellant argues, first, that the local rule making the six-member jury mandatory in \u201call civil jury cases\u201d deprives her of her Seventh Amendment \u201cright to trial by jury\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We cannot agree. We hold that the twelve-member panel is not a necessary requirement of \u201cthe right of trial by jury\u201d in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">In Williams v. Florida, 1970, 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446, the petitioner challenged the constitutionality of a Florida statute providing that \u201csix men shall constitute a jury to try all . . . criminal cases [except capital cases]\u201d. The Supreme Court rejected the challenge and held that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, were not violated by Florida\u2019s decision to provide a six-man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>rather than a 12-man jury\u201d. 399 U.S. at 103, 90 S.Ct. at 1907. The Court\u2019s consideration of the jury trial right in <em>Williams </em>was in the context of a discussion of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court therefore added a caveat to its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arm-dedup-0\">[W]e do not decide whether, for example, additional references to the \u201ccommon law\u201d that occur in the Seventh Amendment might support a different interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">399 U.S. at 92, fn. 30, 90 S.Ct. at 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Despite this caveat, we believe that the applicability of <em>Williams </em>to criminal cases answers the constitutional arguments leveled against the six-member civil jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Justice White pointed out in <em>Williams, </em>in a criminal case \u201c [t] he purpose of the jury trial . . . is to prevent oppression by the Government\u201d. 399 U.S. at 100, 90 S.Ct. at 1905. In a criminal case, because the liberty of the accused is at stake, the jury has always performed a zealously guarded role; a jury insures that, despite the efforts of \u201c \u2018the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and . . . complaint, biased, or eccentric judge\u2019 \u201d, 399 U.S. at 100, 90 S.Ct. at 1905, an accused will not be deprived of his liberty without a judgment by his peers. No such role is performed by a jury in a civil ease where property or damages are at stake. Whatever one considers the role of a civil jury and whatever importance attaches to that role, (see authorities cited in footnote 9), no one has ever contended that the function of the civil jury is <em>more </em>important than that of the criminal jury. Changes in the traditional jury, therefore, such as the change approved in <em>Williams, </em>which do not offend the concept of \u201ctrial by jury\u201d within the context of a criminal case (Sixth Amendment) would not offend that concept within the context of a civil case (Seventh Amendment). It would be anomalous to the point of irrationality to construe the Constitution as sanctioning a six-member criminal jury but not sanctioning a six-member civil jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The Seventh Amendment is textually different from the Sixth Amendment. The Seventh Amendment twice refers to \u201ccommon law\u201d. See footnote 2. We do not find these references determinative of the question of the size of the civil jury. The reference to \u201ccommon law\u201d in the first clause of the Seventh Amendment, the only clause with which we are concerned in the present case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> represents an intention by the Framers to distinguish between cases \u201cin law,\u201d where a jury was traditionally used, and cases in equity and admiralty, where no jury, was used. Parsons v. Bed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ford, 1830, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 433, 445-446, 7 L.Ed. 732, 736-737. The available historical evidence indicates no intention of the Framers of the Bill of Rights to require \u201cthe exact procedural incidents or details of jury trial according to the common law in 1791.\u201d Galloway v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 372, 390, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1087, 87 L.Ed. 1458; Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 289 (1966). See also Ross v. Bernhard, 1970, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729; Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 1899, 174 U.S. 1, 13, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873, 877; Shields v.

Co., D.C.La. 1951, 98 F.Supp. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Even assuming, as the Court does in <em>Williams, </em>that the common law jury in 1791 consisted of twelve members, that number is by no means sacred<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is, as the Court noted, \u201ca historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance \u2018except to mystics.\u2019 \u201d 399 U.S. at 102, 90 S.Ct. at 1907.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Just as the Supreme Court in <em>Williams </em>refused to bind the Sixth Amendment to the twelve-member jury, despite a long line of cases holding that \u201cthe jury referred to in the Amendment was a jury \u2018constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less\u2019 \u201d, 399 U.S. at 90, 90 S.Ct. at 1900,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we refuse to shackle the Seventh Amendment to \u201ca historical accident, unrelated to the great purposes which gave rise to the jury in the first place\u201d. 399 U.S. at 89-90, 90 S.Ct. at 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">The \u201ccommon law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions.\u201d Funk v. United States, 1933, 290 U.S. 371, 54 S. Ct. 212, 78 L.Ed. 369, 376. We may, as the Court did in <em>Williams, </em>consider not only \u201cthe intent of the Framers\u201d but also \u201cthe function that the particular feature performs and its relation to the purposes of the jury trial.\u201d 399 U.S. at 99-100, 90 S.Ct. at 1905. Much has been written, favorable and unfavorable, about the civil jury and reducing the size of the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our task, however, is not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>decide the merits of a twelve-man jury but to decide whether the federal district courts may constitutionally reduce the size of the civil jury. The Supreme Court has asserted that \u201cthe reliability of the jury as a factfinder hardly seems likely to be a function of its size\u201d, 399 U.S. at 100-101, 90 S.Ct. at 1906, and that the six-member jury in the criminal context performs its \u201cfunction\u201d as well as the twelve-member jury. <em>See </em>399 U.S. at 99-102, 90 S.Ct. 1893. We feel compelled to make the same evaluation in a civil context. \u201cThe aim of the [Seventh] amendment . . . is to preserve the substance of the common-law right of trial by jury, as distinguished from mere matters of form or procedure ...\u201d Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line v. Redman, 1935, 295 U.S. 654, 657, 55 S.Ct. 890, 891, 79 L.Ed. 1636, 1638.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-18\">The parties may stipulate that the jury shall consist of any number less than twelve or that a verdict or a finding of a stated majority of the jurors shall be taken as the verdict or finding of the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-19\">The appellant asserts that the local district court rule requiring a six-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>member civil jury in certain cases is invalid because it is inconsistent with Rule 48.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This argument has two parts. First, the appellant contends that the local rule is invalid as inconsistent with Rule 48, because it deprives her of a twelve-member jury which Rule 48, as she reads it, guarantees. This argument is, however, misplaced. Rule 48 does not, on its face, guarantee a twelve-member jury, and we cannot imply such a guarantee in the Rule. When the drafters of the Rules wished to guarantee a twelve-member jury, they knew how to use express language to that effect. See F.R. Crim.P. 23(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, the presence of Rule 48 with Rule 38(a) <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure indicates that the drafters did not intend to- enshrine the common law jury with all <em>its </em>details, including twelve members, in Rule 48. For, Rule 48, despite Rule 38 (a) and the preservation of \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury . . . inviolate\u201d, abrogates the common law notion that the parties may not stipulate to a jury of less than twelve members.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">Second, the appellant argues that the local rule is invalid, as inconsistent with Rule 48, because it deprives her of the right to stipulate to a jury of \u201cany number less than twelve\u201d which Rule 48, as she reads it, guarantees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rule 48, however, deals only with a stipulation <em>by \u201c[t\\he parties\u201d. </em>It does not purport to prevent <em>court rules </em>which provide for .civil juries of reduced size. We refuse to read a negative implication into Rule 48 so as to bar the local rule at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">Other considerations lead us to conclude that Rule 48 does not prevent enactment of the local rule or invalidate the local rule because of an apparent inconsistency with Rule 48. Rule 48 was drafted and adopted before the Supreme Court decision in Williams v. Florida. It was, therefore, drafted and adopted in light of the then long established line of cases holding that a jury must consist of twelve members.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e. g., Thompson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>v. Utah, 1898, 170 U.S. 343, 18 S.Ct. 620, 42 L.Ed. 1061; Patton v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 276, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854; Maxwell v. Dow, 1900, 176 U.S. 581, 20 S.Ct. 448, 44 L.Ed. 597. After <em>Williams, </em>however, the constitutional interpretation upon which Rule 48 was based is no longer valid. In light of <em>Williams, </em>we cannot read Rule 48 as guaranteeing the twelve-member jury or as precluding a local rule establishing a six-member jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The record in the present case indicates that the local rule at issue here was, as required by Rule 83 (see footnote 12), \u201cfurnished to the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d. We interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s receipt of the local rule without objection as indicating tacit approval of the rule. As a subordinate federal court, we are reluctant to overturn a local rule to which the Supreme Court has not objected. Thirty-one other district courts have promulgated similar rules and presumably, as Rule 83 requires, each of these other district courts submitted its rule to the Supreme Court. Accordingly, we interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance without objection of district court rules for a six-member civil jury some indication of constitutional validity of the rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">We are not impressed with the contention that the local rule cannot stand in light of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, the statute authorizing promulgation by the Supreme Court of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . Judge Merrill answered this contention in Colgrove v. Battin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-12\">Here we are confronted with the phrase \u201cright of trial by jury as at common law.\u201d This language upon its face would appear to deny to the Supreme Court authority to dispense with any characteristics of the jury or of trial by jury known to the common law. This would indeed be a sweeping limitation. The Congress has, it is true, dealt extensively with the jury system. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq. It is hardly conceivable, however, that it was felt that the Supreme Court should not be allowed initially to move in interstitial areas save in accordance with perhaps archaic common law procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-13\">An historical inquiry suggests that the language in question was included in the predecessor statute, Act of June 19, 1934, ch. 651, \u00a7 2, 48 Stat. 1064, in anticipation that the forthcoming rules would unite law and equity and to assure that with such union the right of trial by jury would be neither expanded nor contracted. 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 38.06 at 44 (2d ed. 1971). <em>See also </em>House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Rep.No.1829, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1934).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We conclude with the words of Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">The command of the Seventh Amendment that \u201cthe right of trial by jury shall be preserved\u201d does not require that old forms of practice and procedure be retained . . . New devices may be used to adapt the ancient institution [jury trial] to present needs and to make of it an efficient instrument in the administration of justice. Indeed, such changes are essential to the preservation of the right. The limitation imposed by the amendment is merely that enjoyment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and that the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be not interfered with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMqx\">Ex parte Peterson, 1920, 253 U.S. 300, 309-310, 40 S.Ct. 543, 546, 64 L.Ed. 919, 923-924.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p

We have carefully examined the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find this contention unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b846-28\">COLEMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AtTr\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-29\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The Seventh Amendment reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">\u201cIn Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The Constitutionally mandatory character of the twelve member jury in Seventh Amendment cases was unmistakably enunciated by the Supreme Court in the <em>civil </em>case of Capital Traction Company v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">This is the last Supreme Court case directly in point. It is binding on the inferior courts until such time as it may be overruled by the same Court which decided it.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The present majority opinion does not discuss <em>Hof. </em>This despite the fact that the opinion there rendered was most thoroughly researched and is a definitive analysis of the Seventh Amendment, handed down in a day when Mr. Chief Justice Fuller presided, serving with jurists like Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Gray, and Mr. Justice White, later Chief Justice of the United States. <em>Hof </em>repeatedly stated that trial by jury in the primary and usual sense of the term at common law and in the American constitutions is \u201ca trial by a jury of 12 men in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Indeed, the Court said, \u201cThis proposition has been so generally admitted, arid so seldom contested, that there has been little occasion for its distinct assertion. Yet there are unequivocal statements of it to be found in the books.\u201d Whereupon, the Court proceeded to catalog those statements, including a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio that the requirement of twelve men for a jury at common law \u201cis as well settled as any legal proposition can be\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">I do not know whether the widow in the case now before us can, or will, seek certiorari in the Supreme Court. She should not have to do so. The burden should be on those who seek to overturn a rule of Constitutional Law that has stood since 1789 \u2014 until it occurred to someone that this emphatic pronouncement of both the Constitution and the Supreme Court could be overturned by a local rule for the sake of convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">I must say further that even if I were without the guidance of <em>Hof </em>I would nevertheless dissent. If, for reasons of convenience, a District Court by local rule may reduce the size of a jury from, twelve to six, why may it not on the same reasoning reduce the number to three, or some other number which would greatly impair, if not effectually destroy, the reasons underpinning trial by jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">We live in a time of great emphasis on constitutional rights, particularly the rights of those charged with crime or who wish to undermine by whatever means available the effectiveness of those charged with the performance of official duty. In my opinion, the <em>greatest of all constitutional rights </em>is the right of trial by jury. I would not see it impaired by tKe most insignificant scintilla, much less by a rule which has the potential of eventually emasculating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Rule 48 is to me crystal clear. It means that only by stipulation of the parties may a jury be reduced to less than twelve. The Rule, of course, has the effect of a statute. Courts cannot alter or revise statutes. I emphatically disagree with the idea that a statute may be parsed away [in fact, repealed] by court order on the theory that those who enacted it in plain and unambiguous terms were actually under a misapprehension as to some other rule of law. If the Rule is to be abrogated it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>be done by the procedure available to those who would seek that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Moreover, \u201cthe receipt [by the Supreme Court] of a local rule without objection\u201d does not indicate \u201ctacit approval of the rule\u201d. The judicial power of United States Courts reaches only to cases and controversies. The Supreme Court renders no advisory opinions, either by silence or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">I would reverse and remand this case for a new trial before twelve jurors.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b848-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and the Court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the Court and a majority of the Circuit Judges who are in regular active service not having voted in favor of it, (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule (2) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Coleman, Circuit Judge, adheres to the dissenting opinion originally filed in this case. Learning that a petition for cer-tiorari has been filed with the Supreme Court from another Circuit on the identical question here involved, nothing further is written at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Before JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, and WISDOM, GEWIN, BELL, THORNBERRY, COLEMAN, GOLDBERG, AINSWORTH, GODBOLD, DYER, SIMPSON, MORGAN, CLARK, INGRAHAM and RONEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b848-11\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aao-dedup-2\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">I agree in part with Judge Coleman\u2019s dissent from the panel opinion. By 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2072, Congress has reposed rulemaking power for district courts of the United States in the Supreme Court alone. By Rules 48 and 83 that Court has vested the prerogative of reducing the 12-man size of juries in the parties alone. The lack of any other mention of authority to diminish this institution, prevents me from reasoning that it is somehow implicitly conveyed. Certainly, neither the number of courts which have assumed to exercise this function, nor the expediency which a new day seems to demand, can supply this deficit of power in the district courts. I respectfully dissent to the court\u2019s failure to grant rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
