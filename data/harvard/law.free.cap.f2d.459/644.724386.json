Nicholas J. Merrick was arrested twice for the unauthorized operation of a taxicab at Washington National Airport.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He declined to be tried by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>a magistrate and elected to be tried in district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There he demanded a trial by jury, but his motion was denied. The court consolidated both eases, tried him without a jury, found him guilty, and imposed two concurrent six month sentences suspending, however, all but five days imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"> Neither Article 3, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, which provides, \u201cThe Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury,\u201d nor the Sixth Amendment which states, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,\u201d applies to petty offenses. Consequently, there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury for a petty offense. Frank v. United States, 395 U.S. 147, 152, 89 S.Ct. 1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969); Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 380, 86 S. Ct. 1523, 16 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966); District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 630, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65, 68, 24 S.Ct. 826, 49 L.Ed. 99 (1904); 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 371 (1969). The Supreme Court has never precisely defined a petty offense. In Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 68, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 1888, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970), Mr. Justice White said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether an offense is \u2018petty,\u2019 we have sought objective criteria reflecting the seriousness with which society regards the offense, . and we have found the most relevant such criteria in the severity of the maximum authorized penalty. . Applying these guidelines, we have held that a possible six-month penalty is short enough to permit classification of the offense as \u2018petty\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">The legislative definition also adopts a maximum penalty of six months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Confronted by these authorities, Merrick concedes \u2014 correctly, we believe \u2014 that he is not constitutionally entitled to a jury trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">Merrick contends, however, that he has a statutory right to a jury trial because Congress has not enacted any law to the contrary. In support of his position, he cites a number of cases which hold that a petty offender is entitled to a jury trial unless Congress has otherwise provided. E.g., Smith v. United States, 128 F.2d 990 (5th Cir. 1942); United States v. Bishop, 261 F. Supp. 969 (N.D.Cal.1966); United States v. Martinelli, 240 F.Supp. 365 (N.D.Cal. 1965); United States v. Great Eastern Lines, Inc., 89 F.Supp. 839 (E.D.Va. 1950). But Merrick fails to reckon with changes in pertinent statutes and rules enacted since these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">In 1968 Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401 to provide that the magistrate shall explain to a defendant charged with a minor offense,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201chas a right to trial before a <em>judge </em>of the district court and that he <em>may </em>have a right to trial by a jury (Emphasis added). The Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses before United States Magistrates, which became effective January 27, 1971, distinguish for the first time between minor offenses and petty offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rule 3, dealing with petty offenses, clearly indicates that a petty offender is not entitled to a jury trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rule specifically states that the trial before the magistrate shall be conducted \u201cas are trials of petty offenses in the district court by a district judge without a jury.\u201d Moreover, the defendant need not be warned that by consenting to trial before a magistrate he waives a right to a trial by jury in the district court. If a petty offender had the right to a jury trial in the district court, the magistrate would be required to inform him of this right because an accused can waive only a known right or privilege. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In sharp contrast to Rule 3 for petty offenses is Rule 2, which deals with minor offenses, for which the penalty may exceed six months. Then the magistrate is required to explain to the defendant \u201cthat he has a right to trial before a judge of the district court and a jury . .\u201d Furthermore, the defendant must sign a written consent, in which he specifically waives trial before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">We believe that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3401 and 3402, as amended in 1968, and Rule 3 of the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses before Magistrates, demonstrate the intent of both the Congress and the Supreme Court to provide for the trial of a petty offender without a jury when he elects to be tried in a district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, one reason Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas dissented from the Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of Rule 3 was their belief that the Rule probably denied the right to a jury trial for a petty offense. 51 F.R.D. 206 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Merrick also complains that the district judge misconstrued the regulation which he was charged with violating and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. We find no merit in these assignments of error. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-15\">. Merrick was charged with violating 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.3 (1971), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">\u201c(a) No person may operate a motor vehicle for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire (including a taxicab) on the airport unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-17\">(1) He is authorized to do so by contract with the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-18\">(2) He is operating that vehicle \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-19\">(i) To carry passengers to the airport for delivery there;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj_-dedup-0\">(ii) To carry immediately from the airport passengers picked up in response to a prior request; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmDk\">(iii) To carry immediately from the airport passengers picked up, without a prior request, at the point of and immediately upon discharge of other passengers delivered there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">(b) A person operating a motor vehicle for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire (including a taxicab) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the airport in response to a prior request to pick up passengers there must show on his manifest the time the request was made, the name of the person who made the request, and the time of pickup.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">.

The maximum penalty for Merrick\u2019s offense is six months imprisonment or a fine of $500, or both. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.191 (1971). His crime, essentially a trespass, is not so serious as to entitle him to a jury regardless of the penalty. <em>See </em>District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U.S. 63, 73, 51 S.Ct. 52, 75 L.Ed. 177 (1930) ; United States v.
