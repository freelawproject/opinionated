He came before the court insisting that as a claimed eighteen year old he wanted to be handled as an \u201cadult\u201d notwithstanding a report by the prosecuting attorney that appellant had been reported as being only seventeen years of age. He was held for action by a grand jury, bail already having been set. On February 5, 1971, he was brought before the court for consideration of possible waiver of indictment. He declined to waive indictment. On February 22, 1971, the indictment was returned against him by the grand jury. On February 26, 1971, he stated to the court that he was seventeen years of age rather than eighteen, and was advised by the court that in view of his refusal to consent to be prosecuted under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act he might be sentenced, if convicted, as a youth offender. He then entered a plea of not guilty to the indictment. On March 29, 1971, upon motion of the government and hearing before the court, his examination by a psychiatrist for the purpose of determining whether he was competent to stand trial was ordered. Upon the basis of the psychiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>ric evaluation the court ruled that the defendant was perfectly \u201ccompetent to stand trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The trial commenced on April 7, 1971, .a little less than four months from the time of appellant\u2019s arrest. A verdict of guilty was returned by the jury; appellant as a youth offender was committed for observation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e) and in due course following such study to the custody o.f the Attorney General or his authorized representative for treatment-and supervision pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) until discharged by the Youth Correction Division of the Board of Parole as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The evidence at the trial disclosed that the defendant and another person were observed by officers in possession of a motor vehicle which had been reported stolen in another state. Officer Jack E. Johnson, a New Mexico state policeman, was called by the United States and testified before the jury that after being advised of his rights in accordance with <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the appellant confessed to the stealing and interstate transportation of the motor vehicle in question. No objection to this testimony was interposed, nor had there been any prior motion to suppress the confession. At the close of Johnson\u2019s direct examination, counsel for the appellant cross-examined him briefly about his advice of rights and also concerning the content of the incriminating oral statements. In neither aspect was the testimony thereby thrown into question. Following this cross-examination, nonetheless, the trial judge excused the jury, indicated to counsel out of its presence that he had not been involved in prior proceedings in the case, and asked if there had been a voir dire hearing on the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements. Upon ascertaining that there had been no such prior hearing, the judge proceeded to examine the officer as to the <em>Miranda </em>warning and the other circumstance of the confession. Appellant\u2019s counsel, after having been afforded opportunity to cross-examine the officer, moved to strike the confession. The motion was denied. Officer Johnson then was permitted to further testify on the subject before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Byrnes, an FBI agent who had been present at the interview of appellant, was also permitted to testify under similar circumstances, a hearing out of the presence of the jury being devoted primarily to the question of the admissibility of a card signed by appellant containing the <em>Miranda </em>warning signed at Byrnes\u2019 request. The latter\u2019s testimony was clear and convincing both before and out of the presence of the jury that an appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warning was given to the appellant prior to the making of the incriminating statements. The signed acknowledgment of the warning over objection was received. The only discrepancy between the testimony of the two witnesses was that officer Johnson testified that his advice of rights was read from the card, whereas the FBI agent recalled that Johnson made an oral statement of rights to appellant and immediately thereafter the agent reiterated the statement of rights in detail in accordance with the printing on the card and had the defendant sign the acknowledgment. It is not questioned that the statement on the card was in keeping with the requirements of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The appellant\u2019s confession as recounted by officer Johnson and agent Byrnes was not only consistent and believable, but of a convincing nature. Thereafter, the appellant took the stand on his own behalf and did not raise any factual issue concerning the advice given to him about his rights or the voluntariness of his confession, but on the contrary denied that he had admitted that he was guilty and attempted to explain the interstate transportation of the stolen car in company with a companion consistently with his own innocence. The jury could reasonably have considered this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>testimony as far from convincing. The appellant testified at the time of the trial that he was eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in committing him as a youth offender is not meritorious. The only authority cited by his counsel on the point is Hale v. United States, 307 F.Supp. 345 (W.D.Okl.1970), it being frankly conceded that this case is opposed to appellant\u2019s contention. Rogers v. United States, 326 F.2d 56 (10th Cir. 1963), sustains the constitutionality of the Act in a similar context and, in principle, its application to the appellant\u2019s situation. It may be noted as another related, but only obliquely raised, point that the trial court clearly found on several occasions, and particularly at the times of the oral pronouncement of judgment and the written commitment, that the defendant was \u201csuitable for handling under the Youth Correction Act\u201d. It also found in the order of commitment that the defendant was eighteen years of age on the date of conviction, and recited that the defendant had been convicted by verdict of a jury of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 (which section contains a statement of the applicable sentence of imprisonment). In view of these findings, any failure to more expressly record that the Dyer Act offense for which appellant was convicted was \u201cpunishable by imprisonment under applicable provisions of law other than [the Federal Youth Corrections Act]\u201d did not impair the validity of the court\u2019s sentence. <em>Cf. Rogers, </em>326 F.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">There is no showing that the defendant was denied a speedy trial in any unconstitutional or prejudicial sense. \u201cThere is nothing in the record to indicate nor has appellant made any showing that the lapse . . . between the time appellant Was taken into Federal custody and the trial resulted in any oppressive delay, harassment, discrimination or prejudice to appellant.\u201d Webber v. United States, 395 F.2d 397, 400 (10th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Nor do we find prejudicial error in the sequence of the foundational hearings leading to, or supporting, the admission into evidence of appellant\u2019s confession or in its admission into evidence itself. No objection was made by appellant\u2019s counsel as the testimony had proceeded before the jury in the first instance; but as soon as the court became aware that a <em>Miranda </em>question might be involved, upon its own, motion it excused the jury and conducted hearings on the subject. The totality of evidence left little room for doubt that the warning was appropriately and timely given and that the appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary. Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), and Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965), relied upon by appellant, do not impeach the procedure followed by the trial court under the circumstance shown by the record. On the contrary, Pinto v. Pierce, 389 U.S. 31, 88 S.Ct. 192, 19 L. Ed.2d 31 (1967), seems controlling against appellant\u2019s position. <em>See also </em>United States v. Hathorn, 451 F.2d 1337 (5th Cir. 1971); Garrison v. Patterson, 405 F.2d 696 (10th Cir. 1969), and Evans v. United States, 377 F.2d 535 (5th Cir. 1967). In all events, any irregularity in the sequence of the hearings in and out of the presence of the jury would have been non-prejudicial beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">. Miranda v.
