App., \u00a7 462(a), and 32 C.F.R. 1632.14 for his refusal to submit to induction into the armed forces as ordered by his local draft board. On appeal, he alleges that the trial court erred in finding that the local board properly refused to reopen his classification upon his submission of a \u201cSpecial Form for Conscientious Objectors,\u201d Selective Service System Form 150. We affirm that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">Appellant registered with Local Board No. 6 of the Selective Service System at Seattle, Washington, on June 18, 1965. After receiving several deferments, on February 23, 1968, he was reclassified from II-S to I-A and advised of his right to ask for an appeal or personal appearance. On February 27, 1968, Local Board No. 6 received appellant\u2019s request for an appeal and a personal appearance before the Board. The Board advised appellant of a personal appearance to be held before it on April 15, 1968. On that date, the appellant appeared before the Board and advised it in writing that he would like to be classified as a conscientious objector. Apparently, it was during that appearance that the appellant received SSS Form 150 \u201cSpecial Form for Conscientious Objectors.\u201d Appellant completed and returned this form. As part of filling in this form appellant furnished the names and addresses of six individuals who could supply information as to the sincerity of his professed convictions. None of these references wrote to the Board, or spoke to the Board, although they were requested to do so. On June 3, 1968, the Local Board considered appellant\u2019s request for a conscientious-objector classification. The Board refused to reopen his classification, citing the following reasons: (1) applicant\u2019s claim was \u201cnot based on religious beliefs (2) applicant presented his claim \u201cafter he realized he did not qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>student deferment;\u201d and (3) applicant\u2019s \u201creferences given in Series V did not substantiate his claim upon our letter of request.\u201d The Appeal Board unanimously upheld the decision thus leaving appellant in Classification I-A. Appellant objected in writing to the Washington State Director of Selective Service, and was afforded a \u201ccourtesy interview\u201d by the local board to allow him an opportunity to elaborate his claim for conscientious-objector exemption. Appellant also was reminded to contact his references at this time. At no time did the Board receive any communications from appellant\u2019s references. In September 1968 the appellant reappeared before the board and explained the basis for his claim for exemption. His request to reopen classification was denied. On March 4, 1969, an order to report for induction was mailed. On April 8, 1969, the Army reported that the defendant refused to be inducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">At the time of trial, appellant entered a plea of guilty. Prior to sentencing, the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in Welsh v. United States, 404 F.2d 1078 (9th Cir., 1968) to determine the extent of conscientious objection based on nonreligious grounds, and the district court stayed sentencing of appellant pending the outcome of that case. After the Court\u2019s decision in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970) appellant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, and moved to dismiss the information alleging that his file qualified him for rehearing on his conscientious-objector status under the standard developed by <em>Welsh. </em>The motion was denied. Appellant waived his right to jury trial, and, after court trial, on February 12, 1971, the court pronounced him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Appellant raised three questions on appeal: (1) whether appellant\u2019s files presented a prima facie case for conscientious-objector status; (2) whether, given a prima facie case, the board was required to reopen the determination of his classification; and, (3) whether, given a prima facie case, evidence in the record supports the finding of insincerity by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">These questions turn on the principal issue whether the appellant\u2019s record as a whole, particularly his SSS Form 150, presented a prima facie case for exemption as a conscientious objector. Inasmuch as this court holds that a prima facie ease was not sufficiently set forth, the remaining questions posed are not reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The statutory exemption for conscientious objectors is set forth in Section 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j), which exempts from combatant training and service in the armed forces those individuals who by reason of their \u201creligious training and belief\u201d are conscientiously opposed to participation in armed conflict. Expressly excluded from this exemption are those who profess views which are essentially \u201cpolitical, sociological, or philosophical\u201d or which are merely a \u201cpersonal moral code.\u201d This court is guided by the standards initially outlined by the Supreme Court in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965) and as amplified in <em>Welch, supra, </em>in examining appellant\u2019s total record. The test was set forth, with respect to determining the necessary conviction in one\u2019s belief as a conscientious objector, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-13\">\u201c[a] sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption. . . . \u201d <em>See-ger, </em>at 176, 85 S.Ct. at 859; <em>Welsh, </em>398 U.S. at 339, 90 S.Ct. 1792, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">That portion of appellant\u2019s file which capsulizes the statement of his belief is contained in Series II of his SSS Form 150, where, in response to the inquiry that he describe the nature of his belief which is the basis of his claim, he replied: \u201cI believe my own conscious (sic) to be my Supreme Being and that it is also Superior to duties arising from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>human relation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court is provided some guidance by the language and reasoning of its earlier opinion. United States v. Moore, 423 F.2d 556 (9th Cir., 1970) which, although decided in the interim between <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh, </em>incorporated the thrust of the latter decision in disposing of a similar question with respect to the characterization of an applicant\u2019s beliefs. <em>Moore </em>emphasized the language in <em>Seeger </em>which was adopted and followed in <em>Welsh </em>as the \u201ctest\u201d of belief for qualifying as a conscientious objector. <em>Moore, </em>at 558. Moore, in describing his \u201cbelief,\u201d expounded at length essentially on the same theme presented by appellant in the instant case. This belief, when stripped of its laudable rejections of war and conflict, can be reduced to an essential affirmation of faith in one\u2019s self, subordinating even those relationship with others to the concept of self. Such a credo would seem to preclude a belief parallel to that filled by an orthodox belief in God, and would seem to be essentially a \u201ckind of individual self-determination.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>at 558. Beyond this level, the court cannot speculate. At this point, third-party interpretations of the different facets of appellant\u2019s convictions would have been critical. However, appellant did not meet this burden of providing supplementary elaboration on the characterization of his beliefs. To allow the court to presume what might have emerged, either through supplementary responses provided by the appellant, or through supporting letters of reference which might have provided crucial insight, would be for it to fashion appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Appellant seeks to draw a close parallel with the characterization of the belief held to qualify as an exemption in <em>Welsh, </em>noting with particularity the experiences of childhood religious training, notwithstanding the abbreviated statements offered by the appellant to communicate his beliefs. <em>See Welsh, </em>398 U.S. at 341, 90 S.Ct. 1792. However, a determination of an applicant\u2019s beliefs is not limited to his statements, but covers his entire application. And, in <em>Welsh, </em>the court based its holding that he was entitled to conscientious-objector status on an <em>elaboration </em>of his beliefs later communicated to the Service officials, and on this court\u2019s conclusion that he held them \u201c \u2018with the strength of more traditional religious convictions,\u2019 404 F.2d, at 1081. . . .\u201d <em>Welsh, </em>at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1798. In the instant case, appellant failed to elaborate sufficiently those characterizations, even though given ample opportunity to do so. Elaboration might have lent the requisite conviction to the argument that his behavior was governed by a superior moral force parallel to that occupied by an orthodox belief in a God. There is a significant absence of supporting material in this case for this court to find that appellant professes his belief with \u201c \u2018the strength of more traditional religious convictions. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Welsh, </em>at 343, 90 S.Ct. at 1798.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Elaboration was crucial in Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970), another case relied upon by appellant but which is distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the court emphasized, as evidence of \u201cnew information,\u201d five letters written in support of the petitioner, noting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A36\">\u201cit is clear that the petitioner\u2019s SSS Form 150 and the accompanying letters constituted a prima facie showing that he met the statutory standard for classification as a conscientious objector. ...\u201d <em>Mulloy, </em>at 417, 90 S.Ct. at 1771.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Appellant submitted no supporting letters ; it cannot be said that \u201cnew factual allegations\u201d were presented which \u201cwere not conclusively refuted\u201d by other information on file. <em>Cf. </em>Mulloy, at 418, 90 S.Ct. 1766.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Appellant\u2019s written and oral statements were so wedded to what amounts to a self-serving personal creed that it is very difficult for this court to conclude that such \u201camount to an assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>his beliefs were \u2018deeply held\u2019 and, \u2018that his conscience would give him no rest or peace\u2019 if he were forced to become involved in war.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Coffey, 429 F.2d 401, 405 (9th Cir., 1970). Nor is the court convinced that the totality of the circumstances merit the conclusion reached by the Third Circuit in United States v. Stephens, 445 F. 2d 192 (3d Cir., 1971) that the individual possessed \u201cneither the knowledge nor the intellectual wherewithal to synthesize his views. . . .\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>at 195. This court is not prepared to adopt the holding in that case which may well be based on \u201ca distortion of the prima facie standard. . . .\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>at 199. The circumstances of this particular case are such that this court cannot confidently infer that sufficient information was forwarded by the appellant to make out at least a prima facie case that he was one \u201cwho, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.\u201d 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The circumstances of this case are not such that the court would be inclined to anticipate what might transpire should the appellant merely be allowed more time to develop the technique of communicating his convictions, as in <em>Stephens, supra. </em>For the court to presume to what depth and for which purpose the appellant holds his belief would be for it to preempt his right of expression and burden of communication. It is presumed that the same prerequisite of supporting facts is necessary for a <em>Welsh </em>affirmation as were necessary for those alleging a more orthodox persuasion. Underlying the <em>Welsh </em>standard is a recognition of the possibility that the individual may not be able to adequately convey the depth or purpose of his conviction. Thus, recourse to external sources has been expressly provided; those acquaintances intimate with the individual could provide a dispositive illumination of the individual\u2019s practice of his belief. <em>See </em>United States v. Callison, 433 F.2d 1024, 1026-1027 (9th Cir., 1970). Consequently, inadequate or inarticulate expression would not be deemed tantamount to shallowness of conviction or misdirection of purpose just as superabundance of rhetoric would not necessarily be equated with deep and abiding moral dedication. In this case, no supplementary material was presented by which the board could properly gauge the <em>depth </em>of appellant\u2019s convictions, or ascertain the <em>purpose </em>of his statements. We are left with an inadequate framework of facts at the threshold which simply does not flesh out the <em>Welsh </em>standard. As appellant\u2019s file stands there are insufficient facts presented to support the conclusion that his objection to participation in the armed services was founded on a consistent and deep conviction in a belief comparable with and parallel to that filled by an orthodox belief in God, rather than on a largely self-determined, personally defined code of conduct. Accordingly, this court is obliged to agree with the finding that under the circumstances his application did not set forth a prima facie case for exemption as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"A17\">\n<em>Series I of SSS Form 150</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">\u201cI am by reason of my religious training and belief, conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form and I am further conscientiously opposed, to participation in noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces.

I assume, although I do not necessarily agree, that his answers to the questions in the SSS Form 150 were insufficient. But there is more. At the September 16 \u201ccourtesy interview\u201d, Johnson enlarged upon his beliefs. The draft board\u2019s summary of the interview states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-26\">\u201cRegistrant appeared as requested. Oath administered by Mr. Bruce, Chairman. CO questions were answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-27\">\u201cRegistrant stated that he feels the idea of killing or helping to kill anyone is against his beliefs. He doesn\u2019t feel that he has the right to kill and that he has the right to do what he wants as long as he doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. He was baptized Lutheran but does not attend the church now. He does believe in and would call the police in case of trouble, but although he had thought of being a member when younger, he would not join now. He believes in the Fire Department. He is against war. He used to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>in a Supreme Being, but now he is not sure. There might be a Supreme Force. He doesn\u2019t believe that churchgoing is a requisite, since many people don\u2019t enact their beliefs 'whereas he believes he does enact his beliefs. He would accept alternate service if it helped people and helped to stop violence. The registrant is not employed and has attended 3 years of college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201cMembers asked registrant to submit letters from the references given in SSS Form 150. They advised he would not be placed in class 1-0 on the basis that his claim is not [sic] on religious training and belief as required by the statue [sic]. They will review the file again after the letters are received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cWas advised that classification was not to be reopened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In my opinion, Johnson\u2019s statements, considered together with his answers to the questions in the SSS Form 150 do state a <em>prima facie </em>case, and the board should have reopened his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">1. <em>The test for determining whether a registrant\u2019s classification should be re-opened.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">In Mulloy v. United States, 1970, 398 U.S. 410, 416-417, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 1771, 26 L.Ed.2d 362, the Supreme Court established the following test for determining whether a registrant\u2019s classification should be re-opened.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201cWhere a registrant makes non-frivolous allegations of facts that have not been previously considered by his board, and that, if true, would be sufficient under regulation or statute to warrant granting the requested reclassification, the board must reopen the registrant\u2019s classification unless the truth of these new allegations is conclusively refuted by other reliable information in the registrant\u2019s file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">\u201cBecause of the narrowly limited scope of judicial review available to a registrant, the opportunity for full administrative review is indispensable to the fair operation of the Selective Service System. Where a prima facie case for reclassification has been made, a board cannot deprive the registrant of such review by simply refusing to reopen his file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">\u201cThe Government suggests . that the board might have concluded that the prima facie claim had been undercut by the petitioner himself\u2014 by his statements at the courtesy interview or because his demeanor convinced the board that he was not telling the truth. There is, however, but scant evidence in the record that the board\u2019s action was based on any such grounds. And, in any event, it is on precisely such grounds as these that board action cannot be predicated without a reopening of the registrant\u2019s classification, and a consequent opportunity for administrative appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">\u201cThis is not to say that on all the facts presented to it the board might not have been justified in refusing to grant the petitioner a 1-0 classification; it is to say that such refusal could properly occur only after his classification had first been reopened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">It obscures analysis to dispose of the present case, as the majority does, by comparing its facts to those in <em>Mulloy. </em>The Supreme Court indicated in <em>Mulloy </em>that the case before it was well within the test applied by the Court, but it did not state that facts less overwhelming than those in <em>Mulloy </em>would automatically fall outside the test. Thus, I think the focal point of analysis should be the test used in <em>Mulloy, </em>and not the facts in <em>Mulloy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">To determine whether appellant satisfies the test in <em>Mulloy </em>we should first decide whether appellant has stated a <em>prima facie </em>case for reopening his classification, and second, whether the facts which form the basis of his <em>prima facie </em>ease are conclusively refuted by other reliable information in his file.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>2. <em>Whether appellant has stated a prima facie case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">To answer the first inquiry, whether appellant has stated a <em>prima facie </em>case, I turn to United States v. Seeger, 1965, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733, and Welsh v. United States, 1970, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308. The facts of those two cases and the present one are strikingly similar in several important respects. As the Court noted in <em>Welsh:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cBoth Seeger and Welsh were brought up in religious homes and attended church in their childhood, but in neither case was this church one which taught its members not to engage in war at any time for any reason. Neither Seeger nor Welsh continued his childhood religious ties into his young manhood, and neither belonged to any religious group or adhered to the teachings of any organized religion during the period of his involvement with the Selective Service System. At the time of registration for the draft, neither had yet come to accept pacifist principles. Their views on war developed only in subsequent years, . . ..\u201d 398 U.S. at 335-336, 90 S.Ct. at 1794. \u201c[N] either could definitely affirm or deny that he believed in a \u2018Supreme Being,\u2019 both stating that they preferred to leave the question open. But both Seeger and Welsh affirmed on those applications that they held deep conscientious scruples against taking part in wars where people were killed. Both strongly believed that killing in war was wrong, unethical, and immoral, and their consciences forbade them to take part in such an evil practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 90 S.Ct. at 1795.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Of most importance in the present case is the <em>Welsh </em>Court\u2019s treatment of the question what constitutes \u201creligious belief\u201d within the meaning of the Selective Service Laws. The government had argued that <em>Welsh </em>was distinguishable from <em>Seeger </em>because Seeger had merely placed quotation marks around the word \u201creligious\u201d whereas Welsh had struck the word \u201creligious\u201d entirely. From this the government argued that Welsh\u2019s views, unlike Seeger\u2019s, were \u201cessentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d A belief based on such views disqualifies one for conscientious' objector status. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j). The Court, however, concluded that \u201c[wjhat is necessary under <em>Seeger </em>for a registrant\u2019s conscientious objection to all war to be \u2018religious\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 6(j) is that this opposition to war stem from the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339-340, 90 S.Ct. at 1796.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">As a matter of substance I think that Johnson\u2019s claim is no weaker than those in <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh, </em>and in at least one respect is stronger than the claim in <em>Welsh. </em>Like Seeger and Welsh, Johnson indicated that he was unsure whether there was a Supreme Being. At his courtesy interview he indicated that there might be a Supreme Force. Like Seeger and Welsh, Johnson had attended church as a child, but was not a member of any organized religion at the time that he applied for conscientious objector status. And like Seeger and Welsh, Johnson stated categorically that under no circumstances could he take the life of another human being. Finally, in contrast to Welsh, Johnson stated that he had acquired the belief which formed the basis of his claim in \u201cchurch as a child.\u201d Welsh indicated that his beliefs had been formed by \u201creading in the fields of history and sociology.\u201d 398 U.S. at 341, 90 S.Ct. at 1797. On the basis of the similarities between the present case and <em>Welsh </em>I find it impossible to conclude that Johnson has not stated a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>This case differs from <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>in two respects. First, Johnson\u2019s answers to the SSS Form 150 questions were both meager and flippant. This might be a basis for a board finding that he was insincere. The board\u2019s first disposition of his CO claim hints at such a finding. But I see neither flippancy, nor any other evidence of insincerity in what Johnson said to the board at the September 16 interview. What I do see is a better statement of his views, without the flippancy. I note, too, that the board did not, at that interview, find him insincere. It rested refusal to reopen solely on its conclusion that his views were not founded on religious training or belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Second, Seeger and Welsh were far more articulate than Johnson and went into greater detail about their beliefs than did Johnson. However, a registrant\u2019s inability to express himself well or apparent general lack of intelligence do not prevent his stating a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>See generally </em>United States v. Mount, 9 Cir., 1970, 438 F.2d 1072; United States v. Stephens, 3 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 192; United States v. Garvin, 7 Cir., 1971, 438 F.2d 1054; United States v. Joyce, 7 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 740; United States v. Callison, 9 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1024; United States v. Davila, 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 481; United States v. Lamberd, W.D.Mo., 1970, 315 F.Supp. 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The majority relies heavily on our decision in United States v. Moore, 9 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 556. As the author of the opinion in that case, I can hardly object to its whole-hearted acceptance by my brethren. <em>Moore, </em>however, was decided after <em>Seeger </em>but before <em>Welsh. </em>I am convinced that <em>Moore </em>cannot survive <em>Welsh </em>\u2014 that if <em>Welsh </em>stated a <em>prima facie </em>case, as the Supreme Court has held, then <em>Moore </em>did too.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">For this reason I think that we should now follow United States v. Callison, <em>supra, </em>which was decided after <em>Welsh. </em>In <em>Callison </em>the appellant\u2019s conscientious objector claim was rejected by his local board with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az7\">\u201cFrom a review of the statements in this form, you stated that your beliefs were part of your conscience, and that you did not know whether or not you believed in a Supreme Being. In no place did you state your objections to war were based on any religious training or belief. From this, the Board could only assume that yours was purely a philosophical view or moral code and not one based on religious grounds.\u2019\u2019 Quoted in 433 F.2d at 1026.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">In claiming conscientious objector status Callison had stated in SSS Form 150, \u201c \u2018My beliefs and my conscience makes it impossible for me to engage in the systematic killing of other human beings.\u2019 \u201d He further indicated that \u201c T believe that I\u2019m part of a human consciousness to which I would do immoral violence by killing people, or helping others to kill people.\u2019 \u201d Quoted at <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">On those facts we held that Callison had stated a <em>prima facie </em>ease under <em>Welsh, </em>notwithstanding the fact that his views had apparently been set forth in rather abbreviated form. On its face, Johnson\u2019s case is no weaker than Calli-son\u2019s, and actually is somewhat stronger in that Johnson explicitly stated that the beliefs which form the basis of his objection were formed in church as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Thus, I conclude that Johnson, on the strength of <em>Seeger </em>and especially of <em>Welsh, </em>has satisfied the first half of the <em>Mulloy test </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>if the facts he stated in his form 150, plus what he told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>board at the interview, are true, he has made out a <em>prima, facie </em>case for having his classification reopened. I also conclude that we should look to <em>Cailison </em>rather than <em>Moore </em>for guidance. I think that' Welsh did have an effect in this area of law beyond that which resulted from the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Seeger, </em>and that <em>Cailison </em>accurately reflects that additional impact in a way that <em>Moore </em>does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The second half of the Court\u2019s test in <em>Mulloy </em>remains to be considered: Whether there is other information in the registrant\u2019s file that \u201cconclusively refutes\u201d the allegations that form the basis of his <em>prima facie </em>case. 398 U.S. at 416, 90 S.Ct. 1766.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As I have already noted, the board did not purport to base its decision on any ground other than its opinion that Johnson\u2019s claim was not based on religious training and belief. It made no finding that Johnson\u2019s belief was not sincere or not deeply held. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Coffey, 9 Cir., 1970, 429 K2d 401. Under <em>Mulloy, </em>such a finding would have no effect unless the evidence supporting it <em>conclusively </em>refuted Johnson\u2019s claim. I cannot find evidence of that character in Johnson\u2019s file. By that I do not mean that there is no evidence pointing to insincerity. There is some: the flippancy of some of the answers on the SSS Form 150, and the failure of any of his references to respond. But the timing of the application is not such evidence. The courts have universally held that a registrant\u2019s application for conscientious objector status after he realizes that he no longer qualifies for a student deferment cannot serve as the basis for a finding of lack of sincerity. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Bornemann, 2 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The existence of such non-conclusive evidence cannot support a failure to reopen. <em>Mulloy, </em>quoted above, is explicit in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">. I commend to judges who may find themselves in my position the delightful concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson in McGrath v. Kristensen, 1950, 340 U.S. 162, 176-178, 71 S.Ct. 224, 233, 95 L.Ed. 173. Like Baron Bramwell, whom he quotes, I find that \u201c[t]he matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
