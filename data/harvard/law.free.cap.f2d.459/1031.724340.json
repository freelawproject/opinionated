App. \u00a7 462. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">In June 1968, Walton was classified IA. He did not appeal this classification. However, in February 1970, he requested a Form 150 (conscientious-objector application). He completed the form and returned it to his local board on March 3, 1970, with a letter which read: \u201cI would at this time like to place my case on appeal for classification I-O.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">The board rejected the conscientious-objector application June 24, 1970, and notified Walton of his right to appeal within 30 days. He did nothing until September 1970, when he refused induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\"> Walton now says that his letter of March 3, 1970, should be treated as a notice of appeal from the board\u2019s decision of June 24, 1970, three months later. We agree with the district court\u2019s refusal to treat an anticipatory letter as a notice of appeal. A notice of appeal after a decision is entitled to liberal construction. A purported notice of appeal in advance of decision is not entitled to any construction. It is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
