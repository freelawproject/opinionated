Burke, then unmarried, applied for a National Service Life Insurance policy in the amount of $5,000 on October 2, 1950. Burke named his father the principal beneficiary and his brother as contingent beneficiary, selecting a lump sum settlement (rather than an installment settlement) as to both. Burke\u2019s father died July 31, 1958. On December 1, 1958, Burke and the appellant were married. Burke died November 25, 1965. His brother, the contingent beneficiary, died February 26, 1966, intestate, without next of kin or heirs and without having applied for the proceeds payable under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Appellant, Burke\u2019s surviving widow, joined with the Administrator of Burke\u2019s estate in an action to recover the proceeds payable on the NSLI policy. The trial court, in dismissing appellant\u2019s claim, held that under the statutory scheme set forth by Congress, the proceeds were payable only to the contingent beneficiary\u2019s estate unless the proceeds would escheat to the State of Illinois, in which case no payment should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Appellant contends that since the congressional purpose underlying passage of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 was to protect the surviving family of a deceased serviceman from financial hardship, the trial court\u2019s determination results in unjust enrichment or a \u201cwindfall\u201d for the appellee. Further, appellant asserts that a \u201cvoid or grey area\u201d exists within the Act as to whom the proceeds of this policy should be paid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AtRr\"> We find no \u201cvoid or grey area\u201d in the Act relevant to this case. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 717,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the principal beneficiary predeceases the insured, the policy proceeds are to be paid to the surviving contingent beneficiary or his estate (if he survived the insured) unless it is shown such sums would escheat. If escheat would result the Veterans Administration is to make no payments under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Of course were the statutory provisions ambiguous they should be construed liberally to effectuate the beneficial purposes Congress had in mind. United States v. Zazove, 334 U.S. 602, 610-611, 68 S.Ct. 1284, 92 L.Ed. 1601 (1948). However, we find the statute clear and unambiguous with respect to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">Similarly, we find no unjust enrichment or \u201cwindfall\u201d to the appellee. A review of the history of war risk insurance discloses that during wartime Congress closely circumscribed the class of permissible beneficiaries to insure that proceeds of such policies would go to persons dependent upon the insured soldier for financial support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress in 1946, however, broadened the Act by granting insured servicemen the right to designate their choice of beneficiaries and with the right at all times to change such designations without the consent of the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to such congressional command, the appellee contracted to pay the policy proceeds to Burke\u2019s choice. Unfortunately for the appellant, Burke chose his father and brother. See Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U.S. 655, 658, 70 S.Ct. 398, 94 L.Ed. 424 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">.
