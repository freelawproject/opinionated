On October 22, 1965, he was sentenced to life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-22\">Evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s motion was conducted by the same district judge who conducted the criminal proceedings. Appellant testified in person at such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-23\">Appellant was represented by counsel during the 1965 criminal proceedings which led to his guilty plea and sentence, and during the hearing on his motion. He has chosen to appeal in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-24\">We have carefully examined the record in this case, including the well-prepared Memorandum and Order filed by the district judge denying appellant\u2019s motion. The crucial findings of fact, based upon conflicting evidence, are supported by substantial evidence and in no manner can be found to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-25\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
