Mr. Manes (appellee) is a registrant of Local Board No. 36. In early 1970, ap-pellee was classified I-A and ordered to report for a pre-induction physical examination. He requested a III-A hardship classification and a personal interview. The local board then provided him with a dependency questionnaire that was timely returned to the board, and granted appellee\u2019s request for a personal interview. No action was taken by the local board at the interview, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>appellee was requested to provide a certified statement from his mother as to his contributions to her for support. On June 16, 1970, after the statement was received, the local board, through its secretary, notified appellee of his I-A classification. But it was not until the next day that the board actually considered and approved such classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Manes requested and was granted an appeal to the state board, which affirmed the classification rendered by the local board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">On September 18, 1970, appellee was ordered to report for induction on October 12, 1970, but on October 1, he requested a reopening of his file on the basis of a letter submitted by his mother\u2019s psychiatrist. The board reviewed Mr. Manes\u2019 file, refused to reopen his classification because \u201cthere was no change in [appellee\u2019s] status resulting from circumstances over which [he] had no control\u201d, and ordered appellee\u2019s induction on November 5, 1970. Mr. Manes requested a second appeal to the state board, and was informed that he had no such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Mr. Manes then filed an action in the district court seeking to restrain his induction. The district court first denied relief, then reversed itself on the basis of Hunt v. Local Board No. 197, 438 F. 2d 1128 (3d Cir. 1970), declared the induction notice \u201cNULL and VOID\u201d, and ordered that the matter be remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The local board has appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">The threshold question in every pre-induction review ease is whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to reach the merits of the controversy. Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3), states that: \u201cNo judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant * * * except as a defense to a criminal prosecution. * * The statute further provides that such limited review was further restricted to the issue of jurisdiction of the Selective Service System \u201conly when there is no basis in fact for the classification assigned to such registrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">Section 10(b) (3) has been considered a number of times by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cases collectively</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a2j-dedup-0\">\u201cestablish the principles (a) that \u00a7 10(b) (3) does not foreclose pre-in-duction judicial review in that rather rare instance where administrative action, <em>based on reasons unrelated to the merits of the claim to exemption or deferment, </em>deprives the registrant of the classification to which, <em>otherwise and concededly, he is entitled by statute, </em>and (b) that \u00a7 10(b) (3) does foreclose pre-induction judicial review in the more common situation where the board, authoritatively, <em>has used its discretion and judgment </em>in determining facts and in arriving at a classification for the registrant.\u201d Fein v. Selective Service System, 405 U.S. 365, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>374, 92 S.Ct. 1062, 1069, 31 L.Ed.2d 298 (1972) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The facts and holding of the <em>Fein </em>decision, which came down after the order of the district court, are instructive as to whether the local board\u2019s action here entitles appellee to pre-induction judicial review of his \u201cclassification or processing.\u201d Dr. Fein was classified 1-0 by his local board, but the State Director appealed. Although Dr. Fein \u201cwrote seeking \u2018a statement indicating the basis for the State Director\u2019s Appeal\u2019 and an opportunity to reply,\u201d he received no explanation. The appeal board unanimously reversed the local board without stating any reasons, and the National Director of Selective Service further appealed on Dr. Fein\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The national board affirmed the appeal board\u2019s decision without stating any reasons. In his complaint seeking pre-induction judicial review of his classification and processing, Dr. Fein charged that the statute and regulations violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in that they did not provide for the rendition of a statement of reasons for the decision to appeal or the subsequent action by the various appeal boards, and that the defendants acted unconstitutionally by failing to state reasons, by not allowing Dr. Fein to submit additional materials, and by refusing him the opportunity to \u201crebut,\u201d the decision to appeal. 405 U.S. at 370, 92 S.Ct. at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">In <em>Fein, </em>the Supreme Court noted that Mr. Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in <em>Oestereich </em>and <em>Breen </em>would have allowed such a review under Section 10(b) (3), but that \u201cthis view, however, commanded the vote of no other member of the Court.\u201d 405 U.S. at 375, 92 S.Ct. at 1070. The Supreme Court concluded, therefore, that pre-induction review of allegedly unconstitutional administrative procedures was barred by Section 10(b) (3) absent the element of \u201cblatant lawlessness\u201d present in <em>Oestereich </em>and <em>Breen. </em>Appellee\u2019s \u201cclaimed status,\u201d like Dr. Fein\u2019s, \u201cis not one that was factually conceded and thus was assured by the statute upon objective criteria. His administrative classification action was, in contrast, a product of the \u2018process\u2019 and the \u2018system of classification,\u2019 * * *. It turned \u2018on the weight and credibility of the testimony\u2019 * * *. And it was \u2018dependent upon an act of judgment by the board.' * * <em>Id. </em>at 376, 92 S.Ct. at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">We hold, therefore, that the order granted by the district court was improper under Section 10(b) (3), as interpreted in <em>Fein.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded for such further proceedings consistent with this opinion and <em>Fein, </em>and in particular part IV thereof, as may be necessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">. Appellee calculates that each registrant classified on June 17, 1970 received a maximum of 36.6 seconds of consideration by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1171-8\"> Neither the local nor the state board stated the reasons for their decisions. There is no indication in the record that a statement of reasons was ever requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">. The district court concluded that Mr. Manes had presented a <em>prima facie </em>case for reclassification and that the board, therefore, was required to reopen ap-pellee\u2019s file so that he would be entitled to certain \u201cprocedural privileges.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">. <em>See e. g., </em>Fein v.

Because the decision of the state appeal hoard was unanimous, Dr. Fein had no right to further appeal. The National Director, however, is empowered to prosecute an appeal in such a situation, and in this case, he did so on Dr. Fein\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"AOck\">At this time, after a subsequent request for information, Dr. Fein was advised that the State Director\u2019s decision to appeal \u201cwas based upon the information contained in [his] selective service file.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
