Following trial the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it concluded that the deceased, LeBlanc, was an employee of Pen-rod at the time of his injury within the meaning of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S. C. \u00a7 901 et seq. The court held that the plaintiff was therefore limited to the remedy provided by \u00a7 905 of the Act and barred from maintaining her suit for damages against Penrod. Champagne correctly conceded at oral argument that the court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. It is our judgment that the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and that the legal conclusions reached are supported by the facts found. Based on the opinion of the district court, 341 F.Supp. 1282 (W.D.La. 1971), the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
