ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">This appeal emanates from a judgment, entered on the verdict of a jury, convicting appellant of twelve violations of federal narcotic laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The verdict followed a trial on an indictment charging three separate offenses for each of four alleged sales of narcotics to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>undercover police officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The principal events giving rise to the prosecution were related at trial by Officer Thomas G. James, the undercover policeman. Since Officer James\u2019 version of the drug sales is contested only in his identification of appellant as the seller, it furnishes a convenient starting point for our consideration of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Officer James carried out his undercover assignment from November 23, 1966, through the last week of April, 1967. During this period he bought narcotics from 24 individuals, and from some he made several purchases. The four sales attributed to appellant took place on January 5, 6, 10 and 13,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and each followed the same general pattern. All transactions took place in the presence of one Roy Brown, a paid police informant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They transpired in the same locality<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and covered periods ranging from five to twenty minutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each transaction was for a few capsules,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was consummated at the same unit price,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and was paid for with police department advance funds. None of the drugs was sold in or from an original stamped package,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or pursuant to an order form.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">After each purchase, Officer James returned to his residence and made notes in which he recorded descriptive details which he later utilized in his identification of appellant. His notations included \u201ca pock-marked complexion,\u201d \u201cgold-capped front teeth,\u201d and items of Army-type attire.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The officer also conducted preliminary field tests on the capsules which denoted the presence of an opium derivative, and thereafter handed the capsules over to his supervisor, whom he met at a predetermined place. The capsules were promptly submitted to chemical analysis, which produced a positive result for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-19\">On April 20, 1967, approximately three and a half months after the first transaction and slightly more than three months after the last, appellant was arrested on a warrant, sworn out by Officer James on the previous day, charging him with each of the four sales. Officer James spent 30 to 45 minutes in appellant\u2019s company shortly prior to the arrest, and continued in undercover role for about a week thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">That, in the main, coupled with Officer James\u2019 insistence that appellant was the seller, was the Government\u2019s case. Detective Joseph W. Somerville detailed Officer James\u2019 deliveries of the purchased capsules to him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The custodial chain and the narcotic content of the capsules were completed by stipulation of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Detective Robert I. Bush described the events surrounding appellant\u2019s arrest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Roy Brown, the informant, did not testify.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Appellant manned the witness stand to deny that he ever sold narcotics to the undercover officer or anyone else. He testified that he could not state where he was on the dates in question, but recalled that during the period the sales took place he was employed at a service station. During the interval between the sales and his arrest, he said, the station had become defunct, and efforts to locate his former employer and coworkers were of no avail. The only other person, he continued, whom he could possibly have summoned to shed light on his then whereabouts was his sister who had since died. She, he claimed, was the one person who was sufficiently familiar with his work habits to testify as to where he was on the sale dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Appellant attacks his conviction on three grounds. He argues, first, that the statutory provisions upon which the conviction rested violated his Fifth Amendment due process and self-incrimination rights. These contentions are substantially the same as those recently analyzed and rejected in United States v. Burgess,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and we do not consider them further. Appellant next argues that the delay of three to three and one-half months from the alleged commission of the crimes to the date of his arrest was unreasonable and prejudiced his defense. In Part I of this opinion we survey the landscape of problems stemming from delayed arrests in narcotics cases and, in Part II, we analyze the particular facts of this case in light of established doctrine and conclude that appellant\u2019s claim must fail. Appellant\u2019s last contention is that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant separate trials on the four violations with which he was charged. For reasons elucidated in Part III of this opinion we reach a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">The recurring problem of delay between an alleged narcotics crime and the arrest of the accused arises from methods the Government must employ to unearth violations of that kind. The clandestine character of narcotics traffic makes the use of undercover policemen well nigh an absolute necessity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Entree into the underworld of drug activity is most successfully gained by newer offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>cers whose identification with the police force has not become known.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The efficient utilization of personnel working under cover demands extension of their anonymity for the periods during which the undercover assignments are carried out.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since, as a practical matter, complaints can be publicized only after tours of duty are completed,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> alleged violators are in the meantime left unaware that they will be charged.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is not surprising, then, that delays, often of months, between alleged offenses and notification of charges \u2014 usually by arrest \u2014 have frequently come under scrutiny by this court. The judicial task, of course, is reconciliation of the competing needs of effective law enforcement and early notice to the accused-to-be of the impending accusation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">On the basis of our supervisory power over criminal trials in this circuit, but recognizing the due process overtones of the problem, we have held that narcotics charges must be dismissed where the delay between the undercover agent\u2019s detection of the crime and notice to the accused of criminal charges is unreasonable and prejudicial to him. Ross v. United States<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is the foundation case. We said there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-10\">It is always to be remembered that the [delay] is a conscious act on the part of the police. That alone does not condemn it, because the Department is motivated solely by a purpose to enhance its effectiveness in the public interest. But the Constitution contemplates a separate interest in fair procedures for the citizen faced with the loss of his liberty by reason of criminal charges. When interests of this nature impinge on each other, as they have a way of doing, they must be accommodated. A balance must be struck, if one or the other is not to be sacrificed completely.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Cases since <em>Ross </em>have attempted to strike the proper balance, mindful that \u201cthe risk of conviction of an innocent person\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cattributable to the process which led to the verdict of guilt\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is the central concern of the <em>Ross </em>ruling. Our numerous opinions in the field have addressed the problem in a great variety of factual circumstances. All cases agree that the two prime factors to be considered are the reasonableness of the delay and the resulting harm, if any, to the accused. Justification for delay is measured largely though not exclusively by the desirability of keeping the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>dercover agent\u2019s identity secret to enable him to track down as many narcotics traffickers as possible while he is useful.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While some amount of delay is administratively inevitable, and by the same token is legally permissible, courts must consider the adverse effects of delay upon the accused.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The rough rule of thumb the cases indicate is that delays of four months or less ordinarily necessitate no detailed judicial exploration of the underlying reasons.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This limit is, of course, an effort toward a practical accommodation of the competing governmental and individual interests, and presupposes that a shorter period is unrealistic. In particular cases, however, this basic assumption may not hold. Thus, where the agent emerges from cover within the four-month period, the Government will be required to make a diligent effort to find and notify the accused promptly thereafter.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\"> Any averment of prejudice\u2014 or, as sometimes called, \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d \u2014 necessitates a showing intensely dependent on the facts of each case. While it is hard to draw too many generalizations from the decided cases, two broad categories of special circumstances have been recognized. The first, and the most common, embraces those cases in which the accused complains that the delay damaged his ability to present his defense. The burden is upon him to come forward with \u201ca plausible claim\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> of prejudice, and a frequent claim is that he cannot remember where he was during the short period of time the narcotics transaction consumed, usually some months before.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The length of the delay, even if ordinarily reasonable, is obviously relevant in assessing injury of this sort. Any inference that harm did result is negated when the accused testifies in detail,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or brings forward an alibi witness,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>or perhaps even when he holds a steady job.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Another variation of the claim that the defense has suffered from the delay is the assertion that a material witness has become unavailable. Any loss of such a witness which is chargeable to the delay weighs heavily against the Government in these cases.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Special circumstances comprising the second category are those related to the kind of proof the Government presents and the reliability of the techniques by which the accused is identified as the offender. Because of the conditions under which narcotics are usually traded, we have remained advertent to the lurking danger of misidentification. We have been particularly cautious when the only evidence is the uncorroborated testimony of an undercover agent who had but a single brief encounter with the alleged offender.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We have been even more prone to dismiss an indictment when the undercover agent did not know the seller before the sale, took only scanty notes, and identified him from pictures of narcotics suspects some time after the sale, than when more careful procedures have been followed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We have, on the other hand, recognized that multiple contacts between agent and seller tend to strengthen any later effort by the agent to point out the guilty party.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Our decisions lay down- no rules as to the weight to be assigned to these factors; they call, instead, for judicial judgment of the most delicate type. <em>Ross </em>itself is just about the paradigm. The seven-month delay there was unnecessary because the undercover agent had reached the point where he was unnecessarily duplicating purchases. The accused made a plausible claim of prejudice; because of the long delay, he claimed he could not remember where he was at the time of the crime, and a witness who might have helped him could not remember the day in question either. Atop this, the proof offered by the Government was particularly suspect. The novice undercover agent claimed to have made only one purchase from the accused, and to have seen him only for ten minutes. The officer had sworn out 51 warrants and could not testify without his notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">We turn, then, to apply the foregoing principles to the facts before us. Officer James, the undercover agent, testified to four purchases of narcotics from appellant during the first two weeks in January, 1967. Since appellant was arrested on April 20, the delay was about three and one-half months.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The arrest followed expeditiously the officer\u2019s emergence from cover. We have no call to delve into the reasonableness of the police action in this case <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Appellant seeks, rather, to bring himself within the <em>Ross </em>rule by alleging special circumstances. His primary contention is that his defense was impaired by the delay. Appellant took the stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>at the trial and denied participation in the criminal activities; he testified further that he could not remember where he was on the days in question. We cannot reject out-of-hand his claim that he had forgotten his whereabouts when the drug transactions took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Appellant asserts that he had worked at a service station which went out of business before trial. He could not, he says, locate the owner of the station nor any of his co-workers for the trial. The record, however, demonstrates that appellant\u2019s counsel had interviewed the station\u2019s owner and could classify his testimony as no better than \u201cinconclusive\u201d. Apparently no records were kept which could show whether appellant was working at the station when the crimes transpired, and it also appears that appellant worked only intermittently.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Appellant also avers prejudice from the death of his sister, with whom he was living at the time of the offenses, but we are not informed as to just when she died. There is, of course, a \u201cslender hope\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> that she might have been able to help the defense, but it may well be that she died during the interval between arrest and trial, and not, as in Woody v. United States,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> at \u201can advanced stage of the delay\u201d prior to appellant\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Beyond that, this case is further unlike <em>Woody </em>because there two witnesses were lost because of pre-arrest delay, one because of death and the other because an intervening arrest led him to invoke his self-incrimination rights instead of testifying.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The latter witness, the court was told, would have testified in direct contradiction to the undercover policeman.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The only claim appellant makes here is that his sister might, in some un-elucidated manner, have helped him reconstruct his activities on the days in question. We conclude, then, that the probability of damage to appellant\u2019s ability to defend himself was not significant enough to warrant upsetting his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">We think, too, that the quality of the Government's proof in the instant case demonstrates that there is little chance of misidentification. The undercover officer testified, with notes, to four separate purchases from appellant within a period of two weeks and in three different places.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The officer said that he spent five to ten minutes with appellant at each of the first three purchases, then spent 20 minutes with him in making the last purchase and, finally, discussed with him future narcotic purchases for over half an hour just before the arrest. It is true that the testimony reflects some confusion about the date of the last purchase<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> but, whatever inconsistency that testimony reflects, it detracts little from the Government\u2019s cause. The agent said that he made 24 arrests and claimed that he could remember all of the sellers from whom he made more than one purchase. His notes from the scene of the purchases included a description of appellant with gold-capped teeth, a description appellant meets at least partly. This case is far different from single-sale brief-encounter cases like <em>Ross </em>and <em>Woody.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Since the delay here was not unreasonable, any harm to appellant\u2019s case slight, and the reliability of the Government\u2019s proof substantial, we reject the argument that the indictment should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contention is that the denial of his motion for severance of the twelve-count indictment constituted error deteriorating the fairness of his trial. As we explained earlier, appellant was charged with three separate offenses in connection with each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>the four narcotics sales specified in the indictment, and was tried on all twelve counts simultaneously.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Appellant asserts no claim that the counts were improperly joined in a single indictment;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the argument is that he should have been relieved from potential harm stemming from the trial of so many accusations at one time.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In our view, however, an application of the governing principles, delineated in our opinions during the recent past, compels a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We have recognized that the trial of multiple counts jointly, though conducive to economy and expedition in criminal litigation, may in particular instances breed prejudice to the accused. One danger is that \u201cthe jury may use the evidence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposition on the part of the defendant from which is found his guilt of the other crime or crimes charged.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Another danger is that \u201cthe jury may cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered separately, it would not so find.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Still another may be \u201ca latent feeling of hostility engendered by the charging of several crimes as distinct from only one.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\"> At the same time, we have acknowledged that separate trials offer no panacea where evidence of each joined offense is admissible as to each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>others, for in that event the accused could fare no better from a severance and trial of the severed counts independently.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We also have \u201cfound no prejudicial effect from joinder when the evidence of each crime is simple and distinct, even though such evidence might not have been admissible in separate trials\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> since, \u201cwith a proper charge, the jury can easily keep such evidence separate in their deliberations and, therefore, the danger of the jury\u2019s cu-mulating the evidence is substantially reduced.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Thus, by our standard, no severance is required if \u201cevidence of the joined offenses would be mutually admissible, or if not, the evidence is sufficiently \u2018simple and distinct\u2019 to mitigate the danger of cumulation.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> And \u201cin any given case the court must weigh prejudice to the defendant caused by the joinder against the obviously important considerations of economy and expedition in judicial administration.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We think that upon a separate trial of either of the four drug transactions alleged in the indictment,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> evidence relating to the other three transactions would have become admissible, and that in any event the evidence was so uninvolved and so readily referable to the several offenses as to reduce the hazard of cumulation to the point of insubstantiality. We accordingly conclude that the trial judge did not err in favoring the needs of trial administration by denying the sought-after severance.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">To be sure, evidence indicating the accused\u2019s commission of an offense not on trial, because of its potential for prejudice, is generally to be excluded.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> There are, however, situations wherein evidence having such a tendency would serve \u201csome substantial, legitimate purpose\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> in the case on trial, and thus may summon an exception to the general rule.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> One established exception obtains where the other-offense evidence bears significantly upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the identity of the perpetrator of the offense being tried, in which event it may properly be let in although it also associates the accused with other crime.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Just such an occasion, we believe, was presented here.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The Government\u2019s case, as to all of the four alleged drug sales, rested crucially on the testimony of Officer James, the undercover agent. He was the only available Government witness to the transactions,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and consequently the only one who could have identified the seller. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the seller was, of course, as much a part of the Government\u2019s burden as was the establishment of any other essential element of the offenses. That the Government\u2019s task was real is manifest from the fact that appellant, at the trial under review, took the witness stand to avow that he was not the seller, and to proffer something of an alibi for the times at which the offenses occurred. Thus identity of the seller loomed as the burning issue at any trial, joint or separate,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and with testimonial credibility so largely at stake, any evidence materially bolstering Officer James\u2019 identification of appellant could have critical importance in terms of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">These circumstances, we think, furnished an adequate predicate for invocation of the identity exception to the rule shunning evidence disclosing other crimes.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> For Officer James\u2019 identifiea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tion of appellant as the person who sold him narcotics on any one of the four occasions was very likely to be strengthened considerably by reference to certain of the circumstances involved in the other three.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> To jurors, no less than to judges,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the reliability of an eyewitness identification is apt to increase as the opportunities for observation of the subject and mental retention of his image are broadened, and as the reasons for close scrutiny and accurate recollection become more special.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> A witness who ventures an identification of a party simply on the basis of one encounter may well be believed, but the identification bids fair to command greater respect when accompanied by a showing that the witness encountered the party on other occasions, and that he had an inportant reason for studying and remembering his distinctive features.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Within Officer James\u2019 testimonial range lay sundry events calculated to fortify his identification of appellant at any separate trial. The officer made, not one, but four purchases of drugs from appellant. The first three transactions endured for five to ten minutes and the last for fifteen to twenty minutes, and after each he incorporated the seller\u2019s description into his written notes.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Additionally, he spent 30 to 45 minutes with appellant immediately prior to his arrest, in part in a discussion of future drug transactions. His official mission, as an undercover police officer, was not only to seek out traffickers in narcotics but also to keep a sharp mind and memory for the stimuli that could lead to their later identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">In such distinctive circumstances, we believe that upon a separate trial of the counts relating to any one of the four drug transactions, these details from the other three would promise real assistance in the jury\u2019s evaluation of Officer James\u2019 identification of appellant.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> We believe, too, that in this milieu the probative values of such evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>dence would suffice to serve \u201ca substantial, legitimate purpose\u201d warranting admission.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> And since upon any separate trial some testimonial items from the transactions not on trial would have become admissible,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> we find no prejudice stemming from the denial of the motion for severance.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">There is yet another consideration lending support to our conclusion that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to sever did not operate to enhance other-crimes prejudice to appellant. As we have observed, a severance of counts is not required where the evidence, even when not mutually admissible in separate trials, is so simple that the jury should encounter no substantial difficulty in properly confining its treatment within zones of relevance.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he very essence of this rule is that the evidence be such that the jury is unlikely to be confused by it or misuse it,\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> and that, we believe, was clearly so here. The four narcotics sales for which appellant was blamed were not only uncomplicated transactions but were so markedly similar that each was virtually a duplicate of all the rest.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Moreover, the single factual issue arising with respect to the four was identity, with one witness for the Government affirming and one witness for the defense denying that appellant was the seller, and the jury\u2019s principal task was a credibility resolution. We are unable to perceive any significant probability that the jury could have become confused by the evi-dentiary presentation on either side. We need not decide whether this case would qualify under the \u201csimple and distinct\u201d principle in the absence of the mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>admissibility of the four drug sales which we have already found. We do say, however, that on the balance of probative value and harm to the accused, the situation before us is of a piece with those which our previous decisions have held to present inadequate claims of resulting prejudice.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In upholding the declination to sever in this case, we disclaina once again any thought \u201cthat every item having some tendency to show identity is automatically to be made available to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> As we have heretofore admonished,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-5\">An inexorable requirement, obtaining as to all evidence unveiling another offense, is that its probative virtues must outweigh its prejudicial proclivities. . . . Thus \u201cother offense\u201d evidence proffered on an issue of identity must promise a real contribution in the process of proof of identity, for otherwise its help will be surpassed by its hurt. A reasonable need for the evidence must exist, and for as much detail as is to be let in, lest its value be exceeded by its damage. In sum, admissibility depends upon a plus-quality in terms of its evidentiary capability in balance with its harmful portent.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We caution, then, that our decision herein is not to be taken as a license for admission of evidence tending to show merely that an identification witness on some other occasion saw the accused engaging in other criminal conduct. In the case at bar there was much more than just another occasion for observation ; the number of such occasions, their duration, the opportunities for scrutinizing they afforded, the imperative reason for scrutiny, and the recordation of descriptive details all combined to add peculiar value to Officer James\u2019 identification of appellant. In sum, we sustain the ruling denying appellant\u2019s motion for severance because we find such a plus-quality in evidentiary items 'emanating from each of the four drug transactions as to warrant mutual admissibility, and too little likelihood of jurors' misunderstanding of the evidence to override the husbandry of a single trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-23\">.

Clarity of analysis is promoted by carefully distinguishing two general types of situations which differ both factually and conceptually'. The first involves an eyewitness to several offenses who identifies the accused as the perpetrator of each. If the offenses are tried separately, the witness\u2019 reference to particular details of the offenses not on trial may lend credence to his identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the offense on trial. The similarity or dissimilarity of the offenses, though perhaps of some value, is not particularly significant since the tie between the offense occasions is sought to be established by the eyewitness identification and not circumstantially by common features of the crimes. The case at bar presents a situation of this kind. Compare Hill v. United States, 135 U.S.App. D.C. 233, 234-235, 418 F.2d 449, 450-451 (1969), where we found it unnecessary to decide the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-26\">The second type of situation involves an effort to identify the perpetrator of the offense on trial simply by identification of the accused as the perpetrator of another offense which was so markedly similar as to warrant the conclusion that both offense's were committed by the same person. See Bradley v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 51, 140 U.S.App.D.C. at 14-15, 433 F.2d at 1120-1121. In instances of that kind, the link tying the two offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>to a single culprit is circumstantial, and proof of the factors establishing both crimes as the handiwork of one person is vital.

Bussey, <em>supra </em>note OS, where this court ruled that testimony that the accused held up an auto shop could not be allowed to support iiis identification at ids trial for a nearby holdup minutes later, but we think that case does not indicate a reversal here. As we read the decision, it rested on its own circumstances and not on the theory that testimony aiding identification is flatly prohibited to the extent that it incidentally reveals another crime. Compare Hood v. United States, 125 U.S. App.D.C. 16, 18-19, 365 F.2d 949, 951-952 (1966). Indeed, <em>Bussey </em>acknowledged that \u201c[h]ad defense counsel attempted on cross-examination to cast doubt on the witnesses\u2019 recollection that Bussey was in the auto shop at 4 o\u2019clock, an opportunity might have arisen for them to explain the reasons they definitely remembered that lie was there.\u201d 139 U.S.App.D.C. at 273, 432 F.2d at 1335.

The trial was on a twelve count indictment involving four alleged sales of narcotics on four different dates, each sale leading to charges of three separate offenses under the narcotics laws. Prior to trial, appellant moved for relief from prejudicial joinder. The motion was denied. This I think was reversible error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>I do not understand the court to conclude that there was no prejudice in lumping in one trial the evidence in support of all twelve charges growing out of the four sales of narcotics. The dangers arising from a joint trial of multiple crimes is pointed out by the court at pp. 855, <em>supra. </em>Nevertheless the court, as I understand, holds that the obvious prejudice to the defendant which accompanies such a joint trial must be accepted because were a separate trial had for each of the four sales evidence of the other sales would be admissible to support the testimony of Officer James identifying defendant as the one who made the sale involved in the separate trial. Additionally, the court relies on a rule which in some circumstances permits joint trial of offenses when evidence of each is simple and distinct, even though all the evidence of one would not be admissible in a separate trial of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><em>First. </em>I agree that in a separate trial involving any one of the four sales, in turn involving the decisive issue of identity of the alleged offender, evidence of other encounters of Officer James with the accused would be admissible as tending to verify the correctness of the officer\u2019s identification of the accused. I do not agree, however, that the right to introduce evidence of other encounters in aid of identification also carries with it a right of the prosecution on direct examination to adduce from the officer evidence that the encounters involved other sales of narcotics in violation of the laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If it be said that the added detail of criminal circumstances enhanced the credibility of the identification by underscoring for the jury the reason why Officer James remembered defendant, for the same reasons such detail increased unnecessarily the prejudice to the accused. The purpose of the identification exception would be served without reciting that the encounters with the defendant involved the commission of three similar crimes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deference to the general rule excluding evidence of other offenses would seem to require that the identification exception not be permitted to open the door to prejudice which is unnecessary to serve the purpose of the exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\"><em>Second. </em>As indicated above, the court also seek support in the rule permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>joint trial of offenses when the evidence of each is sufficiently simple and distinct to avoid prejudice because \u201cthe jury is unlikely to be confused\u201d or to \u201cmisuse\u201d the evidence of one in considering the others. In the first place, the court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence of each transaction was simple and distinct is not borne out by the record. Both the Government\u2019s argument to the jury and the District Court\u2019s instructions treated the evidence relating to defendant\u2019s identification as if a single issue were involved \u2014 whether he was the party to all four transactions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To conclude that the jury did not misuse the evidence \u2014 that is, did not cumulate the identifying testimony as to each of the four transactions to reinforce the identifying testimony as to the others \u2014 is to me incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">In the second place, the court\u2019s primary basis for finding no impermissible joinder is that evidence of each narcotics transaction would be admissible in separate trials to support the agent\u2019s identification of defendant, from which it is said to follow that a severance would not relieve defendant from the prejudice. Yet, this basis for permitting the joint trial contradicts the notion that evidence of each offense was so simple and distinct that the jury in the joint trial would not use that with respect to one in considering the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Moreover, it is well settled that, if the other-crime evidence appears to come within an exception to the general rule excluding it, such as the identification exception relied upon by the court, nevertheless the evidence will be excluded if its prejudice to the accused is not outweighed by its probative value to the prosecution. United States v. Bussey, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 268, 432 F.2d 1330 (1970); Bradley v. United States, <em>supra. </em>This balancing of probative value and prejudice is a condition to the admissibility of the evidence. Abandoning the simple and distinct exception as an independent basis for the joint trial, foi% as pointed out above, this would contradict the interrelationship of the evidence relied upon to support identification, nevertheless the court, paradoxically it seems to me, holds that in balancing probative value and prejudice to defendant, the evidence, because simple and distinct, is not sufficiently prejudicial to require exclusion. This amounts to saying that other-crime evidence, although useful to reinforce identification testimony, is nevertheless so simple and distinct as to minimize prejudice. Such a position is logically untenable. Similar evidence which is reinforcing cannot simultaneously be distinct, regardless of its simplicity. In no case which applies the simple and distinct principle is the evidence supporting one of the offenses so nearly identical to the evidence supporting the other offenses as in the present case. The heart of the simple and distinct principle is the disfavor with which the courts view mutual re<em>inforcement </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>cumulation. Whatever may be the usefulness of the balancing process in other cases, the situation before us is one in which the prejudice to defendant increases in direct proportion to probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\"><em>Third. </em>The court in the last paragraph of footnote 74 refers to the discretion which it attributes to the trial judge in \u201cweighting] prejudice to the defendant caused by the joinder against the obviously important considerations of economy and expedition in judicial administration,\u201d citing Drew v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. at 14, 331 F.2d at 88. In <em>Drew </em>the language referred to occurs in an outline of prinei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>pies deemed relevant to the problem of joinder. <em>See also </em>Bradley v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The context surrounding the <em>Drew </em>quotation indicates to me that the court was warning against the use of economy and expedition in judicial administration as a balancing factor where there is prejudice. The court in <em>Drew </em>gave no weight whatever to such economy and expedition in holding that the joinder there of two separate felonies in a single trial was prejudicial error. Indeed, I think we must move away from considering that prejudice to the right of the individual to a fair trial must be permitted in aid of economy and expedition in the administration of justice. The courts should pursue attainment of those ends by other means available.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">The simple fact is that as a matter of common sense no abstract evidentiary rule obscures the prejudice that attached to the use in each offense of the evidence of the four offenses in the joint trial. This prejudice is not offset by any acceptable rationale which justifies imposing upon the defendant an exception to the rule which excludes at trial for one crime evidence of a different one. There is no need to analyze the cases cited by the court, <em>see, e. g., </em>footnote 80, <em>supra, </em>in which reversals have not followed from joint trials of more than one offense. Several of the cases fall within the principle to which I adhered in Dunaway v. United States, 92 U.S.App. D.C. 299, 303, 205 F.2d 23, 26-27. Moreover, no case controls another. The issue is always one of preserving the fairness of the trial, a judgment to be exercised on the facts of each case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">While otherwise concurring, I respectfully dissent from affirmance for the reasons stated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-22\">. No additional motion was required under Rule 14, Fed.R.Crim.P.

None of the authorities cited by the court, notes 54 and 71, <em>supra, </em>calls for the application in this case of the identification exception in a manner which admits in evidence on direct examination the criminal aspects of the other encounters of Officer James with appellant. Each case must be evaluated on its facts and circumstances in light of the principles discussed in the court's opinion; and these principles, when examined in more depth, include the .considerations advanced in this dissent. Moreover, it does not appear from the opinions in Blunt v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 404 F.2d 1283 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 909, 89 S.Ct. 1021, 21 L.Ed.2d 221 (1969), and Bradley v.

In <em>Dreiv </em>the court concluded that joint trial was not permissible though the offenses were far more distinct than those in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b921-19\">. <em>See </em>McCormick, Law of Evidence \u00a7 157, at 332 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-20\">It is rather ironic that all sentences in the present case run concurrently, as though but one offense occurred. Conviction in one or more separate trials would no doubt have entailed no different sentence. The prejudice, however, comes from the fact that if the offenses had been tried separately the identification evidence would appropriately have been freed of the criminal connotations of the separate encounters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
