Plaintiffs-petitioners seek a writ of <em>mandamus </em>directing the Honorable Dudley B. Bonsai, United States District Judge of the Southern District of New York, to reverse a decision and order signed January 6, 1972. That order denied to plaintiffs-petitioners the right to depose certain of defendants-respondents' officers in order to establish standing and subject matter jurisdiction in federal district court. For the reasons set forth below and subject to the limitations herein, the petition for <em>mandamus </em>is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Plaintiffs-petitioners brought this action for damages for violations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and for violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. A request for a preliminary injunction was denied by Judge Marvin E. Frankel on the basis that the \u201cdrastic remedy ... of interim restraint\u201d was improper, since it appeared likely that the individual prosecuting the suit lacked capacity to bring it in the name of the corporate plaintiff, and since \u201cvery substantial doubts\u201d existed as to whether plaintiffs could succeed in establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\">Thereupon plaintiffs-petitioners served a notice of taking depositions of certain named officers of defendant and its subsidiaries, the examination to be limited to the threshold issues of standing and jurisdiction. Defendants-respondents subsequently moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) (1), before Judge Dudley B. Bonsai, for. an order vacating plaintiffs-pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>titioners\u2019 notice of taking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Bonsai granted the motion \u201cwithout prejudice to further discovery if it is determined that this Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The writ of <em>mandamus </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is in general \u201c \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes,\u2019 \u201d Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., 376 U.S. 240, 245, 84 S. Ct. 769, 11 L.Ed.2d 674 (1964), <em>quoting </em>Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 260, 67 S. Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947), and is employed only \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 273, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967), <em>quoting </em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Association, 319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S. Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943); see Allied Air Freight, Inc. v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 340 F.2d 160, 161 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 924, 85 S.Ct. 1560, 14 L.Ed.2d 683 (1965). Thus mandamus \u201cserves a vital corrective and didactic function,\u201d Will v. United States, <em>supra, </em>389 U.S. at 107, 88 S.Ct. at 280, in those exceptional cases where a \u201c \u2018usurpation of judicial power\u2019 or a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 110, 85 S.Ct. 234, 238, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964), <em>quoting </em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379, 383, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953), compels \u2014 contrary to the traditional jurisprudential notion of review, Will v. United States, <em>supra, </em>389 U.S. at 96, 88 S.Ct. 269 \u2014 appellate review prior to a rendering of a final judgment by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The narrow restraints on the general use of <em>mandamus </em>are all the more difficult to apply vis-a-vis the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure discovery provisions, which to a large extent rely for their effectiveness on the discretion of the trial judge. It is settled in this circuit, however, that \u201c[w]hen a discovery question is of extraordinary significance or there is extreme need for reversal of the district court's mandate before the case goes to judgment, there are escape hatches from the finality rule: . . . [one being] ... an extraordinary writ.\u201d American Express Warehousing, Ltd. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., 380 F.2d 277, 282 (2d Cir. 1967). \u201cExtraordinary significance\u201d and \u201cextreme need for reversal\u201d are standards that are not self-executing. They are to be defined and measured \u2014 in deciding whether to entertain a <em>mandamus </em>proceeding \u2014 by the touchstones of \u201cusurpation of power, clear abuse of discretion and presence of an issue of first impression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283 [interpreting and applying Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 85 S.Ct. 234, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964)].</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">Judge Bonsai clearly had the power to vacate plaintiffs-petitioners\u2019 notices of deposition. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (c) (1). Nevertheless, the issue here is one of first impression, and the vacation reveals, through its consequences, an abuse of discretion. Discovery here, furthermore, is not a matter of mere \u201chousekeeping,\u201d <em>see </em>American Express Warehousing, Ltd. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., <em>supra, </em>380 F.2d at 284, but is the heart of the controversy, for on it turns plaintiffs-petitioners\u2019 right to be in court. The order below makes it virtually impossible to discover the facts on which jurisdiction and standing turn, and thus puts the plaintiffs-petitioners in a cul-de-sac which the Federal Rules never contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">While Judge Bonsai did not give the rationale for this portion of his order, Judge Frankel in denying the earlier request for preliminary relief had stated that there were \u201csharp disputes\u201d concerning the dates and places of the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>actions alleged to form the basis of jurisdiction, see CCH Fed.Sec.L.Rep. \u00b6 93,011, at 90,736 (1971). Furthermore, Judge Frankel noted, <em>id. </em>at 90,733:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\">With respect to some of [the involved stock transactions], plaintiffs say they need an evidentiary hearing or state that they need time to inspect certain records. The court has no desire to foreclose their inquiries. The case may be an appropriate one for trial, and perhaps plaintiffs could profit from discovery. But that is another story for another day. The existence of substantial factual disputes may itself weigh against granting preliminary relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Plaintiffs-petitioners essentially argue that Arthur Adelson, who is prosecuting this action, became its president after the transactions purportedly supporting jurisdiction had taken place, and that the truth of those matters lies only within the knowledge and control of defendants-respondents\u2019 officers. Defendants-respondents answer that Adelson did have \u201caccess to information which should have enabled him to make at least a minimal showing of a basis of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Which allegation is true is unknown to us, yet it seems to us that Judge Bonsai\u2019s order \u2014 which limits all further discovery, not just depositions, until jurisdiction is established \u2014 places plaintiffs-petitioners\u2019 case in limbo, from which there is no appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To move forward at all with the case, plaintiffs-petitioners must prove jurisdictional facts at trial; to accomplish that, however, discovery may well be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Furthermore, an order to vacate a notice of taking is generally regarded as both unusual and unfavorable, <em>see </em>8 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2037, at 272 (1970), especially</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">[i]n view of the general philosophy of full discovery of relevant facts and the broad statement of scope in Rule 26, and in view of the power of the court under Rules 26(c) and 30(d) to control the details of time, place, scope, and financing for the protection of the deponents and parties. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">4 J. Moore, Federal Practice 26.69, at 26-493, 494 (2d ed. 1971). <em>Cf. </em>Littlejohn v. Shell Oil Co., 456 F.2d 225 (5th Cir., 1972) (2-1 decision) (error to grant motion for summary judgment \u201cbefore the plaintiff had been afforded the opportunity to utilize discovery to develop basic jurisdictional facts from data solely within the defendants\u2019 possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">We consider the order in this case as creating the exceptional circumstances necessary to support the extraordinary writ of mandamus, and we find the criteria of the <em>Schlagenhauf </em>and <em>American Express </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>to be satisfied. <em>See also </em>International Products Corp. v. Koons, 325 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1963) (case remanded with suggested modification, application for writ allowed if modification not made); Madison-Lewis, Inc. v. MacMahon, 299 F.2d 256 (2d Cir. 1962) (writ granted; 2-1 decision); 4 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 26.83 [9.-4], at 26-612-622 (2d ed. 1971). Thus we grant the petition for writ of mandamus and direct the district judge to vacate his order entered January 6, 1972, which order vacated plaintiffs-petitioners\u2019 notices of discovery, including depositions, and to allow such limited discovery as will permit the trial court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and whether plaintiffs have standing to prosecute this action. In respect both to standing and to subject matter jurisdiction discovery must be aimed at the production of factual matter other than what appears in the opinion of Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Frankel denying preliminary relief or the orders of Judge Bonsai filed herein. Needless to say, if plaintiffs at any time abuse their privileges hereunder, the way will remain open to defendants to apply to the district court for appropriate relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Judgment in accordance with opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-15\">. The facts of the case, and especially those relative to the standing and jurisdiction issues, are discussed extensively in Judge Marvin E. Frankel\u2019s opinion denying preliminary relief, published in CCH Fed. Sec.L.Rep. \u00b6 93,011, at 90,726 (S.D.N.Y. April 21, 1971). On an expedited appeal, this court affirmed that decision without an opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. Or, .alternatively, for an order specifying the way in which any depositions could be taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), grants to the federal courts the power to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\">. It is, of course, possible for the court below to hear the jurisdictional and standing questions on affidavits only, as well ns on oral testimony or depositions. Fed. R.Civ.P. 43(e). But affidavits based on mere supposition or only of a conclusory nature might well be held insufficient. <em>See, e. g., </em>Unicon Management Corp. v. Hoppers Co., 250 F.Supp. 850 (S.D.N.Y.1966). <em>See also </em>5 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 43.13 at 1385 (2d ed. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
