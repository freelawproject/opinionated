Murray, Senior District Judge, District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1066-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">This action concerns a contest over the proceeds of a United States Government Life Insurance policy, between Frances Taylor, daughter of the deceased and executrix of his will, on the one hand, and Myrtle L. Jarvey, a divorced wife and the designated beneficiary of the life policy, on the other. The statutes involved are part of the 1958 revision of Title 38, U.S.C., entitled \u201cVeterans\u2019 Benefits,\u201d particularly Chapter 19 thereof, Sections 701-88, and Chapter 53, P.L. 85-857, September 2, 1958, 72 Stat. 1105, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The question presented is \u2014 Do federal statutes and regulations control problems involving the right of a beneficiary to recover on such a policy? We hold they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Winslow' was the owner of a Government Life Policy in the sum of $10,000. In 1964 he designated Myrtle Winslow, then his wife, as beneficiary. No change of beneficiary' was ever filed with the Government. Winslow and Myrtle were divorced in 1968. Winslow died two months later. Myrtle remarried and became Myrtle Jarvey, the ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">The divorce decree provided that Myrtle was ordered to \u201cwaive and relinquish any claim which she may have against defendant (Winslow) for payment of support, maintenance, or alimony, and any claim which she may now or in the future have, as heir, legatee, devisee, creditor or otherwise against the defendant\u2019s estate.\u201d Myrtle was also ordered \u201cto turn over to the defendant all his personal papers . . . . \u201d The record is otherwise bare of any evidence manifesting Winslow\u2019s intent to remove Myrtle as beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">The trial court rendered judgment for Myrtle Jarvey and Taylor appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-14\">The federal statutes and their regulations control questions as to the right to recover under United States Government Life policies. Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U.S. 655, 70 S.Ct. 398, 94 L.Ed. 424 (1950) (involving a National Service Life Insurance policy, and National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1008, amended). \u201cThere is ... a marked distinction between the criteria for judicial construction of an ordinary commercial insurance contract, and construction of the provisions of an act of Congress setting up a system of national life insurance for servicemen to be administered by a governmental agency.\u201d United States v. Zazove, 334 U.S. 602, 610, 68 S.Ct. 1284, 1288, 92 L.Ed. 1601 (1948) (involving National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">The various cases cited by the parties involving commercial life insurance policies do not control this case. On the contrary, this case is controlled by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 749, 3101(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 847 and the federal cases. Wissner v. Wissner, su<em>pra; </em>Pack v. United States (9 Cir. 1949) 176 F.2d 770; Fitzstephens v. United States (D.Wyo.1960) 189 F. Supp. 919;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hoffman v. United States (9 Cir. 1968) 391 F.2d 195; Suydam v. United States (1968) 131 U.S.App.D.C: 352, 404 F.2d 1329; and Kimball v. United States (6 Cir. 1962) <em>304 </em>F.2d 864.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>O\u2019Brien v. Elder (5 Cir. 1957) 250 F. 2d 275, relied on by appellant did not even cite <em>Wissner, supra, </em>decided in 1950, and is contra to the array of authority above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">In our ease, the divorce decree did not effect a change of beneficiary. Nothing in the divorce decree concerned relinquishment of Myrtle Jarvey\u2019s claim to the proceeds of the life insurance policy. If she relinquished anything concerning the insurance, it was as to any claim against Winslow but not her claim against the insurer, the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">We do not reach appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge relied on alleged hearsay for an alternative ground for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">. 38 U.S.C. 3101(a) reads in part, \u2014 \u201cPayments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by tlie Veterans\u2019 Administration shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1066-16\">.
