We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">Villella was arrested June 6, 1971, and released on bail September 13, 1971, two days before the commencement of trial. On September 14, his counsel moved for a continuance on the ground that appellant had been unable to aid counsel in locating two defense witnesses. No attempt had been made to locate the two witnesses; no good reason was advanced why his counsel could not have searched for them with the help of his client\u2019s direction. The denial of the motion was within the court\u2019s discretion. See United States v. Harris, 9 Cir., 1970, 436 F.2d 775, 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">Villella also claims that his arrest was illegal. Whatever the merits of this contention, it is irrelevant for purposes of reviewing his conviction. See Frisbie v. Collins, 1952, 342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541; Albrecht v. United States, 1927, 273 U.S. 1, 8, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L.Ed. 505. The arrest did not produce evidence that was used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
