A green Volkswagen Beetle identifiable as Miss Mishoe\u2019s by certain distinctive scratches and containing a pair of prescription glasses belonging to Miss Mishoe\u2019s sister, was observed by a paid FBI informant in a garage at Haynes Used Auto Parts located in An-niston, Alabama, on January 15, 1969. The car, the informant observed, was being worked on by appellants Burgess and Rogers, who were known to frequent the Haynes garage, and were not, as was the informant, employed by Haynes. The informant testified that appellant Burgess, with the informant\u2019s assistance, recoupled the gas gauge of the vehicle. Omitting any further reference to Burgess, the informant detailed how appellant Rogers removed the seats and other distinctive marks <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from the Volks<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>wagen. The informant copied an engine block number from a Volkswagen engine which was lying in the garage. Records indicated that the engine bearing that number was installed in the Volkswagen sold to Miss Mishoe in 1966. This same engine was installed by the informant at the request of appellant Jimmy Richard Haynes into ' Jimmy Haynes\u2019 dune buggy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Expert testimony indicated that the body of Miss Mishoe\u2019s Volkswagen had been removed from its chassis and placed on another Volkswagen chassis. The evidence further demonstrated that appellant Jimmy Richard Haynes negotiated the sale of a hybrid rebuilt green Volkswagen, the same automobile as that bearing the body of Miss Mishoe\u2019s car. The sale was made to an innocent third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The district court granted Grover Donald Haynes\u2019 and Grover Jesse Haynes\u2019 motions for judgments of acquittal, Donald\u2019s before the case was submitted to the jury and Jesse\u2019s after the verdict was returned. The court denied each of the appellants\u2019 similar motions. On this appeal we are not concerned with the correctness of the district court\u2019s actions regarding Grover Donald Haynes and Grover Jesse Haynes. We agree, however, with appellant Burgess that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and as to him we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The evidence of Burgess\u2019 participation in this case shows nothing more than association with appellant Rogers and slight work on the Volkswagen. The evidence fails to prove knowledge on his part that the vehicle had been stolen, an essential element.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">With appellants Rogers and Jimmy Richard Haynes, however, we disagree and affirm. As indicated above, there was ample evidence of acts of concealment and sale performed by these appellants which a reasonably minded jury might accept as adequate to support a conclusion of their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Knox, 458 F.2d 612 (5th Cir., 1972); United States v. Crane, 445 F.2d 509 (5th Cir., 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Appellants Rogers and Jimmy Richard Haynes additionally challenge the prosecution\u2019s use of the presumption arising from recent possession of stolen goods in their closing argument. The appellants assert that an argument stated in terms of a defendant\u2019s unexplained recent possession of stolen property may not be used when the defendant rests at the close of the Government\u2019s case lest it amount to a comment upon defendant\u2019s exercise of a Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">Certainly the Government may not directly comment on appellants\u2019 exercise of their Fifth Amendment privilege, or on their refusal to take the stand. United States v. Rhoden, et al., 453 F.2d 598 (5th Cir., 1972); United States v. Bur-sten, 453 F.2d 605 (5th Cir., 1971). As we stated in <em>Bursten, supra, </em>however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">\u201cCommentary on the defense strategy of putting the Government to its proof may ... be proper so long as it does not amount to a veiled invitation to the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify .... [Citations omitted.] Not every characterization of the evidence or of the defendant\u2019s case made in the course of advocacy is to be taken as a comment on the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify.\u201d 453 F.2d 605, at 610.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">The thrust of the inquiry into the matter is not whether the comment was directed to a culpatory inference but whether it was directed toward the failure of the defendants themselves to testify. Simply because the defendants in a case elect not to proceed with a defense does not eliminate the prosecution\u2019s right to rely on any inferences to be drawn from recent possession of stolen goods. It does require that the court exercise special care in its charge to the jury. Fitzpatrick v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>States, 410 F.2d 513 (5th Cir., 1969); Knowles v. United States, 224 F.2d 168 (10th Cir., 1955). The court\u2019s charge in this case demonstrates the necessary-care for appellants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights. The court\u2019s oral charge on the issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cPossession of property recently stolen if not satisfactorily explained is a circumstance from which the jury may reasonably draw the inference and find that the person in possession knew the property had been stolen. The same inference may reasonably be drawn from a false explanation of such possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018recently\u2019 is a relative term which has no fixed meaning. Whether property may be considered as recently stolen depends upon the nature of the property and all the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence. The longer the period of time since the theft, the weaker the inference which may be drawn from unexplained possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cIn considei\u2019ing whether possession of recently stolen property has been satisfactorily explained, the jury will bear in mind that in the exercise of constitutional rights the accused need not take the witness stand and testify. Possession may be satisfactorily explained through other circumstances, other evidence, independent of any testimony of the accused.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We have examined the remainder of appellants\u2019 assertions that their trial was so prejudiced that a new trial was required and we find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The judgment of conviction as to appellants Jimmy Richard Haynes and Henry Rogers is affirmed and the judgment as to appellant Burgess is reversed with instructions to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 2313. Sale or receipt of stolen vehicles</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">Whoever receives, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of any motor vehicle or aircraft, moving as, or which is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-23\">.
