YOUNG, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b231-26\">Mastrom, Inc. seeks damages and an injunction against a group of its former employees who constituted the entire \u201cprofessional\u201d staff *of its Greenville, South Carolina office. Led by defendant Mulvaney, the employees have formed a competing corporation, performing the same services while using the same telephone number and occupying the same building used and occupied while they were employees of Mastrom. Two letters have been relied upon by the parties, a letter dated June 19, 1969 written by Mastrom\u2019s Executive Vice President to each client served by the Greenville office,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and followed on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>21 by a letter to the same clients written by defendant Mulvaney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between the date of these letters and June 30, the defendants removed the clients\u2019 files from Mastrom\u2019s Greenville office and delivered them to the clients to whom they belonged. Mastrom primarily complains of the June 21 letter and the removal of the files. Following a trial to the court, the trial judge entered judgment for defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Mastrom, Inc. raises four issues on appeal: (1) whether appellee Mulvaney breached a duty to Mastrom in terminating his employment and engaging in a competing business; (2) whether Mas-trom had obtained an interest in the term \u201cProfessional Management\u201d of such a nature as to deny its use to ap-pellees in the area of competition; (3) whether plaintiff proved compensable damages as a result of a breach of duty by appellees; and (4) whether the trial court abuse'd its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial. We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Considering appellant\u2019s first and third contentions together, we conclude (1) that appellee Mulvaney did not breach any duty arising from a covenant not to compete with Mastrom, and (2) that even if appellees breached a common law duty arising from their employment, Mastrom has failed to prove that the breach resulted in compensable damage to Mastrom. The law of North Carolina, where the written contract was allegedly executed, does not favor enforcement of covenants not to compete, Kadis v. Britt, 224 N.C. 154, 29 S.E.2d 543 (1944), and the trial judge was clearly correct in declining to draft and enforce such a covenant when the contract containing the covenant was not in evidence, its terms were disputed and it had been superseded in a number of respects following its execution. The removal of the client files from the local Mastrom office and their return to the individual clients\u2019 offices and Mulvaney\u2019s June 21 letter to the Greenville clients may have been a breach of a common law duty arising out of appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>lees\u2019 employment. However, we do not decide this point, since appellant has failed to establish that appellees\u2019 actions brought about the loss of appellant\u2019s Greenville business.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The trial judge found as a fact that much of the value of the Greenville office was directly attributable to the employees at that office, and this is undisputed ; therefore, when the entire staff of that office departed, in whatever manner, they would inevitably take much of the value of the office with them. As to any value which the office had, or should have had, after appellees\u2019 departure, the trial judge also found as a fact that Mastrom had abandoned its Greenville clientele to appellees. This finding is disputed by appellant, but it does not appear to be clearly erroneous; on the contrary it is supported by much of the evidence, in particular the June 19 letter to the Greenville clients from Mastrom\u2019s Executive Vice President and the failure of anyone from Mastrom\u2019s main office to visit the Greenville location until after June 30, the effective date of the Greenville staff\u2019s resignations.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that Mastrom had obtained an interest in the term \u201cProfessional Management\u201d of such a nature as to deny its use to appellees in the Greenville area. This argument is in conflict with the trial judge\u2019s second finding of fact, to the effect that Mastrom \u201chas not registered the trade-mark \u2018Professional Management\u2019 and does not own a possessory interest in same\u201d and that appellees \u201cdid not intend or attempt, by their use of the name Professional Management, Inc., after July 1, 1969, to pass themselves off\u201d as appellant. This finding is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Finally, appellant urges that the trial judge should have declared a mistrial because of his demonstrations of hostility to appellant\u2019s case and lawyer. We have examined the record in this connection and find no evidence to support this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-17\">. Jack C.
