Moreover, the court concluded, in regard to the exception provided by Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965), that the evidence failed to establish a threat of irreparable harm or a purpose by the state to harass, intimidate, or otherwise discourage the Negro citizens of Perry from exercising their right of free speech. Although these findings were made by the district court on July 9, 1970, well before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), they substantially conform to the requirements enunciated in that case. Moreover, we find no unusual circumstances present in the instant case sufficient to overcome the strong policy against federal interference with pending state criminal prosecutions. <em>See also </em>Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971); Boyle v. Landry, 401 U.S. 77, 91 S.Ct. 758, 27 L.Ed.2d 696 (1971); Perez v.
