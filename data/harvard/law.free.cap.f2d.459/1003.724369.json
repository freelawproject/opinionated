United States, 9 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 64. After hearing evidence of the duration and severity of Hord\u2019s addiction and its effect on his behavioral controls, the District Judge struck the evidence as irrelevant, found Hord guilty, and sentenced him to nine years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-21\">Hord appeals, contending (1) that the District Judge committed reversible error in striking the evidence regarding his addiction and (2) that the provisions of the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4251, that disqualify him from sentencing under that A.ct are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>We find it unnecessary in this case to decide (1) whether or under what circumstances addiction to heroin may be such a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d as is referred to in <em>Wade, supra, </em>or (2) when, and if so to what extent, the government must produce evidence to meet the \u201cslight evidence\u201d offered by the defendant when that evidence .is sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">In this case the trial judge did err in striking the defendant\u2019s evidence; it was both relevant and competent. However, the error was harmless. The expert testimony offered by Hord was equivocal and speculative. Its net effect was that Hord could appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and conform it to the requirements of the law because he had had a \"fix\u201d and was therefore not subject to the pressure of withdrawal symptoms. The judge ruled that even if the evidence was relevant, it was insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to Hord\u2019s guilt. That determination was not erroneous. The objection as to the NARA provisions was not raised before the trial court and, therefore, cannot be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
