In an earlier appeal we held that the so-called Three Sisters Bridge could not be built except in compliance with the hearing, environmental protection, safety, and other provisions of federal law applicable to the construction of federally-assisted highway projects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That question, accordingly, is no longer open. We must now decide whether the Department of Transportation did, in fact and in law, heed the applicable federal statutes when it decided that the bridge should be built. On the basis of an extended factual inquiry, the District Court concluded that the Department had failed to comply with some of the provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm that part of the District Court\u2019s judgment. As to the provisions with which the District Court found compliance, however, we have concluded that the statutory requirements were not satisfied, and the case will therefore be remanded to afford the Secretary an opportunity to make appropriate determinations as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">The factual background of this dispute has been described in detail in our earlier opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in the opinion of the District Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Briefly stated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>controversy concerns a projected bridge between the Georgetown waterfront in the District of Columbia and Spout Run in Virginia. The bridge, which would be part of the Interstate Highway System and would be built largely with federal funds, would traverse the Three Sisters Islands, would \u201caffect the Georgetown Historic District,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and would use some parkland. The precise amount of harm to parkland and historic sites has not yet been determined, however, since the planning of the bridge \u2014including the approaches and access roads \u2014 is not yet finalized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A source of continuous controversy since its conception, the proposed bridge was deleted from the Interstate Highway System in January, 1969, when the National Capital Planning Commission, the official planning body for the District, adopted \u201ca comprehensive transportation plan which did not include the Three Sisters Bridge.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The bridge was redesignated part of the Interstate System six months later after Representative Natcher, Chairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the House Appropriations Committee, indicated unmistakably that money for construction of the District\u2019s subway system would be withheld if the bridge plan were not revived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To satisfy the Chairman, it was necessary, first, for the Distinct of Columbia City Council to reverse its earlier position,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and vote to approve the project. On August 9, 1969, the District government so voted, with the swing members loudly protesting that they would not have changed their votes but for the pressures exerted by Representative Natcher.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The second prerequisite of redesignation was a decision by Transportation Secretary Volpe that the project should go ahead as part of the Interstate System. He announced that decision on August 12, 1969, and the project sprang full-blown back to life on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">On April 6, 1970, we held that the hearing and planning requirements of title 23 of the United States Code were fully applicable to this project notwithstanding a 1968 Act directing that construction of the bridge begin not later than thirty days after the Act\u2019s passage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Secretary had complied with the pertinent provisions in concluding that the project should be revived. The case is before us on appeal and cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">Given our earlier decision, the Secretary\u2019s approval of the bridge must be predicated on compliance with a number of statutory provisions. Plaintiffs<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> challenged with two lines of argument the District Court\u2019s finding of compliance. First, they maintain that the Secretary\u2019s determinations under the statute were tainted by his consideration of extraneous factors unrelated to the merits of the questions presented. They allege \u2014 and argue, moreover, that the District Court specifically found \u2014 that pressures exerted by Representative Natcher contributed to the decision to approve the bridge. Second, they argue that quite apart from the allegations of pressure, the record and applicable legal principles do not support a finding of compliance. The two strands of argument are plainly related, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, since the alleged shortcomings un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>der each statutory provision illustrate and lend substance to the argument that the rational, impartial evaluation of the project envisioned by the statute was impermissibly distorted by extraneous pressures. We consider first plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the determinations could not stand even if there were no issue of extraneous pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\"><em>A. Requirements of </em>\u00a7 <em>IS8</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">If a proposed federally-assisted highway project would encroach on parkland or historic sites, the Secretary of Transportation must determine before construction can begin that there is \u201cno feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land,\u201d and, assuming such a finding, that the \u201cprogram includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park * * * or historic <em>site.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12a</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The District Court concluded that Secretary Volpe had complied with each of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">In defending the Secretary\u2019s action, the government can hardly maintain that there was no \u201cfeasible\u201d alternative to construction of the Three Sisters Bridge. This exemption applies, as the Supreme Court indicated in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, only if the Secretary finds that \u201cas a matter of <em>sound engineering </em>it would not be feasible to build the highway along any other route.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It could still be argued, however, that the Secretary rejected each of the feasible alternatives because none of them was \u201cprudent.\u201d In construing this second exemption, the Supreme Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-17\">the very existence of the statute indicates that protection of parkland was to be given paramount importance. The few green havens that are public parks were not to be lost unless there were truly unusual factors present in' a particular case or the cost or community disruption resulting from alternative routes reached extraordinary magnitudes. If the statutes are to have any meaning, the Secretary cannot approve the destruction of parkland unless he finds that alternative routes present unique problems.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aox-dedup-1\"> Our review of the Secretary\u2019s determination is hindered not only by the lack of any formal findings, but also by the absence of a \u201cmeaningful administrative record within the Department of Transportation evidencing the fact that proper consideration has been given to the requirements of this section.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However regrettable, the failure to provide explicit findings indicating why all possible alternatives to the bridge would be unfeasible or imprudent does not, in itself, invalidate the Secretary\u2019s action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But the complete non-existence of any contemporaneous administrative record is more serious. Absent a record, judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s action can be little more than a formality<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> unless the District Court takes the disfavored step of requiring the Secretary to testify as to the basis of his decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And even the Secretary\u2019s <em>\u201cpost hoe </em>rationalizations,\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> filtered through a factfind<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>er\u2019s understandable reluctance to disbelieve the testimony of a Cabinet officer, will rarely provide an effective basis for review. Furthermore, it is hard to see how, without the aid of any record, the Secretary could satisfactorily make the determinations required by statute. The absence of a record, in other words, simultaneously obfuscates the process of review and signals sharply the need for careful scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Secretary Volpe\u2019s testimony before the District Court did little to allay the doubts generated by the lack of an administrative record. Indeed, his testimony \u2014 on occasion uncertain and inconsistent with the testimony of others<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014itself gives rise to at least a serious question whether he considered all possible alternatives to the plan eventually approved. It is clear, moreover, that the Department of Transportation failed to apply its own procedures generally applicable to determinations under \u00a7 138.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That failure is especially disquieting since the procedures at issue were designed specifically to insure that determinations under \u00a7 138 would be made, in the Secretary\u2019s words, only after \u201ca great amount of real independent and genuine review [by] people who were not particularly highway oriented . \u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Furthermore, an apparent misconception about our earlier decision may itself have distorted the Secretary\u2019s determination under \u00a7 138. The government has read our earlier opinion to mean that a bridge must be built, albeit in accordance with the provisions of title 23, somewhere in the vicinity of the proposed Three Sisters Bridge. Congress did direct, as we previously indicated, \u201cthat a bridge be built over the Potomac following the general configurations laid out in the cost estimates.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Viewed in context, however, the statement does not convey the meaning which the government suggests, for we held that \u201cnothing in the statute indicates that Congress intended the Bridge to be built contrary to its own laws.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the bridge cannot be built consistently with applicable law, then plainly it must not be built. It is not inconceivable, for example, that the Secretary might determine that present and foreseeable traffic needs can be handled (perhaps by expansion of existing bridges) without construction of an additional river crossing. In that case, an entirely prudent and feasible alternative to the Three Sisters Bridge might be no bridge at all,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and its construction would violate \u00a7 138. Thus, the Secretary may have disregarded one possible prudent and feasible al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>ternative to the use of parkland and historic sites on the mistaken assumption that that alternative was foreclosed by our earlier decision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">While these difficulties give rise to at least a substantial inference .that the Secretary failed to comply with \u00a7 138, that inference ripens into certainty when one turns to the second determination required by \u00a7 138. Before the project can begin, the Secretary must determine that all possible planning has been done to minimize harm to the affected parkland and historic sites. Yet the District Court found, and the Secretary apparently concedes, that final design of the ramps and interchanges is not yet complete. Thus, when Secretary Volpe purportedly complied with \u00a7 138 in August, 1969, he could at best have been \u201csatisfied * * * that the designs which <em>would be </em>developed based on the preliminary plans <em>would </em>result in a minimum taking of parkland,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but he could not have concluded that the necessary planning had already been'done. The District Court reasoned that the expectation of future planning could satisfy \u00a7 138. But that reasoning seems inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent admonition that \u00a7 138 can be obeyed \u201conly if there <em>has been </em>\u2018all possible planning to minimize harm\u2019 to the park.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, the District Court approved the \u00a7 138 determination on the basis of the Secretary\u2019s testimony that a \u201cminimum of parkland would be taken\u201d for the ramps and interchanges.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> More is at stake, however, than the \u201cminimum taking\u201d of parkland. Section 138 speaks in terms of minimizing \u201charm\u201d to parkland and historic sites, and the evaluation of harm requires a far more subtle calculation than merely totaling the number of acres to be asphalted. For example, the location of the affected acres in relation to the remainder of the parkland may be a more important determination, from the standpoint of harm to the park, than determining the number of affected acres. The Secretary has not yet determined which acres will be taken. In addition, a project which respects a park\u2019s territorial integrity may still, by means of noise, air pollution and general unsightliness, dissipate its aesthetic value, crush its wildlife, defoliate its vegetation, and \u201ctake\u201d it in every practical sense.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">Absent a finalized plan for the bridge, it is hard to see how the Department could make a meaningful evaluation of \u201charm.\u201d Furthermore, Secretary Volpe did not consult with other planning agencies to coordinate efforts to minimize harm to the park and historic sites.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> He also made no studies of potential air pollution damage to the park. His approval of the project under \u00a7 138 was, in short, entirely premature, and we hold that he must make new determinations consistent with the statutory standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\"><em>B. Requirements of </em>\u00a7 <em>134</em></p>\n<p id=\"amb-dedup-1\">The Secretary cannot approve federally-assisted highway projects in urban areas unless he finds \u201cthat such projects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>are based on a continuing comprehensive transportation planning process\u201d carried out in conformance with Congress\u2019s objective of promoting the development of transportation systems.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Secretary reasoned, and the District Court approved his reasoning, that the bridge project was consistent with such a planning process since the bridge had been approved by, and was subject to the continuing scrutiny of, the Transportation Planning Board (TPB) of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, on the other hand, emphatically deny compliance with \u00a7 134 on the grounds that the \u201ccomprehensive transportation plan promulgated by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) in December 1968, specifically \u2018rejects the Three Sisters Bridge . as being both unnecessary and undesirable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> While plaintiffs point out that NCPC is the official planning agency for the District of Columbia and that it alone has prepared a comprehensive transportation plan, the government contends that the Council of Governments, unlike the NCPC, is a regional organization which must consider the interests of the surrounding jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">We are unwilling to resolve this dispute by some abstract balancing of NCPC disapproval against TPB approval. That approach would, we are convinced, entirely miss the point of \u00a7 134. That section does not suggest that the Secretary has satisfied his statutory responsibility as soon as he has found a single plan which incorporates a proposed highway project. Nor can it reasonably be interpreted to mean that the project must be approved by every plan applicable to the affected region. The section speaks, after all, in terms of \u201cplanning,\u201d not \u201cplans,\u201d and it is not our function to decide that one plan has merit while another does not. Rather, it is for the Secretary to determine whether a particular project will be consistent with sound transportation planning for the region.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">Decisionmaking responsibility under \u00a7 134 has been delegated by Secretary Volpe to the Public Roads Division Engineer, Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall disregarded NCPC disapproval of the project because he believed that \u201cTPB [was] the primary agency to which he should look in making his finding.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The District Court approved his finding on that same reasoning. But that reasoning cannot do service for the more sophisticated determination required by the statute. In making his \u201cmental\u201d finding <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> of compliance with \u00a7 134, Mr. Hall apparently did no more than adopt TPB\u2019s conclusion that the project was \u201cconsistent with comprehensive planning\u201d for the region.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Yet that is precisely the determination that the Department of Transportation, taking into account the recommendations of local plans, must make. The statute plainly does not permit the Department to delegate its statutory responsibility to a local planning agency. On remand, the Department must reevaluate the project in light of the purposes of \u00a7 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">Since the determination was not grounded on a correct understanding of the statute\u2019s requirements, we need not now decide whether the substantive result, if reached pursuant to appropriate procedures, would itself be supportable. But to aid the Department\u2019s redetermi-nation under \u00a7 134, we should make clear our misgivings about the result and our doubts that it could be upheld on the present record even under the constrained standard of substantive review.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> TPB approved the bridge project in 1967, two years before Mr. Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>made his finding under \u00a7 134.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> No comprehensive transportation plan had been adopted at that time, either by TPB or any other planning agency. NCPC, which did not formulate its plan until December, 1968, was on record at the time of TPB\u2019s action in 1967 as approving- the bridge project. TPB approved the project not under \u00a7 134, but under the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> NCPC, on the other hand, developed a transportation plan in response to President Johnson\u2019s call for the development of a \u201ccomprehensive plan for a D.C. highway system\u201d which would permit the Department of Transportation to determine whether the Three Sisters Bridge and other projects would be \u201cappropriate links\u201d in such a plan; <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it then rejected the bridge proposal. And even if TPB approval were not \u2014 at least on its face \u2014 stale, inapposite, and unsupported by any underlying, comprehensive plan, we would still have difficulty accepting the Department\u2019s finding without some explanation of how the \u00a7 134 determination could be made <em>before </em>plans for the bridge are finalized.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Nothing in the record suggests that TPB approval\u2014 whatever its other apparent shortcomings \u2014 embraced each conceivable design that might eventually be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\"><em>C. Requirements of </em>\u00a7 <em>109(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The Secretary\u2019s approval of plans for a federally-assisted highway project is conditioned on a determination that the proposed facility will \u201cadequately meet the existing and probable future traffic needs and conditions in a manner conducive to safety, durability, and economy of maintenance.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The District Court held that planning for the Three Sisters Bridge had not \u201cproceeded to a sufficient degree for the responsible officials to determine that the planned facility is structurally feasible.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court enjoined construction of the bridge until the planning had advanced to a stage where structural feasibility was assured. We find the District Court\u2019s judgment consistent with the statute' and the facts presented, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">Plaintiffs also argue, however, that the project was approved before the Secretary could be certain, first, that river bed conditions would support the bridge, and second, that no safety hazard would arise from the increase in air pollution attributable to traffic on the bridge. Again, we are unable to accept the District Court\u2019s disposition. With regard to river bed conditions, the District Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-14\">[bjefore the construction of a bridge, it is necessary to make extensive investigations of subsurface conditions to determine if they are sufficient to support the foundations for the bridge piers. This is done primarily by means of borings. * * * At the time Mr. Hall approved the plans, specifications and estimates for the pier construction, these borings had not been completed, and subsequently problems developed so that the plans for the project had to be modified.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"atr-dedup-0\">Called to testify before the District Court, Mr. Hall still could not be certain \u201cthat the present planned foundation is adequate.\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the District Court found compliance with \u00a7 109(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>because of Mr. Hall\u2019s testimony \u201cthat there is no question that the piers can be built to support the bridge as presently planned.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Department of Transportation is obviously unwilling to construct a bridge known to be unsafe, and during the course of construction the Department would surely verify the suitability of the river bed conditions. But \u00a7 109(a) requires not only that the bridge be safe, but also \u2014 and no less important \u2014 that its safety be ascertained <em>before </em>the Secretary approves the project. That requirement minimizes the safety hazards and at the same time insures that public funds will not be squandered on a demonstrably unsafe proposal. Where planning reveals defects in design or location, those defects can be corrected on paper rather than on steel and concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">The District Court\u2019s findings are not entirely clear as to whether questions about the safety of river bed conditions could be more fully resolved before construction resumes. We hold that if such questions do exist, the Secretary must take steps to resolve them to the fullest practical extent before granting approval of the project under \u00a7 109(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Plaintiffs' second contention under \u00a7 109(a) concerns the dangers of air pollution. The District Court concluded that evidence of a potential air pollution hazard was insufficient to support a finding \u201cthat the defendants are required to undertake a study of such [air pollution] effects.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We can find no basis in the statute\u2019s language or purpose for the conclusion that certain hazards are, as a matter of law, immaterial to the Secretary\u2019s evaluation of a project\u2019s safety. The District Court would surely agree that Congress did not intend to permit construction of a bridge in a situation, however rare, where air pollution would be a significant threat to safety. It does not follow, of course, that air pollution will be a significant hazard in all \u2014 or even any \u2014 highway projects. And the District Court apparently concluded that no extraordinary dangers are likely to arise from the Three Sisters Bridge. Still, the gathering and evaluation of evidence on potential pollution hazards is the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation, and he undertook no study of the problem. His staff has far greater resources and expertise on this matter than the District Court, and it is possible that a study by the Department would reveal significant dangers which had escaped the attention of the District Court. Inquiry into this issue cannot be foreclosed merely because the District Court found no significant evidence of air pollution hazards. That determination must be made in the first instance by the Secretary of Transportation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\"><em>D. Requirements of </em>\u00a7 <em>128</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">Section 128 <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> requires that public hearings be held before construction can begin. In the earlier appeal we specifically held applicable to the Three Sisters Bridge project not only \u00a7 128, but also the Department of Transportation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>implementing regulations.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Those regulations require, in certain specified situations, a hearing on project location and a hearing on project design. After exhaustive consideration of the record, the District Court concluded that the Department had not complied with the design hearing requirement, but that the location hearing requirement had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">While the government did not admit error with regard to the design hearing, it nevertheless chose to hold the necessary hearing in a commendable effort to reduce the number of issues outstanding. Since the question has now been mooted, we express no opinion on the District Court\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As for the location hearing, the District Court reasoned that a hearing held in 1964 satisfied the requirement, even though different proposals were the subject of that hearing,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> since the change in plan was \u201cso insubstantial that the public would not be affected any differently than by the original proposal which formed the basis for the first hearing . \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We have no quarrel with the District Court\u2019s reasoning, but on the present record we are unable to accept its application to this case. Of the proposals submitted at the 1964 hearing, the one most similar to current plans for the bridge was still off by 1500 feet on the District of Columbia shore and 950 feet on the Virginia shore.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Ramps and interchanges as well as the routing of traffic have also been substantially redesigned. Nevertheless, the District Court could not \u201cconceive how many members of the public would be affected differently by the present location than by one of the three\u201d considered in 1964.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It is entirely conceivable to us that the differences in the plans would, in fact, have a substantially different impact on persons on both shores. We would be reluctant, of course, to disturb the District Court\u2019s finding of fact on this point if it were clear that a finding had actually been made. But there is no indication in the record before us that the District Court gathered evidence on this issue, and we have nothing to support the conclusion but the conclusion itself. Moreover, in making the determinations required by this opinion, the Secretary may conclude that current plans must be abandoned in favor of a new location. Accordingly, we remand this issue to the District Court for clarification of the factual basis of its conclusion, and for reconsideration in light of any further location changes the Secretary of Transportation may order.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">\n<em>E. Requirements of \u00a7 817</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">If the Secretary determines that lands owned by the United States are needed for a proposed highway project, he must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number><em>file </em>with the Secretary of the Department supervising the administration of such lands or interests in lands a. map showing the portion of such lands or interests in land which it is desired to appropriate.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">After concluding that the bridge project would use federal parklands under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department\u2019s National Park Service, and after noting defendant's admission that a map had not been filed, the District Court still found \u201ccompliance with the spirit, if not' the letter, of \u00a7 317.\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The court based its findings on the consultation between the Transportation and Interior Departments with regard to this project, and on the issuance by the latter of permits for the use of the parkland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">We agree with the District Court that the failure to supply a map should not be an absolute bar to the construction of the bridge if the purposes of \u00a7 317 have in fact been realized. That section is designed, as the District Court acknowledged, to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-5\">require the Secretary of Transportation to give notice to the Secretary of the Department having control of the land, and provide a means by which the latter may protect any governmental interest in use of the property for purposes other than highway construction.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">We need not decide whether the District Court erred in finding compliance with the spirit of \u00a7 317. In view of our conclusion that the case must be remanded for new determinations, it would not appear to be a significant burden on the Department to remove all doubts under this section by filing the appropriate map.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">\n<em>F. Provisions Other Than Title 23</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">At the hearing below, the District Court barred plaintiffs from presenting evidence on \u25a0 a number of allegations in their complaint because those allegations related to statutory provisions which the District Court found inapplicable to the Three Sisters Bridge project. Thus, the Court concluded that the project was exempted by Congress from compliance with certain provisions of the federal Code, as well as provisions of the District of Columbia Code.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-13\">In 1968 we held in D.C. Federation of Civic Associations, Inc. v. Airis<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> that this project must comply with pertinent requirements of the D.C.Code. Later that year, Congress directed, in Section 23 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aru-dedup-0\">[notwithstanding any other provision of law or any court decision or administrative action to the contrary . . . construction [of the Three Sisters Bridge] shall be undertaken as soon as possible . . . and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable provisions of Title 23 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aj7-dedup-0\">The District Court then held explicitly that the Three Sisters Bridge had been exempted from all of the pre-eonstruetion provisions of title 23, and implicitly that the bridge had been exempted from the comparable provisions of the D.C. Code.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> On appeal from that decision, we held that the bridge must comply with all applicable provisions of title 23. Our opinion did not indicate flatly, however, that the project must also comply with non-title 23 provisions. In view of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that compliance with nontitle 23 provisions is not required, we must now resolve the ambiguity arguably left by our earlier opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">The applicability of these provisions was not squarely faced in the parties\u2019 briefs,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> nor was it discussed at oral argument. While our earlier opinion did make one specific reference to the issue, the parties now draw opposite conclusions from that reference. Discussing section 23\u2019s directive that the bridge be built \u201cnotwithstanding any * * * court decision * * * to the contrary,\u201d we pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-5\">[presumably the \u201ccourt decision\u201d language refers to our decision in <em>Airis </em>[holding D.C.Code provisions applicable to the Three Sisters Bridge], but the reference is mistaken since that decision was not \u201cto the contrary.\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to resolve the dispute without providing the parties an opportunity to discuss the question on the merits. Accordingly, we defer judgment on this issue to permit the parties to file, within twenty days from the date of this opinion, memoranda dealing with the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">As Part I of this opinion makes clear, the Secretary\u2019s determinations failed to comply with a significant num- \u2022 ber of title 23 provisions applicable to the Three Sisters Bridge. Taken as a whole, the defects in the Secretary\u2019s determinations \u2014 in particular, his effort to make the determinations before plans for the bridge were complete \u2014 lend color to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the repeated and public threats by a few .Congressional voices did have an impact on the Secretary\u2019s decisions. As the District Court pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-13\">[t]here is no question that the evidence indicates that strong political pressure was applied by certain members of Congress in order to secure approval of the bridge project. Congressman Natcher stated publicly and made no secret of the fact that he would do everything that he could to withhold Congressional appropriations for the District of Columbia rapid transit system, the need for which is universally recognized in the Washington metropolitan area, until the District complied with the 1968 Act.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1-\">When funds for the subway were, in fact, blocked, Representative Natcher</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amg-dedup-0\">made his position perfectly clear, stating that \u201cas soon as the freeway project gets under way beyond recall then we will come back to the House and recommend that construction funds for rapid transit be approved.\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKY\">The author of this opinion is convinced that the impact of this pressure is sufficient, standing alone, to invalidate the Secretary\u2019s action. Even if the Secretary had taken every formal step re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>quired by every applicable statutory provision, reversal would be required, in my -opinion, because extraneous pressure intruded into the calculus of considerations on which the Secretary\u2019s decision was based. Judge Fahy, on the other hand, has concluded that since critical determinations cannot stand irrespective of the allegations of pressure, he finds it unnecessary to decide the ease on this independent ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">In my view, the District Court clearly and unambiguously found as a fact that the pressure exerted by Representative Natcher and others did have an impact on Secretary Volpe\u2019s decision to approve the bridge. The Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-5\">[t]he statement issued by the Secretary at the time he directed the Federal Highway Administrator to restore the bridge to the Interstate System indicates that the pressure on the rapid transit funds <em>was a consideration at that time.</em><footnotemark><em>70</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">The Court also found, on the basis of the Secretary's contemporaneous statements and his testimony before the Court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A09\">There is no question that the pressure regarding the rapid transit appropriations <em>was given some consideration </em>at the time of the approval of the project in August, 1969.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-0\">The Secretary\u2019s testimony indicated, as the court below pointed out, that \u201chis decision was based on the merits of the project and not <em>solely </em>on the extraneous political pressures.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">Notwithstanding these findings of fact, the Court determined as a matter of law that since the Secretary was not acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, his decision would be invalid only if based <em>-solely </em>on these extraneous considerations.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> I cannot accept that formulation of the applicable legal principle. While Judge Fahy is not entirely convinced that the District Court ultimately found as a fact that the extraneous pressure had influenced the Secretary\u2019s decision \u2014 a point which is for me clear- \u2014 he has authorized me to note his concurrence in my discussion of the controlling principle of law: namely, that the decision would be invalid if based in whole or in part on the pressures emanating from Representative Natcher. Judge Fahy agrees, and we therefore hold, that on remand the Secretary must make new determinations based strictly on the merits and completely without regard to any considerations not made relevant by Congress in the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-17\">The District Court was surely correct in concluding that the Secretary\u2019s action was not judicial or quasi-judicial,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and for that reason we agree that much of the doctrine cited by plaintiffs is inap-posite.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> If he had been acting in such a capacity, plaintiffs could have forcefully argued that the decision was invalid because of the decisionmaker\u2019s bias,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> or because he had received ex parte communications.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Well-established principles could have been invoked to support these arguments, and plaintiffs might have prevailed even without showing that the pressure had actually influenced the Secretary\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> With regard to judicial de-cisionmaking, whether by court or agency, the appearance of bias or pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>may be no less objectionable than the reality. But since the Secretary\u2019s action was not judicial, that rationale has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">If, on the other hand, the Secretary\u2019s action had been purely legislative, we might have agreed with the District Court that his decision could stand in spite of a finding that he had considered extraneous pressures. Beginning with Fletcher v. Peck,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has maintained that a statute cannot be invalidated merely because the legislature\u2019s action was motivated by impermissible considerations (except, perhaps, in special circumstances not applicable here<footnotemark>80</footnotemark>). Indeed, that very principle requires us to reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the approval of the bridge by the District of Columbia City Council was in some sense invalid. We do not sit in judgment of the motives of the District\u2019s legislative body, nor do we have authority to review its decisions. The City Council\u2019s action constituted, in our view, the approval of the project required by statute.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-16\">Thus, the underlying problem cannot be illuminated by a simplistic effort to force the Secretary\u2019s action into a purely judicial or purely legislative mold. His decision was not \u201cjudicial\u201d in that he was not required to base it solely on a formal record established at a public hearing. At the same time, it was not purely \u201clegislative\u201d since Congress had already established the boundaries within which his discretion could operate. But even though his action fell between these two conceptual extremes, it is still governed by principles that we had thought elementary and beyond dispute. If, in the course of reaching his decision, Secretary Volpe took into account \u201cconsiderations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> his action proceeded from an erroneous premise<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> and his decision cannot stand.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The error would be more fla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>grant, of course, if the Secretary had based his decision solely on the pressures generated by Representative Natcher. But it should be clear that his action would not be immunized merely because he also considered some relevant factors.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">It is plainly not our function to establish the parameters of relevance. Congress has carried out that task in its delegation of authority to the Secretary of Transportation. Nor are we charged with the power to decide where or when bridges should be built. That responsibility has been entrusted by Congress to, among others, the Secretary, who has the expertise and information to make a decision pursuant to the statutory standards. So long as the Secretary applies his expertise to considerations Congress intended to make relevant, he acts within his discretion and our role as a reviewing court is constrained. We do not hold, in other words that the bridge can never be built. Nor do we know or mean to suggest that the information now available to the Secretary is necessarily insufficient to justify construction of the bridge. We hold only that the Secretary must reach his decision strictly on the merits and in the manner prescribed by statute, without reference to irrelevant or extraneous considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">For the purposes of the foregoing discussion, we have assumed that pressures exerted by Congressional advocates of the bridge are irrelevant to the merits of the questions presented to Secretary Volpe. It does not seem possible to make even a colorable argument of relevance except with regard to \u00a7 138. But it might be argued that the potential loss of the subway was the type of \u201cunique problem\u201d and cost of \u201cextraordinary magnitude\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> that the Secretary could properly consider in deciding, pursuant to \u00a7 138, that there were no prudent alternatives to the use of parkland for the bridge. The Secretary plainly understood that the price of abandoning, modifying, or even delaying construction of the bridge was the loss of appropriations for the District\u2019s subway. He undoubtedly viewed the prospect of that loss with understandable alarm, and may have concluded that the destruction of parkland was inescapable and appropriate in the face of Representative Natcher\u2019s clear and enforceable threat. We cannot agree, however, that a determination grounded on that reasoning would satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Neither the section\u2019s legislative history nor the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Overton Park </em>indicates clearly whether or not this sort of consideration should be deemed relevant. We are persuaded, however, that holding these pressures relevant would effectively emasculate the statutory scheme. The purpose of \u00a7 138, in our view, was to preserve parkland by directing the Secretary to reject its use except in the most unusual situation where no alternative would be available. The \u201cunusual situation\u201d posited here is entirely the product of the action of a small group of men with strongly-held views on the desirability of the bridge, who, it may be assumed, are acting with the interests of the public at heart. They may well be correct in concluding that a new bridge is needed and that no alternative location is available. But no matter how sound their reasoning nor how lofty their motives, they cannot usurp the function vested by Act of Congress in the Secretary of Transportation. Until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>statute is amended or repealed by another Act of Congress, the Secretary must himself decide, bearing in mind the statute\u2019s mandate for the preservation of parkland, whether a prudent alternative is available. Congress could not have contemplated that an alternative would be \u201cimprudent\u201d merely because persons who are convinced that parkland should be used have the power to decree that all alternatives to the use of that parkland shall henceforth be agonizing. Our interpretation of \u00a7 138 is essential if the Secretary is to be insulated from extraneous pressures that have no relevance to his assigned statutory task.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">To avoid any misconceptions about the nature of our holding, we emphasize that we have not found \u2014 nor, for that matter, have we sought \u2014 any suggestion of impropriety or illegality in the actions of Representative Natcher and others who strongly advocate the bridge. They are surely entitled to their own views on the need for the Three Sisters Bridge, and we indicate no opinion on their authority to exert pressure on Secretary Volpe. Nor do we mean to suggest that Secretary Volpe acted in bad faith or in deliberate disregard of his statutory responsibilities. He was placed, through the action of others,. in an extremely treacherous position. Our holding is designed, if not to extricate him from that position, at least to enhance his ability to obey the statutory command notwithstanding the difficult position in which he was placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">We conclude that the case should be remanded to the District Court with directions that it return the case to the Secretary<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> for him to perform his statutory function in accordance with this opinion. It seems clear that even though formal administrative findings are not required by statute, the Secretary could best serve the interests of the parties as well as the reviewing court by establishing a full-scale administrative record which might dispel any doubts about the true basis of his action.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court is directed to enjoin construction of the bridge until the defendants have complied with the applicable statutory provisions as set forth in our opinion.

This case arises out of governmental efforts which seek to improve the highway transportation facilities of the Washington Metropolitan area by removing a number of highway bottlenecks. One of these is the traffic bottleneck in the vicinity of, and across the river from, Georgetown in Northwest Washington. There the increasing congestion on parkland highways, an antiquated street system and historic road patterns which are additionally confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>within the adverse topographical features of the beginnings of the Potomac Gorge, combine with the necessity of bridging the Potomac River to cause great inconvenience to those attempting to enter or leave the District of Columbia by means of the existing streets and highways. The result is great inconvenience to thousands of highway users entering and leaving the capital and a substantial lengthening of many workers\u2019 day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The governmental authorities responsible for dealing with this situation concluded that it is necessary to erect the Three Sisters Bridge across the Potomac River as one essential part of the overall highway improvement program proposed for the entire metropolitan area. The erection of this bridge is here opposed by a citizens group of the District of Columbia which does not seriously attack the basic merits of the overall program to improve highway traffic congestion but instead ground their opposition on an alleged failure to comply with certain procedural requirements imposed by statute which are applicable to the planning and construction of the project. In such matters, under our form of government with its separation of powers, the function of policy making is assigned to the Legislative and Executive Branches. Congress enacts the basic laws and these are carried out by (1) the Executive Department functioning principally through the Department of Transportation, headed by the Secretary of Transportation, a member of the President\u2019s Cabinet, Mr. Volpe, though other federal departments may perform isolated functions; and (2) by the District of Columbia acting through its Highway Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">It should also be noted that the Constitution vests Congress with complete control over the entire area of the District of Columbia for all governmental purposes and insofar as legislation is concerned vests it with the combined powers of the federal and state governments. U.S. Constitution, art. I, \u00a7 8; Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 618, 9 L.Ed. 1181 (1838); Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, 129 U.S. 141, 147, 9 S.Ct. 256, 32 L.Ed. 637 (1889); Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U.S. 282, 300, 13 S.Ct. 361, 37 L.Ed. 170 (1893); Atlantic Cleaners and Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 434-435, 52 S. Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932); O\u2019Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 539, 53 S.Ct. 740, 77 L.Ed. 1356 (1933). The Constitution thus imposes a precise duty upon the members of Congress to look after the needs of the District of Columbia in addition to those of their individual district constituents. Members of Congress are also charged with guarding all the interests of the entire nation in the District of Columbia as the seat of our national government. Pursuant to this assignment of responsibilities, Congress and its members have taken cognizance of the need for transportation facilities in the District of Columbia and the surrounding metropolitan area. To meet the area\u2019s anticipated transportation needs it has authorized the appropriation of federal funds for the construction of a metropolitan subway system and has also authorized and directed that substantial additions be constructed to the thru-highways in the area. These additions include the erection of the Three Sisters Bridge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this connection it was the decision of Congress that the subway construction and the additional highways (including the Three Sisters Bridge) would be built contemporaneously. This conclusion follows from the facts of the contemporaneous appropriations and the express congressional direction that work on the Three Sisters Bridge begin within thirty days after the congressional enactment (82 Stat. 815).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">The remainder of this opinion deals with the very extraordinary majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>opinion \u2014 extraordinary in that it effectively sets aside for one alleged reason or another <em>every </em>finding of the trial court that the Government had in any way complied with the statutes in question. In its own language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-5\">As to the provisions with which the District Court found compliance, however, we have concluded that the statutory requirements were not satisfied * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Majority opinion, page 1235. In this terse manner the extensive findings of the trial court are effectively negated. The discussion of the application of the separate statutes (Title 23, U.S.Code) which follows fully demonstrates the wide gulf between the majority and the practical trial judge who heard all the witnesses in an extensive 12-day hearing, received 1,025 pages of depositions and then thoroughly documented his findings in an opinion covering 40 printed pages.

Volpe, 316 F.Supp. 754 (D.D.C.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-15\"><em>Section 188 </em>\u2014 Feasible <em>and Prudent Alternatives and Planning</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alz\">The majority opinion sets aside the determination of the trial court that the Secretary had complied with the requirements of section 138 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> largely because of an absence of formal findings and an administrative record in the Department of Transportation. The majority opinion asserts that all possible planning to minimize harm to the affected parkland and historic sites <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> could not have been carried out because the final design of the ramps and interchanges had not been completed when the Secretary approved the project. However, the lack of findings and the normal departmental administrative record is fully and satisfac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>torily explained by the fact that the Secretary personally made the necessary decisions and the Department file thus does not include the usual inter-office memoranda reflecting action by subordinates which is a feature of those projects on which the Secretary does not personally exercise his statutory responsibility. After all, the statute places the duty upon the Secretary to make such determinations and his decision should not be set aside because of the absence of documents which are not necessary or normal when he personally exercises that responsibility. This Secretary of Transportation is not a figurehead. He has had extensive prior experience in highway programs. His background and record indicate that he is personally Capable of making not only the ultimate decision on the bridge project but also many of the underlying minor, but basic, decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Further, I would not conclude that the Secretary failed to indulge in all possible planning to minimize harm to the park because his consideration of the amount of land to be taken by the ramps was based on the <em>preliminary plans </em>for the ramps. In this respect the opinion of the trial court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ama-dedup-0\">Secretary Volpe testified that he based his determination on the preliminary planning for the ramps and interchanges which had been done at that time. Although he conceded that the final design of the ramps was not com-p\u00edete, he pointed out that there were <em>very limited alternatives available. </em>He stated that before he approved the bridge project, he was satisfied, and the Department of Interior, which had jurisdiction over the parklands, was satisfied, that the designs which would be developed based on the preliminary plans would result in a minimum taking of parkland. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe, <em>supra, </em>316 F.Supp. at 774-775. I construe this statement of the trial court as a finding that the Secretary took into consideration the amount of parkland that might be required under <em>all </em>the limited alternatives for the ramps and interchanges. Thus, the final selection of any ramp, etc., design would not present any problem that the Secretary has not already considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">As to the suggestion of the majority that the use of the word \u201charm\u201d in the statute confers authority upon the courts in this case, where only Government land is involved, to pass upon the \u201csubtle calculations\u201d inherent in determining the \u201caesthetic value\u201d of this bridge, it is my view that Congress had more practical considerations in mind and did not thereby direct the rejection of projects which while they may be \u201cpleasing\u201d to the eye might by some personal standards be considered not to be \u201cbeautiful.\u201d <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>The majority opinion further states that the Government can hardly maintain that there was no \u201cfeasible\u201d alternative to the. construction of the Three Sisters Bridge because this exemption under <em>Overton Park </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> only applies if the Secretary finds that as a matter of \u201csound engineering\u201d it would not be feasible to build the highway along any other route. To my mind this argument is not foreclosed to the Government in the least. The majority\u2019s comment may have been falsely premised on a belief that sound engineering referred only to structural features, but there is much more to highway engineering than the stability of the structural features that may be constructed. Certainly the location of present highways and bridges in the Washington area when combined with various topographical features, existing traffic flow patterns, and the fact that one objective of the Three Sisters Bridge project was doubtlessly intended to alleviate some of the traffic congestion presently existing on the highways within the parklands on both sides of the river in the vicinity of the Three Sisters Bridge, might compel the conclusion that as a matter of sound <em>highway </em>engineering the only feasible project that would correct the congestion would be to erect a bridge in the vicinity of the Three Sisters Islands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I would thus not rule out the possibility that sound highway engineering would practically dictate a bridge at that location and that it would not be feasible to correct that traffic congestion by the construction or expansion of a bridg\u00e9 at any other location. The controlling engineering principles when applied to the facts here present may not produce such a conclusion but there is nothing in this record to indicate that such conclusion could not properly be dictated by the application of sound highway engineering principles.</p>\n<p id=\"A1gi\">The personal involvement of the Secretary in the decision also explains the alleged failure of the Department to process the matter through normal procedural channels in the Department. When a statute directs a Cabinet officer to make a decision, that decision should not be criticized or found to be faulty because he did not delegate the groundwork to subordinates and then rubber stamp their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">The majority opinion also states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-11\">Secretary Volpe did not consult with other planning agencies to coordinate efforts to minimize harm to the park and historic sites.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">Majority opinion, page 1239. This statement refers to something that is not required by the statute. It seems clear that the provision of section 138 requiring \u201call possible planning to minimize harm to such park ... or historic site from such use\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does not require that the Secretary of Transportation <em>\u201cconsult </em>with other planning agencies to coordinate efforts to minimize harm to the park and historic sites.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). The majority opinion while it does not state so exactly, seems to be trying, by such language, to give the National Capital Planning Commission a voice in the Secretary\u2019s decision by compelling the Secretary to \u201cconsult\u201d with them. But the statute does not so provide. It requires only that the Secretary engage in all possible <em>planning </em>and not that he consult every group that may have an axe to grind \u2014 he <em>may </em>consult with such groups but there is no requirement that he do more than indulge in \u201call possible planning.\u201d Clearly consulting is something more than planning. The statute directs the Secretary to make the decision and he is not forced to share that decision with outside agencies under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>the guise of consulting. The statutory-requirements are already cumbersome enough without having the majority try to invent new requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">As for air pollution, I find the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cair pollution was an overall consideration in this as well as all interstate highway projects\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to completely satisfy any requirement in this respect. Moreover, it seems obvious to me that the bridge would not <em>create </em>any air pollution, and that to the extent that it relieved highway congestion on the present highways in the parks it would <em>decrease </em>air pollution. In this respect, as in other instances, appellants and the majority are straining at gnats. Instead of sustaining appellants\u2019 vague generalized objections to the present plans, I would require the objectors to show precisely how some of the plans being considered by the Secretary failed to meet the statutory standard or that some other feasible plan would cause less harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">It also seems to me that, in requiring approval by the Secretary of final engineering plans for all details before the project can proceed, the majority are giving an overly technical, legalistic and impractical interpretation to the statute. What the Act requires is that the Secretary \u201cnot approve any <em>program or project </em>. . unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative . . . and all possible <em>planning </em>to minimize harm . .\u201d was indulged in. To my way of thinking this would permit the Secretary to approve a program or project which is described by general specifications and reasonably precise locations without having the final blueprints. Certainly as a practical matter there must be room for some preliminary approval prior to the preparation of blueprints because no government is going to spend the millions of dollars necessary to prepare the final drawings without some prior approval that the drawings are being prepared along lines acceptable to the approving authority. If it subsequently develops that the final plans for some phase of the project do not meet the statutory standards they may be attacked at that time. Alternatively, the preliminary plans could be attacked upon a showing that they did not meet statutory standards. But there is neither such showing here, and I would not hold up projects, as the majority holds up this project, unless the objectors could demonstrate that substantial harm would result from the presently existing plans which would be alleviated by some other plan. Insofar as this affects the possible ramps and interchanges here it would be a relatively simple matter to consider all the \u201climited alternatives\u201d and make a decision thereon. I would thus not remand for any purpose connected with section 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\"><em>Section 13 U </em>\u2014 Comprehensive <em>Transportation Planning Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">This section requires the Secretary to cooperate with the states and not approve highway projects unless he finds them to be based on a continuing comprehensive transportation planning process carried on cooperatively by \u201cstates and local communities.\u201d <footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">In considering the requirements of this section the majority reverse the trial court by concluding that the Public Roads Division Engineer (Mr. Hall), to whom the Secretary delegated his responsibility under section 134, had improperly in turn delegated his responsibility to the Transportation Planning Board (TPB) of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG), because, they allege, Mr. Hall believed that \u201cTPB was the primary agency to which he should look in making his finding.\u201d But certainly the belief that TPB was \u201cthe primary agency\u201d for such purposes does not constitute a delegation of his authority. The record thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>does not support the majority\u2019s finding of improperly delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Moreover, the TPB was the <em>only </em>agency in the area that did satisfy the requirement of the statute of a body carrying on a \u201ccontinuing comprehensive transportation planning <em>process . . . cooperatively by states and local communities . . </em>..\u201d Also, as the trial court noted, the District of Columbia, through resolution of its Board of Commissioners on June 17, 1965, provided for the District\u2019s participation in the planning processes carried on by TPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">What is really involved in the majority\u2019s opinion in this respect, as with its criticism under section 138 that Secretary Volpe did not <em>consult </em>with other planning agencies, is another backhanded attempt to elevate the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) to a point where it can obstruct the project for its own ends. However, the NCPC is \u201cconcerned with planning <em>solely </em>for the District of Columbia,\u201d and thus does not meet the requirement of the statute for a planning organization being carried on \u201ccooperatively by states and local communities.\u201d In contrast, the TPB is a regional organization <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and does satisfy the statute. It is thus my conclusion that the majority exceeded its authority on this appeal when it ruled, contrary to the facts, that Mr. Hall had delegated his authority. Similarly, the majority are acting contrary to the statute, if they are attempting to compel the Secretary to be governed by the views of the NCPC. I might add that the situation here is not novel in the United States. Comprehensive highway plans traditionally run into many local objections, some selfish and some meritorious. When such situations arise they can only be solved by a fair application of the law, which I do not consider here justifies the majority in indirectly suggesting an interpretation of the statute that would give appellants, through the narrow interests of the NCPC, a whip hand in the final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">A further example of the tenuous rationale of the majority in its reversal appears in its attempted characterization of the TPB approval of the Three Sisters Bridge as a \u201cstale\u201d approval.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The TPB formally approved the Three Sisters Bridge in December 1967 as \u201cconsistent with comprehensive planning in the region\u201d and since that time, as the District Court found, \u201cthe TPB has continuously reviewed the transportation system for the area and . . . the approval of the Three Sisters Bridge has never been rescinded.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Division Engineer of the Bureau of Public Roads (Mr. Hall) considered this approval of the bridge when he made his finding in August or September, 1969, that the project was \u201cbased on a continuing comprehensive transportation planning process carried on cooperatively by states and local communities.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On these admitted facts, I consider it to be a gross distortion of the record to characterize Mr. Hall as acting upon a \u201cstale\u201d approval, when the original TPB approval was within twenty months, and the area transportation system had been \u201ccontinuously reviewed\u201d by the TPB since then without any alteration in its approval of the bridge. It is also incorrect to call such approval \u201cinapposite.\u201d And to require a \u201ccomprehensive <em>plan\u201d </em>(which the court refers to, whatever that might mean as applied to a project for a single bridge), as opposed to requiring that project to be consistent with \u201ccomprehensive <em>planning,\u201d </em>is to attempt to impose a requirement that is not imposed by the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">I thus concur in the trial court\u2019s finding that the requirements of section 134 were fully complied with and dissent from the contrary conclusion of the majority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number><em>Section 109(a) </em>\u2014 The <em>Safety of the Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">I concur in the trial court\u2019s conclusion to require further study of the structural feasibility of the bridge but dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which states that the Secretary \u201cundertook no study of the [air pollution] problem.\u201d As previously stated the Secretary testified that \u201cair pollution was an overall consideration <em>in this </em>as well as all interstate highway projects\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> ; thus I consider that the air pollution problem was properly considered and disposed of. I would further permit work to proceed upon the <em>excavation </em>for the piers because this work is in the nature of a preliminary test since preconstruction borings are not conclusive. Thus, according to the testimony there will always be some doubt as to the absolute feasibility of the location and plans until the excavation is completed for the piers. It is my view that given the approval of Congress, and the necessary available appropriations (both of which the project has), it is within the proper discretion of the Secretary to proceed to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\"><em>Section 128 </em>\u2014 The <em>Location Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">Since the record is devoid of any proof that the present location of the bridge and ramps would affect the public in any manner substantially different from the three locations (which spread eagled the present location) discussed at the 1964 hearing, I would concur in the findings of the trial court that the public hearing requirements were substantially complied with. I thus dissent from the statement by the majority that the trial court\u2019s opinion was not clear that a finding had actually been made. To me it is perfectly clear that the court so found when it ruled that the present location was \u201cnot a new location\u201d within the meaning of section 6a(l) of the PPM. The finding by the trial court that \u201cno private property will be taken for the bridge or its ramps and interchanges\u201d is also relevant to the finding with respect to the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\"><em>Section 317 </em>\u2014 The <em>Map</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">This section requires that a map should be filed showing the portions of land which a department desires to appropriate. In this connection the majority opinion in footnote 61 refers to a letter of December 15, 1970 from the National Park Service and indicates that the plaintiffs may present this matter to the District Court for reconsideration of its ruling under Section 317. It seems clear, however, that the letter does not relate to any parkland but only to the \u201cadverse impact (of traffic conditions) on the parkway (the highway).\u201d It is thus my opinion that the letter would not have any relevance to any issue under section 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">\n<em>Congress, Representative Natcher and So-called Political Influence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">In Part III of the majority opinion Judge Bazelon deals with the position of Congress and refers principally to some statements by Representative Natcher relating to the Three Sisters Bridge. The opinion infers that Representative Natcher by his acts was a party to forcing approval of the Three Sisters Bridge without regard to its merits, but the record does not so reflect. As the trial court found, Representative Natcher stated that he would do what he could to withhold appropriations for the construction of the District of Columbia rapid transit system \u201cuntil the District complied with the 1968 Act\u201d and \u201cthe freeway program gets under way beyond recall.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Representative Natcher was thus merely attempting to see that the laws enacted by Congress were carried out. The Three Sisters Bridge was just one of several freeway projects upon which Congress in 1968 had directed the District of Columbia to commence work.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is not unusual or improper for Congress to withhold appropriations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>until its laws are complied with. In discussing the public position of Congress, as articulated by its laws and Representative Natcher, Judge Bazelon states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-5\">[T]he impact of this [congressional] pressure is sufficient, standing alone, to invalidate the Secretary\u2019s action. Even if the Secretary had taken every formal step required by every applicable statutory provision, reversal would be required, in my opinion, because extraneous pressure intruded into the calculus of considerations on which the Secretary\u2019s decision was based. (Majority opinion, p. 1245)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdTq\">And further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-6\">[T]he [trial] court determined as a matter of law that since the Secretary was not acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, his decision would be invalid only if based <em>solely </em>on these extraneous considerations [the influence emanating from Representative Natcher]. (Majority opinion, p. 1246)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">Judge Fahy does not agree that the trial court found that extraneous pressure had influenced the Secretary\u2019s decision and I find it impossible to read the findings and conclusions of the District Court as announcing that holding. In this respect the trial court\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-8\">The mere fact that the Secretary was aware of the Congressional pressure to build the Three Sisters Bridge is not sufficient to invalidate his action in directing that the bridge be restored to the Interstate System. Since the issue in this suit is whether there has been compliance with Title 23 of the United States Code, <em>the political pressure exerted by members of Congress is relevant only as to whether it may have caused Secretary Volpe to act without considering the merits of the project as required by Title 23. </em>As will be discussed in connection with \u00a7 138, Mr. Volpe commenced an exhaustive study of the merits of the Three Sisters Bridge project soon after taking office, and did not come to a decision that the bridge was essential until the Summer of 1969. <em>The Court believes the Secretary\u2019s testimony that his decision was based on the merits of the project and not solely on extraneous political pressures. </em>It is true that Mr. Volpe was also interested in securing the release of the rapid transit appropriations, and that the approval of the bridge led to the release of those funds. <em>But the Court finds that the mere fact that the Secretary was aware of this pressure does not invalidate his decision that the Three Sisters Bridge is an important and necessary part of the Interstate Highway System.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-11\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-12\">The plaintiffs contend that the Congressional pressure for the construction of the Three Sisters Bridge was of such a character that it can reasonably be inferred that it had <em>some influence, </em>conscious or unconscious, on the decision of the Secretary to re-designate the bridge as part of the Interstate System. From the evidence of the contemporaneous statements of Secretary Volpe, and his testimony in this case, there is no question that the pressure regarding the rapid transit appropriations was given some consideration at the time of the approval of the project in August, 1969. But the Court concludes that this does not invalidate the decision of the Secretary in this case. . . . The statute commits the decision to the Secretary\u2019s discretion. There is no requirement that he base his decision only on matters presented at a public hearing, but rather, <em>there is only the implied requirement that he base his decision on the merits of the project. In view of the Secretary\u2019s testimony that he made an exhaustive review of the merits of the project and based his decision on that study, this Court will not invalidate his decision. </em>The present case is further distinguishable from <em>Jarrott </em>in that there the contracts with the Board were secret, while here the actions of Congressman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>Natcher and others are a matter of public record contained in official Congressional documents and speeches made on the floor of the House of Representatives. [Footnote omitted, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe, 316 F.Supp. 754, 765, 766-767 (D.D.C.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">It is submitted that any fair reading of the trial court\u2019s opinion cannot twist its language to support Judge Bazelon\u2019s conclusion that it held that the Secretary\u2019s decision would be invalid <em>\u201conly </em>if based <em>solely </em>on these extraneous considerations.\u201d While the trial court found as a fact that the Secretary\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on the merits of the project and not solely on extraneous political pressures,\u201d this is only one of several fact findings; it is not the basis for the decision of the trial court and such factual finding is not the application of any rule of law. The trial court also found that \u201cthe mere fact that the Secretary was aware of this [congressional] pressure does not invalidate his decision . . . . \u201d But most importantly, the controlling conclusions by the trial court recognized the \u201cimplied requirement that the [the Secretary] base his decision on the merits of the project\u201d and that the Secretary had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-6\">made an exhaustive review of the merits of the project <em>and based his decision on that study, </em>[and] this Court will not invalidate his decision. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">It thus seems clear to me that the trial court (Chief Judge Sirica) thereby found that the Secretary had based his decision upon the merits of the project. I specifically concur in this conclusion of the trial court and disagree with Judge Bazelon\u2019s solitary conclusion with respect to this phase of the case. Judge Fahy also does not agree with Judge Bazelon that the trial court found that extraneous pressure had influenced the Secretary\u2019s decision. It is thus clear that as presently articulated in these opinions a majority of the judges on this panel do not require that new determinations \u201con the merits\u201d be made because of the interjection of any, for want of a better name, political pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion also discusses the <em>relevance </em>of the position of Congress on the appropriations to the matter of the Three Sisters Bridge. Under Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), the Supreme Court indicated that \u201cThe court must consider whether the decision [on the use of park-lands] was based on a consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d I find that the trial court made the proper finding when it determined after a lengthy trial that the Secretary based his decision on a \u201creview of the merits of the project [and] . . . that study.\u201d While the majority opinion states it is not holding that the bridge can never be built, if Judge Bazelon\u2019s individual view as to the position of Congress in this and other matters were to prevail, the result would come close to setting up legalistic standards which are practically impossible of compliance. Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion would do that here by deciding, contrary to the finding of the trial judge, that because a member of the Cabinet had <em>knowledge </em>of the position of Congress on appropriations for subways and highways in the District of Columbia that his decision with respect to the merits of a highway project must necessarily have been improperly influenced by that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">Actually any member of the Cabinet worthy of his position would necessarily know the position of Congress on such matters. No person with the position and ability to make the decision with respect to the Three Sisters Bridge would be ignorant of the publicly expressed congressional position on such matters. What Judge Bazelon fails to consider is that there were congressional pressures both ways and that the trial judge after full consideration found as a fact that the Secretary based his decision on a study of the merits of the project. For an appellate court to reverse such conclusion on this appeal is to overstep its au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>thority to determine whether the action of the Secretary was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d The Supreme Court has said that this court has no authority to set aside the Secretary\u2019s action on a finding that it was \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence\u201d or \u201cunwarranted by the facts.\u201d Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 414, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136. Likewise, the credibility of witnesses is a matter in which the trial judge is normally considered to have a particular province in actions tried upon the facts without a jury. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Judge Bazelon\u2019s view of the matter would violate both of these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Judge Bazelon also reflects an overly suspicious view with respect to the effect of so-called political pressures. An individual's attitude toward this type of question is closely related to his individual trust in human beings \u2014 whether he believes a human being can resist improper pressures, I do not find it unusual for a Cabinet member to be capable of resisting such pressures. Moreover the law is that in the absence of evidence to the contrary (and there is no such evidence here) public officers are to be presumed to perform official acts in accordance with the law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As I read Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion, however, it is his individual view that such pressures are irresistible. In the face of such colossal distrust of Government officials, the mere existence of the vestiges of pressure becomes equivalent to the reality of duress. I find that conclusion to be unsupportable \u2014 and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">The realities of this situation are that under the Constitution the Congress of the United States has a wider voice in the affairs of the District of Columbia than it does in the affairs of states or other cities. Pursuant to its constitutional mandate Congress does take a firm hand in matters affecting the District and that is precisely what this court found was lacking in the first case (1968) involving the District highway program. D.C. Federation of Civic Associations, Inc. v. Airis, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 391 F.2d 478 (1968). But no Congressman has any weight in such matters beyond his ability to speak for Congress and to the extent that he does speak for Congress he is only calling attention to the expressed will of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-10\">Congress has spoken in this matter. In Section 23 of the Highway Act of 1968<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it ordered the erection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>Three Sisters Bridge, not as a single project but as part of the broad highway-improvement program for the Washington Metropolitan Area. And Congress and those who speak for it have a continuing interest in seeing that the expressed will of Congress, as clearly enunciated in a statute signed by the President, be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Moreover, Congress has also declared that the relationship of the highway improvement program in any state, or the District of Columbia, be coordinated with plans for improvements in other affected forms of transportation (this would include subways) which are formulated with due consideration to their public effect on the future development of larger urban areas. In this respect Title 23, \u00a7 134, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-5\">\u00a7 134. Transportation planning in certain urban areas</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1I\"><em>It is declared to be in the national interest to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems, embracing various modes of transport in a manner that will serve the States and local communities efficiently and effectively. </em>To accomplish this objective the Secretary shall cooperate with the States, as authorized in this title, in <em>the development of long-range highway plans and programs which are properly coordinated with plans for improvements in other affected forms of transportation </em>and which are formulated with due consideration to their probable effect on the future development of urban areas of more than fifty thousand population. After July 1,1965, the Secretary shall not approve under section 105 of this title any program for projects in any urban area of more than fifty thousand population unless he finds that such projects are based on a continuing <em>comprehensive </em>transportation planning process carried on cooperatively by States and local communities in <em>conformance with the objectives stated in this section. </em>Added Pub.L. 87-866, \u00a7 9(a), Oct. 23, 1962, 76 Stat. 1148. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">Thus, this congressional mandate applies to both the subway and to the highway program for the Washington Metropoli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>tan Area with which we are here concerned. To the extent that it provides that the Secretary shall not approve highway projects in larger urban areas unless he finds such projects are based on a continuing <em>comprehensive (i. e., </em>rail and highways) transportation planning process in conformance with the objectives stated in Section 134, it is essential that the Secretary of Transportation in approving highway plans be concerned with the program to build subways in the District of Columbia. Indeed it would be impossible and contrary to law for any Secretary of Transportation to pass on any major highway project in the District of Columbia without being familiar with and considering its effect and relationship to the subway\u2019 construction program. In carrying out this statutory duty the Secretary must determine, in this case with respect to the District of Columbia, that the proposed subway and highway plans will <em>combine </em>to produce \u201cmodes of transport in a manner that will serve the States and local communities [here the Washington Metropolitan Area] efficiently and effectively.\u201d It is obvious, if the subway program were to proceed without the necessary highway construction, that the modes of transportation being built would not be efficient or effective. To this extent some joint consideration of subway and highway construction (including the Three Sisters Bridge) was a relevant matter and I do not find that the Secretary exceeded his authority by giving such matters more weight or consideration than was required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">In its discussion of \u201cprudent alternatives\u201d the majority opinion really attempts to define the problem as being one to determine whether a unique problem of extraordinary magnitude was posed by the potential loss of appropriations for the District subway. This is completely foreign to what section 138 is all about and does nothing more than indicate a preoccupation with the position of Congress. Actually when section 138 speaks of prudent alternatives it refers to alternatives to the use of parkland for the erection of the bridge at one location or another. The majority generally ignore the fact that the topographical features of the river with the high, steep banks of the Potomac Gorge, when coupled with the existing highways and parklands on both sides of the river, would cause the location of any other bridge that would meet the traffic congestion problem to affect existing park-lands in a substantially similar manner to the Three Sisters project. The case is unique in those respects. It is obvious that the viable alternatives would affect parklands substantially to the same extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">The majority also ignore the fact that the so-called parklands involved on the Virginia side of the river are all in the George Washington Memorial <em>Parkway. </em>Highways have always been an important part of this highway park. The George Washington Memorial Parkway was established by Congress (46 Stat. 482 <em>et </em>seq.) as a narrow elongated parkway along both banks of the Potomac River from Mt. Vernon and Fort Washington to the Great Falls of the Potomac. It parallels the Potomac River from Mt. Vernon to a point above the Great Falls on the Virginia side, except for the City of Alexandria, and from Fort Washington (in Maryland across from Mt. Vernon) to a similar point above the Great Falls on the Maryland side, except within the District of Columbia. One of the congressional purposes in establishing the parkway as a memorial was to provide for the construction of extensive highways within the dedicated area. The legislation also sought to protect and preserve the natural scenery of the Potomac Gorge and the Great Falls of the Potomac, to preserve the historic Patowmack Canal and to acquire that portion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal below Point of Rocks (46 Stat. 482-483).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">The fact that this park has to a substantial extent, and always has had extensive highways within its confines, makes it practically impossible for any proposed bridge in this area to be erected without affecting some of its lands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>This results from the fact that much of the traffic congestion which the proposed bridge seeks to relieve is traffic over the automobile highways within the parkway itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">It is thus submitted that (1) the restrictive alternatives occasioned by the topography and location of the parklands, and (2) the nature of the parkland here involved, established by congressional legislation with substantial highways within its confines as one of its principal purposes, make the proposed Three Sisters Bridge a unique problem. It should also be noted that this highway park was established by Congress and that Congress has power by a subsequent act to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">In its peroration to Part II the majority opinion attempts to disclaim obvious implications of its decision. However, in so doing, it merely emphasizes the partial and slanted view it takes of the facts. Thus it states they are not suggesting any impropriety in the acts of those who \u201cstrongly advocate the bridge\u201d; then next imply that there is some question as to the authority of such persons to exert pressure on Secretary Volpe which resulted in placing the Secretary in such an extremely treacherous position <em>; </em>and then conclude by denying that they are suggesting that Secretary Volpe acted in bad faith or in deliberate disregard of his statutory responsibility. Finally, they set aside the Secretary\u2019s finding on grounds which the Secretary testified under oath did not exist and the finding of the trial court supported the Secretary\u2019s finding. The result reached by the majority opinion thus contradicts its disclaimers. So whether the majority are implying that the Secretary acted contrary to his statutory responsibilities or not, they end up at exactly the same place as though he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">However, all of this buys time for the objectors and keeps alive the hope that a new Secretary or a new Council will succumb to pressure and disapprove the project. The majority opinion does not criticize pressure from the objectors and it does not fully state the history of the prior approvals and disapprovals of the project. Originally the Three Sisters Bridge was designated as part of the entire metropolitan freeway project. Nothing in this record indicates that this was not a decision on the engineering merits uninfluenced by any improper pressures. However, in the waning days of an outgoing Presidential Administration, the then Secretary of Transportation on January 17, 1969, three days before a new administration was to take office, deleted the bridge from the Interstate Highway System following disapproval of the bridge project by the District government. The majority do not question the basis of this action, but only attack the reversal of this decision.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It may well be that they should question the background of that decision rather than what may well have been a rectification of a prior error or improper action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-11\">\n<em>Procedure on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-12\">In the conclusory paragraph of its opinion the majority suggests that the Secretary establish a <em>\u201cfull scale </em>administrative record which might dispel any doubts about the <em>true </em>basis of his action.\u201d When members of an appellate panel, for no reason more substantial than their own innate suspicion, elect to disbelieve the sworn testimony of a member of the Cabinet that his final decision was not influenced by outside factors, and also to circumvent the factual finding of the trial court to the same effect, in my opinion, it is not likely that a more extensive administrative record would cause them to believe him in the future. A court that has gone to the great extremes that this court has to reverse the trial court here can always find reasons satisfactory to it for avoiding practically any subjective decision required with respect to the bridge. It may well be that the only hope to carry out the expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>will of Congress lies with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">To the extent that the majority opinion differs from the views hereinbefore set forth, I respectfully dissent and I concur in the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">FAHY, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom BAZELON, Chief Judge, concurs :</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">Our decision in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 148 U.S.App.D.C. -, 459 F.2d 1231 (1971), issued October 12, 1971, was rendered on appeal by the plaintiffs in the litigation from the, decision of the District Court in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 316 F. Supp. 754 (1970). In important respects we agreed with the findings of the District Court in that case that the Secretary of Transportation had not complied with certain applicable provisions of Title 23 of the United States Code. We could not agree, however, with the rulings of the District Court that the Secretary in other important respects had met the requirements of Title 23. We accordingly remanded the case with directions that construction of the bridge be enjoined until those requirements are met, as set forth in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">The plaintiffs had also contended in the District Court that the defendants were required and had failed to comply with statutory provisions other than Title 23, including certain provisions of the Code of the District of Columbia. In rejecting this contention the District Court held that the project had been exempted by Section 23 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from compliance with all statutory provisions \u201cother than those of Title 23 of the U.S. Code.\u201d Plaintiffs-appellants renewed their contention in this court. Because the parties had not squarely faced this problem in their briefs before us when we rendered our October 12, 1971, decision, we asked for supplemental briefs, which have been filed. We now decide the questions thus reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-18\">The relevant provisions of Title 7 of the D.C.Code are \u00a7\u00a7 108, 109, 115 and 122, briefly described in an Appendix to this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have concluded, as more fully to be explained, that further compliance with these provisions is not required insofar as they apply to the Three Sisters Bridge project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-19\">Section 23 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 was the legislative response to the administrative decision of certain District of Columbia officials to abandon the bridge project, and in response also to the decision of this court in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Airis, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 391 F.2d 478 (1968), requiring compliance with Title 7 of the D.C.Code, \u201cparticularly \u00a7\u00a7 7-108 to 7-115.\u201d By Section 23, Congress directed that construction of the bridge go forward \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law, or any court decision or administrative action to the contrary,\u201d subject, as we held in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436 (1970), to compliance with the applicable provision of Title 23 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court pointed out in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>opinion in that case that \u201cit was Congress\u2019 intention to countermand the District Government\u2019s \u2018administrative action\u2019 which had stopped further interstate construction,\u201d adding in a footnote: \u201cPresumably, the \u2018court decision\u2019 language [of Section 23] refers to our decision in <em>Airis, </em>but the reference is mistaken since that decision was not to the contrary.\u201d This court thus construed Section 23 in essence as a direction to the local and federal authorities to continue with the bridge plans formulated prior to <em>Airis; </em>but the court did not pass upon the precise question now before us, whether Section 23 exempted the bridge project from further compliance with those provisions of Title 7 of the D.C.Code which had been before the court in <em>Airis. </em>That case was not to the contrary of the intent of Section 23 that the bridge should be built; but the local Code provisions which had been held in <em>Airis </em>to be applicable to the bridge project we think became inapplicable by the subsequent enactment of Section 23 to the extent that compliance with those provisions would conflict with the provisions of Section 23 that work on the bridge should commence within 30 days. The reasonable conclusion to draw now from the ambiguous situation presented seems to us to be that such compliance with those provisions as had not occurred by the end of the 30 day period does not constitute a condition to the approval or construction of the project. This does not preclude the authorities from taking advantage of any of the provisions which they might find to be desirable or useful in connection with the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">We have not overlooked that appellants also invoke certain provisions of the D.C. Code other than those in Title 7, namely, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-1005(a), 1407(a) (7) and 8-115, also briefly described in the Appendix to this opinion. We did not include these provisions among those which our October 12, 1971 decision reserved for further consideration. <em>See </em>footnote 2, <em>supra. </em>Nevertheless, we consider them. The issue as to their applicability to the project had been presented to the court in <em>Airis, </em>although they did not surface in the opinion. We think they are also fairly included in the target of Section 23. Even were we to interpret the omission from the <em>Airis </em>opinion of any discussion of these provisions to mean that the court regarded them as applicable to the bridge project we nevertheless think the impact of Section 23 upon these provisions is the same as we have construed its impact to be upon the Title 7 provisions, as above set forth. The language of Section 23, and its history and objective, persuade us that the overriding intention of Congress was also to exempt the project from the necessity of further compliance with these recommendatory and consultative provisions of the local Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">Clearly one of the objectives of Congress was to have the bridge project go forward promptly. The \u201cnotwithstanding * * * any law * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>to the contrary\u201d language, construed in light of this objective, and of the history of the project, bears a construction that the provisions of the D.C.Code now considered should not delay or bar the authorities from proceeding. As we explained, however, in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436 (1970), Congress did not intend that the bridge should go forward without complying with \u201call applicable provisions of Title 23 of the United States Code.\u201d Those provisions having been brought into Section 23 itself, were not to the contrary of Section 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">We consider finally whether the appellees must comply with 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 470, 470f, which are part of the United States Code. Only Section 470f is really involved. It provides that in the case of a project such as the Three Sisters Bridge the head of the Federal Agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking, shall take into account the effect of the undertaking on any site that is included in the National Register of historical sites, and shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, established under Title 16, a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking. This provision was not considered in <em>Airis </em>and it is not a local highway statute. It is a part of a national plan to protect historic sites. Section 23 of the 1968 Act was passed, as we understand its purpose, to free the bridge from further planning under the local statutes. We cannot say that Congress also intended to render inapplicable this federal law of general application affecting historic sites. The Secretary of Transportation is a member of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation created by 16 U.S. C. \u00a7 470. Accordingly, if he has not already done so since our decision in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436 (1970)\u2014 we understand he may already have done so \u2014 the Secretary is required to comply with Section 470f before final approval of the project, for areas affected by the bridge project are listed in the National Register.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">As to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 403 and 525, and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655, referred to in footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>apparently appellants and appellees agree that the authorities have complied with these provisions.

Its west boundary was fixed at \u201cArchbold Parkway from Reservoir Road to the Potomac River * * The district so established would be slightly to the east of the presently prescribed location of the Three Sisters Bridge. If any of the ramps or interchanges were to come within said district, it is obvious from the maps that it would only touch a <em>de minimis </em>area at the southwest corner of the district which is devoid of buildings. Thus, the Three Sisters Bridge does not imperil the architecture in Georgetown. The Old Georgetown District was established \u201cto preserve and protect the places and areas of historic interest, exterior architectural features and examples of the type of architecture used in the National Capital in its initial years * * *.\u201d (64 Stat. 904). To effectuate the intent of Congress the Act required the Commissioners of the District of Columbia before issuing any permit for the construction, alteration, reconstruction or razing of any <em>building </em>within the Old Georgetown District, to refer the plans to the National Commission on Fine Arts for a report as to \u201cthe exterior architectural features, height, appearance, col- or, and texture of the materials of exterior construction which is subject to public view from a public highway.\u201d The Commission was then required to report its recommendations as to whether the plans with respect to any building would preserve the historic value of said district and if not to suggest changes. Thus, while the Act referred to \u201cplaces and areas\u201d of historic interest, the operative features of the law were directed solely to buildings within the district and there was no showing made in this case that any buildings within the district would be affected by the Three Sisters Bridge or any of the ramps and interchanges that would be constructed under any plan. And as stated above, only a <em>de minimis </em>area at the southwest corner might be affected by the ramps and interchanges. The bridge itself would not touch the Old Georgetown District. Also the character of the so-called parkland on the north bank of the Potomac (the D.C. side) where the bridge abutments would be erected consists practically entirely of a railroad right-of-way, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and a public highway. Thus, any substantial interference with \u201cgreen places\u201d on the District of Columbia side of the river has not been demonstrated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">. Biographical data on Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe indicates that lie was born December 8, 1908, graduated from high school and following two years of night school majored in architectural construction at Wentworth Institute. He engaged in the construction business in Massachusetts from 1933 to 1943 when he volunteered for duty with the Civil Engineer Corps (Seabees) of the United States Navy. On his return to civilian life he held the rank of Lt. Commander and he then reopened his construction company. As the business grew, he set up offices in Washington, D. C. and Miami, Florida. He served as Commissioner of Public Works for the State of Massachusetts for four years beginning in 1953. In this position lie undertook one of the largest highway construction programs in the history of Massachusetts. President Eisenhower named him as the first Federal Highway Administrator of the United \u25a0 States and he served in this position in 1956 and 1957 and thus became one of the architects of the $40 billion Interstate Highway Program initiated by the United States at that time. He is a member and past president of the Society of American Military Engineers and is also past president of the Associated General Contractors of America.

Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436 (1970) and D.C. Federation of Civic Associations v. Volpe, 148 U.S.App. D.C. -, 459 F.2d 1231 (Nos. 24838 &amp; 24843, dissenting opinion filed 11/4/71), and to my views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">Judge Fahy\u2019s opinion at pages 4-5 would have initially exempted the Three Sisters Bridge project from compliance with those provisions that would conflict with the provisions of section 23 of the Highway Act of 1968 so that work on the bridge could have commenced within thirty days. That date having passed he now concludes that compliance with those provisions as had not occurred by the end of the 30-day period does not constitute a condition to the approval or construction of the project. I would express our opinion more affirmatively. In my view the provisions of section 23 of the Highway Act of 1968 effectively eliminated the application of any provisions of the D.C.Code which would conflict with the construction schedule or plans referred to in the Act for\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-9\">those routes already under construction . . .

Section 470f was enacted on October 15, 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-15\">The head of any Federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in any State and the head of any Federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in the National Register. The head of any such Federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation established under sections 470i-470n of this title a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.

In the follow-up correspondence to this presentation, the Council\u2019s comments on these projects were expressly solicited. I find in this correspondence ample demonstration that the effects of the project on sites included in the National Register were considered within the Department of Transportation, and that the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation was given a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. I accordingly, respectfully dissent from the suggestion that the Council be afforded an additional opportunity to comment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1324-11\">.

On the same date the division, consisting of Chief Judge Bazelon, Circuit Judge MacKinnon and myself, also denied a rehearing. Judge MacKinnon who had dissented from the decision of October 12, 1971, would have granted a rehearing. Each of us reserved the right to file later a statement of reasons for our position as to the denial of rehearing. This I now do in brief form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">By \u00a7\u00a7 23(a) and (b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, to which reference has been made in the foregoing Supplemental Opinion, Congress provided among other things that the Secretary of Transportation and the District of Columbia should resume construction of the abandoned bridge project as soon as possible after enactment, the construction to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-11\">carried out in accordance with all applicable provisions of title 23 of the United States Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-13\">Work was to commence not later than 30 days after enactment. Work did commence but was brought to a halt by the litigation which questioned whether the construction was being carried out \u201cin accordance with all applicable provisions of title 23 of the United States Code.\u201d This court had held in D.C. Federation of Civic Ass\u2019ns v. Volpe, 140 U.S.App. D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436 (1970), that the applicable provisions of Title 23 included those governing \u201cboth the planning and building\u201d of the bridge. This interpretation of the intention of Congress created a conflict with the implications of the intention expressed in the 30-day clause. The difficulty was resolved of necessity by suspension of the work while the questions thus raised were settled. Obviously the substantive provisions of Title 23, involving, <em>inter alia, </em>vital decisions of the Secretary of Transportation, took precedence over the apparently inconsistent time provision. The project could not proceed in disregard of Title 23. Accordingly, our 1970 decision, next above cited, required a remand of the case to the District Court for an expedited hearing with respect to compliance with Title 23. The Government did not seek Supreme Court review of that decision, and it became the law of the case. The soundness of this court\u2019s remand was soon manifested by the further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>ceedings in the District Court which we reviewed in our decision of October 12, 1971. As the opinion of the District Court on the remand revealed, approval of the Bridge project had been given wh.en the planning was incomplete and fell short of statutory requirements in important respects. Extant were questions even of structural feasibility, involving safety, as well as of final design and location of ramps and interchanges. Moreover, a finding that only the minimum acreage of parkland would be taken fell altogether short of the content necessary to meet the statutory requirement of minimum harm to parkland. Furthermore, the approved location of the bridge on the District of Columbia side of the river was 1500 feet off from the nearest location considered in the 1964 public location hearing. The District Court\u2019s opinion did not reveal a factual basis to support its conclusion that the approved location was so similar to that subject to the public hearing as to eliminate the need for a fresh location hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The situation thus briefly outlined with respect to compliance with the applicable provisions of Title 23 called upon this court to hold that the approval given by the Secretary was, as a legal matter, not in conformity with the applicable statutes, and that the findings and conclusions of the District Court that they were, could not be accepted under the standards of judicial review applied in such a case by the Supreme Court in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 414-415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">It is well to keep in mind that Title 23 of the United States Code is a comprehensive congressional enactment governing the deep involvement of the federal government in the Interstate Highway System, of which the Three Sisters Bridge was to be a part. The provisions of the Title could hardly find a more appropriate place for careful application than in and about the Capital of the nation, especially if a proposed project encroaches upon parklands and historic sites, both subjects of express congressional solicitude. It therefore was quite natural, notwithstanding the desire that the bridge project proceed promptly, for Congress also to require compliance with the applicable provisions of Title 23. It is equally well to note, as the Government points out, that in such a project the Secretary must be permitted to make decisions in what might be called a progessive manner\u2014 not everything can be pulled together all at once. But when decisions necessary to final approval are made, such as those required with respect to parklands by Section 138 of Title 23, they must be made conditionally and tentatively, subject to readjustment and reconsideration as the process toward final determination goes forward. And final approval must await and be dependent upon completion of this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-13\">In thus briefly supplementing our October 12, 1971, opinion, we refer to it in the respects there more fully stated as reasons for our denial of the motion for rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1326-14\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ADGQ\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">I dissent from the denial of rehearing of the decision of October 12, 1971 for the reasons expressed in my opinion in that case, filed November 4, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">The majority opinion comments that prior decisions on certain issues have become \u201cthe law of the case.\u201d While that rule of judicial practice imposes some restriction upon the trial court it does not prohibit the appellate court in a proper ease from reconsidering its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>Also what is the law of the case with respect to the Court of Appeals is not the Supreme Court\u2019s law of the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">However, I concur in the statement expressed at page 1240 of the majority-opinion that would allow Government agencies to make decisions conditionally and tentatively in a progressive manner. This conforms to the view expressed in my dissenting opinion filed November 4, 1971 in which I stated that I would permit work to proceed upon the <em>excavation </em>for the piers of the Three Sisters Bridge because Congress has approved the project, the necessary appropriations were available and the excavation is in the nature of a preliminary test since precon-struction borings are not conclusive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">.
