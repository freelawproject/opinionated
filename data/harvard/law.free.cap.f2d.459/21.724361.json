He was sentenced to serve two concurrent prison terms of fifteen years each. On direct appeal this Court affirmed his conviction. <em>See </em>Juarez-Flores et al. v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In 1970 Roman-Morales filed in the sentencing court a motion under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255 to set aside his conviction. In his motion he argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s 1969 holding in <em>Leary </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the presumption in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is unconstitutional should be given retroactive effect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s <em>en banc </em>decision in United States v. Scott, 9 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 55, the district court agreed and set aside the conviction. The Government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">This Court has now joined the Ninth Circuit in holding that <em>Leary </em>is to be applied retroactively. <em>See </em>Vaccaro v. United States, 5 Cir. 1972, 461 F.2d 626. On the authority of <em>Vaccaro, </em>we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">. Leary v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\">. The relevant portion of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">Whenever on trial for a violation of this subsection, the defendant is shown to have or to have had the marihuana in his posession, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\">. The original trial record in this case reveals that the court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">In connection with the allegation of unlawful importation of the marihuana into the United States contrary to law I charge you that the law permits you to draw an inference from the possession of marihuana by a person that it was brought into the United States contrary to law \u2014 in other words, that it was smuggled into the United States. . If you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the defendants had possession of the marihuana, the law permits you to draw the inference that marihuana was illegally imported into this country. That is an inference which may be rebutted. . . . You are the ones to say whether or not there is rebuttal evidence of this inference that you are permitted to draw to the effect that if a person had possession of marihuana it was imported into this country contrary to law and that he knew it was so imported.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-22\">. In both the district court and here on appeal the Government has argued that Roman-Morales waived his right to raise the <em>Leary </em>issue and that any error in the trial court\u2019s use of the \u00a7 176a presumption was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court rejected those contentions. So do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
