After a great deal of telephoning, Hughey, Clark and Vali-tano, who was Hughey\u2019s employer, went to Carrion\u2019s home where the purchase was to be made. There Carrion offered marijuana cigarettes and talked of his drug dealings. He promised quick delivery of 4,000 tablets at a parking lot. Valitano drove Carrion and Clark to the parking lot where Carrion got into a second car. Clark followed and arrested him, and approximately 4,000 L.S.D. tablets were found in the source car. All of the participants were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-21\">The trial judge found that the record (which is barely outlined here) was ample to show an adequate connection on the part of all participants for the purpose of making their acts and declarations admissible. We agree. <em>See </em>Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-22\"> Appellant also challenges- the sufficiency of the evidence. As to this, he faces the rule that the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government, where as here, the jury found in favor of the United States. Glasser v. United States, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Yaple, 450 F.2d 308 (9th Cir. 1971). We find the evidence clearly sufficient, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-16\">. At the time of conviction in this case, the sale of L.S.D. tablets violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(q) (2), Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, \u00a7 5, Pub.L. No. 89-74, 79 Stat. 226, <em>repealed by </em>Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, \u00a7 701(a), Pub.L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. For the current statute see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
