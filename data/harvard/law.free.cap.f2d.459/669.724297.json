The district court granted Mr. Meeker\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Mr. Steward has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-26\">Summary judgment was properly granted because the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, if true, could not meet the jurisdictional requirements of either section 1983 or section 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-27\"> Section 1983 creates a cause of action against \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory . . .\u201d deprives another of his civil rights. Although an attorney is an officer of the court, as privately retained counsel, Mr. Meeker owed an absolute duty of loyalty to his client, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>N.J.S.A. 2A.-158A-11. Consequently, Mr. Meeker was acting as a private person in his representation of Mr. Steward, and was not acting under color of law within the meaning of section 1983. Thomas v. Howard, 455 F.2d 228 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Section 1985 deals solely with conspiracies to interfere with civil rights, and specifically refers to the situation where \u201ctwo or more persons . . conspire.\u201d Mr. Steward alleges wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Meeker alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Because the allegations of the complaint failed to meet the requirements of either section of the Civil Rights Act under which the suit was filed, the judgment of the district court granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
