Plaintiff alleges that on April 3, 1970, he entered into a one-year teaching contract and was wrongfully discharged on September 28, 1970, because defendants \u201cdislike the fact that the plaintiff grew a mustache; they requested that he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>move it; he refused; and they fired him.\u201d The trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"> The judgment of dismissal is manifestly correct. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint asserts nothing more than a breach of contract claim, alleges no claim to diversity jurisdiction, negates specifically any claim to a constitutional right to wear a mustache, and recites no involvement of a substantial federal question.
