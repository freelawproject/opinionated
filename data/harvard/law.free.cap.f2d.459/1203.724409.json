It is brought here by WAIT Radio, a co-partnership licensed to operate a Class II-D standard (AM) broadcast station, with 5000 watts of power on 820 kHz from Chicago, on a daytime-only-basis. WAIT is an independent, locally-owned station which broadcasts quality music and public affairs programs designed to appeal to adult audiences. During the day, other stations, elsewhere in the United States, use the 820 kHz channel. At night, however, only WBAP, Ft. Worth, Texas, is authorized to operate on this Class I-A clear channel. 47 C. F. R. 73.25. WAIT petitioned the FCC to enlarge its daytime-only authorization. It seeks to operate full time at 10,000 watts, with a directional antenna system, in order to furnish its distinctive service to almost four and one half million listeners in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">The Commission met the request for a waiver of its rules by a memorandum opinion that stated that since WAIT\u2019s proposal would violate its rules, its application would be returned as unacceptable for filing. 10 F.C.C.2d 481 (1967); reconsideration denied, 11 F.C.C.2d 547 (1968). In WAIT Radio v. FCC, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 317, 418 F.2d 1153 (1969) (WAIT-I) we reserved judgment on the merits and remanded to the Commission for their reconsideration. We said that we must be satisfied that the agency had taken a \u201chard look\u201d at the case, because \u201c[w]hen an application pleads, and offers factual material in support of, a non-frivolous First Amendment contention, an agency may not dismiss it with the routine treatment that might suffice in the ordinary case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">We recognized the tension between the doctrine of judicial restraint, which requires of us considerable deference to agency decisions, and the practical necessities of judicial review, which require a minimum standard of articulation, so that we may discern the path which the Commission took on the way to its result. We acknowledged the impossibility of framing a universally applicable formula \u201cfor deciding when an agency . . . has crossed the line from the tolerably terse to the intolerably mute,\u201d but we identified in this case a number of symptoms, chief among them the perfunctory character of the agency\u2019s opinion, which persuaded us that the Commission had not measured up to the minimum standards of deci-sionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">On remand, the FCC again denied the requested waiver, 22 F.C.C.2d 934, and again denied reconsideration, 22 F.C.C. 2d 1016 (1970). We are now satisfied that the \u201chard look\u201d has been taken, and that we discern the Commission\u2019s path. Thus we address the substantive elements of the appeal, testing whether the FCC exceeded its discretion in denying WAIT\u2019s application for authorization to broadcast during nighttime hours. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-15\">I. <em>The Underlying Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-16\">This case involves the FCC\u2019s clear channel and nighttime broadcast rules. The rules themselves are not under attack, and we begin by sketching their content before identifying the points of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-17\">1. <em>The Clear Channel Rules. </em>The FCC\u2019s placement of stations on the 107 available frequency channels, each of the width of 10 kHz, with the objective of providing satisfactory signal strength to as many listeners as possible and service of local origin to as many communities as possible, had to take into account behavior of radio signals. Part of the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ergy from the transmitting antenna of a broadcast station is called a groundwave which provides the \u201cprimary\u201d service used in broadcasting. The groundwave travels closely along the earth\u2019s surface; its intensity diminishes with distance but remains relatively constant at any location day and night and from season to season. A \u201csecondary\u201d service is provided by the skywave signal, which refers to that portion of the energy which travels upward from the transmitter into the upper atmosphere. In the daytime, because of the sun, this skywave is absorbed by the atmosphere. At night it is reflected, off layers of the upper atmosphere, back to earth, at distances much greater than the reach of the groundwave signal. While less constant in intensity than groundwave signals, the skywave signals are capable of providing service when free from excessive interference on the same or adjacent channels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Duplication of stations on the same channel to provide local services and to enhance multiplicity of program choices for as many listeners as possible \u201cdilutes the effective range of nighttime skywave propagation to distant rural areas where it may not be possible to provide local transmitters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">The concept of certain channels on which only one station is permitted to broadcast at night has long been accepted in practice. Frequency allocation to unduplicated channels has been a feature of federal communications policy for almost fifty years. \u201c[T]he primary objective of clear channel allocation [is] to render wide area service to residents of less densely populated portions of the country which are beyond the reach of interference-free nighttime service from other classes of stations.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An estimated one-half of the land area of the United States receives no usable groundwave service at night.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FCC calls such underserved areas \u201cwhite areas.\u201d They are concentrated in the mountainous parts of the Middle Atlantic states and in northern New England, the Upper Great Lakes, the Great Plains, the South and the Rocky Mountains area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">In order to bring some service to these white areas, the FCC has by rule reserved twenty-five of the more than one hundred available AM frequencies to the use of clear channels. Prior to 1961, a clear channel was a frequency on which only one station could broadcast during nighttime hours. One problem with this policy of exclusivity \u2014 the Commission called it a \u201cpersistently plaguing deficiency\u201d \u2014 was that, as a result of the policy, populous areas were almost overwhelmed with signals, while sparsely inhabited parts of the country remained without adequate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">While the population of white areas increased by about 50% during the decade 1947-57, the broadcasting services to these areas stayed at about the same level.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The FCC desired to improve broadcast services to white areas, but found that the only feasible route to effectuating such improvement was through a modification of the clear channel policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a rule-making proceeding, which culminated in a report and order dated September 13, 1961, the FCC ordered that thirteen of the twenty-five clear channels be \u201cbroken down\u201d \u2014in other words, that thirteen of the reserved channels be cleared for licensing to a subordinate broadcaster at night. The subordinate station would be far from the dominant station in miles, and would not be permitted to broadcast unless it protected the dominant station\u2019s 0.5 mv/m 50% skywave contour \u2014in other words, no \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> within roughly 700 miles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>of the dominant station\u2019s transmitter\u2014 and unless it also furnished some new service to a white area. This rule\u2014 usually referred to as \u201cthe twenty five percent rule\u201d \u2014 requires that at least 25% of the proposed subordinate station\u2019s projected audience, or projected territory, must be without present primary nighttime broadcast service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">\u201cThe underlying justification [for modifying the clear channel policy] was the compelling need to go as far as possible toward reducing the vast areas which lack any nighttime primary service.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission referred to such things as technical and engineering improvements in equipment like directional antennae, which simplified the process of minimizing obnoxious interference; but the polestar of the policy was to service underserved areas. Channel 820 \u2014 WAIT\u2019s channel \u2014 was not one of the channels which the Commission ordered available for duplication. It considered the idea of breaking down channel 820, but rejected it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-5\">In selecting 640, 820, 1160 and 100 kc for inclusion in [the no-duplieation] group, we have noted that these are the only I-A channels . . . serving the West; that the West is characterized by vast regions of low population density where skywave signals afford the only nighttime broadcast service; that a choice among sky-wave signals is not generally available to a substantial part of the West; and that acceptable locations for assignment of new unlimited-time stations on these channels would, in general, be limited to eastern areas already receiving abundant service. Accordingly, at this stage, we preserve the potential for improving skywave service which these channels afford.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">The FCC rules define a Class I station as a dominant station operating on a clear channel and designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area and at relatively long distances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The FCC rules define a Class II station as a \u201csecondary station which operates on a clear channel . . and is to render service over a primary service area which is limited by and subject to\u201d interference from Class I stations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There are three different groups of Class II stations. Class II-A and II-B stations are unlimited-time stations \u2014 broadcasting 24 hours per day\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>with Class II-A stations required to operate with at least 10 kw nighttime. A Class II-D station, WAIT\u2019s category, is a limited time station. It may broadcast only from sunrise to sunset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">The regulation entitled \u201cEngineering standards of allocation,\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-182, details, among other things, the protected service contours of the two groups of Class I station \u2014 that is, the duplicated and the unduplicated dominant stations. A Class I station which is on a duplicated clear channel is protected, at night,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-6\">To the 0.5 mv/m 50 percent skywave contour from stations on the same channel. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">As to the other Class I stations, the rules state, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.182(u) fn. 7: \u201cClass I-A stations on channels reserved for the exclusive use of one station during nighttime hours are protected from co-channel interference on that basis.\u201d While the FCC\u2019s brief did not elucidate this peculiar phrasing, its counsel at argument explains that this means that the signal of an unduplicated clear channel is protected on the basis that no other station is allowed on that channel at all. The signal from such favored stations, that is, is protected wherever it goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">2. <em>Nighttime Broadcast Rules. </em>The nighttime broadcast rule is a separate rule, although interrelated with the clear channel rule. It provides that an authorization for a new standard broadcast station or increase in facilities of an existing station will be issued only after a showing has been made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-9\">That a proposed new nighttime operation or change in frequency in any existing nighttime operation . . . would (i) not cause objectionable interference with any existing station . . .; and (ii) provide a first primary AM service to at least 25 percent of the area within the proposed interference-free nighttime service area., or at least 25 percent of the population residing therein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">Thus the nighttime broadcast rules supplement the clear channel rules in terms of avoiding \u201cobjectionable interference,\u201d and add the 25% new service requirement as a condition for new nighttime operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">II. <em>The Commission\u2019s Exercise of Its Discretion in Declining To Issue a Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\"> At the Commission level, WAIT sought a waiver of the FCC\u2019s clear channel rule, which as it stands prohibits any station other than WBAP on 820 kHz. It had a heavy burden. As we noted in WAIT-I: \u201cAn applicant for waiver faces a high hurdle even at the starting <em>gate.\u201d </em>135 U.S.App.D.C. at 321, 418 F.2d at 1157. On its appeal to this court, the burden on WAIT is even heavier. It must show that the Commission\u2019s reasons for declining to grant the waiver were so insubstantial as to render that denial an abuse of discretion. In order to evaluate that legal contention, we shall consider the strands of public interest identified by the Commission, repeating as a preliminary observation that the role of the court is not to determine the public interest, but to determine whether the agency\u2019s delineation is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">\n<em>WAIT\u2019s Submission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">In broad outline WAIT\u2019s submission is as follows. Its proposal would provide an interference-free nighttime signal to approximately 4,400,000 people in the Chicago area. Its operation will be under conditions engineered to insure that no objectionable interference will result to any other station. The Commission has not presented any valid reason why such limited operation should not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-17\">The development of this submission puts forward several matters. First, WAIT notes that waiver requests in general face an adverse presumption. It agrees that if a waiver would violate the policy of the rule, it can only be justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>fied by an affirmative showing of countervailing considerations. In its case, however, WAIT says that it has shown that its application violates the letter of the rule, but not its policy. On such a showing, it is argued, the rule itself no longer retains an adverse presumption. Though appellant does not use this analogy, its contention seems to liken the situation to the kind of presumption that lays only a burden of coming forward with evidence; once such evidence is adduced, the presumption drops from the case. What is left, then, is a normal application to supply additional service, and that is said to be favored by a presumption in favor of the application. This favoring presumption is related to the public interest in hearing new voices, and to First Amendment considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">In support of the premise that its proposal does not conflict with the policies underlying the rules sought to be waived, WAIT says that these policies seek to avoid \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d with WBAP\u2019s \u201cclear channel\u201d signal in a \u201cwhite area.\u201d WAIT concedes that its proposal would cause some \u201cslight interference\u201d with WBAP\u2019s signal in a crescent-shaped area that runs from Kentucky to South Dakota, in which about 2,170,000 people reside. But it points out that this area is served by at least two nighttime primary radio signals, and indeed by at least three primary signals as to more than 95% of this area. Thus the interference area is not \u201cwhite,\u201d and indeed, says WAIT, is not even \u201cgrey\u201d \u2014 for in view of the strong ground signals available here, the erratic and lesser skywave service available from WBAP is an insubstantial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">WAIT also concedes that its proposal would cause \u201csome interference\u201d with the signals of stations which occupy adjoining clear channels (WCCO, Minneapolis, 830 kHz and WGY, Schenectady, 810 kHz). But this is beyond the \u201c0.5 mv/m-50%\u201d skywave contour that identifies a station\u2019s normally protected contours under the FCC rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">\n<em>Policy of Non-Dwplicated Channels</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">The FCC\u2019s opinion stated that while its clear channel rule was not sacrosanct, it had concluded in its last rule-making that 12 of the 25 clear channels should not be duplicated at all, in contrast to the 13 clear channels that might be duplicated at night under certain conditions, including avoidance of \u201cobjectionable interference.\u201d After 16 years of study the Commission issued its 1961 Report embodying the determination to avoid any duplication on 820 and certain other clear channels serving the West, in view of the needs of this area of low population density for skywave service, the fact that acceptable locations for unlimited-time stations on these channels would, in general, be in eastern regions already receiving abundant service. \u201cAccordingly, at this stage, we preserve the potential for improving skywave service which these channels afford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">The Commission stated that WAIT\u2019s proposal would hamper the FCC in future allocations regarding nighttime broadcasting on 820 kHz, or possibly in authorizing clear channels with \u201csuper power.\u201d The Commission 'gave, for purposes of illustration, the case of station WDAE, Ellsworth, Maine, which has asked by way of a rule-making for permission to broadcast on channel 820 during the night. If this proposal were accepted, there would be no interference with any existing signal, and new service would be furnished to many persons in white areas; but the efficiency of WDAE\u2019s proposal would be severely compromised if the WAIT proposal were accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">We can appreciate WAIT\u2019s frustration in offering a present service that would offer, in its submission, a desirable present service, only to be told it must be rejected on grounds of possible interference with some future service of a nature that is not specified, and indeed that in the nature of the case cannot be specified. We need not consider whether the future potentiality consideration would of itself suffice to justify indefinite retention of a policy maintaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>certain channels as inviolably clear. But it suffices to support the Commission\u2019s answer, that WAIT errs in saying it does not ask the Commission to give up a policy. The Commission is being asked to give up a policy of retention to await future developments, and to surrender flexibility in dealing with allocation problems in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">WAIT\u2019s rejoinder is that it will accept a grant on the condition that the grant must be surrendered when, as and if a future development emerges in fact. This offer is hardly conclusive. An agency can realistically take into account that such a conditional grant would generate a vested interest in fact that undercuts flexibility. The Commission noted the \u201cprecedential impropriety of granting a conditional waiver\u201d as of \u201cmajor concern,\u201d and referred to \u201cthe almost unimaginable consequences\u201d of such an action unless there is a concomitant showing that the waiver is in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The curtailment of future flexibility provides an element of public interest that justifies the Commission in not granting the waiver sought where, as here, the Commission identified aspects of WAIT\u2019s proposal which it found raised problems in terms of the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">\n<em>Interference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">The FCC noted that the WAIT proposal concededly took away a third or fourth service (from WBAP) from millions of people in the crescent area. Although WAIT offered evidence that WBAP is not listened to in this area, there was contrary material before the FCC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And the Commission stressed that it was being asked to cancel this in behalf of a 26th nighttime service in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">The Commission also considered interference to WBAP beyond its 0.5 mv/m-50 percent skywave contour, and to WCCO and WGY, the stations on the frequencies adjacent to 820 kHz. WAIT correctly points out that this interference is hot defined as \u201cobjectionable interference\u201d under the FCC\u2019s rules. But the FCC states that while this meant that such interference would not be an impediment if there were reason for the grant, it was still interference. The FCC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-11\">Almost all new allocations for AM stations will cause some interference not recognized as objectionable under our rules. This does not mean, however, that the Commission considers it desirable to permit such interference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">And such interference was unwelcome\u2014 and not justified when wrought at the behest of a 26th nighttime service in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">\n<em>Lack of New Primary Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">The Commission stressed that WAIT did not offer any service to an area or population previously without primary service. There is some technical jousting as to whether the 25% rule (supra note 7) is applicable in terms. We find it unnecessary to decide the matter, because obviously the policy is one that the FCC could take into account in deciding whether to grant a waiver. If a 25% new service requirement, assuming service in an area previously without primary service, must be met by an applicant seeking to be licensed for fulltime operation, as a Class II-A or II-B station, the principle of requiring some new service is fairly applicable to a II-D station seeking fulltime operation through a waiver of the nighttime restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-15\">That approach would lead, says WAIT, to a situation where no big city station could ever get a waiver. We are not, however, asked to consider whether this factor alone would justify the FCC\u2019s action. We merely say it is an element of the public interest the Commission was entitled to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>\n<em>Programming</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">WAIT\u2019s presentation to the FCC focused on its programming. We are not entirely happy with some aspects of the FCC\u2019s opinion on this phase of the case. WAIT\u2019s manager was asked by a Commissioner to define the \u201cquality music\u201d he offered, and he replied that it was semi-classical, and included Broadway show tunes. The FCC opinion contains a footnote that derides this fare as lacking the \u201cunique\u201d character claimed by WAIT, and as not different from that of several other stations. But what about the public affairs programs? WAIT\u2019s counsel at oral argument in this court referred to WAIT as spiritually identified with the University of Chicago, and the record contains references to programs under the University\u2019s auspices that seem, at least prima facie, to have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The FCC decision states that programming is transitory, and cannot be the basis of structural grants. We take note of this only to make clear that we are not to be taken as necessarily approving that position as a universal premise. But we do not think this an appropriate case to explore the implications of this position. As we read the FCC\u2019s opinion, this was not a material element of the decision so much as, ,a jousting point, a pin to prick what was apparently viewed as a pretension.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">\n<em>Fundamental Approach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">The substance of these various strands of public interest depends on a fundamental approach in weighing the considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">Looking at the picture in broad terms, we can fairly describe WAIT\u2019s approach as follows: The interferences in its proposal are insubstantial \u2014 like coughing in church, a vexation that is minor, all things considered, and must be taken for granted. The skywave service interfered with is relatively unimportant, compared with the significant service from ground waves available in the interference area. The unused air service is an asset that is being wasted, like water passing untapped over a potential damsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">The Commission\u2019s broad approach can be put in these terms, obviously with some simplification: The skywave service is meaningful, though inferior. The interference, though minor, is unwelcome \u2014 especially on an incremental basis. And the one-time liberality of providing new service is an approach that must be re-evaluated in order to avoid excessive interference and congestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">Perhaps this approach of the Commission will be reshaped in the light of new technology. Perhaps, as WAIT claims, the Commission is being overly rigid, even in the light of today\u2019s technology. The reviewing court has a role that is supervisory, but must be exercised with restraint. There are respects in which the commission\u2019s opinion presents problems, some of which we have identified. On balance we have no warrant for saying that the Commission has failed on remand to comply with our order that it take a \u201chard look\u201d at the matter and identify its reasoning. And we have no warrant for saying that the Commission\u2019s approach is either devoid of rationality, or is to be condemned as arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">.
