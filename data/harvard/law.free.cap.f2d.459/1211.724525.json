ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">This appeal presents for resolution an issue of potential concern to American servicemen stationed within the territories of our allies under the North Atlantic Treaty,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and similarly to the many others assigned to military outposts in other parts of the world. The question is whether a court of the United States is empowered to entertain a claim of illegality in the conviction of two American soldiers in the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to enjoining their surrender for service of their sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have carefully examined the problem in the light shed by the relevant precedents, which most numerously are controlling upon us. We conclude that the question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">At the center of the controversy are reciprocal criminal-jurisdiction nrov\u00b1-_ sions subscribed to by the nations comprising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They are embodied in the -NAm^Stetusof Forces Agreement (NATO SOFA) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, with but minor variations, they extend to the Federal Republic of Germany by virtue of a subsequent multilateral agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They are designed to avoid jurisdictional clashes when military personnel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of one country \u2014 the \u201csending State\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 are assigned to peacetime duty<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> within the borders of another \u2014 the \u201creceiving State.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jurisdiction may be either exclusive or concurrent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is concurrent when the misconduct charged amounts to a crime under the law of each.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> NATO SOFA specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-23\">In eases where the right to exercise jurisdiction is concurrent the following rules shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-24\">(a) The military authorities of the sending State shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction over a member of a force or of a civilian component in relation to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-25\">(i) offences solely against the property or security of that State, or offences solely against the person or property of another member of the force or civilian component of that State or of a dependent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-26\">(ii) offences arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty. (</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-28\">(b) In the case of any other offence the authorities of the receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>State shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">These specifications are accompanied by others relating to waiver of jurisdiction <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and provisional custody of the accused by the sending nation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And, importantly for appellants\u2019 case, NATO SOFA surrounds prosecutions by receiving nations with fair-trial safeguards approximating some but not all of those constitutionally mandated for criminal proceedings in the United States Courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-5\">Whenever a member of a force or civilian component or a dependent is prosecuted under the jurisdiction of a receiving State he shall be entitled\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-6\">(a) to a prompt and speedy trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-7\">(b) to be informed, in advance of trial, of the specific charge or charges made against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-8\">(c) to be confronted with the witnesses against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-9\">(d) to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour, if they are within the jurisdiction of the receiving State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-19\">(e) to have legal representation of his own choice for his defence or to have free or assisted legal representation under the conditions prevailing for the time being in the receiving State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-20\">(f) if he considers it necessary, to have the services of a competent interpreter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-21\">(g) to communicate with a representative of the Government of the sending State and, when the rules of the court permit, to have such a representative present at his trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-22\">West Germany, as an occupied country in 1951, was not an original party to NATO SOFA, but became one in 1958. The Supplementary Agreement bringing that about,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> together with the Signature of Protocol thereto, wrought some changes respecting waiver and custody <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but none significantly affecting this litigation. NATO SOFA\u2019s fair-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>guarantees<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> were left standing without any change whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Appellants are American citizens serving in the United States Army. In July, 1970, while stationed with the Infantry Division in West Germany, they were arrested on charges of attempted rape and related offenses. Appellants tell us that the matter was investigated by their military superiors, who decided that the evidence did not warrant prosecution. The Federal Republic of Germany recalled a waiver of its jurisdiction,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> however, and appellants were later indicted. In harmony with the Supplementary Agreement,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> they were remitted to American military custody while the case proceeded in the West German courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Trial in the District Court (Landge-richt) in Bad Kreuznach culminated in convictions and sentences to imprisonment fou three years. A subsequent appeal to the Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) was denied, whereupon their convictions became final under German law. It then became the Army\u2019s' responsibility under the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement to turn appellants over to the Federal Republic.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">Shortly prior to pronouncement of the appellate decision, appellants left West Germany without authorization and returned to the United States. Thereafter they surrendered to Army officials, in whose custody they now are, and then initiated the present litigation in the District Court. In their complaint, as amended, they claimed deprivations of rights secured to them by NATO SOFA,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> by principles of international law, and by the Constitution of the United States. ' They were materially prejuspeedy trial, they allege, ^Because they w\u00e1recEarged in July, 1970, but were not tried until the following December. They were noUfurnished counsel of their^ choice, they say, because their request for an American civilian attorn\u00e9y was denied. Representation by their German counsel was ineffective, they aver, because the language barrier and incomplete relay by their court-appointed interpreter impeded communication. They were not permitted confrontation, they declare, by their accuser- because they were excluded while the prosecutrix testified, or by another witness whose hearsay was admitted into evidence. And they lacked a full and accurate transcript and resultahilyja fair appeaT7~they state, because a verbatim trial record was not provided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Their prayer, in substance, , was for an injunction restraining the American military from surrendering them to the Federal Republic and for a judgment declaratory of the invalidity of such surrender.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-13\">The District Court, after a hearing at which it rejected appellants\u2019 proffer of evidence to support their factual theories, denied their application for a preliminary injunction, and granted appel-lees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a justiciable cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>action. The most significant feature of (the court\u2019s holding was that even if appellants\u2019 allegations were proven, it was beyond the power of the judiciary to order corrective action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Surely, in situations such as this, \u201c[t]he controlling considerations are the interacting interests of the United States and of foreign countries, and in assessing them we must move with the circumspection appropriate when [a court] is adjudicating issues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our international relaI tions.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And undeniably, matters \u201cvitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is not surprising, then, that many questions arising in connection with our treaties with other governments have been held to be nonjusticiable.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For \u201c[n]ot only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature; but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government\u2019s views.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">That is not to say that every dispute touching our foreign relations falls outside the province of the judiciary <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has characterized its decisions, they \u201cseem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences of judicial action.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Even in controversies affected in some degree by a treaty with a foreign country \u2014 areas very likely off-limits for the judiciary<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u2014 the courts may in a particular context have a legitimate and useful function to perform.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>our view, however, this court has no such role in this case.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Our starting point is a basic fact and an elementary proposition. All essential t elements of the crimes in question were committed within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. From ! that it follows that, save only as modified by some other agreed-to alignment, West Germany\u2019s power to try and con|vict for those offenses was complete.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cA sovereign nation,\u201d the Supreme Court declares, \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders, unless it expressly or impliedly^consents to surrender its jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cThe jurisdiction of the nation, within its own territory, is necessarily exclusive and absolute; it is susceptible of no limitation, not imposed by itself.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> And \u201c[a] 11 exceptions . to the full and complete pow- \u25a0 er of a nation within its own territories must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate source.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Thus, had appellants been present in West Germany as militarily-unattached civilians, an exercise of West-German criminal jurisdiction over them would indubitably have been appropriate. It seems equally clear that, absent some countervailing international agreement, such an exertion remained unaffected by their status as American soldiers stationed there. We are advertent to the observation in Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon <footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201c [t] he grant of a free passage . . . implies a waiver of all jurisdiction over the troops, during their passage,\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> .but read it in context as a proposition based on real, though not expressly-conferred, consent of the host nation emanating from the obvious necessities of the situation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We are also advertent to similar expressions in cases involving troops occupying hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>or conquered territory,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> where obviously there can be \u201cno question of implying waivers of jurisdiction from consent to the presence of the forces.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We think | it now fully established that the plenary / criminal authority of a friendly host na- / tion during peacetime is undiminished by | the bare fact that the accused is a memI ber of a military force stationed there.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Certainly there is no immunity from local prosecution contrary to the explicit terms of an agreement \u2014 like NATO SOFA \u2014 purporting to define jurisdictional areas for host and visiting countries alike.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">In this light we examine appellants\u2019 objections, addressing first the contention that their surrender to the Federal Republic of Germany would infringe rights secured to them by the Constitution. That, as we understand their thesis, not because the Constitution operates extraterritorially to surround I American citizens tried for crime by foreign governments,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> but because it the ^United States would effect the^surrender\" \"The argument, in essence, is that the turnover of an American citizen for service of a sentence imposed in culmination of an unfair foreign trial<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> is a governmental involvement which the Constitution does not tolerate. \u00fc\u00f1The premise that their Wist German trial was unfair in the respects charged in this case,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> appellants lay claim to judicial process to shield the asserted constitutional violation.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-16\">To be sure, \u201cno agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on . . . \u2022 any . . . branch of Government, which is free from the restraint of the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> And no more than the supremacy of the Constitution over treaties like NATO SOFA<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> can its supremacy over executive augmentations like the Supplementary Agreement with the Federal Republic be doubted.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Nor can it be doubted that our Nation\u2019s performance as well as its making of international compacts must observe constitutional mandates.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The fatal difficulty in appellants\u2019 position, however, is that these considerations are beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-18\">Here we deal, not with an American prosecution in an American tribunal at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>home or abroad,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> but with a West German trial in a West German court \u2014 a trial for offenses under West German law allegedly committed in West Germany against a West German citizen. Obviously, the constitutional provisions appellants invoke exerted no force of their own upon the Federal Republic in that exercise of its sovereignty<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And while, of course, American officials having custody of appellants are fully subject to constitutional commands, it must be remembered that the contemplated surrender is the precise response required of the United States by its treaty commitments fo the Federal Republic. The Constitution plays no part in this case unless somehow it operates to negate those commitments in the circumstances appellants allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">It is evident that if appellants\u2019 point were to be entertained, an in-depth examination of the West German trial record would become an indispensable forerunner of any endeavor to resolve their claims on the merits. We need not pause to reflect on the difficulties \u2014 practical or otherwise \u2014 of such an undertaking, for appellants\u2019 contention that the Constitution has the effect asserted is doomed, we think, by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Neely v. Henkel<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> An American citizen there contended that a federal statute authorizing extradition eompli-ably with an applicable treaty to a foreign country or territory occupied by or under the control of the United States was \u201cunconstitutional and void in that it does not secure to the accused, when surrendered to a foreign country for trial in its tribunals, all of the rights, privileges, and immunities that are guaranteed by the Constitution to persons charged with the commission in this country of crime against the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Reference, in support of this position, was made not only to particular provisions of the Constitution but also \u201cgenerally to the fundamental guaranties of life, liberty, and property embodied in that instrument.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The Court found the argument wanting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-12\">The answer to this suggestion is that those provisions have no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States against the laws of a foreign country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-13\">In connection with the above proposition, we are reminded of the fact that the appellant is a citizen of the United States. But such citizenship does not give him an immunity to commit crime in other countries, nor entitle him to demand, of right, a trial in any other mode than that allowed to its own people by the country whose laws he has violated and from whose justice he has fled. When an American. citizen commits a crime in a foreign country, he cannot complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people, unless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipulations between that country and the United States.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number> As we view <em>Neely, </em>it governs the decision on the point under discussion. What we learn from <em>Neely </em>is that a surrender of an American citizen required by treaty for purposes of a foreign criminal proceeding is unimpaired by an absence in the foreign judicial system of safeguards in all respects equivalent to those constitutionally enjoined upon American trials. We do not believe that that teaching as been eroded by timd<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> nor that the slight factual differences between the pretrial extradition there and the postconviction surrender here removes the instant situation from <em>Neely\u2019s </em>ambit. We conclude, then, that the Constitution erects no barrier to appellants\u2019 surrender to the Federal Republic in conformity with NATO SOFA and the Supplementary Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">Remaining for consideration is appellants\u2019 contention that any obligation imposed upon the United States by NATO SOFA and the Supplementary Agreement to surrender them to the Federal Republic of Germany was negated by events allegedly transpiring at their West German trial.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>the position that those events violated the Federal Republic\u2019s agreement to afford American servicemen specific rights in criminal prosecutions,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the argument is that the breach exonerated the United States from compliance with any covenants of its own. We advert once again, without consideration, to the formidable problem encountered when an American court is asked to review the proceedings at a foreign trial for the purpose of ascertaining whether it has discharged its responsibilities. Beyond that, we deem it established that even if appellants\u2019 underlying premise were ^/correct, we lack power to make the decision they solicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">The contention appellants make is not new; on the contrary, it has ofttimes been advanced, and it has uniformly been rejected. Not only has it consistently been held that the courts cannot command the United States to take action assertedly necessary to performance of a treaty,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but attempts to secure judicial adjudications that nonperformance by the other party to the treaty relieved the United States from its own obligations have met the same fate.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Quite early in the Nation\u2019s history the Supreme Court, in Schooner Exchange v. McFadden,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> when denying jurisdiction over an American citizen\u2019s in rem claim to a French warship, placed weight on \u201cthe consideration [] that the sovereign power of the nation is alone competent to avenge wrongs committed by a sovereign, that the questions to which such wrongs give birth, are rather questions of policy than of law, that they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Later, in United States v. Lee,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the Court, referring to litigation attempting subjection of property of foreign countries found within domestic territory, declared that \u201cit has been uniformly held that these were questions, the decisions of which . . . must be primarily dealt with by those departments of the government which had the power to adjust them by negotiation,\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and that \u201c[i]n such cases the judicial department of this government follows the action of the political branch. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Still later, in Underhill v. Hernandez,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the Court, in holding that the Judicial Branch cannot entertain damage claims by American citizens against officials of a recognized foreign power, admonished that \u201cthe courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>another, done within its own territory,\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark> and that \u201c[r]edress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves.\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> And in 1943, in Ex parte Peru,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> where a steamship solely owned by a foreign state was libeled for alleged breach of a charter party, the Court, entertaining a mandamus proceeding having in view the release of the ship, reiterated \u201cthe court\u2019s duty to surrender the vessel and remit the libelant to the relief obtainable through diplomatic negotiations,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> and declared \u201cthat our national interest will be better served in such cases if the wrongs to suitors, involving our relations with a friendly foreign power, are righted through diplomatic negotiations rather than by the compulsions of judicial proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">That the doctrine espoused in these cases controls the one at bar can hardly be gainsaid.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Indeed, it has seen specific application in a situation closely approximating that now before us. In Charlton v. Kelly,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> an American citizen fought extradition from the United States to Italy pursuant to a treaty in terms requiring each government to deliver up persons within its borders, including its own citizens, when charged as fugitives from prosecution under specified laws of the other. Claim was made that the extradition treaty was not binding on the United States because Italy had refused to honor it whenever surrender of an Italian citizen was demanded. Notwithstanding a firm showing that such was the fact,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the objection to extradition could not prevail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-15\">If the attitude of Italy was, as contended, a violation of the obligation of the treaty, which, in international law, would have justified the United States in denouncing the treaty as no longer obligatory, it did not automatically have that effect. If the United States elected not to declare its abrogation, or come to a rupture, the treaty ' would remain in force. It was only voidable, not void; and if the United States should prefer, it might waive any breach which, in its judgment, had occurred, and conform to its own obligation as if there had been no such breach. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-16\">The Executive Department having thus elected to waive any right to free itself from the obligation to deliver up its own citizens, it is the plain duty of this court to recognize the obligation to surrender the appellant as one imposed by the treaty as the supreme law of the land, and as affording authority for the warrant of extradition.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-17\">We are mindful of the consideration that while a treaty is primarily a political compact between sovereigns,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> it \u201cmay also contain provisions which confer certain rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of the nations residing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>the territorial limits of the other, which partake of the nature of municipal law, and which are capable of enforcement as between private parties in the country.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark> We also recognize that in the domestic realm courts are not only equipped to enforce self-executing treaties affecting individual rights, but by virtue of the Supremacy Clause<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> are required to do so.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> We see no room, however, for operation of these principles when the corrective machinery specified in the treaty itself is nonjudicial. That appears the clearer from Johnson v. Eisentrager,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> which held that federal courts lacked habeas corpus jurisdiction to inquire into war-crimes trials by an American military commission in China of nonresident enemy aliens captured there. The Court stated that the prisoners were entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention <footnotemark>83</footnotemark> but pointed out that \u201cthe obvious scheme of the Agreement [is] that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities,\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> and that \u201c[r]ights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention?\u2019 <footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">The same result is plainly dictated here, where appellants trace the rights they claim to the provisions of an international agreement the enforcement mechanism of which is diplo\u00f1iatic'recourseonly\" \u00d1\u00c1T\u00d3~~So I' ATwM c\u00edfm\u00f1kes provision of the rights claimed, is explicit that \u201c[a] 11 differences between the \u201c Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled by negotiation - without recourse to any outside jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Therein lies also the answer to appellants\u2019 contention that judicial redress of their grievances is called for by the international standard of justice, for \u201c [t] here is no power in this Court to de-\"1 clare null and void a . declara- f tion included in a treaty merely on the 1 ground that such provision violates a_J principle of international law.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In sum, intervention by an American court into the matters of which appellants complain is foreclosed by the very terms of the document from which the rights in- I sisted upon are said to spring.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">We think the doctrinal considerations discussed herein apply full force to the case at bar. We think, too, that they rebut appellants\u2019 argument in each of its facets. And it goes without saying that the relevant law enunciated by the Supreme Court \u2014 as in overwhelming measure it is here \u2014 is controlling on this court. We caution, however, that we do not say that appellants\u2019 claims of trial unfairness are unworthy of executive scrutiny; on that score, we make no adjudication one way or the other. What we decide, and all we decide, is that those claims cannot be vindicated by the process appellants have solicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">To Americans, steeped in a long and unique tradition of criminal-trial fairness, the prospect of a foreign prosecution under less protective standards is . disturbing.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> That is the more so where the accused did not tread on foreign soil by choice, but rather in consequence of military assignment in the service of his country.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Perhaps the zenith of discomfort is reached when, as here, serious deprivations of fair-trial entitlements under an applicable treaty are judicially asserted,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and governmental litigants in position to know do not specifically deny the charges, whether technically required to do so or not.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">We are not the first to express concern. Nearly two decades ago, when ratification of NATO SOFA was pondered in the Senate, apprehensions over the subjection of American servicemen to criminal procedures variant from our own were strongly voiced.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Indeed, an unsuccessful effort to condition ratification upon extraterritoriality for American troops abroad drew the support of a full third of the members voting.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> What seemingly carried the day for unconditional ratification<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> was a feeling, not that the fears expressed were completely unfounded, but that on balance NATO SOFA was a decided improvement over existing international arrangements and any others that could realistically be envisioned.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">More significantly, ratification of NATO SOFA was forthcoming only with a resolution expressing reservations\u2014 \u201cthe sense of the Senate\u201d <footnotemark>97</footnotemark> \u2014 in the form of pracaclures to accompany foreign criminal trials of American servicemen.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Prior to trial, the laws of the prosecuting nations are to be examined by the commanding officer of the armed forces \u201cwith particular reference to the procedural safeguards contained in the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark> If the commanding officer is of the view that \u201cthere is danger that the accused will not be protected because of the absence or denial of constitutional rights he would enjoy in the United States,\u201d he must request a waiver of foreign jurisdiction and, if refused, must \u2018Tequest the Department of State to press such request through diplomatic channels.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> As a further step, an American representative is to observe the trial and report any noncompliance with NATO SOFA\u2019s fair-trial guaranties<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> to the commanding officer, who in turn must then \u201crequest the Department of State to take appropriate action to protect the rights of the accused.\u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark> To these supplications are added similar specifications in regulations of the Department of Defense promulgated in pursuance of its \u201cpolicy to protect, to the maximum extent possible, the rights of United States personnel who may be subject to criminal trial by foreign courts and imprisonment in foreign prisons.\"<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">This litigation, however, as cast in the District Court, made no call for an investigation of claims that American author ities_^^Temiss_in.tt;e_discharg:e\u201dof any such obligations owing to appellant's. The case was\u201d not\u2019 pitch'ed on alleged deficiencies of that character, nor was relief demanded on that account. Instead, appellants\u2019 complaint, as amended, was directed almost _exelusively..Jtoward__ the asserted shortcomings in their West German trial,<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> and the declaration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>the injunctions they sought would have had the effect only of thwarting their surrender to the Federal Republic.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> And while appellants\u2019 contentions have broadened considerably on appeal, a judicial barring of the surrender remains their single objective. That, as we have said, is an area in which we cannot intrude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">Our duty is to decide the controversy as presented. Accordingly, we do not reach the question whether_the_Senate reservations <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> or the Defense Department\u2019s implementing regidations__mi_ght have supported another approach.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Nor do we pass upon appellants\u2019 contention that their sentences unjustly deprive them of their liberty, but simply note that such a claim hasjong been addressable to the Presiden!.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Our holding is that in the circumstances here the contemplated surrender of appellants to the Federal Republic of Germany is a matter beyond the purview of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-16\">.

In Wilson v.

Indeed, ?! notwithstanding the serviceman\u2019s specific claim that the absence of due process in the Japanese judicial system would deprive him of a fair trial in the Japanese courts, Brief for Petitioner-Appellee in Nos. 1103 and 1108 at 42-49, the Court found \u201cno constitutional or statutory barrier\u201d to the surrender. 354 U.S. at 530, 77 S.Ct. 1409.

See cases cited <em>supra </em>note 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b1277-12\">. Appellants also submit two subsidiary arguments. One is that their situation is beyond the scope of the requirement NATO SOFA imposes upon the United States to surrender servicemen to the Federal Republic. The duty to surrender, like the other duties NATO SOFA enjoins, relates to members of a visiting \u201cforce\u201d and, with a proviso not relevant here, \u201cforce\u201d is defined as \u201cthe personnel belonging to the land, sea or air armed forces of one Contracting Party <em>when in the territory of </em>another Contracting Party in the North Atlantic Treaty area in connection with their official duties.\u201d NATO SOFA, art. I, para. 1(a) (emphasis supplied). Appellants say that, as persons no longer in West Germany, they are not members of a \u201cforce\u201d to which NATO SOFA applies. The answer is that appellants were in West Germany as members of a \u201cforce\u201d at the time of the commission of the offenses with which they were charged. West German jurisdiction then attached, and neither it nor the correlative American obligation to surrender was affected by appellants\u2019 subsequent unauthorized departure for the United States. Compare Williams v. Rogers, <em>supra </em>note 32, 449 F.2d at 520. <em>Cf. </em>Autry v. Wiley. 440 F.2d 779, 803 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"A7uA\">The other argument is that appellants are surrenderable only pursuant to the terms of' an extradition treaty. It is certainly the law that the power of the Executive Branch to invade one\u2019s personal liberty by handing him over to a foreign government for criminal proceedings must be traced to the provisions of an applicable treaty. Valentine v. United States ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U.S. 5, 7-9, 57 S.Ct. 100, 81 L.Ed. 5 (1936) ; Factor v. Lau-benheimer, 290 U.S. 276, 287, 54 S.Ct. 191, 78 L.Ed. 315 (1933) ; United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407, 411-414, 7 S.Ct. 234, 30 L.Ed. 425 (1886). But NATO SOFA \u2014 a treaty in every sense of the word' \u2014 makes just such a stipulation, as does the Supplementary Agreement with the Federal Republic, which derives full efficacy from the provisions of still another treaty. See note 18, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.
