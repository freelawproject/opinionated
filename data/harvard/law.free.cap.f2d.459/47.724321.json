He appeals, contending that the prosecutor in final argument alluded to his failure to take the stand, and that the court\u2019s curative instructions were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-24\">The prosecutor asked an ambiguous rhetorical question about the defendant\u2019s ability to speak. He quickly corrected himself, and the court likewise immediately told the jury that the defendant is under no obligation to put on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>any evidence, or to take the stand. The denial of the motion for a mistrial was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In all, the trial court instructed the jury four different times that the defendant had no duty to prove, any thing, and specifically told the jury that it could draw no inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Assuming that some incipient error may have lurked in the prosecutor\u2019s remark, had it gone unchallenged, any possible error was fully cured by the judge\u2019s instructions. United States v. Taitano, 442 F.2d 467, 469 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 852, 92 S.Ct. 92, 30 L.Ed.2d 92 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
