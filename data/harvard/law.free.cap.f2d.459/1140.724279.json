The motion was made initially at the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief, and was renewed after the evidentiary presentations on both sides had been completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1199-17\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1199-18\">Following trial by a jury, appellant was convicted on counts of assault with intent to kill while armed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and carrying a pistol without a license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges emanated from a verbal altercation in the course of which appellant shot another, and the controversy on appeal, as at trial, stems from appellant\u2019s claim that he did so in self-defense. The single question before us is whether the trial judge erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in thus leaving consideration of the issue of self-defense for the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A review of the record satisfies us that the judge\u2019s ruling was eminently correct, and we accordingly affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-19\">Earlier on the day of the shooting, someone broke into appellant\u2019s automobile and stole a tape deck therefrom. Appellant then armed himself with a pistol and in the company of a companion proceeded to a service station for a tire repair and a call to the police. There his companion spotted a tape deck inside the station<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and appellant, informed of the discovery, went in for it. An argument ensued between appellant and James P. Cole, an employee of the station, culminating in the shooting of Cole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-20\">At his trial, appellant told the jury that he fired at Cole when, during an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>exchange of words, the latter put his hands into his pockets and \u201cwas pointing something at me through his pocket.\u201d Appellant\u2019s companion stated similarly that Cole had a hand in his pocket \u201clike he was going to shoot.\u201d Additionally, three defense witnesses attested to appellant's reputation as a truthful and peaceful citizen. By no means, then, was the claim of self-defense frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">On the other side of the ledger, however, the evidence was devastating. Four witnesses testified that appellant drew the pistol and shot Cole in the head at very close range. According to two of them, appellant trained the gun on Cole for several seconds before he pulled the trigger, thus indicating an absence of the haste which frequently punctuates action in self-defense. Two witnesses avowed that Cole had his arms folded across his chest when shot, and that at no time did Cole have his hands in his pockets. One of these witnesses stated that five minutes before the shooting appellant declared that \u201che was going to kill\u201d whomever he found with his tape deck. Still another related that after the shooting appellant walked \u201cpretty calmly\u201d from the service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">The principles that must guide our decision are well settled. As quite recently we summarized them,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-6\">A motion for a judgment of acquittal enjoins the trial judge to \u201cdetermine whether upon the evidence, giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d For this purpose, the judge must \u201cassume the truth of the Government\u2019s evidence and give the Government the benefit of all legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d If the evidence so measured at the point in the prosecution to which the motion is properly addressed, portends to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it is for the jury to make the decision as to whether it actually does.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-15\">In the case at bar, the Government\u2019s evidence, if believed, sufficed to establish all essential elements of each of the two offenses of which appellant was convicted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial judge, in denying appellant\u2019s motion soliciting an acquittal, observed that he could not grant it without \u201cusurping the function of the jury,\u201d and that view we share fully. It is peculiarly the mission of the jury to resolve conflicts in the evidence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> including those developing with reference to a defense interposed by the accused.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The evidence here was such that twelve reasonable minds might rationally concur on guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge committed the issue of self-defense to the. jurors under instructions which have not been challenged, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>they resolved the issue against appellant. We have no warrant to now overturn either the judge\u2019s submission or the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">. D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-501, 22-3202 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1199-15\">. The judge, properly in our opinion, withdrew a count charging assault with intent to kill, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-501 (1967), and treated another count charging assault with a dangerous weapon, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-502 (1967), as a lesser included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1199-16\">. According to the Government\u2019s evidence, an unidentified party sold the tape deck to an employee of the service station and be in turn sold it to the victim of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1199-22\">. The details of the argument are obscure. At trial, appellant said he accused Cole of stealing the tape deck when Cole demanded $15 for it. Appellant added that Cole had uttered \u201ca few curse words\u201d but recalled nothing else Cole might have said. Cole\u2019s sparse testimony was unhelpful, apparently because of the poor condition in which the shooting left him; the trial judge described Cole as \u201ca vegetable, having been shot between the eyes. He will be a ward of the community for the rest of his life.\u201d No other witness could state just what words passed between Cole and appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">.
