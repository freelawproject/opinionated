Section 8(b) (3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board, in its Decision and Order reported at 183 NLRB No. 137, concluded that the Union had violated these statutory provisions when it refused to negotiate with certain employers represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>one Royster, the immediate past president of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">After Royster was defeated in his attempt to gain reelection as Union president, he sought employment as a labor relations consultant for management. On behalf of one of his first clients, Wisinger Trucking Service, Inc., Royster dealt amicably with the Union for two months, during which period he investigated and instigated the resolution of several disputes and grievances against Wisinger. While subsequently attempting to resolve another grievance against Wisinger, however, Royster was told that the Union had decided, pursuant to orders from the new president and Executive Board of the Union, no longer to deal with him as a representative. A few days later, Royster attended a contract negotiations meeting as the representative for Kockos Brothers, Inc., another client, whereupon the Union implemented the prior warning by first refusing to deal while Royster remained in the room and then terminating the meeting when he declined to leave. On the following day, the Union formally advised employers represented by Royster that it would refuse to bargain with them so long as Royster was their representative. The Union\u2019s only expressed reason was that Royster, as a former president, could not deal with the Union \u201cin an adversary capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">A literal interpretation of the statutory language would seem to indicate that a Union would never be justified in refusing to bargain with an employer, regardless of the representative\u2019s former ties with the Union. As recognized by our Brothers of the Second Circuit, in what is perhaps the leading ease with respect to the employer\u2019s correlative duty to bargain with the Union, these statutory rules are not absolute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cThere have been exceptions to the general rule that either side can choose its bargaining representatives freely, but they have been rare and confined to situations so infected with ill-will, usually personal, or conflict of interest as to make good-faith bargaining impractical.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">General Electric Co. v. N. L. R. B., 412 F.2d 512, 517 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The Union\u2019s argument in our case can be readily dismissed. It was conceded upon oral argument that there were no facts in the record to support a charge that Royster had misused confidential information or that his selection as the bargaining representative was prompted by an \u201culterior motive\u201d on the part of the employers to gain an unfair advantage over the Union. <em>See </em>General Electric Co. v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra </em>at 518. Hence, the Union\u2019s position is reduced to its urging that because of the nature of the prior relationship between an executive officer and the Union, there arises a presumption against the propriety of a former official\u2019s becoming a bargaining representative of an employer negotiating with that Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The lack of merit of this argument is indicated by the wording and purpose of the statutes the Union has been charged with violating. The statutory language obviously imposes duties on the Union to bargain with employers and to refrain from coercing them in their choice of representatives. In order to avail itself of an exception to these statutory duties, the Union must prove that it is entitled to the application of the exception. <em>See </em>General Electric Co. v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\"> Only in truly exceptional circumstances should a Union be permitted to refuse to bargain with an employer represented by a former Union official. In order to meet bizarre instances of abuse in the collective bargaining process, <em>see </em>N. L. R. B. v. International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union (Slate Belt), 274 F.2d 376, 379 (3d Cir. 1960) (employer, by hiring former union official as bargaining representative, claimed it had \u201cput one over on the union\u201d and placed \u201cthe union on the spot\u201d), a flexible standard such as \u201cgood faith\u201d has been employed. <em>See </em>General Electric Co. v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>516-517. As a legal test, however, the \u201cgood faith\u201d standard lacks precision. We think it better that the test be formulated in terms which focus directly on the danger posed by the selection of a former Union official as an employer\u2019s bargaining representative \u2014 the violation of the former relationship of trust through the misuse of confidential information. Thus we hold that, in cases of this nature, the burden is upon the Union to demonstrate that the representative in the particular dispute has gained an unethical or overreaching advantage by the misuse of specific confidential information acquired by reason of his former tenure as a Union official.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Since the Union in this case did not meet that burden, the Board\u2019s petition for the enforcement of its Order is</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-19\">.

The Union apparently had no by-law, nor any contract between it and Royster, which might possibly have precluded Royster from accepting employment that would force him to deal with the Union in an adversary capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
