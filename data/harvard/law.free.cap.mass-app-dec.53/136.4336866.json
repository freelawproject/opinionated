Said deed is recorded in the Fall River District Registry of Deeds in Book 1032, Page 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Subsequent to the date of the aforesaid execution sale, Credit Union filed a petition in the Superior Court for a decree authorizing the foreclosure of its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The foreclosure sale was held on June 28, 1972 and the property was sold to Aguiar.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The court ordered the Clerk to turn over ' the funds in his possession to the plaintiff Anna Flynn McManus and the case was reported to us by the trial justice under the provisions of G.L. c. 231, $ 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The issue in this case is who is entitled to the surplus funds now in the hands of the Clerk of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">An examination of this report with its agreed statement of facts reveals a certain vagueness as to the actual filing of the claims for these funds by Aguiar and the Credit Union and whether or not they were perfected to judgment. The accurate detailing of .any such pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>cedure would have been most helpful to this Division.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b146-11\">Brian R. Corey for Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdQB\">Raymond V. Pettine Roger F. Sullivan Levin &amp; Levin for Defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We are able to ascertain, however, that the Credit Union filed its claim for the funds in question subsequent to Aguiar\u2019s attachment and are able to resolve this matter without the delay of remanding this case for further information and clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The order of the lower court in ordering payment to McManus is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Both creditors seeking these surplus funds were wiped out by the foreclosure and/or the sale and execution and return of execution by Aguiar marked <em>Satisfied in Full.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">This attachment by Aguiar was prior to Credit Union and would have extinguished Credit Union\u2019s claim anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">There is no information to the contrary in the report in any event, and even though the report is meager concerning the perfection of the claims of the attaching creditors, we conclude that McManus is entitled to these surplus funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The order of the trial judge in the District Court is hereby affirmed. So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b143-12\">G.L. c. 231, \u00a740; c. 218, \u00a719.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
