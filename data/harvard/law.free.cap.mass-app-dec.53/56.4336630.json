There was a finding for the plaintiff and the case is here for review on the defendant\u2019s claim that he was aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s denial of the following rulings requested by the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>There is no evidence of proof of incorporation by the Plaintiff\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201c3. There is no evidence of the identity of the Defendant\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The report discloses that the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that it repaired an automobile owned by the defendant, that the fair and reasonable charges for the repair was $521.24, of which $200.00 had been paid by the defendant, leaving a balance remaining due and unpaid as of May 14, 1970 in the amount of $321.24. There was also introduced in evidence a certificate by the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,, certifying that the plaintiff was incorporated on September 1, 1948 and that it still continued to have legal existence on October 3, 1972, the date of the certificate. The report further discloses that the defendant himself testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>he had brought his automobile to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, had contracted for the repairs and has in fact paid $200.00 on account.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b64-6\">Norman P. Mamber, Defendant, Pro Se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In the light of this evidence, it is abundantly clear that there is no substantial basis for the defendant\u2019s claim of error in the.denial of his requests for rulings that there was no evidence of proof of incorporation of the plaintiff and that there was no evidence of the identity of the defendant. In the alleged brief submitted to us by the defendant and in his appearance before us at oral argument, he submitted no argument worthy of the name. It is perfectly clear to us that his claim of a report in this case was frivolous and intended for the purposes of delay. This is, indeed, a most appropriate case for the imposition of double costs on the defendant. See <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Boyajian, </em>303 Mass. 311, 313; <em>Modist </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>277 Mass. 135; <em>Dindo </em>v. <em>Meshaka, 275 </em>Mass. 113; G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It is hereby ordered that the report be dismissed, with double costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
