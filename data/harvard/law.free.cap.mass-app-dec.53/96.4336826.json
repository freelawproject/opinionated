The defendant answered by way of a general denial and payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The principle contention of the defendant is that the transaction in question, although governed by the terms of a written document called a \u201clease\u201d is nevertheless a conditional sales contract, and the lease is really intended only as security. Defendant, on this basis, says implied warranties of merchantability and fitness relating to the equipment apply (see G.L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-314); that these warranties were breached by the plaintiff; and that said breaches provide a defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The lease clearly indicates an intention of the parties to enter into a true lease, and not a lease merely as security. For example, clause #7 states \u201cNo title or right in said property shall pass to lessee except the lease rights herein expressly granted. Plates or other markings may be affixed to or placed on said equipment indicating that lessor is the owner thereof and lessee will not remove the same. Upon termination of the lease, lessee will immediately return said equipment to lessor in as good condition as received less normal wear, tear and depreciation. Said equipment shall always remain and be deemed personal property even though attached to realty. All replacements, equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ment, repairs or accessories made to or placed in or upon said equipment shall become a component part thereof and title thereto shall be immediately vested in lessor and shall be included under the terms hereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The trial justice reported that the defendant\u2019s Vice-President testified in substance that, at the completion of the payments called for by the lease document, title to said equipment passed to the defendant and a bill of sale would issue to the defendant from the plaintiff: No such term is included in the written lease, and the basis or authority for this statement of the witness is not reported, if indeed the witness stated any basis or authority for his testimony other than his unilateral assumption to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The term \u201csecurity interest\u201d is defined in G-.L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(37) as \u201can interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. . . .Unless a lease or consignment is intended as security, reservation of title thereunder is not a \u2018security interest\u2019. . . .Whether a lease is intended as security is to be determined by the facts of each case; however (a) the inclusion of an option to purchase does not of itself make the lease one intended for security, and (bj an agreement that upon compliance with the terms of the lease the lessee shall become or have the option to become the owner of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for no additional consideration or for a nominal consideration does make the lease one intended for security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The defendant requested the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201c1. That the defendant leased the equipment alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration pursuant to a conditional sales contract\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In response to this request the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cDenied. I find that the defendant signed a lease for the rental of equipment with the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The trial justice was certainly not required, on the basis of the evidence reported, to rule as a matter of law that the transaction was a conditional sales contract. Only if he had found as a fact that the equipment would become the property of the defendant, or that the defendant had the option to become the owner of the equipment for a nominal or no consideration, at the expiration of the stated lease period would it have been error to deny this request. Gr.L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(37). The trial judge was not required by the evidence to find that this was one of the terms of the transaction, and it is clear that the judge did not so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Requests numbered 2 and 3 were similarly properly denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b106-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Sheldon H.
