The total amount of damage to the plaintiff vehicle amounted to $720.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The plaintiff never filed a proof of loss with the company within sixty days after the occurrence of the loss. The insurer never investigated the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The only other correspondence relative to this claim which the insurer received was a letter dated April 9, 1971, from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The insurer has refused to pay the claim, for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Richard D. Silver for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVY\">Maher for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">The only issue that we need to concern ourselves with is whether the plaintiff is precluded from recovery because of prejudicing the defendant\u2019s rights of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">By not making a claim within two years of the loss, the plaintiff did prejudice the rights of the defendant to bring a subrogated property damage claim against the third party. This is a substantive right which the defendant had and the plaintiff is thereby precluded from recovering.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Reversible error found. Finding made for the defendant and case ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
