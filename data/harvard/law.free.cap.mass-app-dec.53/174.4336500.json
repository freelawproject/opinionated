The case comes before this Division on the defendant\u2019s petition to establish a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">This action was instituted by a writ of replevin dated June 7, 1972 and returnable in the Second District Court of Plymouth on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>26, 1972. The return on the writ made by deputy sheriff Paul E. Robinson states that on June 12, 1972 he replevied the personal property in question; that the value of the personal property was agreed by the parties to be in the amount of $8,000.00; and that he took from the plaintiff a bond with surety approved by him in double the amount of said agreed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The defendant\u2019s answer consists of a general denial and a further answer that the plaintiff at all times material to the action did not have a right to possession of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The case was tried on May 25, 1973. The defendant filed no requests for rulings. On June 19, 1973 the trial judge entered a finding for the plaintiff, stating: \u201cIn the above entitled action I find for the plaintiff in Replevin.\u201d On June 26, 1973 defendant\u2019s request for a report was filed and on June 29, 1973 the defendant filed a draft report. On July 2,1973 the trial judge filed a Memorandum which read: \u201cDraft Report dismissed for failure to comply with Rule 27 of the Rules of the District Courts of Massachusetts, in that request for ruling of law was not filed in writing before the beginning of closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Defendant\u2019s petition to establish report and its supporting affidavit were filed on July 6, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It repeated substantially the allegation of its draft report, that: \u201cThe sole issue raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>by the Claim of Report and in the Draft Report filed with the Presiding Justice is the constitutionality of General Laws, Chapter 247, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, which statute is identical in nature to statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Florida which have been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">On July 31, 1973 the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s petition to establish report.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We take note that the decision in the case of <em>Fuentes </em>v. Shevin, 40 LW 4692, 92 S. Ct.U.S. - Reporter 1983, to which the defendant refers, was announced on June 12, 1972, the same date as the replevin in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We do not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s contention in our disposition of this matter. Defendant\u2019s petition to establish report is not rightly before this Division. Defendant\u2019s draft report was not \u201cdisallowed\u201d by the trial justice but, rather, was \u201cdismissed.\u201d Relative to the dismissal of draft reports, Rule 28 of the Rules of the District Courts (1965, as amended) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac9\">\u201cIf the party claiming the report has failed to comply with the statutes or any of these rules applicable to draft reports, the justice may dismiss it, in which case an aggrieved party who desires to raise the question of the correctness of the or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>der of said dismissal may file a claim of report and draft report <em>on said dismissal </em>and proceed as provided in these rules.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The case of <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>305 Mass. 261, is cited at the conclusion of the above quotation from Rule 28. In this decision, Chief Justice Field stated (page 263):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cAfter the granting of the motion to dismiss, whether such action was right or wrong as a matter of law, and until the order to that effect was vacated or reversed, there was no draft report relating to the trial on the merits on the files of the court which the trial judge could disallow .... or which would furnish a basis for establishing a report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In the <em>Gallagher </em>case, the Appellate Division had entered an order denying the defendant\u2019s petition to establish a report. In reversing the order of the Appellate Division and dismissing the petition to establish a report, the Supreme Judicial Court said at page 264:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cSince, according to the practice in the district courts, a report serves the purpose of a bill of exceptions in other courts, the remedy of the party aggrieved by a dismissal of a report relating to rulings made at the trial on the merits is to be had upon a report of the questions of law involved in such dismissal, and not by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>petition to establish a report of the rulings made at such a trial. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b185-8\">Dennis J. Smith, Jr., and Michael J. Flynn for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1V\">Willis A. Downs for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">See also, <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Edes Manufacturing Company, </em>305 Mass. 311; <em>Wend Innersole and Counter Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Geilich, </em>317 Mass. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The trial judge based his dismissal of the defendant\u2019s draft report on defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 27 of the Rules of the District Courts, in that the defendant did not file a request for ruling of law before the beginning of closing argument. Ordinarily, in order to save a question of law for report to the Appellate Division, it is necessary to file a request for a ruling. G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 108; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>314 Mass. 167; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>293 Mass. 435. No requests for rulings having been filed by the defendant at the conclusion of the trial on the merits, that the trial judge was correct in \u201cdismissing\u201d the draft report. Since no questions of law involved in such dismissal have been properly raised by the defendant, its petition to establish report must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s petition to establish report is allowed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
