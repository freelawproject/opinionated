In the method of making square cut gaskets having close tolerances from a tube of soft rubber having a hardness of less than 80 durometer on the A scale, the steps which comprise mounting said tube over a mandrel, rotating the mandrel about its axis, moving a cutting tool made of a material which has a high resistance to abrasion, a low coefficient of friction and is a good conductor of heat into contact with the periphery of said tube and causing relative movement between said tube and said tool in a direction parallel to the axis of said mandrel while said mandrel is rotating.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">These claims call for turning of the outer surface of a soft rubber tube as in a lathe. It is noted that claim 17, the broadest, merely requires the use of a single \u201ccutting tool made of a material which has a high resistance to abrasion, a low coefficient of friction and is a good conductor of heat.\u201d More specific claims 3 and 6 require use of \u201cdiamond\u201d cutting tools. Claim 6 calls for the use of tandem cutting tools, whereas claim 3 specifies a peripheral work speed \u201cof at least 1000 feet per minute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">A second group, claims 7-11, call for making of \u201csquare cut gaskets\u201d by revolving a soft rubber tube in engagement with a severing tool moved inwardly in a straight line under controlled fluid pressure. Of this group, claim 9 is the broadest, in not requiring use of a \u201cnon-rotating\u201d severing tool and \u201chydraulic\u201d fluid therefor as in the other claims. Dependent claim 10 calls for axially indexing the severing tool between successive cuts. Claims 8 and 11 provide for pregrooving the rubber tube about the line of severance by a chamfering tool in order to form beveled gasket surfaces. In claim 11 the pregrooving and severing are done simultaneously at spaced points under hydraulic pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-11\">While it is noted that all of the claims refer to \u201cclose tolerances,\u201d none, however, require maintenance of any specific tolerance. [Referring to the specification, the limit of \u201cclose tolerances\u201d may lie between 0.008 inch and 0.003 inch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">The references are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-13\">Poulain 1,346,056 July 6,1920</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjYL\">Lawson 488,361 December 20,1892</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amfx\">Merritt et al.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak4V\">(Merritt) 1,086,606 February 10, 1914</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARA\">Belada 2,476,530 July 19,1949</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa47\">Hanson 221,552 November 11,1879</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-24\">Poulain discloses a diamond-point lathe tool \u201cfor cutting or working all materials, such as steel, bronze, fiber, ebonite, paper, rubber and other materials * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-25\">Lawson discloses a tandem tool holder for a lathe for making plural cuts in one axial pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-26\">Merritt relates to \u201cmachines for cutting circular packing rings, or gaskets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>* * * from cylindrical tubing. We have examined this reference and find that it supports the examiner\u2019s analysis of its teachings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-4\">* * * (1) mounting a rubber tube on a rotating mandrel; (2) rotating the tube about the axis of the mandrel; (3) moving a cutting tool (rotatable or non-rotatable) radially inward; (4) moving the tool radially outward; (5) indexing the tool a predetermined amount; and (6) moving the tool radially inward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">The purpose of the latter movement is to sever sucessive rings. While the patent indicates a rotary cutter, it is stated: \u201cFor some purposes it may be found sufficient or even preferable to use a non-rotating cutter, of a form suited to the cut to be made.\u201d Manipulation of a cutter (steps 3, 4 and 6 above) is accomplished by a mounting slide provided with a cam pin or roll engaging with a cam carried by a vertical driving shaft. The angular disposition of the slide is adjustable so as to cut the gasket at the angle required. The patent states that \u201cequivalent mechanical devices may be substituted for effecting the desired movements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">Belada relates to \u201ca machine for cutting tubes of rubber, rubber composition or other material.\u201d The machine is adapted \u201cfor cutting tubes of rubber\u201d into short lengths or rings for sealing gaskets. A nonrotatable slicing blade is employed which is rocked in and out of engagement with revolved rubber tube stock by pneumatic means. The rocking arm is long compared to the thickness of the rubber tube such that the motion of the cutting blades might be considered effectively linear. The cutter bar is moved to and from its operative position by a pair of air-operated piston motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-8\">Hanson shows a turning chisel having one portion which forms a groove in the object to be cut and a second position to later sever the object at the groove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">The examiner rejected claims 3 and 17 as unpatentable over Poulain under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, pointing out that the reference teaches a diamond cutting tool for working on rubber material, the object being to provide a tool of high resistance for turning the material in a lathe. It was the examiner\u2019s view that Poulain \u201canticipates the method steps of claims 3 and 17 of mounting a tube of rubber over a mandrel\u201d (shown to be old by Merritt), rotating the mandrel at a peripheral speed of at least 1,000 feet per minute and turning the rotating workpiece with the diamond cutting tool. The examiner felt that peripheral speed was a matter of choice with the operator in the method of Poulain and that the patent \u201canticipates turning a rotating rubber workpiece having a hardness of less than 80 durometer on the A scale.\u201d With reference to the limitation calling for rubber \u201chaving a hardness of less than 80 durometer on the A scale,\u201d it is noted that applicants had contended that there is nothing in the patent to Poulain to suggest turning a rubber workpiece having a hardness of less than 80 durometer on the A scale and that Poulain\u2019s teaching is directed to turning h\u00e1rd materials such as steel and bronze and consequently the rubber referred to is hard rubber. In rejecting this contention as untenable, the examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-11\">* * * Poulain, while teaching workpieces of steel and bronze, further teaches workpieces of fiber, ebonite, paper, rubber, and other materials. It is noted that Poulain lists both <em>ebonite </em>(hard rubber) and <em>rubber. </em>It follows that Poulain would not have listed rubber if he had reference to only hard rubber as he already anticipated hard rubber workpieces with the inclusion of ebonite, and the inclusion of rubber, in view of ebonite, was intended to teach the machining of soft rubber. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">It is pertinent to further point out that in his final rejection the examiner stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-13\">The hardness of the material worked and the particular dimensions of the cutting tool are held to be a matter of choice or experiment for the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>ticular operation, well within the scope of one having ordinary skill in the art.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">We think it clear from the context of the examiner\u2019s observations that the rejection of claims 3 and 17 were predicated on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 notwithstanding his somewhat liberal use of the word \u201canticipates.\u201d It is so accepted and treated by the board as well as by counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-7\">The examiner rejected claim 6 on Poulain in view of Lawson\u2019s teaching of tandem tool operation, holding it \u201cobvious to one having ordinary skill in the art to use the teaching of Lawson and design the cutter used in the cutting operation as taught by Pouplain with a plurality of diamond cutting tools in which the trailing tool projects radially inward beyond the lead cutting tool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">The second group of claims, 7-11, involve different references. The examiner stated that claims 7, 9 and 10 \u201cstand rejected as unpatentable over Merritt et al in view of Belada under 35 U.S.C. 103,\u201d stating the six steps in the teachings of Merritt, viz. (l)-(6) hereinabove set out, and applying the teaching disclosed in Belada of \u201ccontrolling the in-feed of non-rotating cutters to produce gaskets by means of controlled pressure and air-operated piston and cylinder means.\u201d He considered it obvious \u201cto use the teaching of Belada and design the infeed means of Merritt et al. with controlled fluid piston and cylinder means, the switch from air to a liquid being well within the scope of one having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d The same basis was relied on in rejecting claims 8 and 11 \u201cfurther in view of Hanson,\u201d who teaches pregrooving a rotating workpiece prior to severing to be old and well known in the art. It would, therefore, said the examiner, be obvious to use the teaching of Hanson and pregroove the workpiece of Merritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-9\">The board affirmed \u201cfor reasons pointed out by the Examiner\u201d and stated that \u201cthe references make it obvious that the tools disclosed therein could be used to make gaskets having close tolerances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-12\">Appellants advance the contention that inasmuch as the appealed claims require turning or cutting to tolerances \u201con the order of 0.003 inches or less,\u201d such degree of tolerance is not obvious on the basis of prior art. It is noted, however, that the claims specify \u201cclose tolerances\u201d with no limitation relating to the degree of tolerance embraced thereby. With respect to this contention, the board held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-13\">It is urged that since the specification indicates that the term, close tolerances, means tolerances of \u00b10.003 inches or less, the claims do specify the close tolerances which are achieved. Appellants may not read into claims limitations not expressed therein although emphasized in the specification. In re Custer, 36 CCPA 927, 81 USPQ 99 * * *, 173 F.2d 226.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-14\">In In re Tibbals, 316 F.2d 955, 50 CCPA 1260, this court considered it \u201caxiomatic that a limitation not expressed in a claim should not be read therein.\u201d Also, in In re Soderquist, 326 F.2d 1016, 51 CCPA 969, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-15\">The mere fact that the specification does disclose engagement of the inner surface of the band is not controlling since undefined features disclosed in a pending application cannot be read into the claims to distinguish from the prior art.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-16\">While the term \u201cclose tolerances\u201d is employed in the specification, it is not defined thereby. It appears that appellants are relying on the affidavits of Conner and Krandall to tie the claims to the \u00b10.003 asserted tolerance. The fact remains that the claims are not so restricted and embrace within the scope of their terms processes which can be reasonably carried out to yield gaskets not having the asserted tolerance. Thus, the production of gaskets having tolerances within 0.003 inch, even if considered unobvious, would not necessarily result from practice of the <em>claimed </em>method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>steps by one of ordinary skill in the art. The effect, therefore, is that one can hardly contend as a general observation that the <em>claimed </em>invention, considered as a whole, produces an unobvious result. We must agree with the solicitor that neither affidavit is pertinent to the broad methods of the appealed claims nor to the relevant teachings of the principal references.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Both affiants state that the use of \u201ca tool having the hardness of a diamond\u201d would not have occurred to them. We have hereinbefore discussed the examiner\u2019s application of the pertinent language appearing in Poulain and his interpretation thereof. We consider this interpretation reasonable and sound and that it would be so interpreted by one skilled in the subject art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">It is noted that Conner states that he had read each of the references \u201ccited by the Examiner in the above-entitled application.\u201d This assertion does not apply to Merritt, the basic reference relating to the second group of claims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since it had not been invoked when the affidavit was composed. This circumstance has direct bearing on the pertinency of Conner\u2019s remarks concerning \u201crotary or swinging tools.\u201d Merritt teaches that it may be found \u201cpreferable to use a non-rotating cutter, of a form suited to the cut to be made.\u201d It is apparent that the motion for supporting Merritt\u2019s slide is linear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">Appellants contend that in the accurate turning of soft rubber, the fact that high-speed steel and tungsten carbide were tried without success would suggest to a person skilled in the art that a diamond-type tool would not be successful. This argument apparently derives from language in the specification relating to prior attempts with \u201chigh speed steel and tungsten carbide\u201d which proved completely uneconomical because due to \u201chigh abrasive action\u201d the life of the tools is extremely short.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-11\">From immediately succeeding and relative language in the specification that it is not possible in mass production to accurately form the periphery of the tube of soft rubber by using high-speed steel and tungsten carbide, the obvious conclusion is that the life of the tools is too short for economical mass production in that they wear away due to abrasive action. Appellants\u2019 argument here is addressed only to the first group, viz. claims 3, 6 and 17. The solicitor argues, convincingly and with merit we think, that for \u201clow output custom production embraced by these claims, why shouldn\u2019t one ordinarily skilled in the art consider use of a tungsten carbide tip or an obvious equivalent, such as a diamond?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-12\">Upon consideration of the record including the affidavits of Conner and Krandall, the cases cited, the contentions asserted and the arguments of counsel, we are not persuaded of reversible error in the decision of the board, which is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1449-27\">.
