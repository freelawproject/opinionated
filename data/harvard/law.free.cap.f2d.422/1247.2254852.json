See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-27\">The nature of this cause is somewhat obscure, but it appears to be one in tort for conversion of property or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>possibly breach of contract. The complaint here contains no allegation of fact showing any legal right which belonged to complainant and which the appellees breached, with damages resulting therefrom. Under the most liberal interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the appellant failed to allege a cause of action against appellees. Dorsey v. State Farm Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">However, assuming a cause of action once existed and was alleged, the complainant waited fifteen years \u2014 from 1954 to 1969 \u2014 to bring his action, and Texas Statutes of Limitations, Article 5526 and Article 5527,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vernon\u2019s Annotated Texas Civil Statutes, would prevent recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">The District Court did not err in dismissing the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">. Article 5526, Vernon\u2019s Texas Civil Statutes :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-8\">There shall be commenced and prosecuted within two years after the cause of action shall have accrued, and not afterward, all actions or suits in court of the following description:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-9\">1.
