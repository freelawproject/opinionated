See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">In this case the taxpayers sued for the refund of income taxes, and interest, assessed and collected for the years 1963, 1964, and 1965. At issue is the deductibility of certain rental payments made by Dr. Chace for the use of a building previously owned by him and thereafter placed in trust for ten years. The factual details are reported in the opinion of the District Court, 303 F. Supp. 513 (M.D., Fla., 1969) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">For the reasons there appearing and upon the authorities there cited, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">See, in particular, Furman v.
