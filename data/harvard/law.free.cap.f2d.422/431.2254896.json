Since the issues to be decided in this appeal do not require it, the invention will not be explained in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-18\">The claims were finally rejected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) as being unpatentable over an article published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and co-authored by appellant and one Eugene F. Lutz. Appellant does not dispute that the reference discloses the subject matter claimed. The questions brought here on appeal arose from appellant\u2019s attempts to remove the reference as prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-19\">Appellant initially attempted to remove the reference by filing an affidavit swearing that Lutz was, at the time of the invention, a paid research assistant to appellant, that the work was carried out by Lutz, but at the suggestion and direction of appellant, and that Lutz\u2019s name was added to the article \u201cmerely as a matter of academic courtesy.\u201d This was deemed insufficient by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the examiner, who ruled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that a disclaiming affidavit by the co-author would be necessary to overcome the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The propriety of the examiner\u2019s action in refusing to give the desired effect to the initial affidavit thereafter became moot, however, and is therefore not before us. It seems that in attempting ,to pursue the examiner\u2019s requirement, appellant\u2019s attorney became apprised of facts which made him decide to convert the application to a joint one with appellant and Lutz as co-applicants. In a display of commendable candor, these facts were explicitly stated in the \u201cVerified Statement of Facts\u201d filed, in accordance with Patent Office Rule 45(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with the request to amend the application ,to include Lutz as a joint inventor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In summary, the facts alleged were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">1. In 1958 Lutz was a graduate student working under the direction of Searles on a program designed to produce small-ring cyclic ethers (not cyclic sulfides, the eventual product).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">2. Potassium propionate had been used as a catalyst in reactions in the program. One of the reactants in the program suggested by appellant was the cyclic carbonate of a diol specified in the claims. As a substitute for potassium propionate appellant suggested use of a \u201clower melting-point salt.\u201d The new reaction was to be carried out under conditions selected by appellant as part of the program to produce cyclic ethers. Potassium thiocyanate was thereafter substituted for the potassium propionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">3. Appellant and Lutz are in disagreement as to who proposed specifically the use of potassium thiocyanate, each claiming that he and not the other made the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">4. Lutz recollects that, upon carrying out the reaction using potassium thiocyanate and before talking to appellant, he suspected the formation of the cyclic sulfide.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">5. When appellant came to the laboratory Lutz called attention to the odor of the product and the fact that it did not have the boiling point of the desired cyclic ether. Appellant recollects that he then recognized the probable production of a sulfide and predicted the mechanism and generality of the reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">6. Appellant, when he filed the parent application and the present application, believed himself to be the sole inventor of the invention disclosed in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">The requested conversion of the application was refused by the examiner who stated \u201c[t]he deficiency resulting in the denial is considered to rest in the \u2018Verified Statement of Facts\u2019. * * * \u201d His reasoning was articulated later in the Examiner\u2019s Answer, when, denying that he was making an \u201cex parte determination of inventorship\u201d, the examiner took the position that the facts presented were not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that Searles was not the sole inventor and that Searles and Lutz were joint inventors. The rejection over the joint publication was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-20\">Before filing his brief to the Board of Appeals, appellant filed a petition to the Commissioner wherein he asked that the examiner be directed to enter the preferred papers, thus allowing conversion of the application, or, in the alternative, to make a positive determination that ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ther Searles or Lutz was a sole inventor. His reasoning appears to have been that either action would serve the same purpose in clarifying the issues and paving the way to the removal of the reference as prior art and obtaining the grant of a patent to someone. The Commissioner, however, dismissed the petition, refusing to rule on the question \u201csince it is determinative of the rejection made, [and] is thus appropriate for consideration on appeal to the Board of Appeals rather than by petition.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The board, in its decision on the appeal, specifically declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">The question here is solely one of whether applicant has sufficiently complied with the provisions of 35 USC 116 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Rule 45(c) to entitle him to convert this application to a joint one with Lutz and hence, through the parent application, to dispose of their joint publication as a reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A70\">It then went on to analyze the requirements of the statute and rules regarding the inclusion in an application of an omitted joint inventor. Agreeing with the examiner that the facts were dubious regarding error in determining inventor-ship, the board concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">on the facts before us the Examiner\u2019s holding denying the entry of the conversion amendment and rejecting on the point publication must be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">We are thus presented with the anomalous situation that the only rejection of record is not contested by appellant and nothing presently in the official file of the application may be used to obviate that rejection. On this appeal the court is asked to rule on the propriety of the examiner\u2019s refusal to permit entry of an amendment into the official file record. We note that traditionally, such actions being considered procedural, rather than substantive, recourse was available only through petition to the Commissioner of Patents,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> review of his decision being possible by means of civil action. See, In re Pavlecka, 319 F.2d 180, 50 CCPA 1342 (1963). Here, however, the Commissioner has decided, and a majority<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the board of appeals agreed, that because the question involved is \u201cdeterminative of the rejection\u201d it is properly an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>appealable matter. These unusual circumstances raise a question concerning this court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal and compel comment on this particular aspect of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Ordinarily, there is no problem regarding the manner in which the Patent Office appellate tribunals divide their authority. Decisions of the examiner directly relating to the rejection of claims are subject to appeal. These questions generally deal with the merits of the invention, involving factual determinations and the legal conclusions drawn therefrom regarding ,the application disclosure, the claims and the prior art. The examiner\u2019s rulings dealing with procedural matters, such as whether an affidavit or amendment is untimely, and formal requirements, such as whether a new application title will be required, are reviewable upon petition. However, the facts of this case point out that the dividing line between the two is often a blurry one.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The issues required to be determined on this appeal clearly do not relate \u201cto matters * * * affecting the merits of the invention * * * \u201d (Rule 191(c), footnote 7, <em>supra). </em>Rather, the decision of the examiner which was appealed from was a denial of a request \u201cthat this application be amended to include Eugene F. Lutz as a joint inventor\u201d (see Rule 127, footnote 6, <em>supra). </em>Nevertheless, we have concluded that this appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals is properly within the jurisdiction of this court under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is not, however, <em>merely </em>because the issues are \u201cdeterminative of the rejection.\u201d As Examiner-in-Chief Lidoff correctly pointed out in his concurring opinion, an examiner\u2019s refusal to allow entry of an amendment to the claims or to consider an affidavit under Rule 131, which might also clearly be \u201cdeterminative of the rejection\u201d, is reviewable only by petition and will not be considered by the Board of Appeals. In this case, the examiner\u2019s decision refusing to permit the conversion of the application to a joint one additionally, and necessarily, required the exercise of technical skill and legal judgment in order to evaluate the facts presented, interpret the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 116 and Rule 45 and weigh the facts against those requirements^ His decision was, thus, such an \u201cadverse decision\u201d as to be properly reviewable by the Board of Appeals under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Having made these preliminary observations, we now consider the merits of the appeal. This requires a more detailed analysis of positions taken by the Patent Office during the prosecution of the application before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">In denying the requested conversion, the examiner\u2019s position appears to have been that, because of the disagreement between Searles and Lutz as to who suggested the use of potassium thiocyanate, and because of certain alleged inconsistencies between this application and the parent, \u201ca preponderance of the evidence\u201d did not warrant the conclusion that Searles was not the sole inventor and that Searles and Lutz were co-inventors of the subject matter claimed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">The Board of Appeals, after summarizing the history of the prosecution of the case and stating the issue before it (as stated above), set out as what it saw to be the requirements for the conversion of a sole to a joint application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 116 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">1. there be an \u201cerror\u201d in not including a joint inventor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">2. \u201csuch error arose without deceptive intention\u201d on the part of the joint inventor not included * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>3. the amendment be under such terms as the Commissioner prescribes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Applying these requirements to the facts of this case, the board first specifically reversed \u201cthat aspect of the Examiner\u2019s position that would appear to hold that the mere fact of a disagreement as to who first suggested a detail of the invention defeats a claim to joint inventor-ship.\u201d As to point (2), the board decided that an allegation of lack of deceptive intention on the part of Lutz would be \u201ca material allegation in any verified statement of facts under Rule 45(c).\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s terms of requirement (3) were stated by the board as being prescribed in Rule 45(c) thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">a \u2014 \u201cfiling a statement of the facts verified by * * * all the actual joint inventors\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">b. \u201cfiling * * * an oath or declaration as required by rule 65 executed by, all the actual joint inventors\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">c \u2014 that \u201cthe amendment is diligently made\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">d \u2014 that the amendment \u201chave the written consent of any assignee\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The board noted that while points (a), (c) and (d) were apparently satisfied, the oath which Searles and Lutz submitted with the request to convert the application, contained the statement, \u201cwe are the original, first and <em>sole </em>inventors\u201d (emphasis board\u2019s). Finding this statement \u201cinconsistent with the attempt to amend the application to one of their <em>joint </em>inventorship\u201d, (emphasis board\u2019s), the board went on to assert that it was not inadvertent, since the other papers submitted by the parties were either silent with respect to joint inventorship or \u201cvery carefully worded to omit\u201d any allegation that they were joint inventors. It was then concluded that the examiner was correct in finding that the facts presented \u201cfail to support an error in inventorship\u201d, and his holding \u201cdenying the entry of the conversion amendment\u201d was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">In defending the positions of the examiner and board, the solicitor would have us go further and rule that the evidence submitted by appellant lacks a showing of any activity which can be regarded as constituting joint inventorship. It is apparently contended that the claimed invention was either arrived at <em>independently </em>by <em>each </em>party (if each party\u2019s assertion that he selected the key reactant, potassium thiocyanate, is accepted), or by only one party (if only his assertion is accepted), but in any event there was no joint inventorship since the parties did not \u201cunite in the invention of something essential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">We have concluded that the board was in error in sustaining the examiner\u2019s holding denying conversion of the application. Considering first the argument of the solicitor, we disagree that the evidence submitted will not support a conclusion that Searles and Lutz were joint inventors. We note that appellant has argued that he and Lutz did contribute \u201cjointly to an essential element of the invention, i. e., recognition of the unexpected result.\u201d The solicitor has, we feel, inadequately controverted this position. In addition, we agree with the board that the mere fact of a disagreement between the parties as to who suggested or performed or discovered one detail of the invention does not defeat a claim to joint inventor-ship. But there is a further factor in this case which the solicitor\u2019s argument appears to ignore and which was never questioned by either the examiner or the board. The evidence submitted shows that, at the time of the invention, Lutz was a graduate student working under the direction of Searles. It is indicated that the suggestion to deviate from the original program came from Searles. Thus, at least some of Lutz\u2019s activity in connection with the experiment which produced the new result was attributable to Searles. While not always determinative of the question of joint inventorship, the parties\u2019 relationship to one another ought to be taken into consideration concerning the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of independent invention. We think that the relationship in evidence here militates against the solicitor\u2019s assertion of possible double, but independent, invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">With regard to the positions of the examiner and the Board of Appeals we make these observations: The third paragraph of 35 USC 116 contains no provision requiring that joint inventor-ship be conclusively proved before conversion of the application will be permitted. The requirements of the statute and Rule 45(c) will ordinarily be satisfied if an allegation of joint inventorship is made, coupled with sufficient evidence to enable a determination regarding the <em>facts </em>of error in not including one or more inventors in the application, and the lack of deceptive intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Even absent a specific allegation of joint invention, it would be enough if the preponderance of the evidence submitted pointed in the direction of joint inventorship, so long as the existence of error without deceptive intention is satisfactorily demonstrated. Looking at the evidence in this case, we consider that the parties have satisfactorily shown that there was error in not including Mr. Lutz in the original application for patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Regarding the question of \u201cdeceptive intention\u201d on the part of the inventor to be added,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we specifically disapprove of the board\u2019s suggestion that an <em>allegation </em>of lack of such intent be required or even necessary in a verified statement of facts. Again, it will be enough to satisfy the statute if it would be reasonable to conclude from a consideration of <em>all </em>the facts presented that <em>any </em>deceptive intent was absent. In this case such is clearly true. The facts presented, particularly regarding the relationship between the parties and the disagreement as to who suggested the potassium thiocyanate, show the existence of deceptive intention, on either person\u2019s part, to be highly unlikely. The statute requires no more and Rule 45(c) adds nothing in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">There remains only the board\u2019s discussion concerning the oath first submitted by appellant and Lutz. In the first place, we see, in the filing of this oath, no indication of a conscious effort on the part of Searles and Lutz to avoid calling themselves joint inventors. The remainder of the oath, and the petition are worded in such a manner as to make it obvious that the use of the word \u201csole\u201d rather than \u201cjoint\u201d was inadvertent. All pronouns used are plural, and even the word \u201cinventors\u201d which is modified by \u201csole\u201d appears as the plural. Secondly, we note that, while Rule 65 requires every applicant to state \u201cwhether he is a sole or a joint inventor of the invention claimed\u201d, the section of the statute upon which that rule is based, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 115, merely requires an averment by the applicant that \u201che believes himself to be the original and first inventor\u201d. In certain situations, for example where only part of an inventive entity files for a patent, we can see where it might be appropriate for the oath to contain a statement that the applicant is a <em>joint </em>inventor. However, in circumstances such as appeared in this case, we consider it less than fair that the oath be considered by the Patent Office as defective or equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The board in this case specifically disagreed with the examiner\u2019s assertion that there were unexplained inconsistencies between the parent case and the application before us. Also, as pointed out earlier, the board disagreed with the examiner\u2019s position that the <em>mere </em>fact of disagreement as to who first suggested an element of the invention defeats a claim to joint inventorship. Thus having decided that the position of the exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>iner was untenable, the board went on and pointed out what it considered additional factors which, when coupled with the fact of disagreement between the parties asserting joint inventorship, made the examiner\u2019s position sustainable. This court has now determined that the board was in error in so doing, and that the conversion should have been permitted. Nevertheless, in the absence of such conversion, there is no question that the rejection of the claims of the single applicant, Searles, over the joint publication was proper. That rejection must therefore be, technically, affirmed. However, the case is remanded with instructions to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-20\">.
