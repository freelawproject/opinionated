Stringham \u2022against Cornelia M. Stewart to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have resulted in consequence of the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants. The plaintiff recovered a judgment, which was reversed by the court of appeals, and a new trial was ordered with costs to abide the event (Reported in 100 <em>Af.

Section 1 of title III. of ch. VIII. of part III. of the Revised Statutes (Banks 7 th ed. p. 2395), which saves from abatement actions \u201c for wrongs done to the-property rights or interests of another,\u201d has no application to this case, because section 2 expressly provides that \u201c the' preceding section shall not extend ... to' actions on, the case for <em>injuries to the person of the </em>plaintiff.1\u201d That is the nature of the present action, and the character of the damages sought to be recovered, cannot be separated so as-to claim that part affects the plaintiff\u2019s <em>\u201c </em>property rights or interests\u201d (Hegerich <em>v. </em>Keddie, 99 <em>N. Y. </em>258; Cregin <em>v. </em>Cross Town R. R. Co., 75 <em>Id. </em>192 ; Cox <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 4 <em>Hun, </em>176; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Jewett, 34 <em>Id. </em>11), The only other statute having any application to this case is, section 764 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This section is substantially the same as the addition which was made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>section 121 of the Code of Procedure in 1857. The object of both sections is to save a party or his estate any verdict which may have been rendered before the death of either party, and to enable the action to be carried on by appeal or otherwise to determine whether that verdict shall stand or fall. If the verdict is finally set aside, the action is in the same condition as though there never had been a verdict, the issues being still untried and undetermined. Plaintiff is again remitted to his original cause of action for the tort, which does not survive. In such cases, if, after the death of either party, the judgment is finally set aside,, no new trial should be ordered, for the case then stands as though the plaintiff had died before the verdict (Comstock <em>v. </em>Dodge, 43 <em>How. Pr. </em>97; Spooner <em>v. </em>Keller, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>527 ; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Jewitt, 34 <em>Hun, </em>11; Cox <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central, etc. R. R. Co., 4 <em>Hun, </em>176 ; <em>Rumsey\u2019s Practice, </em>vol. 1, p. 675 ; Mosely <em>v. </em>Mosely, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>105 ; Diefendorf <em>v. </em>House, 9 <em>How. Pr. </em>243; Smith <em>v. </em>Lynch, 12 <em>Civ. Pro. R. (Browne) </em>348 ; Pessini <em>v. </em>Wilkins, 54 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp; S.) </em>146; Benjamin\u2019s Ex. v. Smith, 17 <em>Wend. </em>208; Spooner, Adm. <em>v. </em>Keeler, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>527; Wood <em>v. </em>Phillips, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>1 ; Cox <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central &amp; H. R. R. Co., 63 <em>N. </em>Y. 414; Blake <em>v. </em>Griswold, 104 <em>Id. </em>613 ; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Jewett, 34 <em>Hun, </em>11, 14, 15). Ho argument can be made against the defendant\u2019s position by the amendment of section 764 in,-1881. In express language, it declared the law to be exactly what the courts had construed it to be under the wording-of section 121, in Wood <em>v. </em>Phillips, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>1, in Spooner <em>v. </em>Keeler, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>527, and in Comstock <em>v. </em>Dodge, 43 <em>How. Pr. </em>97. It gave no more nor fewer rights. In 1881 the Legislature simply shortened the section and thus restored the language of section 121, which the courts, had previously decided gave the same rights (People <em>v. </em>Fields, 58 <em>N. Y. </em>491, 502 ; People <em>v. </em>Green, 56 <em>Id. </em>466, 475 ; Butler <em>v. </em>Perrott, 1 <em>Dem. </em>9, 13 ; Hall <em>v. </em>Western Transp. Co., 34 <em>N. Y. </em>284). The same constrnction has always been given, to section 674, as amended, as to section 121 of the oidi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Code (Power <em>v. </em>Village of Athens, 99 <em>N. Y. </em>592). In such cases, where a new trial cannot legally be had, none will be ordered. That is the practice of this court and is within its power (Comstock <em>v. </em>Dodge, 43 <em>How. Pr. </em>97; Spooner <em>v. </em>Keeler, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>527 ; <em>Rumsey\u2019s Practice, </em>vol. 1, p. 675 ; <em>Code Civ.
