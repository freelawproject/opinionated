The action was founded not on contract but on the claim that the public, including the plaintiff, had a right to, and the defendants by law and by their charter were required to continue the facilities in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">Upon affidavits to the circumstances under which defendant had taken its instrument out of plaintiff\u2019s office and to its disclaimer of any fault to find with defendant and its declaration that the only reason for removing it was an order from the secretary of the Stock Exchange,\u2014a preliminary injunction was granted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>There was a contract between the parties, but after the commencement of action, plaintiff gave notice terminating the contract pursuant to its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Thereafter, the injunction was vacated by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The defendant then moved for and obtained leave to make a supplemental answer, and the supplemental answer put in showed the termination of the contract and the vacating of the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">The order vacating the injunction was expressed to be \u201c without prejudice to any of the rights of the plaintiff on the trial of this action, and without deciding that the plaintiff was not originally entitled to the injunction herein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">On the trial, the plaintiff brought on the action at the equity term, and his counsel, in opening the case, said that lie asked no relief, but claimed that having been compelled in self-defense to' terminate the contract, the plaintiff should not be charged with- costs of the action ; but the question should be determined according to the situation of the parties at the time the action was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">The court, Larremoee, Oh.

Chandler, </em>for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Barrett, J.\u2014So far as this action proceeds upon the claim for a relief against the contract, it is now without point, as the plaintiff has elected to terminate such contract. So far as it proceeds upon the general right to a continuation of the service without such a contract or upon willingness to enter into a reasonable one, the questions are too serious, and the right not sufficiently clear to justify an injunction in substance mandatory on mere motion and before trial. The plaintiff thus asks what amounts to a peremptory mandamus to compel the defendant to serve the plaintiff upon such terms and conditions as the court may think just. It is possible that this cannot be accomplished on the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>before us, without at least a full investigation at the trial at Special Term. I must say also that the authorities in this State, and especially in this department, seem to be somewhat adverse to the contention of the plaintiff\u2019s very exhaustive and able brief. The doubt thus arising should be sufficient to require a postponement of the serious questions here presented until the trial. If the plaintiff had not terminated the contract by this notice, I might have granted an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>upon payment of the rate specified in the contract, without prejudice (so far as concerned such payment) to plaintiff\u2019s ultimate rights, thus restraining any arbitrary withdrawal of service by the defendant pending the litigation. But in the present aspect of the case I see no practical course except to deny the motion fortan interim injunction, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The General Term affirmed the order appealed from with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
