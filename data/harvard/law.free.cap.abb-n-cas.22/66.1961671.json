Such an order must state, distinctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>and plainly, the questions of fact to be tried; and must, direct the trial to take place, either in a circuit court, specified in the order; or in the county court of the county of the surrogate ; or, in the city and county of Hew York, in. the court of common pleas. After the trial, a new trial may be granted, as prescribed in section two thousand five hundred and forty-eight of this act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">Section 2548 thus referred to, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">\u00a7 2548. [Am\u2019d 1886.] \u201c A trial by jury, pursuant to an order made in a proceeding for the disposition of the real property of a decedent, made as prescribed in the last section, can be reviewed, in the first instance, only upon a motion for a new trial. A new trial may be granted by the surrogate or the court in which the trial took place, or, if it took place at the circuit court, by the supreme court, in a case where a new trial of specific questions of fact, tried by a jury, pursuant toan order for such trial, made'in an action, would be granted. The verdict of the jury must be certified to the surrogate\u2019s court by the clerk of the court in which the trial took place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">Upon the order for trial of issues of fact, the cause came on to bb tried in the court of common pleas before Judge Van Hobsen and a jury. The questions were submitted to the jury, who answered them in favor of proponent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">The question was then raised how the record should be returned, whether to the supreme court who ordered the trial, or to the surrogate\u2019s court, where the final decree was to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-10\"><em>Wm. H. Arnoux (Francis C. Devlin, </em>proctor), for proponents.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-11\"><em>Roger A. Pryor (S. B. Chittenden, Jr., </em>proctor), for contestants.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> This decision indicates the practice on a point not before settled. It arises in a proceeding of considerable importance and resorted to ' with increasing frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The rule adopted favors simple and direct procedure and appears to be in harmony with the general scheme of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Such clauses of the statute in reference to jury trial of issues in any cases arising in surrogate\u2019s courts, as give any express'indication on the subject, favor the rule adopted in the text. Thus section 2547, which authorizes the surrogate of the city and county of New York to order a jury trial in proceedings for sale of real property to be had in the common pleas, provides that if the verdict be sustained upon appeal to the General Term on the court of appeals, \u201c The court of common pleas shall certify to the surrogate\u2019s court the verdict.\u2019\u2019 In the absence of such a provision it would never be claimed that if the court of appeals should reverse an order refusing a new trial, and direct the common pleas to proceed with a new trial, the verdict should not be returned direct to the surrogate\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">So if the supreme court should affirm a decree on probate, and the direction to try an issue be given in the first instance by the court of appeals on reversing the decree, it would never be suggested that the verdict should not go direct to the surrogate\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The only object of returning the verdict in the first instance to the supreme court would be to preserve the right of control and review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that court. But this idea is foreclosed, and review in a simpler way provided for by the direction of section 2648 that a new trial may be granted \u201c by the surrogate or the court in which the trial took place, or, <em>if it tools place at a circuit court, </em>by the supreme court,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Van Hoesen, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">directed that the record be returned to the surrogate, which was accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Ransom, Surr., thereupon admitted the will to probate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> In Matter of Campbell, 48 <em>Hun, </em>417, it was held that after a trial of the issues at the circuit court, pursuant to a general term reversal of a surrogate\u2019s decree refusing probate of a will, the general term directing the issues to be tried at circuit, the circuit court cannot grant costs, but the verdict should be certified to the surrogate, who should grant or refuse probate accordingly, and it is for him to pass on the question of costs, unless the appellate court acted upon the question of costs when it decided the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
