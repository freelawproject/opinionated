On March 19, 1996, the Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, issued an order remanding the case to this Court for reconsideration in light of its order. <em>People v Gatewood, </em>450 Mich 1021 (1996). Pursuant to that order, appellate review of habitual offender sentences using the sentencing guidelines in any fashion is inappropriate. Thus, our review of an habitual offender sentence is limited to considering whether the sentence violates the principle of proportionality set forth in <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), without reference to the guidelines. In light of the circumstances surrounding the offense and offender in this case, we conclude that defendant\u2019s sentence does not violate the principle of proportionality, <em>Milboum, supra, </em>and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant, <em>People v Cervantes, </em>448 Mich 620, 627, 630; 532 NW2d 831 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
