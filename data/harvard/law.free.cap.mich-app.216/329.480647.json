In our original opinion, we affirmed the ruling of the trial court that certain statements introduced into evidence were not hearsay because they constituted prior consistent statements by complainant introduced to rebut defendant\u2019s charge of recent fabrication pursuant to MRE 801(d)(1)(B). Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 13, 1995 (Docket No. 161389). Our Supreme Court instructed this Court to consider on remand whether MRE 801(d)(1)(B) allows the admission of prior consistent statements of witnesses made after the motive for fabrication arose. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">In a jury trial, defendant was convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. MCL 750.520c(l)(a); MSA 28.788(3)(l)(a). The complainant was his thir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>teen-year-old stepdaughter. During the trial, defendant argued that complainant had a history of lying and that she fabricated the alleged sexual abuse. At trial, two teachers testified that complainant had told them about the alleged sexual abuse. Defendant argued that the teachers\u2019 testimony regarding complainant\u2019s out-of-court statements was inadmissible hearsay. The trial court ruled that this testimony was admissible as a prior consistent statement pursuant to MRE 801(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">MRE 801(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\"><em>Statements which are not hearsay. </em>A statement is not hearsay if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(1) <em>Prior statement of witness. </em>The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is . . . (B) consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The United States Supreme Court has recently addressed this issue with regard to FRE 801(d)(1)(B). The Supreme Court held that the requirement of recent fabrication indicated that the consistent statements must have been made before the motive to fabricate arose. While a consistent statement that predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived, consistent statements made after the motive to fabricate arose provide very little support against a charge of fabrication. <em>Tome v United States, </em>513 US _, _; 115 S Ct 696; 130 L Ed 2d 574 (1995). MRE 801(d)(1)(B) is identical to its federal counterpart regarding prior consistent statements of a declarant to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. FRE 801(d)(1)(B). Therefore, for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sons stated in <em>Tome, supra, </em>a consistent statement made after the motive to fabricate arose does not fall within the parameters of the hearsay exclusion for prior consistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, defense counsel explored the complainant\u2019s reasons for allegedly fabricating the charges against defendant. Because each of these motives to fabricate occurred before her conversations with her teachers, the complainant\u2019s statements should not have been admitted as prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of recent fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">However, we hold that the erroneous admission of this evidence was harmless. The erroneous admission of evidence is harmless if it did not prejudice the defendant. <em>People v Lee, </em>212 Mich App 228, 244; 537 NW2d 233 (1995). The teachers testified about prior statements of the complainant. Because the complainant testified about the alleged sexual abuse at trial, the teachers\u2019 testimony only reiterated the complainant\u2019s testimony that she had been abused. Because the teacher\u2019s testimony was mere cumulative evidence, we hold that the admission of this testimony did not prejudice defendant. <em>People v Fortson, </em>202 Mich App 13; 507 NW2d 763 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
