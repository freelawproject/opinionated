He asserts the district court erred when it: (1) denied his motion to suppress the warrant-based searches of his residence; (2) denied his request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing; (3) denied his request for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of Officer Gratz's personnel file; (4) allowed a witness to testify as to an altercation over Mazzulla's Federal Rule of Evidence 403 objection; (5) failed to give a simple possession instruction. Finally, Mazzulla contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Lincoln, Nebraska, Police Department (\"LPD\") began investigating Rodney Mazzulla in July 2015 when it received information from confidential sources that a man named \"Rob,\" who owned a tree-trimming service, was selling methamphetamine. Officer Anthony Gratz contacted Mazzulla claiming to have a fallen tree that needed to be removed and Mazzulla agreed to meet him. During the meeting, Mazzulla admitted to possession of a personal quantity of methamphetamine and consented to a search of his vehicle. During the search Officer Gratz found 3.1 grams of methamphetamine. Mazzulla was arrested and brought to the police station, where he was read a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. Mazzulla waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and\n   agreed to an interview. During the interview, Mazzulla admitted that over the past two years he sold up to two ounces of methamphetamine per week to his employees. Despite these admissions Mazzulla was not indicted in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2017, Officer Gratz received a confidential tip describing Shawndell Burke's involvement in drug trafficking out of her residence located at 1010 South 10th St. Officer Gratz conducted surveillance of the residence and observed what appeared to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction involving two vehicles. One of the persons involved was Burke. Officer Gratz attempted a traffic stop but Burke fled and was able to avoid arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 2, 2017, Officer Gratz received another confidential tip that Troy Utley was selling methamphetamine out of Burke's residence. Later that evening Officer Gratz encountered Utley with methamphetamine on his person and arrested him. On the way to the police station, Utley pointed out a garage at 1421 S. Folsom St. (\"Folsom St. garage\"), stating Mazzulla was residing there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the police station Utley waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and consented to an interview, during which he stated that Burke regularly kept between a half-pound and two pounds of methamphetamine. Utley identified Mazzulla as Burke's source. Utley also told Officer Gratz that Burke and Mazzulla were living in the Folsom St. garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the Utley interview, Officer Gratz returned to the Folsom St. garage to conduct surveillance, arriving at about 4:00 a.m. Fifteen minutes later Officer Gratz saw Richard Scov leave the garage on a bicycle. Officer Gratz stopped Scov for a traffic violation but before he could make actual contact with him, another officer observed Scov drop something. Officer Gratz retrieved the item, which turned out to be a pouch containing a small amount of methamphetamine. Scov related that he had just left \"Rod Azzu's\" residence, that \"Azzu\" lived in a garage, and that he believed \"Azzu\" was still there. Officer Gratz sought and obtained a search warrant for the Folsom St. garage. Law enforcement executed the warrant at around 7:15 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officers entered the garage where they observed a parked camper. Inside the camper they saw people moving about. The officers ordered the people to come out, and Mazzulla and a woman (later identified as Rhonda Meador) stepped out. The officers searched the motor home and found approximately 49 grams of methamphetamine, a pistol, and some drug paraphernalia. Mazzulla and Meador were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A few days later, Burke retrieved cash from the camper which had been left in the Folsom St. garage and posted bond for Mazzulla and Meador. Burke was arrested in her home on April 21, 2017, and taken to the Lancaster County jail where she waived her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and made a statement. Burke told officers that she had been to Mazzulla's residence where she had observed a quantity of methamphetamine in the gas tank of a black motorcycle. Armed with this information, Officer Gratz prepared affidavits supporting warrants for the search of both the 1010 South 10th St. and the 1421 S. Folsom St. residences. In each affidavit, Officer Gratz attested that Burke was living at the respective address for which he was obtaining search warrants, rather than indicating that Burke was residing intermittently at each place. The search of Burke's 1010 South 10th St. residence resulted in the seizure of 85.1 grams of methamphetamine located in Burke's bedroom. The search of the Folsom St. garage was done in the early morning of April 22 and resulted in seizure of 210 grams of methamphetamine\n   found under the hood of Burke's green van parked in the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Pre-Trial Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Burke and Mazzulla were indicted as co-defendants. Mazzulla was indicted on four counts: (I) conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 841(b)(1)(A) ; (II) possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B) ; (III) possession of a firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crimes charged in counts I and II in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i) ; and (V) distribution of and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mazzulla filed a motion to suppress both searches of the Folsom St. garage. He contended the affidavit for the first search warrant failed to establish sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, and the second warrant improperly relied on fruits of the allegedly illegal first search. Mazzulla also filed a motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), hearing, claiming that both affidavits contained statements made with reckless disregard of the truth and intentional or reckless omissions that made the affidavits misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A magistrate judge found that the information obtained from confidential informants was sufficiently corroborated in two ways: first, by the officers' investigation, and second, because the informants' statements corroborated each other. While the motions were pending, Mazzulla's counsel was allowed to withdraw as a result of recently discovered conflict. On October 24, 2017, the magistrate judge recommended the district court deny the suppression motion and the motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the recommendation was adopted by the district judge, Mazzulla's new counsel moved to limit the scope of the ruling on the suppression motion and for leave to file additional briefing. The court granted the motion, withdrew the prior findings and recommendation, and allowed additional briefing on the suppression motion with regard to the searches of the Folsom St. garage. After the supplemental briefing was complete Mazzulla filed a supplemental motion to suppress and request for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the second motion Mazzulla incorporated all of the original arguments and for the first time asserted that both of the Folsom St. garage search warrants failed to establish a nexus between the drugs sought and the location searched. In seeking a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing Mazzulla argued that Officer Gratz intentionally omitted material facts from the affidavits and that he made materially false statements. The magistrate judge found that each affidavit established a sufficient nexus, and there was probable cause to search the garage on both occasions. The magistrate judge also found that, assuming Officer Gratz omitted facts or made false statements in the warrant affidavits, Mazzulla \"failed to show these misrepresentations or concealments misled the issuing judge or were material to the finding of probable cause.\" DCD 76 at 15. The magistrate judge found that Mazzulla failed to show that Officer Gratz willfully or recklessly concealed any material facts, and denied the\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. Finally, the magistrate judge granted an evidentiary hearing on whether the motor home was a vehicle or a residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following a January 30, 2018, hearing the magistrate judge made further findings as to the nature of the camper and recommended that the motion to suppress should be denied because even though the camper did not appear to be a residence it was readily capable of being driven, and fell within the automobile exception as described in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Holleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116828\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/1152/#p1158\">\n    743 F.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1158 (8th Cir. 2014). The magistrate judge continued to recommend denial of a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's findings, recommendations, and orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mazzulla filed a motion seeking disclosure of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material or an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of Officer Gratz's personnel file. The motion was based primarily on two civil lawsuits filed against Officer Gratz alleging that while working on drug cases he had engaged in sexual relationships with cooperating witnesses, manipulated those relationships to plant evidence, and participated in an unlawful search resulting in the seizure of $224,000. Officer Gratz testified that he was never disciplined by LPD for credibility matters or the matters surrounding the lawsuits, nor was he asked to resign. The district court found that Officer Gratz's character or truthfulness was not called into question and sustained the government's objection to Mazzulla's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, Burke testified that she saw Mazzulla \"hit Rhonda in the face,\" over \"really nothing.\" The court sustained Mazzulla's objection to the testimony as general \"bad act\" evidence unrelated to drug activity, and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. Burke later described another situation where Mazzulla fought with Rhonda over drug money. Mazzulla's attorney did not object at the time, but he later asked the court to direct the jury to disregard Burke's answer to this question because it was unfairly prejudicial. The court overruled the motion, finding that it was directly related to drugs and money. During the course of trial, several other witnesses testified about their drug-related interactions with Mazzulla, most of whom had bought various quantities of methamphetamine from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the close of evidence, Mazzulla requested that the jury be provided a simple possession jury instruction, instead of possession with intent to distribute as to Count II (49 grams of methamphetamine found during the first search of the garage). The district judge denied the request, finding that: 49 grams was more than a personal quantity; there was evidence of distribution found during the search; and there was testimony about Mazzulla's involvement in distribution. The jury found Mazzulla guilty on Counts I, II, and V. The court sentenced Mazzulla to 312 months on each count concurrently, with five years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

April 2 Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mazzulla challenges the April 2 search warrant claiming there was no evidence of a nexus between the contraband and the Folsom St. garage. In Mazzulla's view the affidavit has \"sparse information related to 1421 S. Folsom Street.\" The April 2 affidavit statements tied to the Folsom St. garage included the following information: (1) Utley stated that Burke was his dealer and that she received her methamphetamine from Mazzulla; (2) Utley stated that Burke and Mazzulla were living together at a utility shop near Folsom and West A streets; (3) Utley identified the Folsom St. garage as Mazzulla's residence; (4) Mazzulla had a tree-trimming business called \"Azzu Tree Trimming Service,\" where Burke was employed; (5) Scov was found with methamphetamine and paraphernalia after Officer Gratz observed him leaving the garage; and (6) Scov stated he was coming from \"Rod Azzu's\" residence, a.k.a. the Folsom St. garage. This information provides a substantial basis for a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant of the Folsom St. garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    2. Separate Warrant for the Camper\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mazzulla claims that the search of the camper required a separate warrant because it was his residence, which was separate and apart from the Folsom St. garage. The magistrate judge recommended Mazzulla's motion to suppress be denied, in part because it did not appear that the camper was any more Mazzulla's residence than the garage itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mazzulla attempts to differentiate the garage from the camper by pointing out that a garage is not typically used as a residence. However, the photographs of the garage show that it was filled with living utensils, furniture, clothing, and debris that would result from someone living in it. The district court's adoption of the magistrate judge's factual finding that \"the mobile home appeared no more 'lived in' or 'residential' than the remainder of the garage\" was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mazzulla argues that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schroeder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11895937\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/439/\">\n    129 F.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1997), supports the proposition that \"noticeably separate\" does not mean \"physically separate\" from the parcel being searched. However,\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   relies precisely on physical separation for distinguishing structures for Fourth Amendment purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   , a barn, separated by a fence from the residence, was found to be outside the residence's curtilage and therefore outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment. If a barn, used by the inhabitants of a nearby residence\n   but otherwise uninhabited, and separated from it by a mere fence, is, for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, a separate entity, then surely two residences, separated by barbed wire and maintaining separate addresses, are as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11895937\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/439/\">\n    129 F.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (discussing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here the camper was not separated from the garage in any manner. There was no fence, curtilage, or any other boundary demarcations. The presence of all of the furniture, clothing and living debris tied both the camper and the garage together. The photographs show that the space was used, as a whole, to live in. The camper was located fully inside the Folsom St. garage for which the search warrant was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mazzulla also argues that the magistrate judge misapplied the \"vehicle exception\" test in\n   <em>\n    California v.

We do not believe these statements are necessarily inconsistent-a person can live at more than one address. This is particularly true when, as Officer Gratz explained at trial, people are on the run from police and likely aware\n   that the police have raided their legal residence. More importantly, this was a search warrant looking not for Burke, but methamphetamine. Whether Burke was living at one address or the other was of far less consideration than Burke's presence at the two addresses. Even if \"living\" is redacted, there remains sufficient probable cause to issue the warrant. Any potentially misleading facts in the affidavits for the search warrant were immaterial to the granting of the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mazzulla also argues that \"his Supplemental Application for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing contained additional factual information that was apparently not addressed or considered for\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   purposes.\" Alternatively, Mazzulla argues that \"no ruling was made at all.\" Mazzulla argues that either way, the district court violated Fed.
