The MPPAA imposes liability on employers who withdraw from covered plans by ceasing contributions in whole or in part. This appeal involves one type of partial withdrawal, \"bargaining out,\" which occurs when an employer \"permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute ... but continues to perform work ... of the type for which contributions were previously required.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201385\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(i) (ERISA \u00a7 4205(b)(2)(A)(i)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Appellee Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CEC) once operated four casinos in Atlantic City: Caesars, Bally's, Harrah's, and Showboat. These comprised a \"controlled group\" under ERISA, with CEC being the \"single employer\" of the group.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201301\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (ERISA \u00a7 4001(b)(1));\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204001.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 4001.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CEC bargained with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 68 (the Union), for engineering work at all four casinos. Under their collective bargaining agreements with the Union, each casino had to contribute to the Union's multiemployer pension fund (the Fund). The Fund had 259 contributing employers making some $14 million in annual payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local 68 Engineers Union Pension Plan, Form 5500: FY 2013 Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan 2, 23 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014, the Showboat casino closed, and CEC stopped contributing to the Fund for engineering work there. The other three casinos under CEC's control remain open, and CEC continues to pay the Fund for their Union work. Showboat's closure reduced CEC's total contributions to the Fund by 17%-well below the MPPAA's\n   70% threshold that would have automatically triggered liability for a partial withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201381\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1385(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although CEC was not automatically liable, the Fund claimed CEC was liable under the bargaining out provision of the MPPAA, which applies when an employer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [1] permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but [2] continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement\n   <em>\n    of the type for which contributions were previously required\n   </em>\n   or transfers such work to another location or to an entity or entities owned or controlled by the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1385(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201381\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1385(a)(2). CEC disagreed. So the parties went to arbitration, and CEC lost. The arbitrator held CEC had triggered both clauses [1] and [2] of the bargaining out provision. As relevant to this appeal, the arbitrator reasoned clause [2] applied because \"[t]he type of work for which contributions were required at the closed Showboat is the same type of work currently being done at the remaining casinos.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1833516\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app/2/345/\">\n    2 App. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court reversed the arbitrator's decision.\n   <em>\n    Caesars Entm't Corp. v.

But it held that, under clause [2], liability exists only when an employer replaces (a) work that contributes to the pension fund with (b) \"work-of the same sort-that does not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.

First, \"previously\" connotes something that is no longer the case. In arriving at this conclusion, we give \"previously\" its ordinary meaning at the time Congress enacted the relevant provision.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    New Prime Inc. v.

Around the time of the MPPAA's enactment, dictionary definitions of \"previous\" and its adverbial form included \"coming or occurring before something else; prior:\n   <em>\n    the previous owner\n   </em>\n   .\" The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1535 (2d unabr. ed. 1987);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   The Oxford English Dictionary 1340 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"previously\" as \"at a previous or preceding time; before, beforehand, antecedently\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1070 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \"previous\" as \"antecedent; prior; before\"). Similarly, the largest structured corpus of historical English shows that the word's most common synonyms in the 1970s-80s were \"before\" (the synonym used roughly 86% of the time), \"earlier\" (12%), and \"formerly\" (1%).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corpus of Historical American English, BYU, https://www.english-corpora.org/coha/ (last visited May 3, 2019);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muscarello v.

So to say something is \"previously required\" is to suggest it is no longer required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the canon against surplusage confirms that \"previously\" means \"no longer required.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Advocate Health Care Network v.

If Congress had meant to adopt the Fund's interpretation, it could have omitted \"previously\" to no effect. The provision would have targeted work \"for which contributions were [ ] required.\" Because that's not what Congress wrote, we give \"previously\" some meaning. And that meaning tracks what we've learned from dictionaries and corpus linguistics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For these reasons, the best reading of \"work ... of the type for which contributions were previously required\" excludes work of the type for which contributions are\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   required. To hold otherwise would put us in conflict with our sister courts' interpretation of identical language in another MPPAA provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201383\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i) (ERISA \u00a7 4203(b)(2)(B)(i)). Section 1383(b)(2)(B)(i) imposes complete withdrawal liability on employers in the construction industry when they continue to perform \"work ... of the type for which contributions were previously required.\" Two of our sister courts have held that the same provision imposes liability only when employers \"cease making payments to the plan\" for a type of work (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , construction) \"while continuing to do [that work] in the area.\"\n   <em>\n    Resilient Floor Covering Pension Tr.

Letter 83-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2022426\">\n    1983 WL 22426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Sept. 2, 1983). According to the PBGC, liability under the bargaining out provision arises \"only [in] situations where work of the same type is continued by the employer but for which contributions to a plan which were required are\n   <em>\n    no longer required\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2022426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). So an employer isn't liable when it \"closes one [facility] and shifts the work of that [facility] to other [facilities] which are covered by other [CBAs] under which contributions are made to the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%2022426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That's precisely what happened here. And we, like the District Court, find that the PBGC's view tracks the text of the MPPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Fund cites two other PBGC Opinion Letters (86-21 and 86-17), but both support CEC. Letter 86-21 involved an employer replacing plan-contributing work (packing produce in a shed) with non-contributing\n   work (packing in a field).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PBGC Op. Letter 86-21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%2038800\">\n    1986 WL 38800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Sept. 29, 1986). So the PBGC concluded that the employer had partially withdrawn, assuming shed-packing and field-packing were the same \"type\" of work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%2038800\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But unlike that employer, CEC didn't shift to non-contributing work. It simply closed the Showboat operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Letter 86-17 addressed a company closing a CBA-covered facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PBGC Op. Letter 86-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%2038796\">\n    1986 WL 38796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Aug. 1, 1986). Like CEC, that company continued to contribute to the same pension plan through another facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%2038796\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But unlike CEC, that company outsourced the closed facility's work to third-parties \"unrelated to the [company] in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%2038796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even though that outsourcing arguably replaced contributing work with non-contributing work, the PBGC held the company wasn't liable for bargaining out. The PBGC again stressed, as it did in Letter 83-20, that \"in no case do these rules [of the bargaining out provision] impose liability on an employer for merely ceasing or terminating an operation; rather, they address only situations where work of the same type is continued by the employer but for which contributions to a plan which were required are no longer required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 (quoting 126 Cong. Rec. H7900 (daily ed. Aug. 26, 1980) (statement of Rep. Frank Thompson, Jr.)). In sum, when the PBGC addressed practically the same situation we face here, it refused to find withdrawal liability against the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fund's final response to the textual and administrative headwinds we have described is an appeal to purposivism. According to the Fund, the \"fundamental purpose\" of the MPPAA is to ensure the solvency of employee pensions. Fund Br. 30. So CEC simply must be liable because Showboat's closure decreased the Fund's contribution base. And failing to impose liability would allegedly allow a \"race for the exits\" in which the three other CEC casinos could stop contributing without consequence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Once again, we disagree. The MPPAA's purpose is neither one-dimensional nor easy to promote through employer liability. It's certainly true that the MPPAA aims to foster both \"maintenance and growth\" of multiemployer plans. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001a(c)(2) (MPPAA, \u00a7 3(c)(2), 94 Stat. at 1209);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trs. of Teamsters Local 863 Pension Fund v. Foodtown, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452555,9402629\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/164/\">\n    296 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (3d Cir. 2002). But as counsel for the Fund acknowledged at oral argument, if we adopted the Fund's interpretation, employers would even be liable for conduct that does not reduce their pension contributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument Audio 3:20-4:45. The risk of such capricious liability would discourage \"the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans\" in the first place. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001a(c)(2). Incentives matter, and employers have many alternatives to multiemployer plans.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SEC, Employer-Sponsored Plans, Investor.gov (last visited Apr. 30, 2019), https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/retirement-plans/employer-sponsored-plans [https://perma.cc/5PLE-KM3E]. So employers would be less likely to opt into the MPPAA's regulatory regime if it imposed liability on innocuous business activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Fund's position thus shows why \"it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that\n   <em>\n    whatever\n   </em>\n   furthers the statute's primary objective must be the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Rather than appealing to broad statutory objectives, pension funds should look to\n   Congress's statutory safeguards against plan insolvency.
