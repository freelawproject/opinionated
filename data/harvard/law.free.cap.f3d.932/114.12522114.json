This appeal involves a putative consumer class action seeking damages resulting from the delamination, i.e., peeling and flaking, of the lining of certain Ford truck fuel tanks between 2001 and 2010-a problem that plagued numerous Ford F-Series and E-Series vehicles in multiple countries and that, according to Appellant Galo Coba, Ford knew stemmed from a defect. It requires us to resolve two open questions for our Court: first, whether a district court's denial of class certification divests the court of jurisdiction in a case where its jurisdiction was predicated solely on the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; and second, whether a warranty that covers only defects in \"materials or workmanship\" extends to design defects under New Jersey common law. We must also evaluate whether a reasonable jury could conclude on this record that Ford knew the alleged fuel-tank defect was the cause of the delamination problem at the relevant time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because we conclude that the District Court properly exercised its jurisdiction, that the materials-or-workmanship warranty did not cover design defects, and that the record evidence of Ford's knowledge about the defect does not create a triable issue, we will affirm the District Court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Ford on all of Coba's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ford's Fuel Tank Troubles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2001 and continuing over the decade that followed, Ford received waves of complaints from customers who purchased certain F-Series and E-Series vehicles reporting similar types of malfunction related to their vehicles' fuel tanks. The fuel tanks used in certain vehicle models were susceptible to a problem known as \"delamination,\" whereby particles of the tank lining would separate from the underlying metal and mix with the vehicle's fuel. As the fuel carrying those particles makes its way through the vehicle's fuel system, the particles can clog the fuel filter, which constrains fuel flow to the engine and reduces power. The particles can also damage fuel-system components, such as injectors. If left untreated, the problem eventually may lead to difficulties starting the engine or keeping the vehicle running.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2001, when Ford first received reports that some of its vehicles were exhibiting fuel-tank delamination problems, the complaints came exclusively from customers in Brazil. Over the next few years, cases of delamination cropped up in the United States, though they were largely clustered in certain regions. For example, as of January 2004, forty-three of the eighty-six warranty claims submitted to Ford that related to delamination had come from customers in Ohio. Because of the geographically concentrated occurrence of the delamination complaints, both Ford and the supplier of its fuel-tank coatings, Magni Industries, Inc., suspected that unique qualities in regional fuel supplies were to blame for delamination. In particular, as Ford investigated, its suspicions gravitated toward fuel containing excessive concentrations of biodiesel, which Ford recommended against using because its tanks were not authorized to withstand biodiesel concentrations over 5%. That theory was consistent with Ford's data in some respects because Brazil, where the problem started, did not have established biodiesel regulations until 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Ford could not confirm that biodiesel was the culprit-and Ford's engineers sometimes questioned the biodiesel hypothesis in light of inconclusive testing-Ford's leads were compelling enough that it started working with Magni in 2005 to develop a more biodiesel-resistant coating. And by February 2007, Ford released an improved coating, called \"A35,\" to replace the prior \"A36\" coating in F-Series Super Duty trucks. Around the same time, Ford sent a message to dealers notifying them about the release of the new tank coating and explaining that fuel tanks in certain Ford trucks had delaminated, which Ford attributed to \"the use of fuels containing concentrations of bio-diesel greater than recommended by Ford (5%).\" App. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ford's warranty claims did drop after the release of the A35 coating, but some reports of delamination persisted. Having not fully solved the problem, Ford continued its investigation. And by 2010, Ford's Materials Engineering department came to believe that biodiesel was not the root cause after all; instead, acetic and formic acids-which Ford discovered in fuel samples from service station pumps near a dealer that encountered numerous delamination complaints-were more likely the cause all along.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Coba's Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Galo Coba, the plaintiff in this case, is one of the Ford-vehicle customers whose fuel tanks delaminated. He purchased two Ford 2006 F-350 Super Duty 6.0L diesel dump trucks for his landscaping business, Coba Landscaping and Construction, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   He bought the first in October of 2006 and the second in March of 2007. By March of 2009, both trucks began exhibiting signs of tank delamination. According to Coba, the engines would misfire, the trucks lacked power when driven up hills, the fuel filters were contaminated with fuel-tank debris, and the fuel systems rusted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   He brought the trucks into a Ford dealership, which replaced the fuel tanks and fuel filters in both trucks at no cost to Coba. Despite the repairs, Coba had the same problems over and over again, needing additional replacements each time. Altogether, Coba replaced the fuel tank twice in his older truck and three times in his newer truck. Because several of the replacements occurred after the trucks' warranties had expired, Coba spent several thousand dollars on the fixes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Coba filed this class-action lawsuit against Ford Motor Company in March of 2012. As amended, the operative complaint asserts claims for breach of express warranty, violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (NJCFA), and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Ford had replaced several of Coba's fuel tanks under warranty, Coba alleges that Ford breached its written warranty-the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (NVLW)-by failing to adequately repair and replace his tanks, as the replacements turned out to have the same defects as his original tanks. The thrust of the implied-covenant-of-good-faith-and-fair-dealing claim is that when Ford repaired Coba's vehicles, it knew that the repairs would not solve Coba's delamination problems. Finally, Coba's NJCFA claim rests on allegations that Ford purposefully failed to disclose to Coba and other customers the defect in its fuel tanks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court entered summary judgment in Ford's favor on all of Coba's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coba v.

Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We address a threshold issue of jurisdiction before turning to the merits of the District Court's decision. While our jurisdiction to hear Coba's appeal is clear under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the propriety of the District Court's jurisdiction is less straightforward and an issue we must address at the outset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court initially exercised jurisdiction over Coba's suit-a class action asserting state-law claims-pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), which gives district courts \"original jurisdiction of any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds ... $5,000,000 ...\n   <em>\n    and is a class action\n   </em>\n   in which ... any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added). But when the District Court entered summary judgment on three of Coba's four claims in September of 2016, it simultaneously denied Coba's motion for class certification as moot even though it had not yet disposed of the NJCFA claim. Because \u00a7 1332(d) provides original jurisdiction only over \"class action[s],\" that ruling raises the question whether the District Court still had jurisdiction when it entered its final summary judgment order in August of 2017. Thus, before we address the merits of this appeal, we must consider an issue of first impression for our Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   If a federal court properly exercises jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1332(d) at the time a claim is filed or removed, does a subsequent denial of class certification divest the court of subject-matter jurisdiction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In accordance with every other Circuit Court to address this question, we conclude that it does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We start with the text: District courts have \"original jurisdiction\" over \"class action[s],\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2), which the statute defines as \"civil action[s]\n   <em>\n    filed under\n   </em>\n   [R]ule 23 ... or [a] similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought ... as a class action,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1332(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added).

As an initial matter, the plain definitions of \"workmanship\" and \"materials\" are conceptually distinct from the definition of \"design.\" \"Workmanship\" is the \"the execution or manner of making or doing something,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2635 (1993),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"materials\" are the \"the basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, building, fabric) is made,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1392.

The District Court held, as to the first, that Coba failed to put forth sufficient evidence of Ford's knowledge of the design defect, and, as to the second, that \"the information about the risk of delamination that Ford had available to it at the time [Coba purchased his trucks] was not material.\"\n   <em>\n    Coba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203332264\">\n    2017 WL 3332264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-9.

Internal email correspondence shows that, as early as 2005, Ford knew that the problem had existed for several years and was investigating its cause. But the evidence does not show that Ford knew that the cause was the design of its tanks. To the contrary, it shows that throughout the relevant period, Ford suspected the problem was the improper use by certain customers of fuel with high biodiesel concentrations, which seemed plausible in light of the geographic clustering of delamination occurrence and the phenomenon's origin in Brazil. In September 2006, which was one month before Coba purchased his first Ford vehicle, a meeting of Ford managers and engineers concluded that \"[t]he cause for damaged fuel tanks is biodiesel (both refined and the home brewed type) with bio concentrations greater than 20% (Ford only authorizes concentrations up to 5%).\" App. 1145. And biodiesel fuel remained the prime suspect in February 2007, just before Coba bought his second truck, as apparent in both the message Ford then sent to dealers explaining that fuel containing biodiesel at high concentrations might cause delamination, and its development of the more biodiesel-resistant A35 coating that it released that month. As the District Court concluded, there was no genuine dispute that at the time Coba bought his trucks, Ford \"believ[ed] that the problem was due to instances of contaminated fuel, affecting a limited number of tanks, rather than a defectively designed tank.\"\n   <em>\n    Coba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203332264\">\n    2017 WL 3332264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although Coba posits that the District Court only reached this conclusion by \"construing all facts and drawing all inferences ... in favor of [Ford],\" Appellant's Br. 56, the evidence to which he points fails to raise a triable issue. Coba relies primarily on a 2005 email from a Ford engineer remarking that recent tests of tanks exhibiting delamination uncovered \"no bio-diesel traces\" and noting that they were looking at \"different additives that could cause [the] delamination.\" App. 963. But, viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Coba, it shows that some Ford engineers had doubts whether biodiesel was the problem and they were continuing to investigate. It does not support the inference, as Coba contends, that Ford knew the problem was a design defect and that biodiesel was a \"pretext,\" Appellant's Reply Br. 20.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the most favorable evidence in the record for Coba concerning the rate of delamination comes from Ford's expert who analyzed Ford's warranty database and found that Ford was replacing Magni-lined steel fuel tanks for model year 2003-2007 F-series trucks like Coba's at a rate of less than 1% across the United States. That replacement rate, moreover, included all tank replacements, not merely those related to delamination, suggesting an even lower replacement rate for delaminated tanks. And while Coba criticizes the warranty data as under-inclusive because it covered only tanks that Ford actually replaced while excluding those denied warranty coverage, he identifies no concrete evidence of a higher rate of delamination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In any event, the relevant question is not the actual rate of delamination viewed in hindsight, but what Ford knew and therefore could have disclosed to customers about that rate. And the warranty data-reflecting delamination-based replacements at a rate of even less than 1%-was the information Ford had at the time. As to that small percentage, based on the undisputed evidence that Ford then believed biodiesel to be the culprit and the recommendation in its owner's manual against using those fuels, Ford had every reason to believe that risk was mitigated-as would any reasonable customer in possession of that same information. We therefore agree with the District Court that \"[n]o reasonable factfinder could conclude that this information would be material to a reasonable consumer prospectively deciding, in March 2007, whether to purchase a Ford 6.0L diesel truck.\"\n   <em>\n    Coba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203332264\">\n    2017 WL 3332264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.
