The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sentenced Gammell to 60 months on the conspiracy count and, after classifying Gammell as an armed career criminal, to 180 months on the felon-in-possession counts, with the sentences running concurrently. The district court also ordered Gammell to pay $955,656.77 in restitution to 14 victims of his attacks. In this consolidated appeal, Gammell challenges both his classification as an armed career criminal and the district court's restitution order. Having jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between 2015 and 2017, Gammell engaged in a campaign of malicious computer attacks against various entities with whom he had personal grievances. The attacks, known as distributed denial of service attacks, or DDoS attacks, use repeated attempts to deny service to a computer or website, thereby making it inaccessible to users or customers. In essence, DDoS attacks flood a computer or website with\n   massive amounts of internet traffic to the point that the computer or website becomes disabled and inaccessible to users or customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gammell victimized approximately 40 different entities, comprised of companies he used to work for, companies that did not hire him, companies that he perceived as competitors to his business, law enforcement agencies, and court systems. His attacks lasted anywhere from weeks to two years and resulted in the disruption or complete disabling of the victims' websites, applications, or computer systems. Each of his victims experienced difficulty in restoring the reliability, functionality, and accessability of the affected websites, and expended significant efforts and resources in identifying the source of the attacks and in taking suitable mitigation and infrastructure improvement measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Throughout the course of his attacks, Gammell made considerable efforts to conceal his identity as the perpetrator. When using his own computer to launch DDoS attacks, Gammell used a service to mask his IP address, used encrypted and drive cleaning tools to conceal any evidence of the attacks on his computer, spoofed email addresses, and used names of victims' former employees to create suspicion against other individuals. Gammell also utilized third-party companies to launch attacks, which significantly multiplied the number of attacks and further concealed Gammell as the perpetrator. Gammell also used cryptocurrency to pay the third-party companies in a continued effort to conceal his identity. On at least two occasions, Gammell also sent emails to affected entities, bragging about the attacks and mocking the entities for the disruptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gammell was subsequently charged with conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer, along with two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The two felon-in-possession counts arose out of conduct that occurred outside of Minnesota. In May 2017 in Colorado, Gammell possessed the parts necessary to build an AR-15 assault rifle and he possessed 420 rounds of ammunition. Also in May 2017, in New Mexico, Gammell possessed two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Gammell pled guilty to all three counts pursuant to a plea agreement, which included a waiver of venue with respect to the felon-in-possession counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At sentencing, the district court determined that Gammell had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies that qualified as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The district court identified the three predicate offenses as two convictions in Minnesota state court in 1981 for aggravated robbery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20609.245\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 609.245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 609.11 (1979), and a 1984 conviction in Minnesota state court for aiding and abetting second-degree burglary, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20609.582\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 609.582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   subd. 2(a) and 609.05 (1983). The district court determined a United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months imprisonment. However, due to the ACCA-triggered mandatory minimum of 180 months for each of the felon-in-possession counts, the district court set the appropriate sentencing range at 180 months. The district court imposed a 180-month sentence for each felon-in-possession count and a 60-month sentence for the conspiracy count. The district court ordered the sentences to run concurrently, for a total term of imprisonment of 180 months. The district court also ordered that Gammell pay restitution pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, but left the amount pending to allow for an evidentiary hearing. After the subsequent two-day\n   evidentiary hearing, the district court ordered Gammell to pay restitution to 14 of his victims in the total amount of $955,656.77. This consolidated appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Gammell first asserts that the district court erroneously sentenced him as an armed career criminal, arguing that the district court incorrectly concluded that he had the requisite predicate offenses. \"We review de novo whether a prior conviction is a predicate offense under the ACCA.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Gammell argues that his two prior convictions for aggravated robbery are not violent felonies and asserts that his previous conviction for aiding and abetting second-degree burglary cannot serve as a predicate offense because Minnesota's aiding and abetting statute is broader than generic aiding and abetting. We find both contentions unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, as Gammell concedes, prior panels of this Court have already determined that aggravated robbery under Minnesota law is a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court appropriately considered Gammell's prior aggravated robbery convictions as violent felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, Gammell's argument regarding his conviction for aiding and abetting second-degree burglary is premised upon his assertion that a distinction exists between accomplice liability and primary liability for the purposes of ACCA applicability. He does not dispute that second-degree burglary is a violent felony; rather, he asserts that aiding and abetting accomplice liability is distinct from the substantive offense and requires evaluation of the Minnesota aiding and abetting statute. But as our Court has previously explained \"[a]iding and abetting, not itself an offense, [is] simply one way to prove [the defendant] guilty of [the substantive offense].\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, for the purposes of applying the ACCA, it matters not whether Gammell was convicted as a principal or aider or abettor; it matters only whether the substantive offense qualifies as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

As Gammell does not dispute that second-degree burglary is a violent felony, the district court did not err in counting this conviction as a predicate offense under the ACCA.

Each of Gammell's arguments is unavailing. \"We review the district court's decision to award restitution for an abuse of discretion and the district court's finding as to the amount of loss for clear error.

Gammell asserts that this holding changes the landscape of every restitution award under the MVRA, but his reliance on\n   <em>\n    Lagos\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Lagos\n   </em>\n   considered the recoverability of costs of investigations with respect to restitution awards under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4), which governs restitution as it relates to lost income and other expenses incurred during the investigation or prosecution of an offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612007\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1684/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612007\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1684/\">\n    at 1687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, as the district court noted, it ordered restitution pursuant to a separate subsection of the MVRA, \u00a7 3663A(b)(1), which governs restitution regarding damage, loss, or destruction of property. The district court did not make any award specifically tied to expenses incurred in investigating Gammell as the perpetrator or in prosecuting Gammell's crimes. Rather, the so-called investigative costs were \"a prerequisite to repairing or replacing the damaged property[,]\" and thus were tied to compensation for property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restitution Order 12, Dist. Ct. Dkt. 131.\n   <em>\n    Lagos\n   </em>\n   thus has no applicability to a restitution award made pursuant to \u00a7 3663A(b)(1), a separate subsection unrelated to costs of investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Gammell asserts that the district court erred in ordering $955,656.77 in restitution because it improperly included expenses that victims incurred for mitigation services and infrastructure modifications, which effectively provided victims with a windfall because it allowed the victims to recover costs against future and speculative property loss due to already-existing security vulnerabilities. But as the district court noted, the unique and pervasive nature of Gammell's attacks required specific and extensive efforts to restore the affected website and applications to proper functionality. The district court discussed in detail the nature and substance of these efforts, including that \"Gammell's victims were deprived of their property-namely, reliable access to and use of their websites and web applications-absent the mitigation efforts they used,\" before concluding that \"[t]hese costs effectively equate to repair or cleanup costs because they involve mitigating the damage caused by Gammell's DDoS attacks and restoring a website or web application to its normal functionality, without necessarily replacing the website or web application.\" Restitution Order 8, 10. We find no error in the district court's determination that these expenses were compensable as repair or cleanup costs under the MVRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Gammell challenges the sufficiency and reliability of the evidence supporting the restitution award, asserting that requests for restitution were based on vague claims, that the victims failed to document their losses, and that the government failed to verify the amount requested by each victim. But Gammell's argument ignores the realities of the district court's thoughtful and thorough restitution order, entered following a two-day evidentiary hearing. The district court summarized the evidence upon which it based its order as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the United States introduced in evidence signed declarations or affidavits from each of the 14 victims that seeks restitution. These declarations and affidavits describe, in varying degrees of\n   detail, the actions each victim took to mitigate or remediate the damage caused by Gammell's DDoS attacks and the costs associated with those actions. In addition to the fees and labor costs involved in obtaining DDoS mitigation services and moving websites to new web hosts, Gammell's victims paid employees and third-party vendors to take other responsive actions, including investigating and diagnosing the disruptions and mitigating and remediating the effects of the DDoS attacks. Accompanying these declarations and affidavits are hundreds of pages of underlying documentation that the United States obtained from the victims, including emails, invoices and letters from third-party vendors, timesheets, and other summaries and spreadsheets. Moreover [FBI] Agent Behm testified about the contents of these documents as well as details he learned from his personal conversations with the victims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Restitution Order 12. The district court also noted that because Gammell's \"attacks created crisis situations for his victims that required immediate action,\" victims did not track all responsive actions \"with the level of precision that Gammell now demands\" and stated that \"[t]hat each victim did not respond in an identical manner to Gammell's attacks is not surprising and does not render the evidence unreliable.\" Restitution Order 13. These factors did not render the evidence so insufficient and unreliable as to undercut the validity of the district court's \"reasonable estimate of the loss[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We reached that conclusion in response to a very different argument than is presented here.
