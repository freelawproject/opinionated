In April 2016, after a high-speed chase, he complained to police chief Van Vooren about the patrol vehicle's tires and seatbelts. Mogard later complained to the assistant police chief, then to city administrator Kettwig and to a city council member. He also tried to schedule a meeting with the mayor. The following month, the city council-on recommendations from Van Vooren and Kettwig-voted to terminate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mogard sued the City, Van Vooren, and Kettwig under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging they terminated him without due process and in retaliation for his First Amendment right to publicly raise safety concerns. He also alleged wrongful termination under South Dakota law. The district court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding they were not entitled to qualified immunity because (1) Mogard's right not to be retaliated against for speaking on matter of public concern was clearly established; (2) Mogard was denied due process prior to the deprivation of a clearly-established, constitutionally-protected interest in employment and\n   his reputation; and (3) there are issues of disputed fact about the reason for Mogard's termination. Defendants appeal the denial of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability in \u00a7 1983 actions when their conduct 'does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Morgan v.
