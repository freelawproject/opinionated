During the course of the stop, the trooper discovered that Petitioners were undocumented aliens. The trooper detained them and called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), who interviewed and fingerprinted Petitioners and took them into custody. In the civil removal proceedings that followed, Petitioners argued that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment and that the evidence of their alienage should be suppressed. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") were unpersuaded. While the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not require suppression of evidence in civil removal proceedings where the purportedly offending conduct by federal agents was neither egregious nor widespread, this case presents a different context, namely, a state trooper's conduct rather than that of a federal officer. Accordingly, we must consider whether this difference leads to a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioners are undocumented aliens from Guatemala who have lived and worked in New York since 2008. They were traveling in a van with eight other men, returning to New York from Georgia. According to declarations submitted by Petitioners and other passengers, Pennsylvania State Trooper Luke C. Macke pulled the van over for speeding between 7:40 and 8:00 in the morning. Petitioners were not driving the van when this happened and were instead asleep in the back of the van. When Macke approached the driver of the vehicle, he asked for his license and registration. Petitioners allege that the driver did not have his license with him, but he gave Macke his social security number and offered to call his wife to get his driver's license number. The owner of the van, who was seated in the front passenger seat, gave Macke his own license and registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioners allege that \"[i]nstead of going back to his vehicle to check [either the van owner's or the driver's] information ... [,] [Macke] then went to the side passenger door of the van, opened the door and said [to the eight passengers in the back], 'let me see your immigration papers, work permit, visa, passport and ID.' \" Calel-Espantzay A. 211. Petitioners claim that they did not have any documents to give him, and their declarations do not\n   indicate that they verbally offered him any information. Contrary to this account, however, the Records of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (\"Forms I-213\") produced by the Government purport that, in response to Macke's inquiry, the Petitioners admitted that they were citizens of another country. According to the Forms I-213, Macke contacted ICE at approximately 8:30 a.m. and \"stated that he encountered nine individuals during a traffic stop who claimed to be citizens of; [sic] Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador and Ecuador.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245. Macke issued citations to the driver of the car at 8:57 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioners allege that Macke ordered them to drive the van to a nearby rest stop and, once there, positioned his own car so that Petitioners' van could not be moved. They claim that he ordered them to turn off the van and remain in it and that \"[h]e then began to interrogate [them] about [their] immigration status,\" again \"asking to see [their] work permit[s], passports, visas and social security card[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211. Between the time they reached the rest stop and the time ICE agents arrived, Petitioners allege that Macke would not allow them to leave the van to use the bathroom, would not allow them food or water, and would not let them turn the air-conditioning on in the van even though the weather was \"humid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 211-12. They state that they could not leave and that they felt as though they had to answer his questions. They also \"d[id] not know why [Macke] kept [them] there except for the fact that [they] all look Hispanic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 212.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to the Forms I-213, ICE agents arrived at approximately 9:30 a.m., between an hour and a half and two hours after the alleged time of the initial stop. The ICE agents conducted interviews of Petitioners and other passengers and fingerprinted them. The Government's evidence asserts that all \"freely stated that they were not citizens of the United States[,] had illegally entered the United States ... [, and] were not in possession of any immigration document that would allow them to remain the United States lawfully.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245. They were then handcuffed and transported to an immigration office, where they remained for approximately three hours, until they were moved to a local county prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served Petitioners with a Notice to Appear Form, alleging that they were subject to removal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i). Petitioners moved to suppress any evidence of their alienage obtained as a result of the stop, arguing that it had been discovered through a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Because the Government would not be able to meet its burden of proving alienage without this evidence, Petitioners also moved to terminate the removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the scheduled removal hearing was held, the IJ denied Petitioners' motion and declined their request for an evidentiary hearing. Citing\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821194\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/683/\">\n    653 F.3d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2011), the IJ concluded that the exclusionary rule does not apply to intersovereign situations where a violation was committed by a sovereign other than the one involved in the civil proceeding. The IJ also credited the Government's evidence and found that Petitioners' \"complaint against the ICE officers\n   lacks any corroborating evidence\" and only amounts to \"unsubstantiated allegations.\" Yoc-Us A. 135. The IJ discredited Petitioners' account that Macke stopped them because of their Hispanic appearance, finding that their claim was \"refuted by evidence which shows that their vehicle was stopped for excessive speed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821194\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, with regard to Macke's alleged misconduct, the IJ concluded that the Immigration Court \"lacks authority to provide any remedy for a separate sovereign's misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821194\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a subsequent decision, the IJ ordered Petitioners removed from the United States to Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A single-member panel of the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling in substantially identical opinions for each Petitioner.

The BIA \"discerned no clear error\" in the IJ's findings. Yoc-Us A. 3; Calel-Espantzay A. 2. It agreed with the IJ that Macke conducted a lawful stop and that Petitioners failed to show that Macke or the ICE agents engaged in egregious conduct. Because it found that Petitioners did not establish a prima facie case for suppression, the BIA concluded that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. Lastly, the BIA rejected Petitioners' claim that this type of violation was \"widespread,\" finding that they failed to present any supporting evidence.

Therefore, questioning about an individual's immigration status does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the initial seizure of the individual is lawful and the questioning does not prolong the seizure.

Although Macke was justified in initially stopping the van for speeding, the record supports Petitioners' allegations that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated when Macke unreasonably extended the stop to investigate their immigration status. The declarations submitted on their behalf allege that Macke stopped the van between 7:40 and 8:00 a.m. The Forms I-213 state that he contacted ICE around 8:30 a.m. The traffic citations were issued at 8:57 a.m., Petitioners were sent to the rest area, and ICE agents arrived about thirty minutes later. Because Macke contacted ICE before the citations were issued, at least some of the time between the initial stop and the issuance of the citations was spent interrogating the passengers in the back of the van. Moreover, Petitioners' and other passengers' thirty-three minute detention after the issuance of the citations-which\n   marked the end of \"the seizure's mission\"-and before ICE's arrival extended \"beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission of issuing a ticket for the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    135 S.

It reasoned that any additional deterrence provided by application of the rule in civil proceedings was marginal, and the extreme social costs of applying the rule in those settings-namely, \"the societal interest in law enforcement by its proscription of what concededly is relevant evidence\"-outweighed the deterrent effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178423\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/433/#p443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178423\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/433/#p443\">\n    at 448-49, 453-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178423\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/433/#p443\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, as noted by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   , this second cost would be magnified if different rules applied based on the nature of the authorizations that various state and local law enforcement may have to enforce immigration laws.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516358\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/782/#p789\">\n    885 F.3d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We also laid out the following non-exhaustive list of factors that may be considered in this inquiry: \"whether [the petitioner] can establish intentional violations of the Fourth Amendment\"; \"whether the seizure itself was so gross or unreasonable in addition to being without a plausible legal ground, (e.g., when the initial illegal stop is particularly lengthy, there is an unnecessary and menacing show or use of force, etc.)\"; \"whether improper seizures, illegal entry of homes, or arrests occurred under threats, coercion or physical abuse\"; \"the extent to which the agents reported to unreasonable shows of force\"; and \"whether any seizures or arrests were based on race or perceived ethnicity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522493\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522493\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/259/\">\n    at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We do not agree with the IJ and the BIA that Petitioners failed to allege a potentially egregious Fourth Amendment violation that would warrant an evidentiary hearing. First, as we determined above, Macke's extension of the stop was unreasonable and in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Second, Petitioners' allegations, if true, may show an egregious Fourth Amendment violation that would warrant application of the exclusionary rule because, as noted above, we specifically stated in\n   <em>\n    Oliva-Ramos\n   </em>\n   that \"whether any seizures or arrests were based on race or perceived ethnicity\" was a consideration in determining whether an egregious Fourth Amendment violation had occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522493\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Through their own declarations and the declarations of other passengers, Petitioners claim that Macke detained them and ordered them to travel to the rest area because they \"all look Hispanic.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Calel-Espantzay A. 212. Although the Government's Forms I-213 assert that Petitioners \"claimed to be\" citizens of other countries in their interactions with Macke,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 174, the declarations submitted by Petitioners simply state that they \"did not have anything to give him\" in response to his request for \"immigration papers, work permit, visa, passport, and ID,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 211 (internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, Macke's request, as alleged by Petitioners, supports their claim that Macke continued the stop because of the passengers' Hispanic appearance. His demand for this type of documentation, prior to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   interaction with the passengers in the rear of the van, shows an assumption on his part that the Petitioners and other passengers were not United States citizens, a conclusion he could have only come to based on their appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The facts alleged by Petitioners, if supported by evidence, could support the conclusion that the illegal extension of the stop was solely \"based on race or perceived ethnicity.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliva-Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522493\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/259/\">\n    694 F.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioners aver that they were refused water and food and were not allowed to use the bathroom or turn on the van's air conditioning while they were detained by Macke. Depending on the actual evidence adduced, these facts could be considered evidence of coercion or use of force as part of the totality of the circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because Petitioners have identified a possible egregious Fourth Amendment violation, we conclude that the IJ erred in not granting their motion for a hearing to provide them with an opportunity to put forth evidence in support of their claim.
