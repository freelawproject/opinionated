The Empire confiscated the real property left behind by the victims of the Armenian Genocide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Republic of Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, commingled proceeds from the sale and use of the confiscated property with its general treasury funds. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and T.C. Ziraat Bankasi (\"the Banks\"), received the commingled funds as deposits from the Turkish government and have refused to disgorge them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The California Statute of Limitations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2006, the California legislature determined that existing state law did \"not provide sufficient relief for Armenian Genocide victims whose assets were deposited with or held by financial institutions.\" S. Judiciary Comm., Bill Analysis, S.B. 1524, 2005-2006 Leg., Reg. Sess. at 2 (Cal. Apr. 26, 2006) [hereinafter \"2006 Committee Report\"]. It therefore passed a law to ensure that actions \"brought by an Armenian Genocide victim\" or her heirs, \"seeking payment for ... looted assets, shall not be dismissed for failure to comply with the applicable statute of limitation, if the action is filed on or before December 31, 2016.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20354.45\">\n    Cal.

Judiciary Comm., Bill Analysis, S.B. 1915, 1999-2000 Leg., Reg. Sess. at 5-6 (Cal. May 10, 2000) (discussing \"the revival of otherwise time-barred suits\" under \u00a7 354.4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal involves two actions filed in 2010. In the first, Alex Bakalian, Anais Haroutunian, and Rita Mahdessian allege the Ottoman Empire expropriated 122.5 acres of their ancestors' property during the Armenian Genocide. Their suit against the Banks asserts unlawful expropriation, unjust enrichment, and statutory interference with property rights, and seeks imposition of a constructive trust, an accounting of the looted assets, and declaratory relief. In the second case, Garbis Davoyan and Hrayr Turabian sue the Banks on behalf of themselves and a putative class of descendants\n   of Armenian property owners. They also seek imposition of a constructive trust and an accounting, and assert claims of breach of statutory trust, unjust enrichment, and \"human rights violations and violations of international law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The complaints assert two broad theories of recovery. They first argue that the Ottoman Empire wrongfully confiscated their ancestors' property, depositing the rents and proceeds in the Banks, and that a constructive trust should therefore be imposed over those assets. Alternatively, they allege that the Empire itself held the property \"in trust and for safekeeping on behalf of the rightful Armenian owners\" under Turkish \"Abandoned Property Laws,\" and that the Banks have breached that trust by not turning the proceeds over to the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Banks moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting immunity as instrumentalities of the Republic of Turkey under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In response, the plaintiffs urged that immunity should be denied under the expropriation and commercial activity exceptions to the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1605(a)(2)-(3). The Banks also moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court dismissed both complaints. It found the commercial activity exception inapplicable because the Banks' alleged conduct did not have a sufficiently direct effect in the United States. And, because the Armenian victims of the Genocide were subjects of the Ottoman Empire, the court concluded that the expropriation exception could apply only if the Empire had otherwise violated international law by committing genocide. But, the court held, determining whether the Ottoman Empire had committed genocide was a non-justiciable \"inherently political question.\" The court did not reach the statute of limitations issue, which had been fully briefed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs timely appealed, and we consolidated the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

We assume for purposes of our accrual analysis the truth of the plaintiffs' allegations that either the Ottoman Empire illegally seized the property of the plaintiffs' predecessors, or the Empire and the Banks placed the property in trust under Turkish law but later illegally refused to return it. If the initial expropriation was wrongful, the plaintiffs' claims accrued by 1923. If the property was placed in trust, the plaintiffs acknowledge that \"[l]aws passed in 1928 and 1929 formally ended Turkey's disingenuous attempt at the restitution of immovable property to its rightful Armenian owners.\" Thus, the plaintiffs' predecessors should have known well more than ten years ago that Turkey did not intend to return their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiffs do not allege that any critical facts about the expropriation have been discovered since 2000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oeth v.

This case is therefore distinguishable from actions seeking the return of particular items, like paintings, stolen in war and only discovered years later in museums.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Republic of Austria v.

But, even if we assume that the plaintiffs' claims were equitably tolled until 1976, the plaintiffs do not explain why they should be tolled a further twenty-four years.

But, we are nearly a decade past the outset of these cases, and the Supreme Court has also stressed that \"foreign sovereign immunity's basic objective\" is \"to free a foreign sovereign from\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1312/#p1317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That objective is ill-served by continuing a difficult exploration-in the context of a clearly time-barred action-about whether there is a \"genocidal takings\" exception in\n   the FSIA and, if so, whether the plaintiffs' claims qualify under that exception. In particular, answering that question would require us to decide whether to consider the state of international law at the time of the taking or at some later point, and whether at the relevant point in time either genocide or a genocidal taking was a recognized violation of international law. Nor would analyzing the district court's conclusion-that the \"political question\" doctrine prevents us from addressing FSIA jurisdiction in light of Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide-free the foreign sovereigns from suit as early as possible. The political question analysis also turns on a complex issue of first impression: whether the FSIA necessarily authorizes the judiciary to decide in the first instance whether a genocide has occurred even if a foreign state denies that it has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Article III grants the federal courts general subject matter jurisdiction over claims like those presented by the plaintiffs, which indisputably \"arise under\" federal law.\n   <em>\n    Verlinden B.V. v.
