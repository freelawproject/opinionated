We hold that such a suit may not be brought against him, and we affirm the district court's grant of immunity and its order dismissing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts underlying this case occurred in the broader context of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Part and parcel of the conflict has been the ongoing struggle for the eastern Mediterranean tract of land known as the Gaza Strip (\"Gaza\"). In 1967, following an armed conflict known as the Six-Day War, Israeli Defense Forces (\"IDF\") took control of Gaza. Eventually, Israel entered into several peace accords with the Palestinian Authority, relinquishing control of Gaza but retaining full control over the territorial waters adjoining it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after Israel's withdrawal, Hamas-a group designated by the United States Government as a terrorist organization-came to power in Gaza. With the Palestinian Authority no longer in control, Israeli-Palestinian relations worsened. Israel began experiencing increased attacks by militant groups in Gaza. As a result, Israel imposed a full naval blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2009 to contain the flow of weapons into the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 31, 2010, a group of six vessels, calling themselves the \"Gaza Freedom Flotilla,\" sailed from Turkey toward the Israeli naval blockade. The group's purported objective was to \"draw international public attention to the situation in the Gaza Strip and the effect of the blockade, and to deliver humanitarian assistance and supplies to Gaza.\" The son of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, Furkan Dogan (\"Furkan\"), was aboard one of the vessels in the flotilla: the\n   <em>\n    Mavi Marmara\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When the flotilla was still about sixty miles from the blockade, the Israeli navy transmitted several radio messages to the vessels. The messages informed the flotilla that it was entering a restricted area, that humanitarian assistance could be supplied to Gaza by land, and that all legal measures would be taken to prevent the vessels from breaching the naval blockade. In response, the\n   <em>\n    Mavi Marmara\n   </em>\n   transmitted a message indicating its intent to sail through the blockade and its belief that Israel could not legally prevent it from doing so. Consequently, IDF decided to board the vessels to prevent them from breaching the blockade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From a helicopter, IDF soldiers fast-roped down onto the\n   <em>\n    Mavi Marmara\n   </em>\n   . According to several reports of the incident, the first IDF soldiers to board were met with armed resistance. Occupants of the vessel reportedly attacked the soldiers with makeshift weapons, including clubs, knives, axes, and metal poles. Some reports suggest that certain occupants possessed, and may have used, firearms. When a second group of soldiers boarded the ship, they were authorized to use deadly force against the passengers. Nine passengers of the\n   <em>\n    Mavi Marmara\n   </em>\n   were killed during the scuffle, one of whom was Furkan. According to the Dogans' complaint, Furkan was filming the operation from the\n   vessel's top-deck when he was shot and killed by the IDF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant-Appellee, Ehud Barak (\"Barak\"), was the Israeli Defense Minister at the time of the\n   <em>\n    Mavi Marmara\n   </em>\n   incident. He allegedly planned the operation to intercept the flotilla, directed the operation himself, and personally authorized the IDF to board and take over the vessel. Whether Barak also authorized the use of lethal force is unclear from the record. At any rate, because Barak commanded the forces that took Furkan's life, the Dogans allege that he is responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relations between Turkey and Israel became tense in the wake of the incident, but international responses varied. Some nations issued statements condemning Israel's actions. The United States' response was more equivocal. Whereas both branches of Congress passed resolutions supporting Israel's actions, the President's public statement simply expressed \"regret\" for the loss of life. President Obama eventually helped persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and in June 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden reportedly helped broker the deal which formally resolved the Turkey-Israel disagreement. Israel agreed to pay $20 million to a compensation fund for Turkish families, and Turkey agreed to end all criminal and civil claims against Israel and its military personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 15, 2015, the Dogans filed this lawsuit in federal court. They asserted eight causes of action, each of which falls under one of three federal statutes: (1) the Alien Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"ATCA\"); (2) the Torture Victim Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%2073\">\n    106 Stat. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , note following\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"TVPA\"); and (3) the Anti-Terrorism Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"ATA\"). The complaint alleges that Furkan's killing constitutes \"torture,\" \"terrorism,\" and/or an \"extrajudicial killing\" under the relevant federal statutes and international law, and that Barak is personally responsible because of his commanding authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In December 2015, Israel asked the U.S. Department of State to file a Suggestion of Immunity (\"SOI\") on behalf of Barak. On January 20, 2016, Barak moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) based on common law foreign official immunity, the political question doctrine, and the act of state doctrine. The parties fully briefed the motion. After briefing was complete, the United States filed with the district court a Suggestion of Immunity, which concluded that Barak's actions were official government acts that \"were authorized by Israel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   parties filed supplemental briefing on the effect of the SOI. Thereafter, the district court granted Barak's motion to dismiss on the ground that Barak is entitled to foreign official immunity, declining to reach Barak's arguments as to the political question and act of state doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court held that the foreign official immunity doctrine bars this lawsuit for two reasons. First, the district court stated that federal courts generally have deferred to executive branch determinations of foreign official immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samantar v. Yousuf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641789,12449206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/305/\">\n    560 U.S. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641789,12449206\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/305/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641789,12449206\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/305/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Here, the district court found that the State Department's SOI warranted such deference. Second, even without the executive branch determination, the district court held that its own analysis would have led it to the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moreover, the court held that no exception to foreign official immunity applies here. First, the Dogans argued that foreign officials are not immune from liability for violations of\n   <em>\n    jus cogens\n   </em>\n   norms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noting that the question whether such an exception exists has not yet been decided by the Ninth Circuit, the district court adopted the Second Circuit's position that there is no\n   <em>\n    jus cogens\n   </em>\n   exception to foreign official immunity and rejected the argument on that basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matar v. Dichter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237893\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/9/#p15\">\n    563 F.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (2d Cir. 2009). Second, the Dogans argued that the TVPA abrogates common law foreign official immunity by providing liability for \"torture\" and for \"extrajudicial killing[s]\" perpetrated by \"[a]n individual ... [acting] under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation.\" The court rejected this argument as well, holding that Congress did not intend for the TVPA to abrogate foreign official immunity \"where the sovereign state officially acknowledges and embraces the official's acts,\" as Israel has here. Finding that foreign official immunity (and no exception) applies, the district court granted Barak's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Mills v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072606\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/400/#p404\">\n    742 F.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (9th Cir. 2014). Evidentiary rulings, such as the district court's decision to consider extrinsic evidence, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Wagner v. Cty. of Maricopa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180674\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1048/#p1052\">\n    747 F.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1052 (9th Cir. 2013).

But we need not decide the level of deference owed to the State Department's suggestion of immunity in this case, because even if the suggestion of immunity is afforded \"substantial weight\" (as opposed to absolute deference), based on the record before us we conclude that Barak would still be entitled to immunity. Common-law foreign sovereign immunity extends to individual foreign officials for \"acts performed in\n   [their] official capacity if the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law against the state[.]\" Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 66(f) (1965). According to the Complaint, Barak was \"instructed by the Prime Minister to conduct\" the operations. The Complaint further alleged that Barak's \"power ... to plan, order, and control the IDF operation and troops as Minister of Defense is set out in Israel's Basic Law[.]\" The Complaint's claims for relief state-several times-that Barak's actions were done under \"actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the Government of the State of Israel.\" And if the State Department's SOI is not entitled to absolute deference, we would nonetheless give it considerable weight. We conclude that exercising jurisdiction over Barak in this case would be to enforce a rule of law against the sovereign state of Israel, and that Barak would therefore be entitled to common-law foreign sovereign immunity even under the Dogans' preferred standard (i.e., conducting an independent judicial determination of entitlement to immunity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, the Dogans argue that even if Barak is entitled to common law immunity, Congress has abrogated common law foreign official immunity via the TVPA.

Even with this all-encompassing language (\"[e]very person\"), the Supreme Court has held that, in passing \u00a7 1983, Congress did not \"abolish wholesale all common-law immunities.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierson v.

Indeed, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Pierson\n   </em>\n   held that, even though the word \"person\" includes legislators and judges, for example, \u00a7 1983 did not abrogate common law legislative or judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    at 554-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178394\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/547/#p554\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows that, to the extent this court relies on \u00a7 1983 jurisprudence in analyzing the TVPA, the statute's use of the overinclusive term \"individual\" does not abrogate the immunity given to foreign officials at common law simply because foreign officials fit within the category \"individual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Given that (1) the TVPA is silent as to whether any common law immunities are abrogated and (2) the term \"individual\" does not imply abrogation of common law immunities for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   individuals, we \"assum[e] that common-law principles of ... immunity were incorporated\" into the TVPA.\n   <em>\n    Filarsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189305\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/377/#p389\">\n    566 U.S. at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189305\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/377/#p389\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other considerations counsel against construing the TVPA to abrogate common law foreign official immunity. As the district court observed, \"[i]f immunity did not extend to officials whose governments acknowledge that their acts were officially authorized, it would open a Pandora's box of liability for foreign military officials.\" Indeed, \"any military operation that results in injury or death could be characterized at the pleading stage as torture or an extrajudicial killing.\" And the TVPA allows suits not only by U.S. citizens but by \"any person.\" Because the whole point of immunity is to enjoy \"an immunity from\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   rather than a mere defense to\n   <em>\n    liability\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Dogans' reading of the TVPA would effectively extinguish the common law doctrine of foreign official immunity.\n   <em>\n    Compania Mexicana de Aviacion, S.A. v. U.S. Dist. Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537538\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/859/1354/#p1358\">\n    859 F.2d 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1358 (9th Cir. 1988) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Under the Dogans' reading, the TVPA would allow foreign officials to be haled into U.S. courts by \"any person\" with a family member who had been killed abroad in the course of a military operation conducted by a foreign power. The Judiciary, as a result, would be faced with resolving any number of sensitive foreign policy questions which might arise in the context of such lawsuits. It simply cannot be that Congress intended the TVPA to open the door to that sort of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor does Barak's reading of the TVPA render the statute a nullity, as the Dogans contend. The parties agree that Congress expected foreign states would generally disavow conduct that violates the TVPA because no state officially condones such actions. Thus, in the great majority of cases, an official sued under the TVPA would never receive common-law immunity in the first place, thereby making abrogation unnecessary. Barak points to two examples of this, which adequately prove the point. First, in\n   <em>\n    Hilao v. Marcos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516629\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1467/\">\n    25 F.3d 1467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1994), plaintiffs brought claims against the estate of former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, based on allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings. The Filipino government expressly\n   denied that Marcos's conduct had been performed in an official capacity and urged that the lawsuits be allowed to proceed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516629\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1467/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516629\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1467/\">\n    at 1472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Filartiga v. Pena-Irala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"392565\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/630/876/\">\n    630 F.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1980), plaintiffs brought an action against a former Paraguayan police official based on allegations that he was responsible for the death of their son. In discussing the act of state doctrine, the Second Circuit noted that the defendant's conduct had been \"wholly unratified by [the Paraguayan] government.\" In cases like\n   <em>\n    Hilao\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Filartiga\n   </em>\n   , the TVPA would operate to impose liability on foreign officials who engaged in torture or extrajudicial killings. Thus, our holding today does not render the TVPA a nullity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the TVPA does not abrogate foreign official immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Dogans next urge this court to hold that foreign officials are not immune from suit for violations of\n   <em>\n    jus cogens\n   </em>\n   norms.

The cases relied upon by the Dogans for this proposition involve Ferdinand Marcos, a Filipino dictator whose actions were repeatedly disavowed by his own government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marcos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516629\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1467/\">\n     25 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1472 ;\n    <em>\n     In re Estate of Ferdinand E.

In those cases, Marcos was not entitled to immunity because the Philippines did not ratify his conduct, and thus the court did not have occasion to consider whether to create an\n    <em>\n     exception\n    </em>\n    to foreign official immunity for\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations. No exception was necessary because Marcos never received immunity in the first place.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
