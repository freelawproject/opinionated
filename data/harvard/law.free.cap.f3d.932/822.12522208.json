By requiring the transmission of the plebiscite results, the 2000 Plebiscite Law mandates that the Commission on Decolonization take a public stance in support of the result. 3 Guam Ann. Code \u00a7 21000 (\"It is the purpose of this legislation to seek the desires to those peoples who were given citizenship in 1950 and to use this knowledge to further petition Congress and other entities to achieve the stated goals.\").

Elections regularly require a governmental body to take a stance on issues even though there may be no on-the-ground changes in policy.

The Registry Act established an official list of \"Chamorro\" people, defined according to the Organic Act, as inhabitants of Guam in 1899 who were Spanish subjects or were born in Guam before 1899, and the descendants of those individuals. Registry Act \u00a7 20001(a). In its legislative findings and statement of intent, the Registry Act provided: \"The Guam Legislature recognizes that the indigenous people of Guam, the Chamorros, have endured as a population with a distinct language and culture despite suffering over three hundred years of colonial occupation by Spain, the United States of America, and Japan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1. It further stated: \"The Guam Legislature ... endeavors to memorialize the indigenous Chamorro people ... who continue to develop as one Chamorro people on their homeland, Guam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the Registry Act recognized that \"[t]he Legislature intends for this registry to assist in the process of heightening local awareness among the people of Guam of the current struggle for Commonwealth, of the identity of the indigenous Chamorro people of Guam, and of the role that Chamorros and succeeding generations play in the island's cultural survival and in Guam's political evolution towards self-government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Like the Registry Act, the 1997 Plebiscite Law repeatedly employed the term \"Chamorro\" to note a distinct group and described that group as facing \"colonial discrimination\" and \"long-standing injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Additionally, the Guam legislature has long defined the term \"Native Chamorro\" for purposes of the Chamorro Land Trust Commission to include \"any person who became a U.S. citizen by virtue of the authority and enactment of the Organic Act of Guam or descendants of such person.\" Guam Pub.

The CLTC qualifies Native Chamorros to lease land the United States previously seized from Guam's inhabitants during and after World War II and later returned to the Guam government. After passage of the 2000 Plebiscite Law, the Guam legislature enacted a law providing that individuals who receive a lease or were preapproved for one through the CLTC are automatically registered in the Guam Decolonization Registry, thereby qualifying them to vote in the plebiscite.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Guam%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2021002.1\">\n    3 Guam Code Ann. \u00a7 21002.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Several similarities between the 2000 Plebiscite Law and its predecessors reveal that \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" is a proxy for \"Chamorro,\" and therefore for a racial classification. First, the 2000 Plebiscite Law's definition of \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" is nearly indistinguishable from the definitions of \"Chamorro\" in the Registry Act, the 1997 Plebiscite Law, and the CLTC. \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" incorporates all the citizenship provisions of the Organic Act, as does the definition of \"Native Chamorro\" in the CLTC; the Registry Act and the 1997 Plebiscite Law mirror the first two sections of those provisions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7 21001(e) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Guam%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2075101\">\n    21 Guam Code Ann. \u00a7 75101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; Registry Act \u00a7 20001(a); 1997 Plebiscite Law \u00a7 2(b),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1952).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Guam applies nearly identical definitions to the terms \"Chamorro,\" a racial category, and \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" indicates that these terms are interchangeable. The closeness of the association is sufficient to conclude that the term\n   \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" is a proxy for the \"Chamorro\" classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Second, the 2000 Plebiscite Law maintains nearly identically the features of the facially race-based Registry Act and the 1997 Plebiscite Law. This continuity confirms the 2000 Plebiscite Law's changes to the Chamorro classification were semantic and cosmetic, not substantive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The 2000 Plebiscite Law creates a \"Guam Decolonization Registry\" that mirrors the earlier Registry Act. The new registry is structured similarly to the earlier one, including requiring an affidavit to register,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7 21002,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Registry Act \u00a7 20002; administering the registry through the Guam Election Commission,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7 21001(d),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Registry Act \u00a7 20001(c); and criminalizing false registration,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7 21009,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Registry Act \u00a7 20009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The 2000 Plebiscite Law also amends the 1997 Plebiscite Law to eliminate references to \"Chamorro\" people, but otherwise retains the same features.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9-11. Both statutes establish non-binding elections on Guam's future political status relationship with the United States, the results of which will be transmitted to the federal government and to the United Nations.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   2000 Plebiscite Law \u00a7\u00a7 10-11,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   1997 Plebiscite Law \u00a7\u00a7 5, 10. Given the similarity in the substantive provisions and in the definitions of \"Chamorro\" and of \"Native Inhabitants of Guam,\" the substitution of terms does not erase the 1997 Plebiscite Law's premise for the voting restriction-to treat the Chamorro as a \"distinct people.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476501\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/495/\">\n    528 U.S. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476501\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/495/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the timing of the 2000 Plebiscite Law's enactment confirms its racial basis. The 2000 Plebiscite Law was enacted on March 24, 2000, just one month after\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   was decided. In\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   , Hawaii had revised its definition of \"Hawaiian\" from an earlier version, by replacing the word \"races\" with \"peoples.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 515-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476501\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/495/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court concluded based on the drafters' own admission that \"any changes to the language were at most cosmetic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 516,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476501\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/495/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we have no similar admission, the same is true here. After\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   , Guam's swift reenactment of essentially the same election law-albeit with a change in terms-indicates that the Guam legislature's intent was to apply cosmetic changes rather than substantively to alter the voting restrictions for the plebiscite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Guam's primary argument to the contrary is that \"Native Inhabitants of Guam\" is not a racial category but a\n   <em>\n    political\n   </em>\n   one referring to \"a colonized people with a unique political relationship to the United States because their U.S. citizenship was granted by the Guam Organic Act.\" It attempts to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the voter qualification here is tethered not to presence in the Territory at a particular date but to the passage of a specific law-the Organic Act-which altered the legal status of the group to which the ancestral inquiry is linked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   But indirect or tiered racial classifications, tethered to prior, race-based legislative enactments, are subject to the same Fifteenth Amendment proscription on race-based voting restrictions as are explicitly racial classifications. In\n   <em>\n    Guinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma constitutional amendment that established a literacy requirement for voting eligibility but exempted the \"lineal descendant[s]\" of persons who were \"on January 1, 1866, or at any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of government, or who at that time resided in some foreign nation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676703\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/238/347/#p364\">\n    238 U.S. at 356-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676703\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/238/347/#p364\">\n    35 S.Ct. 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That classification, like the one at issue here, was facially tethered to specific laws-the voter eligibility laws in existence in 1866 before the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified. In that year, only eight northern states permitted African Americans to vote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Benno C.

In essence, the Court recognized that Oklahoma was reviving its earlier race-based voting restrictions, thereby violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Nor is Guam's argument that the classification here is political supported by the Supreme Court's recognition that classifications based on American Indian ancestry are political in nature.
