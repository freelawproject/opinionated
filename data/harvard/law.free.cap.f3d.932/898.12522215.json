App. June 24, 2005). In 2004, he was adjudicated a Sexually Violent Predator (\"SVP\") under the SVPA and civilly committed for two years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2006, the state filed a petition to recommit Page as an SVP. The state supported its petition with two psychiatric evaluations diagnosing Page with Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified (\"NOS\") based on his affinity for nonconsensual sex and concluding that he qualified as an SVP. In May 2006, the state court found probable cause to detain Page pretrial. Page has been detained awaiting trial ever since. The state court minute orders and the July 21, 2015 declaration of David C. Cook, an SVPA prosecutor, set forth the relevant timeline. (Page argues that we should disregard the declaration because Cook cannot act as both witness and attorney in the same case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct 3.7 (2018). This argument fails because Cook does not represent the state in this federal case.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 16, 2006, a public defender was appointed to represent Page. The case was continued until December 15, 2006 to permit the parties to prepare for trial. On December 15, the state filed a motion based on a recent amendment to the SVPA. The court granted the motion and continued the case to March 2, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case was repeatedly delayed over the next two years. Defense counsel requested one continuance, but no explanation for the other continuances appears in the record. The case then was continued throughout 2009 to permit the parties to litigate defense motions, including Page's motion for substitute counsel. On March 12, 2010, Cook \"informed the court and Page's counsel that [the state] was ready for the case to be set for trial.\" The case nonetheless was continued to May 2012 so that two additional defense motions could be briefed and decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One of the defense motions sought a new probable cause hearing, new mental health evaluations, and new mental health evaluators. In a supporting declaration, Dr. Allen Francis opined that \"Paraphilia NOS, nonconsent\" is an \"incompetent\" and \"psychiatrically unjustified\" diagnosis upon which the psychiatric community had recently cast doubt, most notably by rejecting proposals to include it in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or \"DSM-V.\" The court granted the motion for new evaluations and a new probable cause hearing, and continued the case to November 2012 to allow the new evaluations to take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Four mental health professionals were retained to perform the new evaluations. The first two evaluators disagreed as to whether Page met SVP criteria, necessitating two additional evaluators, who also\n   disagreed. In the end, two evaluators, including one that had recommended recommitment in 2006, concluded that Page no longer met SVP criteria. They based their determinations in part on Page's lengthy pretrial detention, reasoning that he had aged and had not committed any further sexual or violent acts. The two other evaluators came to the opposite conclusion, finding that Page continued to meet SVP criteria. One of those evaluators diagnosed Page with Paraphilia NOS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The case was continued from November 2012 to May 2013 so that defense motions related to the new evaluations could be filed, briefed, and decided. On July 26, 2013, the state requested a continuance to file a motion based on\n   <em>\n    Reilly v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237383\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/57/641/\">\n    57 Cal.4th 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20410\">\n    160 Cal.Rptr.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20P.3d%201071\">\n    304 P.3d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), which called into question Page's entitlement to a new probable cause hearing. Defense counsel then sought several continuances to respond to the state's\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   motion. The court granted the\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   motion on April 18, 2014 and rescinded its prior order calling for a new probable cause determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The case was repeatedly continued until June 2, 2017 to allow defense counsel to litigate additional motions. The minute orders from July 28, 2017 through November 3, 2017 reference a \"motion\" but provide no further detail. The case was continued on January 5, 2018 \"[b]y agreement of counsel\" and again on May 4, 2018 for unknown reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cook averred in his declaration that he \"remain[s] ready to set this matter for trial\" and that, to his knowledge, \"neither Page nor his trial counsel has ever requested that Page's case be set for trial.\" Cook further averred that he requested only one continuance after calling ready for trial on March 12, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Page's Federal Habeas Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Page filed the present federal habeas petition in the Northern District of California on July 16, 2012. He alleged that his due process rights were violated by the state court when it based its pretrial detention probable cause finding on pseudoscience; by the prosecution when it introduced pseudoscientific evidence at the probable cause hearing; and by the state when it continued to detain him based on the 2006 probable cause finding even though the 2012 evaluations suggested that the 2006 evaluations had become outdated.

We consider those grounds in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether Page's State SVPA Proceedings Are Ongoing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Page first contends that his SVPA case has been stalled for so long that it is no longer \"ongoing\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   . This contention cannot be reconciled with our precedents, which establish that \"[t]here is no principled distinction between finality of judgments for purposes of appellate review and finality of state-initiated proceedings for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention.\"\n   <em>\n    San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce Political Action Committee v.

Where, as here, \"no final judgment has been entered\" in state court, the state court proceeding is \"plainly ongoing\" for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . While recognizing the possibility that a state court could intentionally delay proceedings to stave off federal habeas review or for other improper purposes, we have determined that\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   's exceptions for bad faith, harassment, or other extraordinary circumstances provide sufficient protection from such state court abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We therefore turn to the question whether Page can establish one of those exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether Extraordinary Circumstances Make\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    Abstention Inappropriate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal courts will not abstain under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   in \"extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Ahern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757424\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/899/#p903\">\n    676 F.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (9th Cir. 2012). Page argues that this exception applies here, either because of the state court's extraordinary delay in bringing him to trial or because he will be irreparably harmed if he is unable to seek federal review prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The delay in bringing Page's SVPA case to trial is not an extraordinary circumstance under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   . True, we have in rare cases declined to abstain where the state court delay was extreme and there was \"no end in sight\" to the state court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336323\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/1030/#p1035\">\n    56 F.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1035, 1038 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"We have consistently recognized that unusual delay in the state courts may justify a decision to protect a prisoner's right to a fair and prompt resolution of his constitutional claims despite the jurisprudential concerns that have led us to decline to review a claim or to require full exhaustion in other cases in which a proceeding related to the federal petition is pending in state court.\"). But\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention is appropriate even in cases of extreme delay where there is \"no indication that the state court has been ineffective,\"\n   <em>\n    Edelbacher v. Calderon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11674164\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/582/#p586\">\n    160 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (9th Cir. 1998), and where the delay is instead \"attributable to the petitioner's quite legitimate\n   efforts in state court to escape guilt\" through litigation,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 585.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As the Cook declaration and the state court record show, the delay in bringing Page's SVPA case to trial is primarily attributable to defense counsel's litigation efforts, not the state court's ineffectiveness. Additionally, an end to the state court proceedings is in sight. The state informed the court that it was ready for trial nine years ago and has remained ready at least as of 2015. Thus, it appears that Page could go to trial if he only demanded it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Page's reliance on speedy trial cases like\n   <em>\n    Doggett v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    505 U.S. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p652\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), which describes an eight-and-a-half-year delay as \"extraordinary,\" is misplaced. Page does not explain how or why speedy trial principles apply to the very different question of what constitutes extraordinary circumstances under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, we have repeatedly rejected the argument that \"violation of the Speedy Trial Clause [is]\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   such that it suffice[s] in and of itself as an independent 'extraordinary circumstance' necessitating pre-trial habeas consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757424\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/899/#p903\">\n    676 F.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carden v Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651472\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/82/#p84\">\n    626 F.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (9th Cir. 1980) ). Thus, even if Page could establish that the delay in bringing him to trial would support a speedy trial defense if the state court proceedings were criminal in nature, it does not follow that the delay is an extraordinary circumstance in the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Page argues in the alternative that abstention is inappropriate for the reasons given in\n   <em>\n    Arevalo v.

If Page is right, then regardless of the outcome at trial, a post-trial adjudication of his claim will not fully vindicate his right to a current and proper pretrial probable cause determination. His claim therefore \"fits squarely within the irreparable harm exception\" to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   that we applied in\n   <em>\n    Arevalo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 766.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    Arevalo\n   </em>\n   , Page's claim is closely analogous to the claim in\n   <em>\n    Gerstein\n   </em>\n   : The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Gerstein\n   </em>\n   challenged the state's refusal to hold a probable cause hearing, while Page challenges the state's alleged failure to hold a\n   <em>\n    constitutionally adequate\n   </em>\n   probable cause hearing. Page's claim likewise is not \"directed at the state prosecution[ ] as such, but only at the legality of pretrial detention without a [constitutionally-adequate] judicial hearing, an issue that could not be raised in defense of the criminal prosecution,\" and thus our review \"could not prejudice the conduct of the trial on the merits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/\">\n    420 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   108 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Page's claim therefore satisfies both of the grounds set forth in\n   <em>\n    Arevalo\n   </em>\n   for overcoming\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The state argues that\n   <em>\n    Arevalo\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because Page failed to show that he was unable to raise his due process claim in the state court proceedings. We considered and rejected the same argument in\n   <em>\n    Arevalo\n   </em>\n   , and are bound to follow suit here.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516004\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/763/#p765\">\n    882 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   767 n.3 (noting that the opportunity to present a claim in state court \"involve[s] the third\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   factor-adequacy of the state proceedings to address the issue,\" and does not categorically bar the \"irreparable harm\" exception).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nor is our treatment of Page's claim inconsistent with our speedy trial jurisprudence. True, we have declined to apply the irreparable harm exception to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention where a federal habeas petitioner seeks to vindicate a speedy trial affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651472\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/82/#p84\">\n    626 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   84 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757424\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/899/#p903\">\n    676 F.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reaffirming\n   <em>\n    Carden\n   </em>\n   ).
