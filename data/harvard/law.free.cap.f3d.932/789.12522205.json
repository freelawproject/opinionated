Ariz. Mar. 16, 2016) (order) (unpublished decision). Dixon was charged with assault with a deadly weapon in Maricopa County Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court appointed two psychiatrists, Drs. Bendheim and Tuchler, to evaluate Dixon, as then required by Rule 11 of the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Both doctors determined that Dixon was not competent to stand trial, noting his depression and difficulty communicating. Both doctors opined that Dixon suffered from \"undifferentiated schizophrenia.\" Dr. Bendheim opined that Dixon would be competent to stand trial within \"two to six months.\" Dr. Tuchler recommended treatment in a state hospital, and opined that Dixon \"may become competent to stand trial.\" Thereafter, the Superior Court determined that Dixon was not competent to stand trial and committed him to the Arizona State Hospital for competency restoration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately six weeks later, a third psychiatrist, Dr. Marchildon, reported that Dixon was competent to stand trial, reasoning that Dixon's \"mental condition substantially differ[ed]\" from the condition described by Drs. Bendheim and Tuchler. Dr. Marchildon noted that Dixon's affect was appropriate, his insight and judgment were satisfactory, and he \"displayed no behavior or ideation which would indicate mental illness.\" Dr. Marchildon further determined that Dixon understood the charges against him and the legal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dixon thereafter appeared before the Superior Court, waived his right to a jury trial, and agreed the case should be determined on the submitted records. The court found Dixon not guilty of the assault by reason of insanity and ordered Dixon released pending civil proceedings on January 5, 1978.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, Deana Bowdoin was found dead in her apartment, strangled with a belt and stabbed several times. Investigators found semen in Deana's vagina and on her underwear, but were unable at that time to match the DNA profile to a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 1985, Dixon assaulted a Northern Arizona University student in Flagstaff, Arizona.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Dixon was convicted of aggravated assault, kidnapping, sexual abuse, and four counts of sexual assault and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496616\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/151/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The victim initially reported the incident to the University Police Department.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496616\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/151/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The University officers assisted in the investigation and transmitted an \"attempt to locate\" call after the victim provided a description of the assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2001, a police detective compared DNA recovered in the investigation of Bowdoin's 1978 murder against a national database. The profile matched Dixon, then an Arizona state inmate whose DNA had been collected in the 1985 sexual assault investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2002, a grand jury indicted Dixon on the charge of first-degree premeditated murder, or, in the alternative, first-degree rape and felony murder, for Bowdoin's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty if Dixon were convicted of first-degree murder. Following the State's notice of intent, public defenders Liles and Simpson were appointed to represent Dixon. For all capital defendants, Arizona law provided automatic prescreening evaluation for competency, sanity, and intellectual disability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2013-753\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 13-753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 754. Dixon's counsel objected to the prescreening evaluation, which was never performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In July 2003, defense counsel informed the trial court it might take longer than usual to compile mitigation evidence because Dixon had spent his early life on the Navajo Reservation. Defense counsel estimated that the mitigation specialist would need a year to conduct a complete investigation. The court initially set the trial date for June 15, 2004. Defense counsel later filed a Notice of Possible Insanity Defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In April 2004, defense counsel estimated the mitigation investigation could be completed in five months if the case were assigned to a new specialist. The court granted the defense motion for a continuance on these grounds and vacated the June 2004 trial date. After a new mitigation specialist was assigned to the case, the court extended the deadline for disclosure of mitigation evidence to January 2005. In April 2005, defense counsel informed the court and the State that Dixon would not be pursuing an insanity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2005, Dixon filed a motion for change of counsel, explaining that his counsel had informed Dixon that they could not file a motion he requested, despite previously agreeing to file the motion in exchange for his cooperation in the preparation of his defense. Dixon believed that the DNA evidence linking Dixon to the murder should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree because it was obtained in connection with his 1985 assault conviction. The 1985 conviction itself was invalid, Dixon believed, because the campus police lacked the authority to investigate. Defense counsel informed Dixon that they could not file the motion on Dixon's behalf because Dixon's theory was not viable. The court held a hearing, at which Dixon acknowledged that a different attorney may likewise refuse to file the motion, at which point he would proceed pro se. The court then denied the motion to substitute counsel, but advised Dixon that he could request to proceed pro se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In February 2006, Dixon moved to waive his right to counsel and to represent himself. The court granted Dixon's request after engaging in a colloquy with Dixon regarding whether his request to represent himself was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The court questioned Dixon's competency. Dixon informed the court that, although he previously underwent Rule 11 competency proceedings in 1977, he was not aware of any current mental health issues that would prevent him from proceeding to trial. The court also asked Simpson, Dixon's counsel at the time, if he knew of any mental health issues \"that would make this court's decision as to whether to grant the waiver of right to counsel in jeopardy,\" but Simpson denied knowledge of any reason why Dixon should not be allowed to waive counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before deciding the motion, the court confirmed that Dixon wished to represent himself and give up his right to counsel, that Dixon understood trial counsel could \"be of great benefit\" to him, that Dixon had the right to an attorney and that the court could appoint an attorney if he could not afford one, that Dixon understood the charges against him, and that Dixon understood that the potential penalties for the crime included death or life imprisonment. The court determined that Dixon \"knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\n   waived\" his right to be represented by an attorney, but appointed Simpson as advisory counsel. The court thereafter granted Dixon's request for a paralegal and a mitigation specialist. Simpson served as advisory counsel until the court appointed Kenneth Countryman and Nathanial Carr III, who served as advisory counsel through Dixon's trial and sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dixon subsequently filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence linking him to the murder based on his theory that the campus officers lacked authority to investigate. The court denied the motion. Dixon filed a motion for change of judge based on the denial of the motion to suppress, which the court also denied. Dixon continued to pursue his theory in a special action, eventually seeking review, unsuccessfully, in the Arizona Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When Dixon was granted permission to represent himself in March 2006, the court set the trial for October 18, 2006. In September 2006, Dixon informed the court his mitigation evidence would not be ready for another nine months to a year, and the court continued the trial to June 25, 2007, \"a date certain.\" In May 2007, Dixon informed the court his mitigation evidence would not be ready for the June trial date and requested a continuance. The trial was rescheduled for August 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In late August 2007, Dixon moved for a continuance until the last week of January 2008. In support, Dixon raised the turnover among prior mitigation specialists, the loss of a number of documents compiled by the prior specialists, difficulties communicating with the current specialist and experts due to his incarceration, and overall delays due to his incarceration. The court set the trial date for September 13, 2007, but subsequently reset the trial for November 13, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 8, 2007, Dixon moved for a three-month continuance, until March 2008. Dixon attached a letter from the current mitigation specialist, Tyrone Mayberry, in which Mayberry informed Dixon that the mitigation investigation was not yet complete and that Dixon could not proceed to trial with the mitigation incomplete. Dixon also attached a letter addressed to his advisory counsel from the office of Dr. Gaughan, a psychologist. In the letter, Dr. Gaughan indicated that he had been unable to reach Dixon's mitigation investigator or advisory counsel and expressed concern about the lack of communication given the seriousness of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court denied Dixon's motion, reasoning that the case was five years old and that the defense mitigation work had been \"on going for well over four years.\" Throughout trial, Dixon maintained a \"standing objection\" that he was not prepared to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the time of Dixon's trial, Maricopa County required in-custody defendants to wear leg brace and stun belt restraints while in court. Before trial, Dixon filed a motion to forgo use of the leg brace to enable him to move freely about the courtroom. The court denied Dixon's motion based on the jail policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court warned Dixon of the possibility that the jury might infer the presence of the restraints, which \"could be prejudicial,\" and suggested that Dixon either remain seated in the presence of the jury or position himself at the podium before the jury entered the courtroom. Dixon again proposed that he wear the stun belt only, and not the leg brace, but the trial court rejected that option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At a conference with the court, Dixon acknowledged the risk that the jury might draw an inference from his movement that he might be wearing restraints, and the trial court determined that Dixon's decision\n   to use the podium to examine witnesses was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. However, over the course of the trial, the court noted to Dixon several times that the outline of the stun belt was visible to the court. The judge instructed Dixon that he should try not to turn his back to the jury or bend over so as to minimize the visibility of the restraints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judge also warned Dixon twice that the leg brace would cause him to walk in a stilted manner. Dixon expressed concern that if the officers failed to apply the brace to the same leg each day, the jury would \"be confused ... [if the jury were to] see I'm limping on my left side, and one day they see me limping on my right side.\" The trial judge agreed to instruct the deputies to make sure that Dixon's leg brace was consistently applied to Dixon's right leg. Dixon alerted the court one morning that deputies had brought only a left-leg brace. The trial judge agreed to change the brace out over the noon hour and to remind deputies to use the right-leg brace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The jury convicted Dixon of both premeditated and felony murder on January 15, 2008. Prior to the penalty phase, Dixon again informed the court that his mitigation investigation was not complete. Dixon's advisory counsel informed the court that, although the mitigation specialist still required additional time to complete his investigation of Dixon's social history, a \"substantial amount of mitigation ... could be presented\" regarding Dixon's \"appreciation for the wrongfulness of his conduct, family instability, parental instability, mental disorders, mental health and substance [abuse] issues.\" Dixon's advisory counsel informed the court that the defense had four experts approved and retained with regard to mental health and family history, as well as a number of documents regarding Dixon's life. Advisory counsel represented to the court that they had informed Dixon that they would present the evidence with the help of the mitigation specialist, but that Dixon had chosen to present only one expert witness. Dixon asserted that he could not present mitigation evidence because the investigation was not complete. Dixon claimed that he had met with only one psychologist on two occasions and that the psychologist had been unprepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At sentencing, the State argued that the death penalty was warranted because of four aggravating factors: (1) Dixon had previously been convicted of another offense for which, under Arizona law, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed; (2) Dixon committed the offense in an especially heinous manner; (3) Dixon committed the offense in an especially cruel manner; and (4) Dixon committed the offense in an especially depraved manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dixon presented only one mitigation witness. The witness, a former warden who reviewed Dixon's prison record, testified that, in his opinion, the correctional system could manage Dixon if he were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The jury determined that the State proved three aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) Dixon had been convicted of another offense for which, under Arizona law, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed (the 1985 assault of the NAU student); (2) Dixon committed the offense at issue in an especially heinous manner; and (3) Dixon committed the offense in an especially cruel manner. The jury unanimously determined that Dixon should be sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed Dixon's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Dixon\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755853\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/545/\">\n    226 Ariz. 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755853\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/545/\">\n    250 P.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (2011). The United\n   States Supreme Court denied Dixon's petition for certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Represented by counsel, Dixon filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the Arizona Superior Court. Dixon raised three claims: (1) that the Arizona Supreme Court deprived Dixon of his right to a fair sentencing and due process when it affirmed his death sentence; (2) that Dixon received ineffective assistance of counsel for his trial counsel's failure to challenge Dixon's competency to waive counsel; and (3) that Dixon was deprived of effective representation from his advisory counsel for failure to challenge Dixon's competency to waive counsel, inform the court of Dixon's mental illness, and develop mitigation evidence relating to Dixon's mental health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of his competency claims, Dixon offered the report of Dr. Toma. Between April and June 2012, Dr. Toma performed four neuropsychological and psychological evaluations of Dixon and diagnosed Dixon with schizophrenia, paranoid type, despite Dixon's \"adaman[ce] that he [did] not suffer from a mental illness.\" Dr. Toma determined that Dixon was not capable of representing himself and that his competence should have been questioned. Dixon also offered a report by Dr. Patino, a psychiatrist who performed a psychiatric evaluation and who concluded that Dixon suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, noting Dixon's paranoia and poor insight. Dixon also submitted the report of Dr. Wu, who conducted a PET scan in October 2012. The results were consistent with schizophrenia and brain damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. The court determined that trial counsel's performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial and that Dixon had no constitutional right to effective assistance of advisory counsel. Dixon petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court for review; his petition was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dixon filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The district court denied the petition, vacated the stay of Arizona's warrant of execution, and granted a certificate of appealability on three of Dixon's thirty-six claims: (1) Claim 1, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for trial counsel's failure to challenge Dixon's competence to waive counsel without a hearing; (2) Claim 3(A), alleging that the trial court erred when it found Dixon competent to waive counsel; and (3) Claim 9, alleging that the trial court violated Dixon's Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when it denied his final motion for a continuance to allow him to develop further mitigation evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dixon now appeals the district court's denial of his habeas petition. In addition to the three certified issues, Dixon raises three uncertified arguments: (1) the trial court violated Dixon's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when it required that he wear visible shackles in the presence of the jury without making an individualized determination that an essential state interest justified the restraints; (2) Dixon's advisory standby counsel violated Dixon's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to challenge Dixon's competency before the trial court; and (3) the trial court violated Dixon's Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to instruct jurors during the penalty phase that they must find the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt in order to impose a sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dixon's habeas petition is subject to review under the Antiterrorism and Effective\n   Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

In reaching this conclusion, the court-presided over by the same judge who presided over the Bowdoin murder trial-explained that it was aware at the time Dixon moved to waive counsel \"of information that placed [Dixon's] mental health at issue,\" thus \"counsel could not have been ineffective in failing to give the [c]ourt information it already had.\" The court further recalled Dixon's acknowledgment during the colloquy of his 1977 Rule 11 competency proceedings, and noted that both Dixon and counsel agreed that Dixon \"had no mental problems that would place his ability to waive the right to counsel in jeopardy.\" The court also noted that Dixon \"was adamant that he would not submit to [a competency] evaluation,\" and the court observed Dixon \"to be able to adequately advance his positions\" and to be \"cogent in his thought processes, lucid in argument, and always able to respond to all questions with appropriate answers.\" Ultimately, the court found that Dixon's \"waiver of counsel was a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent\n   decision on the part of a competent individual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To determine whether the Arizona court's application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   was unreasonable, we look to evidence in the record of counsel's performance to decide \"whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's deferential standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 105,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the two evaluations cited Dixon's depression and indicated that competency restoration was possible. In fact, a few weeks after the 1977 incompetency determination, a third psychiatrist determined that Dixon's mental health status had significantly changed, that Dixon had been restored to competency, and that Dixon was competent to stand trial. With respect to the 1985 assault and resulting conviction, it does not appear from the record that Dixon's competency or mental health was at issue. The 1977 evaluations and the 1978 not guilty by reason of insanity verdict thus shed little light on Dixon's competence at the time he chose to waive counsel in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In fact, the record contains no evidence of competency issues at any time throughout the course of these proceedings. The record instead demonstrates that, at the time Dixon sought to represent himself, Dixon understood the charges against him and the potential sentences, he was able to articulate his legal positions and respond to questions with appropriate answers, and that Dixon demonstrated rational behavior. As to Dixon's continued interest in the DNA suppression issue (which Dixon cites as an indication that he was not competent to waive counsel), Dixon's interest in the issue was not so bizarre or obscure as to suggest that Dixon lacked competence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The 2012 reports Dixon produced in support of his PCR petition do not compel a contrary conclusion. In addition, because they are necessarily retrospective, they likewise fail to illuminate Dixon's competence during the relevant time period. Dr. Toma's opinion, in particular, that Dixon was not capable of representing himself, does not render unreasonable the Arizona court's conclusions in light of a record that demonstrates that Dixon had mental health issues but had previously been restored to competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The record supports the conclusions of the state court. The record reflects that Dixon's prior temporary incompetence was depression-related and readily apparent in Dixon's demeanor, communication, and affect. Dixon displayed no such issues before the trial court. When the evidence of Dixon's prior mental health issues is examined through AEDPA's deferential lens, the state court's application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   was not unreasonable, because the evidence before the trial court was temporally remote and inconclusive. Likewise, although reasonable minds may disagree about the import of Dixon's past incompetency, the record does not contain any evidence that Dixon was not competent between 2002 and 2006, the time period particularly relevant to the murder trial and Dixon's waiver of counsel. Thus, the record demonstrates that the Arizona Superior Court did not rely on an unreasonable determination of the facts. We therefore affirm the\n   district court's denial of Dixon's petition for a writ of habeas corpus as to the first certified issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The district court properly concluded that Dixon's due process rights were not violated by the state trial court's failure to hold a competency hearing\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . Dixon argues that substantial evidence before the court raised a good faith doubt about his competence and that the trial court's failure to hold a hearing before finding him competent to represent himself violated his right to due process. Dixon also argues that the post-conviction court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing, contrary to clearly established federal law, and failed to acknowledge expert reports which indicated that he suffered from some form of schizophrenia, brain damage, and other disorders, reflecting an unreasonable determination of the facts. Dixon again relies on the two 1977 competency evaluations, the 1978 not guilty by reason of insanity verdict, and his continued pursuit of the motion to suppress in support of his argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, the defendant must be competent to waive counsel.\n   <em>\n    Godinez v.

Although the record demonstrates Dixon's history of mental health and competency issues, the record also\n   contains evidence of Dixon's competence at the time he moved to represent himself, as discussed above. Even under a higher competency standard for self-representation, the PCR court's determination without a hearing that Dixon was competent to waive counsel and represent himself was not an unreasonable determination of the facts, nor was it contrary to clearly established federal law. Dixon's actions before the trial court indicated that he understood the consequences of waiving his right to counsel and that he possessed sufficient intelligence and competence to participate in the proceedings. Dixon was responsive and rational before the trial court, and he expressed himself effectively. The court noted that Dixon was able to articulate and advance his positions and to understand and respond appropriately to questions. Although there was evidence that Dixon lacked competence to stand trial in 1977, the record does not demonstrate that this evidence of past incompetency presents \"substantial evidence\" giving rise to \"a good faith doubt\" as to Dixon's competency to represent himself in 2006. We affirm the district court's denial of Dixon's petition as to the second certified issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The district court properly held that the Arizona Supreme Court's opinion concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dixon's final continuance motion was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. The court also did not err in holding that the Arizona Supreme Court's determination did not rest on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Dixon raised these claims on direct appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, and the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the claims on the merits. That court stated that \"Dixon was given more than four years to develop mitigation\" and that the trial court did not err in considering the rights of the victim's parents and Dixon's right to a speedy disposition. Dixon argues that the Arizona Supreme Court's conclusion is not entitled to AEDPA deference because it (1) relied on inaccurate representations made by Dixon's advisory counsel regarding the status of Dixon's mitigation development; (2) omitted evidence that Dixon's mitigation case was not close to being complete; and (3) failed to address the impediments Dixon faced in developing his mitigation case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dixon argues that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision was contrary to, and unreasonably applied, clearly established federal law because it ignored the specific circumstances Dixon faced and precluded Dixon from presenting mitigating evidence that a life sentence, rather than the death penalty, was warranted. Specifically, Dixon asserts that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision violated Supreme Court precedent by focusing primarily on the amount of time during which the mitigation investigation had been ongoing, while ignoring the individual impediments Dixon faced in preparing his mitigation case.

In his final motion to continue, Dixon detailed a number of reasons why a three month continuance was necessary. Specifically, Dixon highlighted a change in mitigation specialists, delays caused by his incarceration, an overall inability to access legal resources while incarcerated, and an inability to schedule interviews with potential witnesses. In support of his motion, Dixon attached a letter from his current mitigation specialist which expressed the view that there was \"no way ethically to proceed to trial.\" The specialist cited delays in reviewing mitigation documents and interviewing witnesses and the appointment of expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Dixon now argues that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision is premised on an unreasonable factual determination because the court relied on an inaccurate representation made by Dixon's advisory counsel that a substantial amount of mitigation evidence had already been prepared, omitted evidence that the mitigation case was not complete, and unreasonably determined that the trial court appropriately considered Dixon's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Although Dixon asserted that he faced a number of delays in and impediments to completing a thorough mitigation investigation and that the mitigation specialist indicated he had not yet completed the investigation, the Arizona Supreme Court did not rely on an unreasonable determination of the facts in concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the continuance. Rather, the court relied on the representations made to it by Dixon's advisory counsel as to the mitigation evidence available. Although the advisory counsel's representations conflicted with Dixon's and the mitigation specialist's opinions, that the Arizona Supreme Court gave greater weight to the advisory counsel's representations does not amount to an unreasonable determination of the facts. Under the relevant standard, reasonable minds might disagree as to which statements the court should have credited, especially because advisory counsel recognized the incomplete status of the investigation in their representations regarding how much of the mitigation investigation had been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Arizona Supreme Court also acknowledged the many continuances granted by the trial court to allow Dixon to develop more mitigation evidence, the overall length of the case, Dixon's interests, and the victims' rights. Consideration of these factors is supported by the record, and the finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance was not unreasonable. For its part, the trial court reviewed a chronology of the case, the mitigation specialist's work on the case, and the victims' objections to a continuance. The trial court and the Arizona Supreme Court ultimately gave more weight to the overall length of the case, the victim's interests, and the advisory counsel's representations than to Dixon's claimed delays and impediments. The PCR court's ultimate determination that the trial court's decision was not an abuse of discretion did not rest on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   When the district court issues a COA on some, but not all, of the issues the petitioner wishes to raise on appeal, uncertified issues raised on appeal \"will be construed as a motion to expand the COA.\"\n   <em>\n    Murray v.
