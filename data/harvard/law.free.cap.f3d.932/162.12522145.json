Brown asked the court to order restitution as a condition of Boone's probation, but his request was denied. He now petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203771\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3). For the reasons stated below, we grant the petition and remand the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brown owned and operated his own electrician's business at the time of the accident. In June 2017, he was riding a motorcycle on a federal roadway in Maryland when Boone ran a red light while operating her vehicle under the influence of alcohol. She collided with Brown, leaving him with serious injuries that required at least seven surgeries within one year of the accident. Brown had metal rods installed in various parts of his body and needed assistive devices to walk. Because of these injuries, Brown alleged that he became unable to work as an electrician or perform daily activities and was \"struggling physically, mentally, emotionally, [and] financially.\" J.A. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Boone was later charged with six violations of various federal traffic regulations in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She reached a plea agreement with the Government and pleaded guilty to three offenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   : (1) driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or above in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204.23\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ; (2) failing to obey a traffic control device in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204.12\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) unsafely operating a motor vehicle in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204.22\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Under the terms of the plea agreement, the Government agreed to recommend a sentence of probation but make no recommendation regarding Brown's claim for restitution as part of Boone's sentence. The parties proceeded to a plea hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   during which the court conducted a plea colloquy and accepted Boone's guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing, Brown requested that the court order restitution in the amount of $18,976 as a condition of Boone's probation. Specifically, Brown sought restitution for the deductible of $250 he paid to his vehicle insurance company and his estimated lost wages for the past seven months, which he calculated at an hourly rate of $22, less the settlement amount of $30,000 he received from his insurer. To support his restitution request, Brown provided personal and familial statements about his injuries and an October 2017 letter from his physician stating that he would not be able to work full-time for one to one-and-a-half years after the accident. Brown explicitly declined to seek restitution for his medical bills or future lost wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Boone agreed that the $250 deductible was an appropriate part of a restitution\n   award but objected to Brown's claim for past lost wages because she contended his supporting evidence was speculative and not reliable. She asked the court to order a restitution award of $250, or, in the alternative, schedule a hearing as to any other proper amounts, although she believed the issue of restitution \"would all get flushed out in the civil proceedings through discovery where it should be flushed out. Not here [in] a criminal magistrate court.\" J.A. 52. At that point, the court noted that Brown \"got serious injuries [and] has had serious medical injuries in the past. It sounds like more surgery is down the road, lost wages, children. [T]his is not something I can decide today.\" J.A. 60-61. The court declined to order restitution at that time, stating that Brown's case was \"extraordinarily unusual,\" J.A. 60, but ordered a presentence report directing the probation officer to examine the issue of restitution. The court scheduled a sentencing hearing for April 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the sentencing hearing, Brown filed an amended request seeking restitution in the amount of $19,040.32 solely to cover his past lost wages. To support the request, he submitted his 2017 federal tax return, his own affidavit detailing his physical struggles, and the letter from his physician. In the letter, the doctor noted that Brown was using a walker and needed physical therapy twice per week for the next six months. The physician further stated \"[i]f he is able to resume his regular full-time work as an electrician, it will likely be 1[ to ]1-1/2 years from the time of his injury.\" J.A. 75. There was no evidence offered as to whether Brown could work part-time as an electrician or was capable of maintaining some other form of full- or part-time employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, Brown reiterated his request for restitution, stating that he would not pursue any civil action against Boone. She continued to oppose the request, arguing that the court should \"stay out of it\" because Brown's restitution request \"is [better suited for] civil litigation.\" J.A. 109. Further, Boone challenged the reliability of the October 2017 letter from Brown's doctor and questioned why Brown could not find other employment and thereby mitigate damages. She also argued that the court may not award restitution here because her conduct underlying the offenses to which she pleaded guilty did not cause Brown's injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Boone asked the court to place her on one year of probation and not to order restitution as a condition of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court sentenced Boone to two years' probation but declined to order restitution, largely for two reasons: Brown lacked sufficient evidence to support his restitution request and the sentencing forum was unsuitable for determining the requested restitution. First, even though the court acknowledged that it had discretion to order restitution and \"no reason to not believe Mr. Brown,\" J.A. 126, it rejected Brown's request, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   although there is evidence of lost wages through Mr. Brown's own testimony and tax return, in my opinion there has got to be more than simply the victim's statement to award restitution in the amount of $20,000..... [T]his is misdemeanor court. This court generally does not deal with restitution, and if we are going to deal with restitution, it is not in this amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   J.A. 127. The court also discussed Brown's future medical bills that were approximately\n   a \"half a million dollars,\" J.A. 128, although Brown did not request restitution for those expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, based on the proffered evidence and Boone's opposition, the court determined that under the circumstances of this case it was not the appropriate forum to determine restitution and referenced\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fountain\n   </em>\n   in support of its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"356487\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/768/790/#p801\">\n    768 F.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801-02 (7th Cir. 1985) (upholding the district court's decision not to award restitution for future lost wages because \"the calculation of lost future earnings involves the difficult problem of translating an uncertain future stream of earnings into a present value\"). The court then stated, \"[i]n a criminal context the Court will put its foot into the waters of restitution if things are readily and accurately ascertainable uncontested. We are contested here, and that is why this is just so not the forum to be dealing with these kinds of figures.\" J.A. 129. The court also noted that \"to order restitution in the amount that is being requested with the evidence that would give me the level of confidence and comfort in that I am being accurate would, in my opinion, complicate and prolong the sentencing process.\" J.A. 130. The court advised Brown to seek restitution in a civil suit so that he could conduct discovery and deal with \"big figures.\" J.A. 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   From the denial of his request for restitution, Brown timely petitions for a writ of mandamus as authorized by the Crime Victims' Rights Act (\"CVRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203771\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Boone opposes the petition, and the Government, in accordance with its obligation under the plea agreement, takes no position either for or against a restitution award. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3771(d)(3) and grant the petition for the reasons that follow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, Boone makes two arguments: that (1) we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review Brown's petition and (2) even if we have jurisdiction, the petition lacks merit. We examine and reject each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 3771(d)(3) governs our jurisdiction over Brown's petition, as it allows a crime victim to \"petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus\" if \"the\n   <em>\n    district court\n   </em>\n   denies the [restitution request].\" \u00a7 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added). Boone asserts that the statute does not authorize our review of Brown's petition because it challenges the decision made by a magistrate judge, not a district court judge. She argues that by using the specific term \"district court,\" \u00a7 3771(d)(3) \"only authorizes a victim to challenge a\n   <em>\n    district court's\n   </em>\n   denial of a restitution request-not a\n   <em>\n    magistrate court's\n   </em>\n   denial of the same.\" Response Br. 12. In effect, Boone argues that a magistrate court does not fall within the meaning of \"district court\" under \u00a7 3771(d)(3) because it is separate and different from a district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Arguing that Congress' choice of the term \"district court\" in \u00a7 3771(d)(3) precludes our review of magistrate judges' decisions, Boone cites to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203402\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in support. This general appeal statute states, \"[i]n all cases of conviction by a United States magistrate judge an appeal of right shall lie from the judgment of the magistrate judge to a judge of the district court of the district in which the offense was committed.\" \u00a7 3402. Boone asserts that only the Government can appeal a magistrate judge's denial of a restitution request to a district judge under \u00a7 3402 and, if the district judge denies the appeal, can proceed to a court of appeals under \u00a7 3771(d)(3). According to Boone, Congress intentionally distinguished the magistrate judge from the district judge in \u00a7 3402 and, had it intended a crime victim to have any rights to directly petition a court of appeals for a writ of mandamus based on a magistrate judge's denial of restitution, Congress would have used the term \"magistrate\" in \u00a7 3771(d)(3). Thus, in Boone's view, where the Government takes no position on a petition for a writ of mandamus and the district court judge has not reviewed the magistrate judge's denial, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Boone's argument is erroneous for at least three reasons. First, her reading of \"district court\" in \u00a7 3771(d)(3) is inconsistent with the relevant statutory definitions. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the statutes in Part II of Title 18, including \u00a7 3771, are governed by the applicable definitional rules of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 1, \" '[c]ourt' means a federal judge performing functions authorized by law.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(b)(2). \" 'Federal judge,\" in turn, is defined to include \"a magistrate judge.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(b)(3)(B). The Advisory Committee intentionally crafted this definition to \"reflect[ ] the current understanding that magistrate judges act as the 'court' in many proceedings\" because it found the term \"court's\" synonymous use with \" 'district judge' \" to be \"misleading or unduly narrow\" and not to \"cover the many functions performed by magistrate judges.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(b)(2) advisory committee's note to 2002 amendment. This principle must be incorporated into the definition of \"district court\" in \u00a7 3771 because Rule 1 governs the statute's definitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, by definition, a \"district court\" under \u00a7 3771(d)(3) includes a magistrate judge. Boone's argument ignores both the definitional structure for \u00a7 3771 imposed through \u00a7 3001 and Congress' decision not to alter that structure for purposes of \u00a7 3771.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Boone misstates the scope of \u00a7 3402, which deals with \"an appeal of right\" \"from the judgment of the magistrate judge to a judge of the district court\" in \"all cases of conviction by a United States magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203402\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case before us is not such an appeal. It is a fundamentally different proceeding by the crime victim-not the defendant-and thus does not fall under \u00a7 3402 as an appeal from a \"case[ ] of conviction by a United States magistrate judge.\" \u00a7 3402 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy-Brown, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519067\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/788/#p793\">\n    907 F.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (4th Cir. 2018) (\"[W]rits of mandamus function differently from ordinary appeals. ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the plain terms of \u00a7 3771(d)(3), it is the \"movant\" who \"may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus\" \"[i]f the district court denies the relief sought.\" \u00a7 3771(d)(3). Brown is the \"movant\" under \u00a7 3771(d)(3) and is clearly accorded the right to petition under the statute. Congress' specific grant of this right to a \"movant\" is unrelated to any appeal under \u00a7 3402 and is plainly\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a right granted to a defendant or limited to the\n   Government. Congress has made this distinction clear by enacting \u00a7 3771(d)(4), which \"simultaneously affords the government with the ability to obtain ordinary appellate review of the [restitution] decision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Antrobus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552105\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1123/#p1129\">\n    519 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129 (10th Cir. 2008). By expressly providing only the Government, not a \"movant,\" with ordinary direct appeal rights, Congress has distinguished the appellate rights for mandamus review afforded to a \"movant\" under \u00a7 3771(d)(3) from the ordinary appeal rights afforded to a party or the Government under \u00a7 3771(d)(4) which would be subject to \u00a7 3402.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sosa v.

Under this provision, a court has discretion to order \"restitution to a victim of the offense under section 3556\" as a condition of probation. \u00a7 3563(b)(2). In turn, \u00a7 3556 states that \"[t]he court, in imposing a sentence on a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense ... may order restitution in accordance with section 3663\" and follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3664. \u00a7 3556.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An award of restitution under \u00a7 3663 is discretionary, as this section states that the court \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   order ... that the defendant make restitution to any victim of [the] offense.\" \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). The court's discretion under the VWPA, however, is not unfettered; instead, \"[d]iscretion in ordering restitution is circumscribed by the procedural and substantive protections\" of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Leftwich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076770\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/665/#p667\">\n    628 F.3d at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The court, in \"determining whether to order restitution,\" must consider \"the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense,\" \"the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\" \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nonetheless, \"[t]o the extent that the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may decline to make such an order.\" \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii). Congress adopted this provision \"to prevent sentencing hearings from becoming prolonged and complicated trials on the question of damages owed the victim,\" S. Rep. No. 97-532, at 31 (1982),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2515, 2537, and so \"that sentencing courts [do] not become embroiled in intricate issues of proof,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The magistrate judge then noted Brown's extensive medical expenses-although he did not seek restitution for these-and his disputed claim for lost earnings, and observed, \"this is a forum which is so much less equipped to handle situations like this than a civil proceeding.\" J.A. 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After discussing case law on the difficulty of calculating lost\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   earnings, the court reiterated its concern\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   about not just lost wages, but about future medical bills, future pain and suffering, future emotional distress.

Put another way, the court abused its discretion by failing to state why the burden of complexity or delay in sentencing outweighed Brown's need for restitution. This abuse of discretion harmed Brown because he received none of the requested restitution to which he may be entitled under the VWPA.

This argument lacks merit. Other circuits have concluded that in determining whether to deny restitution under \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii), a court may consider the availability of other legal remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7633771\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/66/#p68\">\n    77 F.3d at 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that in applying \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii), a court must consider \"the burden that would be imposed on the victim by leaving him or her to other available legal remedies\").

Rather, \"the primary consideration\" of the complexity exception \"is the burden that calculating restitution would place on the sentencing process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130330\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/1202/#p1254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Last, the court below referenced Brown's need for compensation for his medical expenses despite the fact that Brown specifically denied any claim to medical expenses and requested restitution only for past lost earnings. In performing its \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii) balancing analysis, the court should confine its review to what Brown requested-past lost earnings.
