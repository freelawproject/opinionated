(\"Beach Mart\"), in an underlying lawsuit against L&amp;L Wings, Inc. (\"L&amp;L\"). Penn National argues that its duty to defend was eliminated by the \"prior publication\" exclusions in the insurance policies, which preclude an insured from obtaining coverage for injuries caused to third parties through continuous conduct that began prior to coverage. The district court\n   agreed but for the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To resolve this issue of whether Penn National has a duty to defend Beach Mart in the underlying lawsuit against, L&amp;L. we look to: (A) L&amp;L's pleadings in the underlying action, and (B) the insurance policies that Penn National issued to Beach Mart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2011, Beach Mart brought the underlying action against L&amp;L in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina to determine who could use the WINGS trademark. L&amp;L answered the complaint and asserted several counterclaims, including claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Beach Mart subsequently amended its complaint, and L&amp;L in turn amended its answer and reasserted its counterclaims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For purposes of this appeal, the factual allegations supporting L&amp;L's counterclaims and amended counterclaims are taken as true.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bain v. Unitrin Auto &amp; Home Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821410\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/210/398/\">\n    210 N.C.App. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=708%20S.E.2d%20410\">\n    708 S.E.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (2011). Those allegations are materially indistinguishable, so we jointly discuss them below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   L&amp;L and Beach Mart each operate retail stores that sell beach apparel in beachfront communities. Since 1978, L&amp;L has continuously operated and marketed its stores under the WINGS trademark, and in 2008, it registered that mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for use in \"retail apparel stores; retail clothing stores; [and] retail discount store services in the field of beachwear clothing.\" J.A. 663.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to 1995, L&amp;L employed Israel Golassa to work in its retail stores. But on January 1, 1995, Golassa left L&amp;L to found Beach Mart. That same day, L&amp;L and Beach Mart executed a one-year agreement wherein L&amp;L licensed the WINGS mark to Beach Mart for use in two North Carolina stores \"to sell beach-related apparel, beach toys, souvenirs and other related items under the WINGS trademark.\" J.A. 664, 788. At the end of the year, the parties reached an oral understanding that allowed Beach Mart to continue using the mark for an annual fee. That oral licensing agreement continued \"for a number of years,\" but at some point, Beach Mart refused to pay for the WINGS mark yet continued to use it without L&amp;L's authorization. J.A. 664, 789.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, L&amp;L and Beach Mart \"negotiated a resolution\" pertaining to Beach Mart's use of the mark, which was \"memorialized in the 2005 Agreement, dated August 29, 2005.\" J.A. 664, 789. Under the 2005 Agreement, Beach Mart acknowledged that L&amp;L owned the WINGS mark and any goodwill associated with it. Beach Mart also agreed that it would not use WINGS on a standalone basis after December 31, 2005. In exchange, L&amp;L authorized Beach Mart to use the mark in several North Carolina counties, but only in the form BIG WINGS or SUPER WINGS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to L&amp;L's complaint, \"[s]ubsequent to December 31, 2005,\" Beach Mart breached the 2005 Agreement in two principal ways. J.A. 666, 790. First, Beach\n   Mart used WINGS alone, and thus without the SUPER or BIG designations required by the 2005 Agreement. For example, Beach Mart did not include BIG or SUPER on its WINGS hang tags, sales receipts, discount coupons, or internet advertising. Beach Mart's employees also answered store calls with \"Hello, Wings.\" J.A. 666, 790. Second, Beach Mart sometimes used the SUPER designation, but it did so in such a way that was virtually undetectable and therefore contrary to the 2005 Agreement. Thus, on its signs, SUPER was \"so small that it [was] not observable by customers, especially after dark [because] the WINGS trademark ... illuminated, but the word [SUPER did] not.\" J.A. 667, 791. Beach Mart \"similarly diminished the size of the word [SUPER], to the extent it [was] used at all, in connection with merchandise labels and advertising so that it [was] possible only upon careful up-close inspection to see that the word [SUPER was] even being used.\" J.A. 667, 791.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to allegedly infringing upon the WINGS trademark, L&amp;L claimed that Beach Mart \"further breached its duty to act in good faith and deal fairly by undermining the distinctiveness of [Beach Mart] and [L&amp;L] as intended by the 2005 Agreement.\" J.A. 672, 799. Specifically, Beach Mart \"adopted the advertising slogan - 'All you need for the beach' - which is virtually identical to [L&amp;L's] slogan - 'All you need to reach the beach.' \" J.A. 667-68, 791-92. According to L&amp;L's complaint, Beach Mart also \"construct[ed] and operat[ed] retail stores that use[d] the identical fa\u00e7ade as [L&amp;L's] stores, which use a triangular tower above the entry and a distinctive wave sign.\" J.A. 667, 791.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Citing these alleged breaches of contract and covenant, L&amp;L sent Beach Mart a letter on August 9, 2011, terminating the 2005 Agreement effective October 21, 2011. L&amp;L complains that, notwithstanding this termination letter, Beach Mart has allegedly continued to unlawfully use the WINGS mark and its goodwill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 1, 2008, Penn National issued two commercial insurance liability policies to Beach Mart: a Businessowner Policy and an Umbrella Policy. Both policies were delivered in North Carolina and provided coverage for one year. The parties annually renewed the policies in 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under both policies, Penn National agreed to be liable for those damages that Beach Mart became obligated to pay because of \"personal injury\" or \"advertising injury.\" Penn National also agreed to defend Beach Mart in any suit seeking such damages. As pertinent here, the Businessowner Policy defines \"advertising injury\" as an \"injury arising out of ... [m]isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or [i]nfringement of copyright, title, or slogan.\" J.A. 82. And the Umbrella Policy defines \"personal and advertising injury\" as an injury arising out of \"[i]nfringing upon another's copyright, trade dress, or slogan[.]\" J.A. 503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both policies include two relevant exclusions to coverage. First, the policies exclude coverage for injuries arising \"out of the infringement of ... trademark.\" J.A. 117, 492. Under the plain language of the policies, however, that \"exclusion does not apply to infringement ... of ... slogan.\" J.A. 117, 493. Second, the policies include a prior publication exclusion, which precludes coverage for injuries \"[a]rising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period[.]\" J.A. 77, 492.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2012, Beach Mart requested that Penn National defend and indemnify it against L&amp;L's counterclaims in accordance with its insurance policies. According to Beach Mart, it spent the next seven months attempting to convince Penn National that the underlying lawsuit constituted a covered event. Ultimately, in January 2013, Penn National appointed an attorney to defend Beach Mart, while also reserving its rights under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2014, Penn National filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration of non-coverage under the policies. But before responsive pleadings were due, the district court stayed this action from May 2014 to September 2017. After the stay was lifted, in October 2017, Penn National amended its complaint. The same day, Beach Mart finally answered Penn National's complaint and asserted state-law counterclaims for breach of contract, unfair and deceptive practices, and bad faith, each of which rested on Penn National's alleged failure to honor its contractual duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In December 2017, Penn National moved for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). Penn National argued that, even assuming L&amp;L's pleadings in the underlying lawsuit otherwise alleged a covered injury, Penn National nevertheless did not have a duty to defend Beach Mart because the prior publication exclusions in the policies precluded coverage. The district court agreed and, in an order dated March 6, 2018, held that Penn National had no duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penn. Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Beach Mart, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:14-CV-8-BO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201178004\">\n    2018 WL 1178004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 6, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to the district court, the policies' prior publication exclusions eliminated coverage for injuries \"arising from actions which first occurred prior to the policy period,\" which \"did not become effective until January 1, 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201178004\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Examining L&amp;L's pleadings, the court determined that Beach Mart \"used WINGS on a stand-alone basis continually from January 1, 1995, and SUPER WINGS continually from January 1, 2006.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201178004\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such use became \"offensive ... at a minimum when Beach Mart ceased paying fees to L&amp;L ... for use of the mark ... prior to the parties' agreeing to terms of use of the WINGS trademark in the 2005 Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4. Because this \"offensive conduct began outside the coverage period,\" and continued \"over time without any meaningful interruption,\" the court held that the prior publication exclusions applied and that Penn National had no duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court recognized that some of L&amp;L's allegations were not premised upon Beach Mart's infringing use of the WINGS trademark. For example, L&amp;L had also alleged that Beach Mart used almost identical \"advertising slogans\" and \"building fa\u00e7ades\" as used in L&amp;L's stores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Nevertheless, the court viewed all of these alleged wrongs as \"substantially similar\" and part of a \"common, clearly identifiable advertising objective\" that did \"not give rise to 'fresh wrongs' which would trigger coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins. Co. v. Urban Outfitters, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358331\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/761/#p768\">\n    806 F.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768 (3d Cir. 2015) ). Accordingly, Penn National had no duty to defend Beach Mart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the district court determined that Penn National had no duty to defend, it also held that Penn National had not breached the insurance agreements, acted in bad faith, or engaged in unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Therefore, the court also dismissed Beach Mart's counterclaims. Beach Mart timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"We review de novo the district court's ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

In particular, L&amp;L alleged that, \"[s]ubsequent to December 31, 2005,\" Beach Mart offensively published the WINGS trademark and advertising slogan to undermine the distinctiveness between its stores and L&amp;L's. J.A. 667, 791. Although the pleadings do not indicate precisely when these publications occurred, January 1, 2008-the date coverage began-is certainly \"subsequent\" to December 31, 2005. And indeed, Beach Mart did not attempt to terminate the 2005 Agreement for these offensive publications until August 9, 2011-about six years after the agreement was signed and about three years into the coverage period. Making reasonable inferences in Beach Mart's favor, we cannot say these publications are \"not even arguably covered by the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%20374\">\n    340 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Surfing, LLC v.

Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Beach Mart, we conclude that its prior and subsequent publications differ in substance.

These assertions provide us with no basis to determine whether the subsequent trademark publications are substantially the same as the trademark publications predating the policy periods or that the subsequent trademark publications caused substantially the same injury as the early publications.

These wrongs had to be \"fresh\" because, at the time of the pre-coverage publications, the 2005 Agreement did not yet exist and thus there was no contract or covenant to breach.

The Third Circuit identified three non-exhaustive factors to guide the inquiry into whether publications are part of a common advertising objective: (1) \"whether the plaintiff charged the insured with separate torts or an agglomeration,\" (2) whether there is a \"significant lull\" between publications, and (3) whether the publications share a \"common theme relating to the alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358331\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/761/#p768\">\n    806 F.3d at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming a \"common theme\" ran through Beach Mart pre- and post-coverage conduct-a question we need not and thus do not decide-the remaining factors identified by the Third Circuit weigh heavily against applying the policies' prior publication exclusions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To begin, L&amp;L identified distinct wrongs that were caused by the subsequent publications, including, without limitation, breach of the 2005 Agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, because Beach Mart used the mark with authorization while the 2005 Agreement remained in effect, a lull of\n   <em>\n    more than six years\n   </em>\n   could have passed between the prior and subsequent publications. Although these factors are non-exhaustive, the district court failed to identify any other factor to substantiate its determination that the publications at issue were part of a common advertising objective. Thus, even if North Carolina would preclude coverage for publications that are part of a common advertising objective, the court was not justified in doing so here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the district court erred by applying the prior publication exclusions to eliminate Penn National's duty to defend Beach Mart in the underlying lawsuit.
