In 2011, Venezuela expropriated those deposits and transferred them to its state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\"). To seek redress, Crystallex invoked a bilateral investment treaty between Canada and Venezuela to file for arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The arbitration took place in Washington, D.C., and Crystallex won; the arbitration panel awarded it $1.2 billion plus interest for Venezuela's expropriation of its investment. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed that award and issued a $1.4 billion federal judgment. Now Crystallex is trying to collect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unable to identify Venezuelan-held commercial assets in the United States that it can lawfully seize, Crystallex went after U.S.-based assets of PDVSA. Specifically, it sought to attach PDVSA's shares in Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela Holding, Inc. (\"PDVH\"), its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. PDVH is the holding company for CITGO Holding, Inc., which in turn owns CITGO Petroleum Corp. (\"CITGO\"), a Delaware Corporation headquartered in Texas (though best known for the CITGO sign outside Fenway Park in Boston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This attachment suit is governed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1611 (the \"Sovereign Immunities Act\").

Rather, they raise various jurisdictional and equitable objections to the attachment. Likewise, PDVSA primarily contends that its tangential role in the dispute precludes execution against its assets under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   irrespective of the control Venezuela exerts over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We affirm the District Court's order granting the writ of attachment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As Crystallex asserts and PDVSA does not dispute, Venezuela then gave the mining rights at Las Cristinas to PDVSA for no consideration, and PDVSA subsequently \"sold to the Venezuelan Central Bank 40% of its shares in the affiliate that was created to exercise those mining rights.\" J.A. 1194.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later that year, Crystallex filed for arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty between Canada and Venezuela before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. As noted earlier, the arbitration took place in Washington, D.C., and Crystallex won an arbitration award of $1.2 billion plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Crystallex had its award.

It claimed that Venezuela refused to pay its arbitration award and \"thwart[ed] enforcement\" by transferring its assets among several entities-PDVSA, PDVH, and CITGO- allegedly in violation of the Delaware Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, 6 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301 -11.\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v.

The Court denied PDVH's motion to dismiss, but we reversed and held that a transfer from a non-debtor could not be a \"fraudulent transfer\" under the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263466\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/79/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263466\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/79/#p82\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While we do not condone the debtor's and the transferor's actions, we must conclude that Crystallex has failed to state a claim under [the Act].\"). That panel noted explicitly but reserved judgment on the question now before us-whether PDVSA could be liable for the arbitration award as an \"alter ego\" of Venezuela.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263466\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/79/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 84 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Proceedings in this appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While the award-confirmation appeal was pending in the D.C. Circuit, Crystallex followed up its judgment by filing an attachment action against Venezuela in the Delaware District Court. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a), Crystallex attempted to attach PDVH shares owned by PDVSA. That rule provides: \"A money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution-and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution-must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located,\" here Delaware, \"but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.\" Delaware law permits a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of attachment (known by its Latin name,\n   <em>\n    fieri facias\n   </em>\n   , or simply\n   <em>\n    fi\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    fa.\n   </em>\n   ) over various forms of property belonging to the debtor, including its shares in a Delaware corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10 Del. C. \u00a7 5031 ; 8 Del. C. \u00a7 324(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Though not named in the attachment proceeding, PDVSA intervened in the District Court. It moved to dismiss the proceeding on the ground of sovereign immunity under the Sovereign Immunities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After several rounds of briefing and hearings, the District Court concluded that PDVSA was Venezuela's \"alter ego\" under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v. Bolivarian\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic of Venezuela\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Del. Crystallex\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527311\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/380/#p414\">\n    333 F. Supp. 3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (D. Del. 2018). The Court held (1) it had jurisdiction to order attachment against PDVSA's U.S.-based commercial assets, and (2) Crystallex could attach PDVSA's shares of PDVH to satisfy the judgment against Venezuela. A follow-up order, dated August 23, 2018, directed the Clerk to issue the writ and have it served in furtherance of an execution through a public sale of PDVH stock. PDVSA appealed both of these orders (docketed in our Court as Nos. 18-2797 &amp; 18-3124), and also filed a petition for a writ of mandamus (No. 18-2889) to prevent completion of the sale during this appeal. We consolidated all three appeals for oral argument and resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While they were pending before us, Venezuela moved to intervene and to stay these appeals for 120 days so that it could further evaluate its legal position. By order dated March 20, 2019, we granted Venezuela's motion to intervene and participate in oral argument. We also permitted it to file supplemental briefing. We did not rule on its motion to stay but stated we would consider that motion at oral argument. At that argument, Venezuela chose\n   to forgo further pursuit of a stay. Oral Arg. Tr. at 180:1-7 (Apr. 15, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relationship between Venezuela and PDVSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The District Court's primary ruling was that PDVSA is Venezuela's \"alter ego\" under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   . Numerous facts are relevant to that determination, as discussed in more detail below. In general, it is undisputed the relationship between PDVSA and Venezuela has tightened significantly since 2002, when then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez fired roughly 40% of the PDVSA workforce for protesting increased Venezuelan control over the company. Since then PDVSA's presidents have generally been senior members of the Venezuelan president's cabinet, including members of the Venezuelan military. Venezuela has also passed various laws that require PDVSA to fund both government initiatives and discretionary government funds. Venezuela controls PDVSA's domestic oil production, sales, and pricing. It also requires that PDVSA supply Venezuela and its strategic allies with oil at below-market rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Bondholders' interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Also relevant to this appeal are the various bonds that PDVSA has issued over the past decade or so. Several holders of PDVSA bonds due to mature in 2020 moved to intervene as\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   in this appeal. They include BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. and Contrarian Capital Management, LLC. Their bonds have an outstanding face value of approximately $1.684 billion and are secured by a 50.1% collateral interest in PDVH's shares of Citgo Holding, Inc. as security for the bonds. According to the Bondholders, PDVSA has also issued roughly $25 billion in bonds to U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. U.S. policy towards Venezuela and PDVSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   President Nicolas Maduro became the President of Venezuela in 2013. This year Juan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuelan's opposition leader and president of the National Assembly, has made efforts to oust Maduro and take control of the Venezuelan government. The United States Government recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the rightful leader of Venezuela on January 23, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Five days later, as part of a broader effort to convince the Maduro regime to cede power, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\"OFAC\") imposed new sanctions against PDVSA by adding it to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. As discussed further below, the U.S. Government has also promulgated several executive orders limiting transfer of Venezuelan or PDVSA-controlled assets in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The parties dispute whether the District Court had jurisdiction to attach PDVSA's property to satisfy the judgment against Venezuela. The Court held that it had both ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and an independent basis for jurisdiction per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) because PDVSA was Venezuela's alter ego.

(Venezuela Br. at 12-16.) Regardless whether \u00a7 1963 separately confers subject-matter jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, a district court has jurisdiction to enforce a federal judgment against a foreign sovereign when it is registered under \u00a7 1963. This is so, as noted, because the jurisdictional basis from the action resulting in the judgment carries over to the post-judgment enforcement proceeding in a manner akin to the ordinary operation of a district court's enforcement jurisdiction over post-judgment proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391128\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/48/#p53\">\n    281 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   53-54 ;\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051856\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1117/#p1123\">\n    627 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1123 ;\n   <em>\n    Transaero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3613963,10523486\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/148/\">\n    30 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A recent decision by the Supreme Court reinforces our rejection of Venezuela's novel \u00a7 1963 argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic of Sudan v.

It involved a \u00a7 1963 proceeding against the instrumentalities of a foreign sovereign-the same procedural posture we have here. The Court resolved that case on a ground not relevant here, but, notably, it expressed no concern about the use of a\n   \u00a7 1963 proceeding against a foreign sovereign.

District Court. As the latter had jurisdiction over Venezuela-by virtue of the Sovereign Immunities Act's arbitration exception,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) -both Courts that follow, the Delaware District Court and our Court, also have jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

We part company again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To reach this conclusion, we first consider our decision in\n   <em>\n    Federal Insurance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534426\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/1270/#p1279\">\n    12 F.3d at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There we joined other circuits in holding that, although the\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   doctrine came in a case involving the shifting of substantive liability, it also applied to extend a district court's jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign to reach an extensively controlled instrumentality.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534426\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/1270/#p1279\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases). On a straightforward application of\n   <em>\n    Federal Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the District Court's jurisdiction over Venezuela would extend to PDVSA so long as it is Venezuela's alter ego under\n   <em>\n    Bancec.

That reading of\n   <em>\n    Peacock\n   </em>\n   misfires. It was not a case involving foreign sovereigns or the Sovereign Immunities Act. The Act is a specialized jurisdictional statute designed to address a specific problem-the extent to which foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities are immune from suit and attachment in our courts. And the\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   doctrine-the applicability of which is the core question here-is a federal common-law outgrowth of that specialized statute.

Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Peacock\n   </em>\n   leads us to believe the Supreme Court expected or intended its decision in that case to restrain the application of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   in post-judgment proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Rubin v.

When pressed at oral argument to identify the circumstances where\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   could be applied, PDVSA offered two: under\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   's \"fraud or injustice\" prong (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where a sovereign uses its instrumentality's separate status to perpetuate a fraud or injustice) or where the instrumentality was itself \"responsible on the arbitration award\n   as a participant in the events.\" Oral Arg. Tr. at 91: 7-18. But if the instrumentality were directly liable for the award, there would be no need to invoke\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   at all. PDVSA thus tries to read the extensive control prong out of\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   . We cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The District Court concluded correctly that\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   does not require a connection between a sovereign's extensive control of its instrumentality and the plaintiff's injury.

Before\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   , courts struggled with how to give meaning to\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   's apparent reference to a principal-agent relationship.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Bancec does not require consideration of the third-party bondholders.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Amici bondholders of PDVSA contend\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   's extensive-control analysis requires consideration of the interests of other creditors of the judgment debtor's alleged alter ego, both as a matter of doctrine and of equity. That argument, plausible on its face, does not prevail here. As a doctrinal matter, the overarching framework of the extensive-control test tells us that third-party creditors' interest is a reason for-not a separate criterion\n   of-the analysis.\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   explained that those creditors' interests are part of the reason the presumption of separate juridical status is so difficult to overcome: \"Freely ignoring the separate status of government instrumentalities would result in a substantial uncertainty over whether an instrumentality's assets would be diverted to satisfy a claim against the sovereign, and might thereby cause third parties to hesitate before extending credit to a government instrumentality without the government's guarantee.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/\">\n    462 U.S. at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191414\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/611/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason (among others),\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   counsels courts not to ignore separate status.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Letelier v.

To add to this analysis an additional unspecific consideration of third-party interests would double-count the creditors' concern in an arena of many competing concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The difficulty of overcoming the\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   presumption is also practical comfort: where there is extensive control, we can expect reasonable third parties to recognize the risks of extending credit. Here, for example, Venezuela's relationship to PDVSA was clearly disclosed to any prospective holder of the latter's bonds in the offering circular for that issuance: \"We are controlled by the Venezuelan government\"; obligations imposed by the government \"may affect our ... commercial affairs\"; and \"we cannot assure you that the Venezuelan government will not, in the future, impose further material commitments upon us or intervene in our commercial affairs.\" JA-608. Perhaps recognizing that risk, the Bondholders protected their extension of credit to PDVSA by obtaining as collateral a 50.1% security interest in PDVH's shares of Citgo Holding, Inc., which, of course, will not be impaired by the District Court's writ of attachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

But it points to no authority for that proposition, and it does not explain why our review of the District Court's\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   analysis would be any different than in the normal course, where we render our decision based on the record before the district court and \"do[ ] not purport to deal with possible later events.\"\n   <em>\n    Standard Oil Co. v.

In addition to the initial information imbalance between the judgment creditor and the foreign sovereign, the creditor must gather evidence related to events, witnesses, and relationships between a foreign sovereign and its own instrumentality, the bulk of which is often within the territorial control of the\n   sovereign itself, making discovery a particularly onerous task.

While PDVSA effectively conceded that Crystallex satisfied each factor under\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   at oral argument, we summarize the evidence for the sake of clarity, as the facts are paramount in determining when control is so extensive that entity separateness fades away as a legal distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Factor 1: the level of economic control by the government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Venezuela wields extensive economic control over PDVSA. Venezuela's bondholder disclosures in 2011 and 2016 stated: \"[G]iven that we are controlled by the Venezuelan government, we cannot assure you that [it] will not, in the future, impose further material commitments upon us or intervene in our commercial affairs in a manner that will adversely affect our operations, cash flow and financial results.\" JA-645; 1921. They leave no doubt Venezuela has the power to intervene and mandate PDVSA's economic policies. In 2011 PDVSA disclosed that \"the Venezuelan government required us to acquire several electricity generation and distribution companies, as well as certain food companies ... [,] and required ... us to acquire the assets of [another Venezuelan company] at a price to be determined in the future.\" JA-608-09. The District Court found that Venezuela requires PDVSA to fund\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Venezuelan programs that have nothing to do with its business, causing PDVSA to take on additional debt. Such programs include PDVSA Agricola S.A., which subsidizes Venezuela's agriculture, industrial infrastructure, and produce\n   sectors, and PDVSA Desarrollos Urbanos S.A., which subsidizes Venezuela's housing projects. ...

Article 12 provides hydrocarbon deposits within the territory of the state are the property of the Republic, JA-1722, and Article 302 reiterates \"the State reserves to itself, through the pertinent organic law, and for reasons of national convenience, petroleum activity,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1558. Article 303 addresses the state's control over PDVSA specifically: \"For reasons of economic and political sovereignty and national strategy, the State shall retain all shares in Petroleos de Venezeula, S.A.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , JA-350; 386. In addition, as PDVSA disclosed to bondholders, under Article 5 of the Organic Hydrocarbons Law, its revenues \"are required to be used to finance health and education, to create funds for macroeconomic stabilization and to make productive investments, all in favor of the Venezuelan people. Those social commitments may affect our ability to place additional funds in reserve for future uses and, indirectly, our commercial affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 608.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The District Court also found that Venezuela exercises its economic control over PDVSA by dictating to whom PDVSA must sell oil to and at what price. The 2011 circular explains that \"[t]he Venezuelan government, rather than the international market, determines the price of products ... sold by us through our affiliates in the domestic market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 643. Thus Venezuela \"dictates the severely discounted price at which PDVSA must sell its product to Venezuelan citizens\" and \"forces PDVSA to 'sell' oil to third parties for no, or\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   , consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Del.

Per Venezuela's \"Petrocaribe\" agreements with its allies, PDVSA must provide oil to member states at a steep discount on price, along with a two-year grace period for payments, on a payment schedule up to 25 years in length with interest rates as low as 1% (with the option, on Venezuela's part, to accept deferred payments directly in the form of goods and services).

Factor 2: whether the entity's profits go to the government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As PDVSA's lone shareholder, all profit ultimately runs to the Venezuelan government. In addition, PDVSA pays Venezuela taxes and royalties on the oil it produces. The Rigobon Declaration contends that PDVSA pays \"extraordinary taxes,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , taxes at an artificial rate designed to collect more of PDVSA's revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Factor 5: whether adherence to separate identities would entitle the foreign state to benefits in United States courts while avoiding its obligations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Venezuela owes Crystallex from a judgment that has been affirmed in our courts. Any outcome where Crystallex is not paid means that Venezuela has avoided its obligations. It is likewise clear from the record that PDVSA, and by extension Venezuela, derives significant benefits from the U.S. judicial system. Its 2020 bonds are backed by the common stock and underlying assets of U.S.-based corporations, and hence disputes stemming from default will be subject to U.S. laws and presumably be resolved through the U.S. legal system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bayrock Exhibit 6 at 131-32,\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v.

A strict day-of-writ inquiry could allow parties to avoid execution by freezing assets or otherwise ceasing commercial use when the appeal decision is handed down. Instead, a totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry seems more appropriate, as the Fifth Circuit aptly described: \"This analysis should include an examination of the uses of the property in the past as well as all facts related to its present use, with an eye toward determining whether the commercial use of the property, if any, is so exceptional that it is 'an out of character' use for that particular property.\"\n   <em>\n    Af-Cap Inc. v.

PDVSA argues that the shares cannot be used in commerce because they are subject of\n   sanctions contained in two Executive Orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exec. Order.

Section 1(a)(iv) of E.O. 13808 bars PDVH from paying dividends or other distribution of profits to the Government of Venezuela,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and section 1(b) prohibits the \"purchase, directly or indirectly, by a United States person or within the United States, of securities from the Government of Venezuela.\" In addition, Section 1(a)(iii) of E.O. 13835 precludes United States persons or those within the United States from engaging in any transactions, provisions of financing, and other dealings related to \"the sale, transfer, assignment, or pledging as collateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in any entity in which [it] has a 50 percent or greater ownership interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   However, the shares can still be used by PDVSA to run its business as an owner, to appoint directors, approve contracts, and to pledge PDVH's debts for its own short-term debt. Venezuela illustrates its continued use of this power, noting that President Guaid\u00f3 in February 2019 appointed an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   administrative board to represent PDVSA in its capacity as sole shareholder of PDVH for appointing a new board of directors of that entity. These actions are available to the sole shareholder of a company, and so the shares continue to be used in commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This is not to say that the sanctions of PDVSA assets play no role in whether Crystallex ultimately recovers. According to a Treasury Department Frequently Asked Question, any attachment and execution against PDVSA's shares of PDVH would likely need to be authorized by the Treasury Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Del.

The Treasury sanctions provide an explicit mechanism to account for these. Whether the Treasury Department permits execution in this case, it is clear that the sanctions do not make the PDVH shares immune from attachment under the Sovereign Immunities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there is a strong presumption that a foreign sovereign and its instrumentalities are separate legal entities. But the Supreme Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Bancec\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   that in extraordinary circumstances-including\n   where a foreign sovereign exerts dominion over the instrumentality so extensive as to be beyond normal supervisory control-equity requires that we ignore the formal separateness of the two entities. This clears that bar easily. Indeed, if the relationship between Venezuela and PDVSA cannot satisfy the Supreme Court's extensive-control requirement, we know nothing that can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The District Court acted within its jurisdiction when it issued a writ of attachment on PDVSA's shares of PDVH to satisfy Crystallex's judgment against Venezuela, and the PDVH shares are not immune from attachment. Thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    We also deny PDVSA's petition for a writ of mandamus and dismiss as moot its second appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    As a practical matter, there is reason to believe that Guaid\u00f3's regime does not have meaningful control over Venezuela or its principal instrumentalities such as PDVSA.
