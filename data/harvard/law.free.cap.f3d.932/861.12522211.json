Winding Creek Solar LLC is a QF that wants to develop a 1 MW solar generating facility in Lodi, California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To regulate the terms under which electric utilities purchase power from QFs, the California Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\") established the Renewable Market Adjusting Tariff (\"Re-MAT\") program. Re-MAT violates PURPA's requirements, because it caps the amount of energy utilities are required to purchase from QFs and because it sets a market-based rate, rather than one based on the utilities' avoided cost.

Two features of this regulatory scheme are relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the so-called \"must take\" provision requires utilities to purchase\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the energy a QF provides. The regulations mandate that \"[e]ach electric utility shall purchase ... any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility ... [d]irectly to the electric utility.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.303\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the pricing scheme requires utilities to pay QFs a rate derived from the utility's \"avoided costs.\" \"Avoided costs\" are the costs a utility would have incurred but for the purchase from a QF, either by purchasing the energy from some other source or by generating the energy itself.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). FERC regulations give QFs two options for calculating avoided costs. \"[T]he rates for [energy] purchases shall,\n   <em>\n    at the option of the [QF]\n   </em>\n   ... be based on either: (i) [t]he avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or (ii) [t]he avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (emphasis added). In other words-and key to this appeal-PURPA allows QFs to choose whether the avoided-cost rate a utility pays will be calculated at the time of contracting or the time of delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CALIFORNIA'S PURPA PROGRAMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The CPUC implements PURPA programs in California.\n   <em>\n    Californians for Renewable Energy v. Cal. Pub. Utils. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520994\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/929/#p931\">\n    922 F.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 931 (9th Cir. 2019). In 2012, the CPUC created Re-MAT, one of several California programs regulating the terms of utilities' contracts with alternative energy sources, such as wind farms or solar producers. Re-MAT was intended to establish competitive market-based rates for energy from alternative sources. QFs accepted to Re-MAT are assigned to a queue \"on a first-come-first-served basis.\" Every two months, in what is essentially an auction, the utility serving a given area offers the QFs at the head of the queue contracts at a pre-defined Re-MAT price, which QFs can accept or reject. QFs that reject the contract keep their place in line until the next offering two months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two additional features of Re-MAT are significant here. The amount of energy a utility must buy through Re-MAT is capped. California's three investor-owned utilities are obligated to purchase only 750 MW through Re-MAT statewide. This amount is divided among the utilities according to their customers' share of peak electricity demand. And each utility is allowed\n   to subtract from its share any generation it is already obligated to purchase under prior CPUC programs. As a result, PG &amp; E, which serves the Northern California area in which Winding Creek is located, is obligated to purchase just 149.848 MW of energy from QFs under Re-MAT. That obligation is then divided equally among three types of generation: \"baseload,\" \"non-peaking, as-available,\" and \"peaking, as-available\" (which includes solar facilities such as Winding Creek).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, in any given two-month period, PG &amp; E is obligated to purchase no more than 5 MW from each category of generation. Once PG &amp; E reaches this limit-meaning once purchasing the output of the next QF in line would put it over the 5 MW cap-it can stop offering Re-MAT contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Also significant is the Re-MAT contract price. The CPUC set the initial price at $89.23/MWh for peaking as-available facilities like Winding Creek. Every two months this price adjusts up, down, or stays the same based on QFs' willingness to accept the prior offer price. If QFs will not supply at least 1 MW to the regional utility, and there are at least five unaffiliated QFs in the queue, the next contract price adjusts up. If QFs supply at least 5 MW at the previous offer price, the price adjusts down. And if QFs supply between 1 and 5 MW at the offer price, or there are fewer than five unaffiliated QFs in the queue, the price remains the same. The price adjustment follows a formula set by the CPUC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The CPUC administers another PURPA program, the Standard Contract, which is available as an alternative to Re-MAT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061027\">\n    153 FERC \u00b6 61027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206083932\">\n    2015 WL 6083932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 15, 2015). The Standard Contract does not cap the amount of energy a utility is obligated to buy. The Standard Contract offers an avoided-cost rate, calculated using a six-variable formula. However, three of the six variables (burner tip gas price, market heat rate, and a location adjustment factor) are impossible to determine at the time of contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. WINDING CREEK'S RE-MAT PARTICIPATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Winding Creek was accepted into the Re-MAT program, but because it was not placed near the top of the queue, the company did not receive a contract offer at the initial $89.23/MWh price. By the time Winding Creek received a contract offer in March 2014, the price had dropped to $77.23/MWh. Winding Creek rejected this offer and later, lower offers because it could not develop a facility at such a low price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Winding Creek initially challenged the Re-MAT program before FERC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061122\">\n    144 FERC \u00b6 61122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204053221\">\n    2013 WL 4053221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 12, 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061103\">\n    151 FERC \u00b6 61103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202151303\">\n    2015 WL 2151303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 8, 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061027\">\n    153 FERC \u00b6 61027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pub. Serv. Comm'n v.

To begin, Re-MAT's cap on the amount of energy utilities must purchase from QFs is impermissible under PURPA's must-take provision. Under Re-MAT, PG &amp; E is required to purchase no more than 5 MW of energy from each of the three categories of alternative energy sources in any two-month period. And each utility must purchase only a fraction of the 750 MW statewide cap from each category of generators. As a result, a utility could purchase less energy than a QF makes available, an outcome forbidden by PURPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.303\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Re-MAT's pricing scheme also runs afoul of PURPA. PURPA requires a utility to pay QFs at an avoided-cost rate: the rate the utility would have incurred obtaining energy from a source other than the QFs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). True, state agencies may take a variety of factors into account when calculating avoided cost.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20292.302\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 292.302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 292.304(e). But the Re-MAT price, which is arbitrarily adjusted every two months according to the QFs' willingness to supply energy at the pre-defined price, strays too far afield from a utility's but-for costs to satisfy PURPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The CPUC argues that Re-MAT's noncompliance with PURPA is not consequential because QFs may instead sell energy to utilities through the Standard Contract. It is true that FERC has concluded that an alternative program may exist if a state otherwise satisfies its obligations to QFs under PURPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC\n   </em>\n   , 151 FERC at \u00b6 61103 (\"[A]s long as a state provides QFs the opportunity to enter into long-term legally enforceable obligations at avoided-cost rates, a state may also have alternative programs that ... limit how many QFs, or the total capacity of QFs, that may participate in the [alternative] program.\"). The Supreme Court has recently reiterated when courts must defer to agencies' interpretations of their own regulations.\n   <em>\n    Kisor v.

PURPA mandates that QFs be given a choice between calculating the avoided-cost rate at the time of contracting or at the time of delivery.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). The Standard Contract provides only one formula for calculating avoided cost, and that formula relies on variables that are unknown at the time of contracting. The Standard Contract violates PURPA because it fails to give QFs the option to calculate avoided cost at the time of contracting. This infirmity is plain from the face of the regulations, so we do not defer to FERC's unreasoned conclusion to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kisor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620765\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2400/#p2413\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 2415, 2417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is only appropriate if the regulation being interpreted is \"genuinely ambiguous\" and the agency's interpretation \"reflect[s] fair and considered judgment\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The bottom line is that two wrongs don't make a right. Because neither option offered by the CPUC is PURPA-compliant,\n   California's regulatory scheme is preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the district court did not abuse its broad discretion to fashion equitable relief by declining to grant Winding Creek a contract with PG &amp; E at the initial $89.23/MWh price.\n   <em>\n    See Labor/Cmty.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strategy Ctr. v.
