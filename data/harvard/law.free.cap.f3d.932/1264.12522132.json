About seven in ten adults in the United States use Facebook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When a new user registers for a Facebook account, the user must create a profile and agree to Facebook's terms and conditions, which permit Facebook to collect and use data in accordance with Facebook's policies. To interact with other users on the platform, a Facebook user identifies another user as a friend and sends a friend request. If the request is accepted, the two users are able to share content, such as text and photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For years, Facebook has allowed users to tag their Facebook friends in photos posted to Facebook. A tag identifies the friend in the photo by name and includes a link to that friend's Facebook profile. Users who are tagged are notified of the tag, granted access to the photo, and allowed to share the photo with other friends or \"un-tag\" themselves if they choose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2010, Facebook launched a feature called Tag Suggestions. If Tag Suggestions is enabled, Facebook may use facial-recognition technology to analyze whether the user's Facebook friends are in photos uploaded by that user. When a photo is uploaded, the technology scans the photo and detects whether it contains images of faces. If so, the technology extracts the various geometric data points that make a face unique, such as the distance between the eyes, nose, and ears, to create a face signature or map. The technology then compares the face signature to faces in Facebook's database of user face templates (i.e., face signatures that have already been matched to the user's profiles).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If there is a match between the face signature and the face template, Facebook may suggest tagging the person in the photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Facebook's face templates are stored on its servers, which are located in nine data centers maintained by Facebook. The six data centers located in the United States are in Oregon, California, Iowa, Texas, Virginia, and North Carolina. Facebook's headquarters are in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Facebook users living in Illinois brought a class action against Facebook, claiming that Facebook's facial-recognition technology violates Illinois law. Class representatives Adam Pezen, Carlo Licata, and Nimesh Patel each live in Illinois. They joined Facebook in 2005, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and each uploaded photos to Facebook while in Illinois. Facebook created and stored face templates for each of the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The three named plaintiffs filed the operative consolidated complaint in a California district court in August 2015. The plaintiffs allege that Facebook violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2008), which provides that \"[a]ny person aggrieved\" by a violation of its provisions \"shall have a right of action\" against an \"offending party,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/20. According to the complaint, Facebook violated sections 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA by collecting, using, and storing biometric identifiers (a \"scan\" of \"face geometry,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/10) from their photos without obtaining a written release and without establishing a compliant retention schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Illinois General Assembly enacted BIPA in 2008 to enhance Illinois's \"limited State law regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, and storage of biometrics.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5(e). BIPA defines a \"biometric identifier\" as including a \"scan of hand or face geometry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a series of findings, the state legislature provided its views about the costs and benefits of biometric data use. The legislature stated that \"[t]he use of biometrics is growing in the business and security screening sectors and appears to promise streamlined financial transactions and security screenings,\" and also noted that \"[m]ajor national corporations have selected the City of Chicago and other locations in this State as pilot testing sites for new applications of biometric-facilitated financial transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/5(a) - (b). Nevertheless, \"[b]iometrics are unlike other unique identifiers that are used to access finances or other sensitive information,\" because while social security numbers can be changed if compromised by hackers, biometric data are \"biologically unique to the individual,\" and \"once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from biometric-facilitated transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/5(c). Moreover, \"[t]he full ramifications of biometric technology are not fully known.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/5(f). The legislature concluded that \"[t]he public welfare, security, and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, retention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   14/5(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To further these goals, section 15 of BIPA imposes \"various obligations regarding the collection, retention, disclosure, and destruction of biometric identifiers and biometric information\" on private entities.\n   <em>\n    Rosenbach v.

The violation of a statutory right that protects against \"the risk of real harm\" may be sufficient to constitute injury-in-fact, and under those circumstances a plaintiff \"need not allege any\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   harm beyond the one Congress has identified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

The plaintiffs allege that a violation of these requirements allows Facebook to create and use a face template and to retain this template for all time. Because the privacy right protected by BIPA is the right not to be subject to the collection and use of such biometric data, Facebook's alleged violation of these statutory requirements would necessarily violate the plaintiffs' substantive privacy interests.

Facebook argues that its collection of biometric data and creation of a face template occurred on its servers outside of Illinois, and therefore the necessary elements of any violation occurred extraterritorially. At best, Facebook argues, each class member would have to provide individualized proof that events in that class member's case occurred \"primarily and substantially within\" Illinois; for instance, that the member was in Illinois when the scanned photo was taken or uploaded, when a facial recognition analysis was performed, when the photo was tagged or given a tag suggestion, or for similar events. Because the district court would have to conduct countless mini-trials to determine whether the events in each plaintiff's case occurred \"primarily and substantially within\" Illinois,\n   Facebook posits, common questions do not predominate, and the district court erred in certifying the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We disagree. The parties' dispute regarding extraterritoriality requires a decision as to where the essential elements of a BIPA violation take place. The statute does not clarify whether a private entity's collection, use, and storage of face templates without first obtaining a release, or a private entity's failure to implement a compliant retention policy, is deemed to occur where the person whose privacy rights are impacted uses Facebook, where Facebook scans photographs and stores the face templates, or in some other place or combination of places. Given the General Assembly's finding that \"[m]ajor national corporations have selected the City of Chicago and other locations in this State as pilot testing sites for new applications of biometric-facilitated financial transactions,\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5, it is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly contemplated BIPA's application to individuals who are located in Illinois, even if some relevant activities occur outside the state. These threshold questions of BIPA's applicability can be decided on a class-wide basis. If the violation of BIPA occurred when the plaintiffs used Facebook in Illinois, then the relevant events occurred \"primarily and substantially\" in Illinois, and there is no need to have mini-trials on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the violation of BIPA occurred when Facebook's servers created a face template, the district court can determine whether Illinois's extraterritoriality doctrine precludes the application of BIPA. In either case, predominance is not defeated. And of course, if future decisions or circumstances lead to the conclusion that extraterritoriality must be evaluated on an individual basis, the district court can decertify the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Officers for Justice v.
