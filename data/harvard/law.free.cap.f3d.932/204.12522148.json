In the unique context of the facts presented, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cornette pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) pursuant to a written plea agreement with an appeal waiver.

However, the presentence report (PSR) designated the following predicate \"violent felony\" convictions under the ACCA: (1) a 1976 Georgia felony burglary; (2) a 1979 North Carolina breaking-and-entering; (3) a 1986 North Carolina felony possession with intent to manufacture/sell/deliver schedule II controlled substance and felony sell/deliver schedule II controlled substance; and (4) a 1989 North Carolina felony breaking and entering. Based on these convictions, the district court determined that Cornette was an armed career criminal under the ACCA and sentenced him to 220 months of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cornette did not challenge the ACCA enhancement at his initial sentencing, although he appealed the district court's judgment. We vacated the sentence because the district court procedurally erred in failing to adequately explain Cornette's sentence.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (4th Cir. 2010). On remand, Cornette challenged his ACCA enhancement but withdrew the challenge prior to resentencing. On resentencing, the district court once again sentenced Cornette to 220 months imprisonment. A review of that resentencing reveals that the district court did not specify whether it relied on the ACCA's enumerated clause, which includes \"burglary\" as a qualifying violent felony,\n   or the residual clause in finding that Cornette qualified for the ACCA enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, Cornette filed his first motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.

The district court dismissed this as an unauthorized second and successive \u00a7 2255. We granted a motion authorizing Cornette to file a second and successive \u00a7 2255. Cornette then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, once again arguing that he no longer qualified as an armed career criminal under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because (1) his 1976 Georgia burglary conviction no longer qualified as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes under the remaining force or enumerated clauses of ACCA and (2) his North Carolina controlled substance convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicates in light of our decisions in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, we address why the appeal waiver in Cornette's plea agreement does not bar us from reaching the merits of his ACCA claims. Third, we determine that Cornette's 1976 Georgia burglary conviction does not qualify as a violent crime under the ACCA. Finally, we hold that Cornette's North Carolina controlled substance convictions do not qualify as serious drug offenses under the ACCA.

The record of Cornette's sentencing is unclear as to which clause of the ACCA-or even what predicate convictions-the district court relied upon in sentencing him. That is, in announcing its original sentence, the sentencing court stated only that it overruled all of Cornette's objections to the PSR and determined that the final offense level of 32 was \"correct as stated in the Presentence Investigation Report and adopted by the Court.\" J.A. 28. Upon remand and resentencing, the sentencing court stated only that the total offense level of 32 and the criminal history category of VI made the applicable guideline range 210 to 262 months. J.A. 54. There was no discussion of any of the ACCA's clauses in either sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government contends that the record does not establish that Cornette was sentenced under the residual clause such that Cornette cannot present any\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   -based challenge to his sentence. But under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277532\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/677/\">\n    850 F.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2017), we are to read this equivocation in the record in Cornette's favor. We recently reaffirmed this reasoning, stating that \"a\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 2255 motion relies on a new rule of constitutional law ... when the petitioner's ACCA-enhanced sentence 'may have been predicated on application of the now-void residual clause.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In other words, we \"will not penalize a movant for a court's discretionary choice not to specify under which clause of Section 924(e)(2)(B) an offense qualified as a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277532\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/677/\">\n    850 F.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since it is not clear one way or the other, we assume for purposes of this appeal that Cornette was sentenced under the ACCA's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We now turn to whether Cornette's appeal waiver bars us from considering the merits of his ACCA petition for relief. We hold that it does not under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Cornette's plea agreement waived his right to appeal from errors in the sentence imposed against him, except for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Cornette concedes that the claim he presses here is neither an ineffective assistance of counsel nor a prosecutorial misconduct claim. But Cornette contends that his otherwise valid appeal waiver does not bar him from now arguing that by imposing a sentence under\n   the now unconstitutional residual clause of the ACCA, the district court exceeded its statutory authority to sentence him. Cornette's argument finds support in the precedent of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cornette's challenge to his sentence is likewise predicated on the assertion that the district court did not have the statutory authority to impose the sentence it did (here, under the residual clause, rather than the restitution statute), and so\n   <em>\n    Marin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Broughton-Jones\n   </em>\n   support his contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Cornette's argument can be simplified to the following: (1)\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   struck the residual clause of the ACCA as unconstitutional; (2)\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   made\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   retroactive; (3) he was sentenced pursuant to ACCA's residual clause; and (4) because\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   made\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   retroactive and he was sentenced pursuant to the ACCA's residual clause, the district court had the statutory authority at the first sentencing to impose a sentence containing a sentence enhancement under the residual clause of the ACCA but is now deemed not to have had that authority. There is no dispute about the first two propositions. And as we discussed previously, we do not agree with the government's argument about the third proposition that the original sentencing judge did not rely upon the residual clause in sentencing Cornette, and that Cornette could not claim relief based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The only remaining issue, therefore, is whether the district court is now deemed to have had the statutory authority to impose the sentence. It did not. The district court sentenced Cornette pursuant to the residual clause.\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   made\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   retroactive, and so all sentences rendered under the residual clause became unconstitutional. Therefore, Cornette's sentence was imposed \"in excess of the maximum penalty provided by [ACCA],\"\n   <em>\n    Marin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863240\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/493/#p496\">\n    961 F.2d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the appeal waiver does not bar Cornette's\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To be clear, this does not mean that a subsequent change in sentencing law renders an otherwise valid appeal waiver invalid. Our own precedent establishes that when a sentencing law undergoes a non-retroactive change, a defendant who waived his right to appeal a sentence imposed under the old regime remains bound by that waiver even if resentencing under the new regime might otherwise entitle him to new rights or subject him to different penalties.

Under\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

The 1968 Georgia burglary statute under which Cornette was convicted reaches any person who \"without authority and with the intent to commit a felony ... enters or remains within ... any building, vehicle, railroad car, watercraft, or other such structure designed for use as the dwelling of another, or enters or remains within any other building or any room or any part thereof.\" Ga. Code \u00a7 26-1601 (1968). We must therefore determine whether the statute creates (a) separate crimes of burglary that differ based on the type of location entered-e.g., burglary of a building, burglary of a watercraft, burglary of a structure designed for use as a dwelling, and so on-or (b) a single crime of burglary that requires, as one element, entry into any of several different types of location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As a threshold matter, the statute does set forth a disjunctive list of types of locations that may be burgled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fuertes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357175\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/485/#p498\">\n    805 F.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (4th Cir. 2015). While the statute's disjunctive language sets up a divisibility question, it does not answer it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357175\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/485/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[M]ere use of the disjunctive 'or' in the definition of a crime does not automatically render it divisible.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, we consider whether the statute's language describes \"statutory alternatives\" indicating different crimes or mere \"illustrative examples\" referring only to a crime's means of commission.\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , 136 S. Ct. at 2256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the language of the Georgia burglary statute suggests a single crime of burglary while spelling out various factual ways to fulfill the location element of the offense. That is, the \"illustrative examples\" in the statute of burgling a watercraft or railroad car refer only to the means of commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the statute does not contain different penalties based on the type of location burgled and does not require prosecutors to charge the type of location burgled. Therefore, the statute's language suggests that it consists of alternative means as opposed to alternative elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Controlling state court decisions confirm that the statute contains alternative means. How state courts treat jury instructions, in particular, can be instructive on whether a statute lists means or elements. In\n   <em>\n    Omargharib\n   </em>\n   , we explained that elements of a crime, as opposed to means, are factual circumstances of the offense that the jury must find \"unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340728\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/192/#p198\">\n    775 F.3d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). As relevant here, Georgia courts have repeatedly upheld jury instructions where a jury was entitled to find entry into either a \"dwelling house or building,\" with no unanimity requirement on those alternatives. In\n   <em>\n    Hart v. State\n   </em>\n   , the Georgia Supreme Court held that such a jury instruction was \"sufficient to inform the jury of the essential elements of the offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903751\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/238/325/\">\n    238 Ga.App. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903751\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/238/325/\">\n    517 S.E.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (1999). Significantly, the indictment in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   charged entry into a \"dwelling house,\" a term used in the burglary statute, but the jury was not required to agree that the location burgled was indeed a \"dwelling house.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903751\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/238/325/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 792 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Long v.

The lack of a jury unanimity requirement on the type of location burgled indicates that burglary includes multiple alternative means as opposed to elements, and so is an indivisible offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While Georgia law does require prosecutors to charge \"the specific location\" burgled,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

If the \"specific location\" requirement pertained to the elements of the offense, the indictment in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   would have been adequate. Conversely, the Georgia Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

Therefore, we conclude that this rule pertains to the address of the location burgled as opposed to the type of location burgled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, the government points to\n   <em>\n    DeFrancis v.

It does not tell us that the particular type of dwelling must be specified in the indictment.

And at the time of Cornette's conviction, Georgia's intermediate appellate court had held that the state's definition of burglary included entry into \"any ... vehicle,\" regardless of whether it was designed for use as a dwelling.\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , 186 S.E.2d at 436. Thus, when Cornette was convicted, Georgia's definition of burglary criminalized a broader range of conduct than the generic definition of burglary we use for ACCA purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The government argues that\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   has no bearing on our analysis because it was issued by an intermediate appellate court, rather than by Georgia's highest court. According to the government, instead of looking to\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , we should turn our attention to\n   <em>\n    Massey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775987\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/141/557/\">\n    141 Ga.App. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=234%20S.E.2d%20144\">\n    234 S.E.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). In\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , holding that \"the clear intent of [the Georgia burglary] statute is that for a person to be guilty of burglary of a vehicle such vehicle must be designed for use as a dwelling.\" But\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   was not decided until 1977, whereas Cornette was convicted in 1976. At the time of Cornette's conviction,\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   had been decided and\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   had not. That being so, we consider\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   to be the binding interpretation of Georgia law at the time of Cornette's conviction. Indeed, when confronting matters of state law that have not yet been decided by the state's high court, we typically turn to the state's intermediate appellate courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assicurazioni Generali, S.p.A. v.

Nothing more is called for here. In 1976, the crime of burglary in Georgia reached more conduct than the generic crime of burglary enumerated in the ACCA; therefore, Cornette's burglary conviction is not a \"violent felony\" for purposes of the ACCA sentencing enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the government calls our attention to\n   <em>\n    DeFrancis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20S.E.2d%20209\">\n    271 S.E.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Supreme Court of Georgia granted habeas relief to a petitioner who had been convicted of burglary in 1974 but whose indictment was deficient under the post-\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   interpretation of the burglary statute.\n   <em>\n    DeFrancis\n   </em>\n   does not affect our analysis. The inquiry into whether state law at the time of conviction \"covers more conduct\" than the generic offense does not anticipate a separate inquiry into whether some convicted defendants later accrued a claim to habeas relief, as happened with the habeas petitioner in\n   <em>\n    DeFrancis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.

Thus, the Georgia burglary statute, as construed by the applicable Georgia court at the time of Cornette's conviction, is overbroad compared to the generic burglary crime in the enumerated clause of the ACCA, and Cornette's 1976 burglary conviction is therefore not a \"violent felony\" for purposes of the ACCA sentencing enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having determined that Cornette's burglary conviction no longer qualifies as a violent felony, we move to whether Cornette's 1984 North Carolina controlled substance convictions qualify as ACCA predicates.

We looked to the presumptive sentence that the offense carried and whether the defendant's state court judgment had \"aggravating factors supporting a sentence within the aggravated range,\" that is, a sentence above the presumptive sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275101\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/455/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There, the judgment did not state any aggravating factors found by the sentencing judge, and there was no evidence found in the plea transcript to support an admission of aggravating factors,\n   and so we held that Newbold's conviction did not qualify as a serious drug offense because he could not have received ten years of imprisonment for the offense without a finding of aggravating factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275101\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/455/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275101\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/455/\">\n    at 461-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the time of Cornette's 1984 conviction, North Carolina also sentenced criminal defendants under the Fair Sentencing Act. And like the record we examined in\n   <em>\n    Newbold\n   </em>\n   , the record before us has no finding and recording of aggravating or mitigating factors. Cornette's state court judgment only shows that the presumptive range for his controlled substance conviction was three years' imprisonment and that the maximum term was 10 years. J.A. 95. Under the Fair Sentencing Act, Cornette could not have received 10 years of imprisonment for his North Carolina controlled substance conviction without a finding of aggravating factors on the record. There is no such finding, and so Cornette's 1984 controlled substance conviction is not a \"serious drug offense\" as is necessary to qualify as an ACCA predicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To recap, we hold that: (1) Cornette may appeal his sentence notwithstanding the appeal waiver in his plea agreement; (2) his 1976 Georgia burglary conviction is not a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA; and (3) his 1984 North Carolina controlled substances conviction is not a \"serious drug crime\" under the ACCA. Therefore, Cornette does not have the requisite number of predicate offenses to be designated an armed career criminal under the ACCA. We therefore grant Cornette's \u00a7 2255 petition and reverse and remand for resentencing, with instructions for the district court to resentence Cornette without the ACCA enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    There is no real question that Georgia felony burglary does not qualify as a violent felony under the force clause of the ACCA-a person may commit burglary by entering \"without authority.\" The Government makes no argument to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    We recognize that our conclusion puts us at odds with the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Respectfully, we do not find the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Eleventh Circuit relied on the text of the Georgia statute, the fact that \"under Georgia law a prosecutor must select, identify, and charge the specific place or location that was burgled,\" and the defendant's indictment to find the statute divisible.\n    <em>\n     Gundy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141931\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1156/\">\n     842 F.3d at 1167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the inclusion of a \"disjunctive list\" in a criminal statute is not probative of divisibility and Georgia's requirement that prosecutors charge a \"specific location\" means just that the prosecutor must include the address of the location burgled to pass statutory muster and does not indicate that the statute itself sets forth alternative crimes based on the type of location.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Sixth Circuit found the statute divisible because the defendant's indictments stated the location types enumerated in the Georgia statute.\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516975\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/616/#p624\">\n     890 F.3d at 629\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But even if Georgia caselaw is ambiguous enough to allow a reviewing court to consider an individual defendant's indictment as authorized under\n    <em>\n     Mathis\n    </em>\n    , that \"peek\" is for the \"sole and limited purpose of determining whether [alternatives] are elements of the offense.\" 136 S. Ct. at 2257. As the Georgia Supreme Court reasoned in\n    <em>\n     Hart\n    </em>\n    , even an indictment that includes a specific type of statutory location cannot establish that the location type is an element of the charged offense because a jury could properly have been instructed with finding entry into\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    a \"dwelling house or building.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"903751\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/238/325/\">\n     517 S.E.2d at 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, the\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    court's reliance on the specific indictments of the defendant to conclude that the type of location is an element of burglary was misplaced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Based on our holding, we need not consider Cornette's additional argument that the unlawful entry element of Georgia burglary is broader than generic burglary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The district court found that Cornette had not timely challenged his ACCA designation under\n    <em>\n     Simmons\n    </em>\n    .
