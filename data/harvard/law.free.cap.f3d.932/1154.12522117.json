Special Condition No. 24 requires Simpson to submit to periodic polygraph testing (at the discretion of the probation officer) to ensure compliance with the requirements of his supervision or treatment. Simpson admitted he did not report to the community corrections center or to the probation officer as required. He has repeatedly stated that he does not intend to comply with the terms of his supervised release, and he has repeatedly failed to comply. The record strongly supports the imposition of this Condition.\n   <em>\n    Wiedower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095121\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/490/#p493\">\n    634 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There was no abuse of discretion in the imposition of Special Condition No. 23, which prohibits the use or possession of audio/visual recording or producing equipment absent written approval of the probation office. Although Simpson was not charged with producing or distributing child pornography, the record reflects he received at least 300 but fewer than 600 images of child pornography, all of which were produced using photographic equipment. Pictures were used in this offense even if Simpson did not produce or distribute the images, making this Condition reasonably related to the offense. Simpson is not completely restricted from the use or possession of audio/visual recording or producing equipment if he first obtains permission from his probation office.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Notwithstanding this discretion, a district court may order a special condition of supervised release only if that condition is \"reasonably related\" to certain factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), \"involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" for the purposes of certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \"is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Given these limitations, \"when imposing a special condition of supervised release, a 'district court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   make an individualized inquiry into the facts and circumstances underlying a case and make sufficient findings on the record so as to ensure that the special condition satisfies the statutory requirements.' \"\n   <em>\n    Poitra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739415\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/884/#p890\">\n    648 F.3d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wiedower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095121\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/490/#p493\">\n    634 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   493 ). We have repeatedly held that the failure to make individualized findings constitutes error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And we have stressed that requiring individualized findings helps to \"ensure that each condition of supervised release complies with the statutory requirements that it be both reasonably necessary and reasonably related to the rehabilitative process\"; \"instill respect for judicial proceedings in both the defendant and the general public\"; and \"allow for meaningful appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    Poitra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739415\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/884/#p890\">\n    648 F.3d at 889-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Yet, even after Simpson objected at the first opportunity to the lack of individualized findings, the district court failed to make any. Today the court excuses the district court's error on the ground that the basis for Special Condition 23 can be discerned from the record. I disagree. We have previously upheld a similar condition where aggravating factors made it \"reasonable to believe\" that the defendant \"likely\" would photograph and exchange images of minors.\n   <em>\n    Ristine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533868\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/692/#p696\">\n    335 F.3d at 695-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ristine\n   </em>\n   , on plain-error review, we upheld a restriction on a defendant's use of photographic equipment where he \"possessed thousands of photos of [minors,] expressed interest in having sexual relations with [minors],\" and had sold subscriptions to pornographic images.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533868\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/692/#p696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Koch\n   </em>\n   , we upheld a similar restriction where the overall record showed that the defendant was a \"sophisticated computer user\" who had done \"more than merely possess child pornography.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799867\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/470/#p481\">\n    625 F.3d at 481-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, in contrast, I discern nothing from the record that would support a ban on audio/visual recording or producing equipment-including, by its plain language, a cell phone equipped with a camera. Simpson is not accused of producing child pornography or exchanging it with others, and the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) includes no information from which it would be reasonable to believe that the restriction is justified. To the contrary, the PSR stated expressly that Simpson's conduct \"was limited to the receipt or solicitation of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; and the defendant\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    not intend to traffic in, or distribute, such material\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). I respectfully disagree with the court's view that because someone\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than Simpson used photographic equipment to create the images that Simpson possessed, the condition is necessarily justified in\n   <em>\n    Simpson's\n   </em>\n   case. As we have explained, the district court \"must be careful to conduct an inquiry 'on an individualized basis,' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
