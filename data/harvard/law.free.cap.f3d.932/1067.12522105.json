Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Collier was on supervised release in Minnesota for a prior state crime when his supervising officials learned he was engaging in the business of prostitution. Collier was arrested at the request of a supervising official, who then conducted a warrantless search of Collier's cell phone. Local\n   police later secured a warrant to search all of Collier's electronic devices. Further investigation led officials to believe that Collier had been forcing several women to engage in commercial sex acts and give him the proceeds from those acts. Following a jury trial, Collier was convicted of conspiracy, interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises, sex trafficking, and attempted sex trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Collier raises numerous issues on appeal, including denial of his motion to suppress; improper jury instructions; denial of his right to counsel; various evidentiary and witness errors; violation of due process rights; judicial bias; and the denial of his motion to dismiss based on the sufficiency of the evidence. For the reasons discussed below, we find each contention ultimately fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As to the cell phone search by the supervising official (Agent Welle), the district court held that Collier had a reduced expectation of privacy while on supervised release and was subject to Standard Condition of Supervised Release No. 13, which provided that Collier \"must submit at any time to an unannounced visit and/or search of [his] person, vehicle, or premises by the agent/designee.\" The district court found that Welle was not acting as an agent for the police. Collier's computer and other cell phones were also permissibly seized the following day, given that these items could have been searched because of Collier's reduced expectation of privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Collier argues the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

This argument is meritless. The district court's instruction accurately reflected the statute's text - phrased in the present tense - prohibiting a person from \"recruit[ing], entic[ing], harbor[ing], etc., a victim \"knowing\" means such as force or\n   coercion \"will be used to cause\" victims to engage in such acts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Both the instruction and the statute require that Collier, who \"recruit[ed], entic[ed], harbor[ed],\" etc., his victims under \u00a7 1591(a)(1), knew such means would be an instrumental cause in requiring his victims to engage in commercial sex acts, whether it was Collier himself or a third party who would use such means.

Collier did not request a continuance for the purpose of obtaining\n   new counsel until the third day of the trial (even though a week before the trial Collier moved for continuance so he could act as co-counsel).

We turn to the alleged discretionary errors first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sequestration Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Collier argues the government violated the district court's sequestration order and failed to take corresponding remedial steps when a government witness and the government's designated representative allegedly talked to a third government witness, Victim 3, during a break in the latter's direct testimony. While Federal Rule of Evidence 615 authorizes the district court to sequester witnesses, \"sequestration orders ... do not forbid all contact with all trial witnesses at all times,\" unless otherwise specified.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Engelmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709979\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/874/#p877\">\n    701 F.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (8th Cir. 2012). Even if Collier could prove the government violated the sequestration order, Collier has not shown he was actually prejudiced\n   as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kindle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789129\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/272/#p276\">\n    925 F.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276 (8th Cir. 1991) (\"We will only reverse\" a district court's failure to remedy a party's violation of a sequestration order \"if evidence of clear prejudice indicates the trial court's ruling was an abuse of discretion\"). While Collier argues Victim 3's testimony changed tracks after the break, the record contradicts this argument. Victim 3's testimony before and after the break concerned Collier's abusive treatment toward her for failing to meet his standards and does not indicate her conversations with government officials prejudiced Collier.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789129\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/272/#p276\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"There was no showing made that the contact resulted in the tailoring of witness testimony to that of earlier witnesses or the development of less than candid testimony which Rule 615 seeks to prevent.\"). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to find a violation of the sequestration order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Exclusion of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Collier asserts the district court improperly excluded evidence regarding Victim 2's previous involvement in prostitution. However, Rule 412 and previous Eighth Circuit precedent forecloses this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 412 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076513\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/416/#p420\">\n    781 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (holding a \"victim's participation in prostitution either before or after the time period in the indictment has no relevance to whether [the defendant] beat her, threatened her, and took the money she made from prostitution in order to cause her to engage in commercial sex\"). Under Rule 412 and\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   , the district court properly excluded this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Collier intermittently represented himself throughout the course of the trial. He claims he was denied due process in that his ability to cross examine witnesses was impaired when the district court seized his computer during trial. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion. The computer was only seized after the court became aware Collier was using the computer to record witness testimony. Due to allegations of witness tampering\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and threatening of witnesses, the court reasoned the witness's \"safety may be in jeopardy.\" After the seizure, the court made arrangements for Collier to access e-discovery files on his standby counsel's computer and on his own hard drive in the presence of a marshal. Further, Collier has not shown how the district court's action impeded his ability to examine witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11559615\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/900/#p905\">\n    194 F.3d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 905 (8th Cir. 1999) (finding a pro se defendant's due process rights were not violated because the defendant could not show his defense at trial was prejudiced). The district court properly balanced those interests here and did not abuse its discretion in seizing Collier's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Bias\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Collier argues the district court erred in denying a motion for mistrial and not recusing himself from the sentencing proceeding after Collier alleged judicial bias. To support the bias claim, Collier cites moments in the transcript where the district court \"was speaking harshly to Collier.\" However, in\n   <em>\n    Liteky v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held \"judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or\n   even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    510 U.S. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). An opinion that derives from an \"extrajudicial source\" or reflects favoritism or antagonism to such a high degree that makes \"fair judgment impossible\" could support a bias challenge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Liteky\n   </em>\n   specifically states \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger\" do not establish bias or partiality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the judge's comments, at most, fall under the category of impatience, dissatisfaction, and annoyance. Following a comment about Collier's case being \"stupid\" the Judge apologized and stated he had lost his patience and was frustrated. Collier provides no evidence the district court's opinion derives from an extrajudicial source, and the comments were not to such a degree that would make fair judgment impossible. Therefore Collier's judicial bias claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Collier claims there was insufficient evidence to support convictions for Counts Five (sex trafficking of Victim 4, a minor) and Six (sex trafficking of Victim 5). In reviewing this issue de novo, we \"view[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, resolv[e] conflicts in the government's favor, and accept[ ] all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516269\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1099/#p1101\">\n    885 F.3d at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, this court has previously rejected an identical argument, explaining that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) \"criminalizes knowingly undertaking activities, such as harboring and transporting a minor ... knowing that a person under the age of eighteen will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\"\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516269\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1099/#p1101\">\n    885 F.3d at 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the statute requires knowing only that a person \"will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act\" at some point in the future, the fact the victim never actually engaged in commercial sex is irrelevant.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Therefore, there was sufficient evidence supporting Collier's conviction for sex trafficking a minor under Count Five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to Count Six, Collier notes Victim 5 testified she engaged in commercial sex voluntarily. However, multiple pieces of evidence show Collier used physical force against Victim 5 to cause her to engage in commercial sex including: a client's testimony that Victim 5 showed up with a black eye, the victim's own text messages to Collier asking him not to beat her up because she had more money for him, jail calls from Collier ordering her to continue prostitution activities to help fund his jail account, and jail calls Collier made to his brother telling him to keep tabs on Victim 5 and beat her up if necessary. The jury found Victim 5's personal testimony to the contrary to be incredible, and findings as to witness credibility are virtually unassailable on appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
