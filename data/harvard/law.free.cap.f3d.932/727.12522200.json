The district court entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of SB 2289, concluding that the manufacturers were likely to succeed on the merits of their Contract Clause claim and that the other relevant factors weighed in favor of a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dataphase Sys., Inc. v.

The court reasoned that SB 2289 imposed unforeseeable new regulations on existing contracts that amounted to substantial impairments. Citing the statement of a co-sponsor in the legislature that the bill was designed to create a \"level playing field\" for implement\n   dealers, the court determined that the Act was special-interest legislation unsupported by a significant and legitimate public purpose.

Previous regulations, moreover, forbade primarily coercive and discriminatory practices; for example, a manufacturer could not \"[c]oerce or attempt to coerce\" a dealer into accepting delivery of equipment the dealer had not voluntarily ordered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1991 N.D.

Some provisions of the North Dakota law parallel the South Dakota statute by expanding prohibitions on coercion to regulate existing contracts, and the manufacturers were entitled to rely on the South Dakota precedent when considering what legislative impairments were reasonably foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holiday Inns Franchising\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840600\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/383/#p385\">\n    29 F.3d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For all of these reasons, SB 2289 substantially impairs obligations of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State's primary argument is that even if SB 2289 substantially impairs the manufacturers' contractual rights, the legislation reasonably advances a significant and legitimate public purpose, so the impairment is constitutional. In\n   <em>\n    Equipment Manufacturers Institute\n   </em>\n   , South Dakota conceded that the purpose of a similar law was \"to level the playing field between manufacturers and dealers,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11423545\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/842/#p859\">\n    300 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this court concluded that the conceded purpose did not qualify as a \"significant and legitimate public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11423545\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/842/#p859\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11423545\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/842/#p859\">\n    at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . North Dakota makes no such concession and asserts that this law furthers a significant public interest in serving farmers and rural communities. But the mere assertion of a conceivable public purpose is insufficient to justify a substantial impairment of contractual rights. Virtually all legislation enacted by multi-member bodies will be motivated by multiple purposes in the minds of individual legislators, but those subjective intentions are not controlling. Whether the law passes constitutional muster requires a more discerning inquiry into the Act's structure and design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a matter of the text and original meaning of the Contract Clause, there seems to be little doubt that the North Dakota law would be unconstitutional. The Clause's terms are absolute: \"No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts ....\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. The Clause's principal target was debtor-relief legislation that many States had passed in the wake of the Revolutionary War,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sveen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612258\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1815/#p1821\">\n    138 S.

North Dakota House Representative Craig Headland stated \"that [the loss of farm equipment dealers] would have an impact on the town where the dealer is located.\" House Agriculture Committee Vice-Chairman Representative Wayne A. Trottier stated that, if farmers cannot \"get service and sales, it makes it costlier and more difficult.\" Representative Dwight Kiefert stated that equipment is purchased \"because we can get the service and the parts. Our area dealership closed and it costs more to get service because there is more mileage.\" Representative Kiefert further stated that \"[t]here was a time when things were easy to fix. Now we are dependent to have the dealer come out.\" And House Agriculture Committee Chairman Representative Dennis Johnson stated that, \"[a]s a custom harvestor over the years[,]\" he had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   seen from Oklahoma the dealerships that have closed in 25 years. At the end of the day we all need each other. We are still sitting with $4 wheat. We are heading for a train wreck in trying to make this all work. We want to take care of everyone involved: farmers, dealers, and manufacturers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   SB 2289 aspires to benefit the farming and rural communities of North Dakota as well as the dealers that do business there. The legislation aims to preserve the symbiotic relationship between the groups. Farmers rely on having a local dealer for prompt service, especially during harvest. Without a local dealer, farmers must travel farther to purchase equipment and obtain repairs. Moreover, the small towns in North Dakota with dealerships reasonably depend on the employment opportunities that come with having such dealerships. Depriving North Dakotans of these opportunities results in adverse consequences for the communities where the dealers are located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court states that, \"[e]ven if [SB 2289] indirectly might benefit farmers and rural communities, the Contract Clause demands more than incidental public benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   , at 733.
