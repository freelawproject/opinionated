Congress also recognized that the existing law at the time-which prohibited firearm possession by those convicted of a felony-did little to protect victims of domestic abuse, since \"many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies, notwithstanding the harmfulness of their conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Voisine v.

Congress therefore sought to close this \"dangerous loophole\" and keep guns out of the hands of those who might use them to victimize their families or households.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/#p2276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Locke does not dispute here that, when he was arrested by federal agents in August 2017, he possessed a firearm. Nor does he dispute that, some months before his arrest, he had pleaded guilty to assault and battery against a family or household member in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2, in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations (JDR) District Court of Stafford County. He does not dispute either that this conviction would ordinarily serve as a predicate offense under \u00a7 922(g)(9). Rather, Locke's argument is based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb), which states that a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [an MCDV], unless, in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, [...] the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under this provision, if a person like Locke was \"entitled to a jury trial\" to resolve the prior MCDV charge but did not \"knowingly and intelligently waive[ ]\" that right, the past offense \"shall not be considered\" as a predicate under \u00a7 922(g)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, Locke argued that the Virginia conviction could not be considered a predicate offense under this provision. J.A. 427. He argued that Virginia law entitled him to a jury trial in that proceeding, and that his waiver of that entitlement did not meet the \"knowingly and intelligently\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In support of that argument, Locke asked the court to subpoena Nicholas Kalagian, his lawyer in the Virginia proceeding. According to Locke, Kalagian would testify that the JDR judge did not state that Locke was waiving any right to a trial by jury at the time of his guilty plea. The district court decided not to issue the subpoena, ruling instead that Kalagian's evidence was irrelevant because Virginia law did not provide Locke with a right to a jury trial and, therefore, the defense offered by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i) [a](II)(bb) was inapplicable. J.A. 140-45; J.A. 429. The district court did allow Locke to submit documentary evidence pertaining to his Virginia conviction. Opening Br. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Locke was found guilty of possessing a firearm after being convicted of an MCDV. Locke appeals, arguing in relevant part that the district judge erred in ruling that the Virginia MCDV was a proper predicate in light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i) [a](II)(bb). Locke's argument on appeal is first, that he was entitled to a jury trial in the Virginia proceeding and second, that he did not properly waive that right. But we now affirm the District Court because Locke cannot prevail on either step.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The statute found at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i) [a](II)(bb) is only applicable to those MCDVs that the defendant was entitled to have resolved by a jury trial. Because Locke was not entitled to a jury trial to resolve his Virginia MCDV in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, the statute is inapplicable to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Locke was charged with assault and battery against a family or household member in violation of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 in the Stafford County Juvenile and Domestic Relations (JDR) District Court. As Judge Ellis noted, \"[u]nder Virginia law, a defendant tried in JDR court has no right to a jury trial; a defendant is entitled to a jury trial for his Virginia MCDV case only if he ... appeals his conviction to the circuit court.\" J.A. 428 (citing Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:13(a) ). Virginia therefore has a \"two tiered system for the conduct and disposition of misdemeanor offenses.\" Opening Br. at 28. At the first tier, there is no right to a jury trial. That right only attaches once the defendant takes the affirmative step of appealing to the second tier: \"The accused is entitled to a trial by jury\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in a circuit court on a plea of not guilty.\" Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:13(a) (emphasis added). In other words, where no appeal to the circuit court is taken, no jury trial is available in Virginia's JDR court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Locke submitted documents in the District Court that show he was made aware of his \"right to appeal a final order[.]\" J.A. 222. Had he made use of this appeal, he would have had the right to a trial by jury, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb) would operate. But he did not. Instead, he opted to deal with his MCDV on the \"first tier,\" where there is no right to a jury trial to be had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Virginia's entirely reasonable decision to provide for the expeditious resolution of misdemeanors like this assault and battery against a family or household member puts Locke's conviction squarely outside the category of offenses addressed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i)(II)(bb). He is therefore ineligible for the defense provided by that statute. See also,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gordon\n   </em>\n   , 264 Fed.

Guilty pleas are protected by a strong presumption, one \"deeply rooted in our jurisprudence\"-the presumption of regularity.\n   <em>\n    Parke v. Raley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p29\">\n    506 U.S. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p29\">\n    113 S.Ct. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924885\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/20/#p29\">\n    121 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).

Thus, unless Locke can rebut the presumption of regularity that attaches to his guilty plea, he is presumed to have waived his right to trial in a way that satisfies the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(i) [a](II)(bb).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This presumption is \"not easily overcome[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Wyatt v.

The Majority notes \"Virginia's entirely reasonable decision to provide for the expeditious resolution of misdemeanors ...,\" and the language of the statute likewise recognizes the disparity in procedural rights afforded to individuals charged with misdemeanors in varying jurisdictions. Maj. Op. at 199. Virginia's procedure wherein defendants charged with misdemeanors may proceed without a jury in the JDR court but are guaranteed the right to a jury trial via an appeal to the circuit court, demonstrates the need for a clear, affirmative waiver to ensure that a defendant understands his rights. Yet the majority opinion charges unsophisticated defendants with knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to a jury trial in the absence of any evidence that they were informed of the right or expressly waived it during the MCDV proceeding, on the basis that \"as every first-year law student knows, a valid guilty plea is a waiver of the right to a jury trial.\" Maj.
