Upon completion of their prison terms, both Defendants were deported to Mexico after immigration officers determined that their robbery convictions were for \"crimes of violence\"-and thus constituted aggravated felonies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After returning to the United States, both defendants were convicted of illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We agree with that argument. But that agreement avails the Defendants little, because the district courts in both cases correctly held that \u00a7 211 robbery qualifies as a generic theft offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), and thus is an aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).

After release from prison, each Defendant was served with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Removal Order (\"Notice\") and placed in expedited removal proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district courts denied the motions, reasoning that even if CPC \u00a7 211 robbery were not a \"crime of violence\" aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), it still was a \"theft offense\" aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).

But, this case arrives in a quite different procedural posture than our direct review of BIA decisions. In addressing petitions for review, our inquiry is limited to determining whether the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence or the BIA made an error of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

But that case, although containing language which when taken in isolation supports the Defendants' arguments, is fundamentally different than these cases. In\n   <em>\n    Ochoa-Oregel\n   </em>\n   , a legal permanent resident was first ordered removed in 2008 in absentia, but this Court found he was denied due process because he \"did not receive notice of either his in absentia removal hearing or of his ability to file a motion to reopen such proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n    at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ochoa was again ordered removed in 2011 for presenting false entry documents, but this Court concluded that the \"due process defects in the erroneous 2008 removal proceeding infect the 2011 removal,\" by stripping Ochoa \"of the important legal\n   entitlements that come with lawful permanent resident status through a legally erroneous decision that he ... had no meaningful opportunity to contest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n    at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government argued that Ochoa was not prejudiced by the defects in the prior removal orders because \"he was an aggravated felon, who could have been removed anyway, and who would have been denied discretionary relief, including withdrawal of his application for admission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, no prior notice alleged removability on that basis, and the panel rejected that argument, noting that \"even if the government might have been able to remove him on other grounds through a formal removal proceeding, his removal on illegitimate grounds is enough to show prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518697\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/682/\">\n    at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, however, the defendants were not denied procedural due process or removed on \"illegitimate grounds.\" The grounds for the removals were their \u00a7 211 convictions. The government offers no alternative justification for removal today, but merely argues that even if the original statutory citation making the convictions a basis for removal had been made retroactively inapplicable, the same convictions require removal under a different section of the same statute previously invoked. Unlike Ochoa, who was deprived of the important protections of legal permanent resident status through removal proceedings that violated due process, the Defendants long ago admitted their \u00a7 211 convictions. The only issue before us today is whether those convictions justified the Defendants' removals.\n   <strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We therefore turn to whether a \u00a7 211 conviction qualifies as a \"theft offense\" under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), which is purely a question of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menendez v.

Even if the Defendants did not have occasion to address that legal question at the time of their removals, they have thoroughly done so today.
