Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Alleged Defect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case involves an allegedly faulty hydraulic clutch system in various vehicles manufactured by Nissan (the Class Vehicles).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The typical components of a hydraulic clutch system include a fluid reservoir, a clutch master cylinder (CMC), and a clutch slave cylinder (CSC), which is sometimes referred to as the release bearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained by Plaintiff's expert, Michael Stapleford, P.E., the clutch system is a dry friction system that uses brake fluid in a discrete reservoir to transfer heat from the clutch components through the base of the CSC to the attached transmission front cover and the surrounding atmosphere. Such a system routinely generates heat ranging from 200 to 300 degrees Celsius, with hard use resulting in temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, in reconfiguring the Class Vehicles' factory-installed clutch system in 2007, Nissan failed to properly account for heat transfer and produced a defective aluminum/plastic composite CSC that causes the system to overheat. Consequently, the clutch fluid boils and generates air that causes failure of the clutch pedal, such that it sticks to the floor and prevents a driver from shifting gears. A \"sticky\" clutch can make it difficult to control a vehicle's speed, presenting both safety and performance issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Nissan's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A consumer complaint submitted as evidence by Plaintiff indicates that the Class Vehicles began to malfunction as early as June 2007, while Nissan's own records identified the issue starting in October of that year. An internal Nissan report suggested that \"abnormal high-temperature [during] continued use of partial clutch engagement might be the cause.\" Emails exchanged between Nissan employees in 2012 further discussed the sticky clutch problem and its potential causes, and in July 2012, a Nissan project engineer wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This issue is great enough that it warrants a serious look by R&amp;D as to how we can improve the feel, and function of the clutch system. ... Customers are universally dissatisfied with the feel and performance of the system even when it is performing as designed. ... Combine\n   that with the frequent claims of clutch pedal sticking to floor and you've taken a dissatisfaction item and made it into a breakdown item. I think a wholesale approach to a whole new hydraulic system, including a new pedal, is warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff claims that \"[d]espite its investigations and testing, or even the change to a higher quality hydraulic fluid in the Class Vehicles, Nissan never informed consumers that the clutch system in the Class Vehicles had an inherent defect that made it prone to heat-related problems.\" In his complaint, Plaintiff asserted that if he and the other putative class members \"knew about these defects at the time of sale or lease, [they] would not have purchased or leased the Class Vehicles or would have paid less for them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's 2012 Nissan 370Z\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff purchased a new 2012 Nissan 370Z from an authorized Nissan dealer in Santa Clara County, California, as a college graduation present for his son, Michael. In March 2014, Michael was driving the 370Z on the freeway when the clutch pedal lost pressure and did not return to its depressed position; Michael had to pull over to the shoulder of the freeway and slow down until the clutch allowed him to shift into second gear. The Nissan dealership replaced the CSC at no charge because the vehicle was still under warranty. When a similar situation developed two years later, however, the 370Z was no longer under warranty, and so Plaintiff had the CSC replaced by an auto repair shop for $721.75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's first amended complaint alleged five causes of action against Nissan: (1) violations of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA); (2) violations of California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL); (3) breach of implied warranty pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Song-Beverly Act); (4) breach of implied warranty pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Magnuson-Moss Act); and (5) unjust enrichment. The district court granted in part Nissan's motion to dismiss, removing Plaintiff's UCL and unjust enrichment claims, and his request for injunctive relief under the CLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff moved for class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) (or, in the alternative, under Rule 23(c)(4) for liability only), seeking to certify (1) a class of \"[a]ll individuals in California who purchased or leased, from an authorized Nissan dealer, a new Nissan vehicle equipped with a FS6R31A manual transmission\"; and (2) a CLRA subclass of \"[a]ll members of the Class who are 'consumers' within the meaning of California Civil Code \u00a7 1761(d).\" Although Nissan opposed class certification for various reasons-including that Plaintiff was not an adequate class representative, that individual issues predominated due to the varying types of automobiles included in the Class Vehicles, and that Nissan's purported knowledge of the defect changed over the course of the class period-a major point of dispute, and the issue on which the district court's eventual order hinged, concerned Plaintiff's damages model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to Plaintiff, his \"damages model is based on the economic principle of benefit-of-the-bargain and is consistent with [his] theory of liability.\" Assuming that class members would have either paid less than sticker price or not purchased a defective vehicle at all had the nature of the clutch system been divulged by Nissan, Plaintiff seeks \"to recover the difference in value between the non-defective vehicles Nissan promised and the defective vehicles that were delivered based on the cost[ ] to\n   replace the composite CSC with one that is solid cast-aluminum.\" Nissan challenges this proposed damages model, citing the report of an expert who, in its words, \"rejected the notion that average-cost-of-repair represented the amount that informed consumers would discount the price of the [Class] Vehicles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court agreed with Nissan and denied Plaintiff's motion for class certification. It concluded that \"Plaintiff [ ] failed to satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3),\" based on what the court viewed as a \"problematic\" damages model. The court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the proposed benefit of the bargain model, damages are the difference between the value Nissan represented and the value class members received, measured at the time of purchase. However, the difference between value represented and value received only equals the cost to replace the defective CSC\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   consumers would have deemed the defective part valueless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (citation omitted). The court reasoned that, under Plaintiff's proposed model, if a class member \"derived value from the defective CSC-be it by selling it, repurposing it, or simply driving a ways before replacing it-the class member will have received the full benefit of the bargain\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the monetary value of the defective part. That is not an appropriate measure of damages.\" Because the record contained no evidence that the defective clutch was valueless-but\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   contain evidence to the contrary, since \"Plaintiff's vehicle was driven for approximately 26,629 miles before the original CSC malfunctioned\"-the court rejected Plaintiff's damages model as being an improper measure of the benefit of the bargain. Therefore, the district court concluded that Plaintiff could not satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We subsequently granted Plaintiff's timely petition for permission to appeal the denial of class certification pursuant to Rule 23(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and Rule 23(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamberlan v.

That allegation is susceptible to common proof regarding the design of the CSC, which is substantially the same for all Class Vehicles, and individual factors do not affect whether the Class [V]ehicles were sold with a defective CSC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (citation omitted). This characterization is crucial. Plaintiff's legal theory is not based on the\n   <em>\n    performance\n   </em>\n   of the allegedly defective clutch system, but instead\n   <em>\n    the system\n   </em>\n   itself, which he claims is defective. Had Plaintiff alleged that performance problems constituted the defect and caused his and the class members' injuries, then the benefit of the bargain would not be the appropriate measure of damages because, as the district court noted, class members might have received varying levels of value based on if and when they experienced a sticky clutch problem. But Plaintiff's theory is that Nissan knowingly designed a defective clutch system and did not inform consumers of the defect. His expert explained that the CSC \"is defectively designed because its wrought aluminum cylinder and plastic base assembly does not provide enough thermal conductivity to effectively transfer heat from the clutch components to the transmission front cover and surrounding air during clutch engagement.\" This allegedly defective clutch system \"is the same or substantially similar in all of the Class Vehicles.\" Accordingly, as Plaintiff argues, \"under [his] theory, the\n   <em>\n    defect\n   </em>\n   exists-and must be remedied-whether or not the\n   <em>\n    symptoms\n   </em>\n   have manifested yet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Both Nissan and the district court mischaracterized Plaintiff's theory as being centered on performance issues, rather than the defective system itself. Nissan argues that Plaintiff's \"model assumed that 100% of the vehicles would manifest a clutch assembly defect, and none of them would malfunction but for the design flaw.\" But this is not accurate; Plaintiff's theory is that the defect was inherent in each of the Class Vehicles at the time of purchase, regardless of when and if the defect manifested. He alleges that Nissan violated the CLRA because it knew about the defective clutch system and failed to disclose it at the point of sale, that \"a reasonable person would have considered [the fact of the alleged defect] to be important in deciding whether to purchase or lease Class Vehicles,\" and thus that Plaintiff and class members \"would not have purchased or leased Class Vehicles equipped with transmissions, or would have paid less for them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soule v.
