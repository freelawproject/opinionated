Such was the experience of James Andrews, who, after the dealership from which he bought a used car provided his personal information to Sirius XM Radio Inc. (Sirius XM), received unsolicited advertisements asking him to renew his radio subscription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The primary question before us is whether Sirius XM's use of personal information derived from Andrews's driver's license violated the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2725. Because we conclude that the DPPA does not apply where the source of personal information is a driver's license in the possession of its owner, rather than a state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Sirius XM. We also affirm the district court's denial of Andrews's motion to amend his complaint to add a claim under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 14, 2017, Andrews purchased a pre-owned 2012 Chevy Equinox from Auto Source, a small used car lot in Banning, California. He presented the dealership with his California driver's license, from which it obtained his name and PO Box address. He also filled out a California DMV Form 262-\"Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form\"-a multipurpose form that serves as an odometer disclosure, bill of sale, and power of attorney. On the Form 262, Andrews provided\n   his telephone number, street address, PO Box, and name. Auto Source input this information into its dealer management system (DMS), which ran on a database platform operated by a third party, AutoManager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Andrews's Equinox came equipped with Sirius XM radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service. Gail Berger, Sirius XM's Vice President of Auto Remarketing, attested that her company has agreements with thousands of automotive dealerships across the country pursuant to which Sirius XM offers trial subscriptions for pre-owned vehicles and, in return, dealers provide Sirius XM with the names and addresses of customers who purchase or lease XM-equipped vehicles. According to Berger, Auto Source enrolled in Sirius XM's pre-owned program in 2015. The terms of the agreement provided that Sirius XM \"requires the use of data that exists in [Auto Source's DMS], including customer data to activate [its] customers' SiriusXM Trial Service and to communicate with customers regarding their Trial Subscriptions and options to extend their SiriusXM services following the Trial Subscriptions.\" It also permitted Auto Source's DMS provider, AutoManager, \"to extract and share [its] DMS data with SiriusXM.\" A separate agreement between Sirius XM and AutoManager specified that this information included \"Customer Data.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Berger stated that, following Andrews's purchase, AutoManager provided Sirius XM with a record of the sale. This electronic record included his name and street address. According to a Sirius XM manager, however, Andrews's PO Box was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provided by AutoManager; instead, Sirius XM obtained that information through a separate contractor that used the U.S. Postal Service's National Change of Address database. Andrews asserted that he gave neither Auto Source nor anyone else permission to share his personal information with Sirius XM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Within days of Andrews's purchase, the deluge began. Sirius XM sent various letters to Andrews's PO Box between January and August 2017, imploring him-\"We Want You Back!\"-to resume his Sirius XM service after the subscription included with his car purchase ended. Sirius XM also telephoned him for the same purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 24, 2017, Andrews filed a putative class action complaint in the district court, alleging violations of the DPPA and seeking an injunction and statutory damages of $2,500 for each violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his complaint, Andrews-apparently unaware of the agreements between Auto Source, AutoManager, and Sirius XM pursuant to which his personal information was shared-alleged that Sirius XM \"obtained [his] name and address, as well as his phone number, from the motor vehicle records, most likely the registration documents submitted to the DMV after he purchased the car.\" Prior to filing its motion for summary judgment, Sirius XM's counsel explained to Andrews's counsel that, contrary to Andrews's allegations, it had obtained his personal information not from the DMV, but instead from Auto Source and the Change of Address database. Subsequently, Andrews moved to file an amended complaint to add a claim for violation of the CFAA, based on Sirius XM's access to Auto Source's DMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court granted Sirius XM's motion for summary judgment, and denied Andrews's motion to file an amended complaint. As to the DPPA claim, the court determined, \"[l]ike the Supreme Court and the vast majority of other courts to have analyzed the issue,\" that \"the DPPA's definition of 'motor vehicle record' [ ] requir[es]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   that the DMV be the source of the 'record.' \" Because the court found that Sirius XM obtained Andrews's personal information from his driver's license and the Form 262-neither of which, it determined, constituted a DMV record-it concluded that \"the undisputed facts establish that [Sirius XM] did not 'use' 'personal information' 'from a motor vehicle record,' \" and that Sirius XM was therefore entitled to summary judgment on the DPPA claim. Turning to Andrews's motion for leave to amend, the district court concluded that amendment would be futile because the proposed amended complaint \"fail[ed] to allege that he ha[d] suffered a 'loss' or 'damage' cognizable under the CFAA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DPPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Andrews contends that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Sirius XM, arguing that the company violated the DPPA's prohibition on using and disclosing personal information derived from DMV records when it obtained his name, address, and phone number from his driver's license and the Form 262. He urges us to \"issue a limited ruling holding that where a plaintiff can establish that a third party accessed a report (whether it be an accident report or dealership record of sales) containing information from a [driver's license] issued by a state DMV ... the plaintiff can state a claim for violation of the DPPA.\" We decline to adopt such a holding, and instead conclude that Sirius XM's conduct fell outside the scope of the DPPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Origins and Scope of the DPPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Congress enacted the DPPA in 1994, in response to a troubling phenomenon that occurred throughout the 1980s and early 1990s-state DMVs' practice of selling or freely disclosing drivers' personal information, which led to unfortunate consequences ranging from the trivial (onslaughts of random solicitations) to the tragic (the murders of several people by stalkers or ex-spouses).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 140 Cong.

Consistent with this primary objective, the first part of the DPPA expressly focuses on a state's own records.

Andrews's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To prevail on his DPPA claim, Andrews must satisfy \u00a7 2722(a) and prove that (1) Sirius XM knowingly obtained his personal information (2) from a motor vehicle record (3) for a nonpermissible use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Acxiom Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701478\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/325/#p335\">\n    612 F.3d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (5th Cir. 2010). The first and third elements are undisputed here: Sirius XM obtained and used Andrews's name and telephone number-\"personal information\" as defined by the DPPA-for nonpermissible promotional purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 2725(3). Accordingly, the key issue on appeal is whether the documents from which Sirius XM obtained Andrews's personal information-specifically, his driver's license and the Form 262-qualify as \"motor vehicle records\" pursuant to the statute. We conclude that they do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The DPPA defines a \"motor vehicle record\" as \"any record that pertains to a motor vehicle operator's permit, motor vehicle title, motor vehicle registration, or identification card issued by a department of motor vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2725(1). Sirius XM argues that \"a driver's license cannot qualify under that definition,\" citing to the district court's analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [A] driver license, although it contains \"personal information\" contained in the records of the DMV, is not itself a \"record\" \"contained in the records\" of the DMV. Nor does it make sense to include a driver license as a \"motor vehicle record\" when a \"motor vehicle record\" is defined as \"any record that pertains to a motor vehicle operator's permit.\" Interpreting the statute as [Andrews] suggests and construing a \"motor vehicle record\" to include a driver license would render the definition's use of both \"record\" and \"pertains to\" as surplusage because the driver license would be \"pertaining\" to itself and ignore the requirement that [it] also be a \"record.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We are not wholly persuaded by this linguistic analysis of the DPPA. Sirius XM argues, as the district court concluded, that \"construing a 'motor vehicle record' to include a driver license would render the definition's use of both 'record' and 'pertains to' as surplusage,\" but a \"record\" is defined as, among other things, \"[i]nformation that is inscribed on a tangible medium.\"\n   <em>\n    Record\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed. 2019);\n   <em>\n    see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1,898 (2002) (defining \"record\" as \"evidence, knowledge, or information remaining in permanent form (as a relic, inscription, document)\"). A driver's license is a tangible document that serves as proof of an individual's permission to operate a motor vehicle, and can therefore be considered a \"record.\" And, although Sirius XM raises a fair point as to whether \"pertains to\" would be rendered surplusage, it would make little practical sense that a photocopy of a driver's license-which is indisputably a \"record that pertains to a motor vehicle operator's permit\"-could be a qualifying motor vehicle record, but the actual license lying right next to it on the desk at the DMV, containing identical personal information, could not. We are therefore unconvinced that a driver's license is not a \"record\" based solely on the wording of the statute's definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But just because a driver's license is a \"record\" does not necessarily mean it is a \"\n   <em>\n    motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   record.\" Reading \u00a7 2722's words \"in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Aggrieved plaintiffs, Andrews included, might have other statutory remedies to rectify alleged abuses of their personal information. But the DPPA-a statute concerned solely with the actions of state DMVs and those who illicitly retrieve\n   information from them-is not the proper vehicle for such redress, where, as here, the source of that information is a driver's license in its owner's possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sirius XM correctly observes that \"[t]he DPPA was not designed to remedy every misuse of personal information that happened to come from a driver's license.\" Instead, its scope is limited to impermissible disclosures by state DMVs to those who seek information from them. Andrews concedes that neither Sirius XM nor anyone else requested or acquired his information from the California DMV.
