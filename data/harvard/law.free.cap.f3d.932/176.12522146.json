Consumers would generally smoke the spice, but Defendants packaged the product as \"incense\" and labeled it \"Not for human consumption.\" J.A. 633. In late March or early April 2012, Defendants began using the chemical additives XLR-11 and UR-144 in their manufactured spice.

Dr. Berrier would have opined that XLR-11 and JWH-018 are not substantially similar in chemical structure. While another DEA office, the Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section (\"DRE\") in the Office of Diversion Control, ultimately classifies controlled substance analogues, it regularly consults the OFS before making its decisions. As an OFS chemist, Dr. Berrier routinely analyzed synthetic substances\n   for the DRE and gave his opinion on their substantial similarity to controlled substances. In the spring of 2012, the DRE asked Dr. Berrier to compare UR-144 to JWH-018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He concluded that they are not substantially similar in chemical structure. But ultimately, after the charged events, the DRE determined that UR-144 and JWH-018 are substantially similar, making UR-144 a controlled substance analogue. The DEA formally added UR-144 and XLR-11 to the controlled substances drug schedule in 2013, after the alleged conspiracy ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants argued that Dr. Berrier's testimony was crucial to their case, as he was a DEA synthetic cannabinoid expert with a dissenting view-a view demonstrating that even highly-trained Government employees disagreed about the substantial similarity of XLR-11 and JWH-018. Indeed, one of the Government's expert witnesses at trial was Dr. Jordan Trecki, a pharmacologist in the DRE section of the DEA who testified about the effects and substantial similarity of XLR-11 to JWH-018. As discussed above, Defendants unsuccessfully sought to compel Dr. Berrier's testimony on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Barred from questioning Dr. Berrier, Defendants relied on the expert testimony of two chemistry professors, Drs. Croatt and Dudley, who gave the same opinion that Dr. Berrier would have given-an opinion that contradicted Dr. Trecki's. During cross-examination, the Government questioned Defendants' \"hired guns\" about the compensation they received for testifying. In convicting Defendants, the jury ultimately rejected Drs.

In particular, the court determined Dr. Berrier's testimony would have been cumulative because Drs. Croatt and Dudley gave the same opinion and used the same methods as Dr. Berrier. Because the jury had rejected the testifying experts' opinion, the district court held that Dr. Berrier's similar testimony would not have altered the trial's outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We can easily affirm the district court's decision on two of the components of materiality, as Dr. Berrier's testimony was indeed exculpatory and admissible. It was exculpatory because Defendants could have supported their case theory-that the substantial similarity of XLR-11 and JWH-018 was a difficult question-with evidence that even highly-trained DEA scientists disagreed about the answer. His testimony also would have been admissible because it was highly relevant and violated no Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But we disagree with the district court's analysis of the \"not merely cumulative\" component, as we conclude that Dr. Berrier's testimony was qualitatively different from the testimony of the other defense witnesses. In stark contrast to Drs. Croatt and Dudley, Dr. Berrier was not paid outside his DEA employment to form his opinion about XLR-11's chemical similarity to JWH-018. Nor would Defendants have paid him to testify at trial. Consequently, the Government could not have impeached Dr. Berrier in front of the jury for having a pecuniary motive for testifying. Dr. Berrier's inability to be impeached on that ground made his testimony\n   unique and particularly relevant, not cumulative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Westbrooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277574\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/659/#p666\">\n    849 F.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (6th Cir. 2017) (noting \"impeachment on the basis of pecuniary bias is fundamentally different\" from impeachment for other reasons).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Also unlike Drs. Croatt and Dudley, Dr. Berrier could have rebutted the testimony of Dr. Trecki, the Government's DEA expert, with his own knowledge of the DEA's processes and analyses. His expert testimony, which diverged from Dr. Trecki's, could have shown the jury that the DEA's own scientists could not agree on the substantial similarity of the chemicals at issue. Drs. Croatt and Dudley could not have provided that type of rebuttal testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   And finally, Dr. Berrier's testimony was material to the chemical structure issue because presenting it to the jury could reasonably have resulted in a different trial outcome. The jurors struggled to decide whether XLR-11 is substantially similar to JWH-018, as indicated by their note to the district court that they were \"basically hung on Count 1, substantially similar.\" J.A. 2048. That note prompted the court to issue an\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, after which the jury convicted Defendants. Had Defendants presented testimony from someone who opined on that very issue in the course of his duties at the DEA, the jury could have entertained reasonable doubt about whether XLR-11 and JWH-018 are substantially similar in chemical structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government asserts that any error in excluding Dr. Berrier was harmless and thus does not warrant reversal. Not so. A constitutional error is harmless only \"if it is 'clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For the reasons below, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Cosey's testimony and affirm that evidentiary ruling. With regard to McGee's and Ritchie's testimony, however, we vacate the district court's exclusion of that evidence and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Agent Cosey:\n   </em>\n   On July 25, 2012, law enforcement officers inspected Zencense's production warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. Agent Cosey did not participate in that \"raid,\" but heard about it and called Ritchie, who invited him to visit the Zencense facility on Burgess Road in Pensacola, Florida. Cosey met Ritchie there the next day. Ritchie showed him the facility, described the spice manufacturing and packaging process, identified the spice's chemical additives, and gave Cosey lab reports and spice samples. At one point Ritchie said to Cosey that \"if [Cosey] told [Ritchie] he was doing anything illegal, he would close it down that day.\" J.A. 2087. Cosey testified in his deposition that he did not know at that time whether the spice contained a controlled substance or analogue and he offered no opinion to Ritchie that what he was doing was either legal or illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Cosey and Ritchie met again in Pensacola on September 13. Along with other law enforcement officers, Cosey inspected a Zencense facility on Copter Road with Ritchie, who also met privately with Cosey and other officers and obliquely discussed the legality of his business. Ritchie said to them, \"I know if law enforcement wants to put somebody out of business that's not doing anything illegal, there's means to do it.\" J.A. 2101. He reiterated that selling Zencense's spice was \"not illegal,\" J.A. 2102, but told Cosey \"that if his products were made illegal, if those additives in his products were made illegal, that he would destroy the product right then and there.\" J.A. 2109-10. Cosey responded, \"If what you are producing and distributing is not a controlled substance, I cannot-law enforcement cannot and will not engage-or interfere in your, you know, ability to conduct commerce.\" J.A. 2101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The officers then drove to Zencense's Burgess Road location and Ritchie continued\n   his conversation with Cosey and the officers by asking, \"Am I going to continue to be looked at, targeted by law enforcement?\" J.A. 2106. Cosey responded, \"While what you are doing may be legal now, it could change in the future.\" J.A. 2106. He further explained, \"[J]ust because something is legal today doesn't mean it might not be illegal in the future, because the compounds are constantly-they are adding compounds to the banned list all the time.\" J.A. 2107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Before trial, Defendants sought, through a\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   request, to compel Cosey to testify about these conversations to establish the affirmative defense of entrapment by estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"662186\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/65/#p69\">\n    986 F.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"The defense of entrapment by estoppel is available when a government official tells the defendant that certain activity is legal, the defendant commits the activity in reasonable reliance on that advice, and prosecution for the conduct would be unfair.\"). The district court declined to compel Cosey's testimony, holding that the proffered evidence was insufficient to establish the entrapment by estoppel defense because the spice business had been in full swing for months when Ritchie first talked to Cosey. The court explained that the element of reasonable reliance was missing: \"[Y]ou cannot rely on something that happened seven months later to try to raise the suggestion that there was some reliance on something the government said ... when the illegal conduct is up and running seven months before.\" J.A. 356-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of this ruling, Defendants changed course and proffered the same testimony as general evidence that they lacked the mens rea required to violate the Analogue Act. They argued that on August 9, the date of the first charged spice shipment to Virginia, they believed distributing spice containing XLR-11 was legal because Cosey never told Ritchie on July 26 that doing so was illegal. The district court denied Defendants' alternate proffer as a \"backdoor way to circumvent the Court's ruling\" and reiterated that Cosey's testimony was inadmissible because he spoke to Ritchie after the spice enterprise was fully operational. J.A. 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We affirm the district court's exclusion of Cosey's testimony because it was irrelevant in two ways. First, Cosey never indicated that selling XLR-11 was legal. Each time Ritchie asked whether his business was lawful, Cosey responded noncommittally, saying things like, \"If what you are producing and distributing is not a controlled substance, ... law enforcement cannot and will not ... interfere in your ... ability to conduct commerce.\" J.A. 2101. Even Cosey's warning on September 13 that \"just because something is legal today doesn't mean it might not be illegal in the future,\" J.A. 2107, was not an affirmative statement that selling XLR-11 was currently legal. Nothing Cosey said to Defendants could reasonably support a reliance on an official representation that their actions were lawful, so Cosey's testimony could not reveal Defendants' mens rea on that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, Cosey's testimony is not probative of Defendants' mens rea because his conversations with Defendants were unrelated to the similarity of XLR-11 and JWH-018. As Cosey's September 13 conversation with Ritchie occurred after the August 9 shipment, it is irrelevant to showing Defendant's intent on August 9. But even the July 26 conversation, which followed months of Defendants' regular sales of spice with XLR-11 but preceded the August 9 shipment, would not have tended to negate Defendants' knowledge of substantial similarity on August 9. This is\n   because Cosey simply inspected the Zencense facilities and did not discuss the chemical structure or effects of XLR-11 or JWH-018 with Defendants on July 26. In fact, Cosey stated in his deposition that he could not verify Ritchie's description of the spice's contents on July 26 because he had not yet seen a DEA lab report on the substance. Therefore, Cosey did not know whether the spice contained XLR-11, and none of his comments to Defendants could have negated their knowledge of whether their spice additive was substantially similar to JWH-018. Cosey's proffered testimony is thus irrelevant, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 401(a) (noting that evidence is relevant if \"it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's exclusion of Cosey's irrelevant testimony. As any error in excluding it did not \"affect the outcome of [the] case,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.3d at 619, it was harmless, and we hold the district court did not violate Defendants' compulsory process rights by excluding Cosey from testifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Attorney McGee:\n   </em>\n   In late July or early August 2012, after federal officials began investigating Zencense, Defendants contacted Florida attorney David McGee to represent them. After conducting some preliminary research, McGee agreed to represent Defendants. They retained him on August 6, three days before the first charged shipment. At points during McGee's representation of Defendants, he consulted chemists about the chemical\n   structures of XLR-11 and JWH-018, and several chemists opined to him that the chemicals are not substantially similar. McGee kept Defendants apprised of his research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   After Defendants were indicted, McGee represented them in pretrial proceedings below. During a hearing on the propriety of McGee's joint representation of Defendants, the district court asked him whether Defendants intended to assert the affirmative defense of advice of counsel. McGee responded that they would not use that defense because he \"never\" advised them that selling XLR-11 was legal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   THE COURT: Well, you know, what are your main defenses in this case? I don't know whether you want to reveal your defense strategy-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   MR. McGEE: I have revealed my defense strategy to the government since January of 2013. It has not changed, it will not change. They know what our defense is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: .... Is one of the potential defenses that they acted pursuant to legal counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   MR. McGEE: Not Mr. Miller or myself. There is a possibility that one of the defenses will be another lawyer before us, not us, gave them advice with regard to the legality of these substances. It was not Mr. Miller, it was not myself ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   .... We have never given such advice and would not give such advice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Supp. J.A. 12-13. The district court ultimately disqualified McGee from jointly representing Defendants, and they each retained new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Yet when Defendants secured new counsel, one of the affirmative defenses raised was reliance on McGee's legal advice that XLR-11 was not substantially similar to JWH-018 because some chemists had reached that conclusion and told McGee. The district court prohibited Defendants from asserting that defense because they could not establish its three elements: sharing relevant facts with counsel, receiving legal advice based on those facts, and reasonably relying on that advice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321880\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/30/514/#p541\">\n    30 F. Supp. 3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541 (E.D. Va. 2014) (listing the defense's elements). The district court found that Defendants did not disclose all relevant facts to McGee because an Analogue Act distribution offense requires distribution of a product \"for human consumption,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McFadden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921136\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/217/#p223\">\n    823 F.3d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but Defendants labeled theirs \"[n]ot for human consumption,\" J.A. 633, and never told McGee consumers were smoking it. Further, Defendants \"consulted counsel\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   [they were] already engaged in selling spice ... with UR-144 and XLR-11 for human consumption,\" so they did not sell it in reliance on McGee's advice. Memorandum Order at 7, United States v. Ritchie, No. 4:15-cr-18-RAJ-LRL (E.D. Va. Oct. 3, 2016), ECF No. 462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   After the district court barred reliance on the advice of counsel defense, Defendants changed course again and offered McGee's testimony for the same purpose they alternatively proposed for Agent Cosey's. That is, outside of the affirmative defense, the same evidence was proffered as general evidence of Defendants' lack of mens rea in selling XLR-11. Defendants now represented McGee's discussions with the chemists as showing they relied on their attorney's belief that their August 9 spice shipment was legal because it did not contain a controlled substance analogue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The district court excluded McGee's testimony as hearsay, explaining that \"the state-of-mind exception [to hearsay] goes to the declarant and doesn't go to this defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 350. Moreover, the court\n   ruled, McGee's testimony, like Cosey's, was irrelevant because Defendants were already selling XLR-11 when McGee consulted the chemists. In the court's view, \"if the point is to show their state of mind at the time they commenced the criminal conduct, and the criminal conduct commenced before that hearsay statement took place in the first place,\" \"it would be irrelevant.\" J.A. 351.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We disagree with the district court. As we understand Defendants' argument, they sought to introduce McGee's testimony to show they had an innocent state of mind when shipping XLR-11 on August 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   If McGee timely transmitted to Defendants the chemists' opinions as they claim, his testimony was not irrelevant; rather, it could have been probative of Defendants' mens rea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   According to Defendants, they shipped XLR-11 on August 9 and throughout the alleged conspiracy in part because they relied on the research of chemical experts whose opinions McGee relayed. In Defendants' view, if McGee had consulted chemists who determined XLR-11\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   substantially similar to JWH-018, told Defendants about those opinions\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   August 9, and Defendants trusted those opinions, \"they would not have made their sale to [the retailer in Virginia] on August 8, 2012, or at any time thereafter.\" Opening Br. 43. We agree with Defendants that McGee's testimony about the chemists' opinions could be probative of their knowledge of the substantial similarity of XLR-11 and JWH-018 on August 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants' argument fails, of course, if McGee consulted chemical experts or reported his findings\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the August 9 shipment. If Defendants received information from McGee later, his testimony could not provide context for Defendants' state of mind at the time of the alleged crime. But the record is unclear about when McGee consulted the chemists and when or what he informed Defendants that he had learned, so we are unable to conclude on this record that his exclusion from trial was harmless. It is possible that McGee's testimony, if the jury believed it, could have affected the outcome of the case.\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.3d at 619. If so, the district court abused its discretion in excluding him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, we vacate the district court's exclusion of McGee's testimony and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Defendants must be allowed to develop the evidence on the narrow issue of when McGee consulted chemists about the similarity of XLR-11 and JWH-018 for Defendants' benefit, when McGee informed Defendants about the chemists' research, and what he told them. We note, however, that McGee's testimony, if a factual basis is established, shall be limited to the issue of the chemists' research and no other subject. Further, our holding is consistent with the rules of hearsay in that McGee can only relay the chemists' opinions if they are offered not for their truth, but solely for their effect on Defendants' state of mind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay to include only statements \"offer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement\"). McGee may testify as to\n   facts only. He may testify about his timely conversations with chemists and with Defendants, but he may not speculate as to what Defendants may have been thinking at the time of their alleged criminal acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Ritchie:\n   </em>\n   Finally, if allowed, Ritchie would have testified that he and Galecki shipped the spice on August 9 with an innocent state of mind because they consulted with attorneys-including McGee-and chemists and \"relied on [their advice] in going forward and operated under the assumption that [XLR-11 and JWH-018] were not substantially similar.\" J.A. 352. The district court excluded Ritchie's testimony as hearsay because others' statements could not reveal Ritchie's state of mind and the testimony did not fit into the state-of-mind hearsay exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(3). The court saw Defendants' maneuver as another \"backdoor\" attempt to inject evidence into the trial that did not meet the threshold for one of the unsupported affirmative defenses. J.A. 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   To the extent Ritchie's testimony about Defendants' state of mind on August 9 is based on his conversations with McGee, it similarly requires sufficient evidence regarding the content and timing of the consultation. As discussed above, if there is insufficient foundation shown on remand to permit McGee's testimony about the chemists he consulted, then Ritchie's testimony on this issue must also be excluded. Ritchie, of course, can still testify as to his own state of mind without reference to McGee. We therefore vacate the district court's exclusion of Ritchie's testimony on this point and remand for the district court to reexamine Ritchie's testimony in light of any further development of McGee's testimony, as limited above. As in McGee's testimony, any discussion of the chemists' opinions in Ritchie's testimony can only be offered for its effect on Defendants' state of mind and not for its truth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.
