The Fox does not develop or produce its own shows; rather, it provides a venue for traveling Broadway shows to perform. These traveling shows do not rehearse at the Fox for any length of time before performing. They simply arrive at the venue, set up their sets and equipment pursuant to their needs, and conduct multiple performances of the same production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2016, Maria Childress, a late-deafened adult, contacted the Fox and requested captioning for a performance of the musical\n   <em>\n    Rent\n   </em>\n   , scheduled for May 2017. Childress, while fluent in American Sign Language (ASL), prefers captioned shows to ASL-interpreted shows so that she can experience the writers' original dialogue and lyrics rather than an ASL interpreter's version. The Fox told Childress that it did not offer captioning and had no plans to do so in the future, but that Childress was welcome to attend a scheduled ASL-interpreted performance of the show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Childress and the Association of Late-Deafened Adults (ALDA) filed suit against Fox Associates under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in June 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She sought injunctive and declaratory relief, including mandated captions at all performances for which the Fox received a captioning request two weeks in advance, publicity that captions were available along with a way to request them, and sale of tickets to deaf and hard-of-hearing patrons by non-telephonic means. After Childress sued, the Fox offered to amend its policies and to offer a single prescheduled captioned performance of each Broadway production as long as a theater patron requested captions for a performance of that production two weeks in advance. To that end, the Fox provided a single scheduled captioned performance-a Saturday matinee-for each of six separate productions from May 2017 to January 2018. The Fox also began publicizing the availability of these performances and provided a means to request captioning and purchase tickets through its website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Childress was unable to attend the prescheduled captioned performance of\n   <em>\n    School of Rock\n   </em>\n   in January 2018, so the Fox provided a second captioned performance a week earlier. It notified Childress, however, that this second captioned performance was an exception to its policy and that future requests for additional captioned performances would not always be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Michele Westmaas, a season ticketholder and member of ALDA, requested that the Fox provide captioning at the remaining 2018 performance for which she had tickets, the Fox instead exchanged her tickets for tickets to the prescheduled captioned performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While Childress's initial request asked the Fox to provide open captioning, the Fox chose to provide closed captioning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It therefore purchased six electronic tablets that allow theater patrons to view captions during a performance. The tablets can be used from any seat in the theater. The Fox also offers device holders for these tablets so that patrons can view captions hands-free, but these holders can only be affixed to wheelchair-accessible seating due to fire hazards. Captions are generated and appear in real time so as to exactly duplicate what occurs onstage, including dialogue, song lyrics, and sound effects. Because every live performance is slightly different, a live, in-person court reporter must be present to transcribe captions for each performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the Fox's implementation of its single-captioned-performance policy, both parties moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that, because the ADA requires equal service, the Fox was required to offer captioning when requested, subject only to the ADA's \"undue burden\" affirmative defense. Because Fox Associates refused to provide financial information during discovery, stating that such information was irrelevant, and because the undue burden defense requires consideration of a defendant's financial state, the plaintiffs contended that Fox\n   Associates had waived the defense. Fox Associates argued that requiring captioning whenever it was requested was not a reasonable modification to the Fox's policies, practices, and procedures and that, because it provided captioning whenever the plaintiffs requested it, their claim for injunctive relief was moot. It further argued that it was not yet raising an undue burden argument and that this fact, alone, prevented a grant of summary judgment against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court found that the plaintiffs brought suit under the ADA's auxiliary aids and services requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iii), rather than the less-specific section addressing modification to \"policies, practices, and procedures,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(ii). It further found that failing to offer captioning at any performance where captions were requested \"results in deaf persons being excluded, denied services, or otherwise treated differently than other individuals merely because of the absence of [an auxiliary] aid. This failure violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iii).\"\n   <em>\n    Childress v.

Mo. Apr. 18, 2018). Fox Associates presented no argument regarding the undue burden defense and the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. It awarded them injunctive relief and, as relevant to this appeal, required the Fox to provide captioning whenever it received a request two weeks in advance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the grant of summary judgment in their favor, the plaintiffs moved for an award of attorney's fees, expenses, and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012205\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court granted the motion and calculated reasonable attorney's fees based on the lodestar method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

It reduced the requested amount of attorney's fees, however, based on its findings that the plaintiffs' attorney billed for clerical or secretarial work and expended time on matters irrelevant to the case as filed. The district court therefore granted the plaintiffs $97,920 in attorney's fees rather than their requested $100,845.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fox Associates now appeals, arguing that it provides deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals with meaningful access to its benefits and it should be allowed flexibility to consolidate multiple captioning requests into one performance because providing captions is expensive. Fox Associates further challenges the award of attorney's fees, arguing that the district court used an inflated hourly rate to calculate those fees, allowed the plaintiffs' counsel to bill for tasks he should not have included, and failed to reduce the fee award to account for the plaintiffs' partial success on their summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fox Associates first argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment for Appellees and failed to grant Fox Associates' summary judgment motion on Appellees' ADA claim. \"We review a district court's decision on cross-motions for summary judgment de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Thirty &amp; 141, L.P. v.

Appellees counter that deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals are guaranteed only one performance date while individuals without hearing impairments may choose from a broad range of performance dates. This discrepancy, Appellees argue, indicates that individuals with hearing impairments have less opportunity to receive the benefits the Fox provides, and that, therefore, the Fox denies them meaningful access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Fox provides its scheduled captioned performance during a Saturday matinee time slot for each Broadway production. Under the Fox's current policies, individuals with hearing impairments must attend that production in order to have access to captioning and therefore cannot, like their hearing-enabled counterparts, attend the theater during the week or in the evening. This excludes individuals with hearing impairments from \"the economic and social mainstream of American life[,]\" perpetuating the discrimination the ADA sought to address.\n   <em>\n    McGann v.

First, Fox Associates argues that it implemented all the remedies Appellees sought before the district court ruled in their favor, including offering captioned performances, publicizing those performances and providing a way to request\n   captioning, providing handheld captioning devices, and allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to obtain tickets through non-telephonic means. Fox Associates contends, therefore, that Appellees' counsel should only be compensated up until the date the Fox implemented those remedies. However, as Appellees correctly point out in their brief, the parties continued to fight over how many captioned performances the Fox needed to provide, nothing prevented the Fox from reverting to its previous policies, and ultimately the district court awarded nearly all the relief Appellees requested in their Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[I]n light of the substantial relief [Appellees] obtained,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to reduce its award of attorney's fees based on partial litigation success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Fox Associates argues that Appellees' requested hourly rate-$450-is unreasonable because it exceeds prevailing market rates and because Appellees' counsel does not charge his clients that much. We note first that Appellees' counsel does not charge his clients $450 an hour because he does not charge a set fee at all. Rather, he relies on the jurisdictions in which he practices to determine a fair market rate. Fox Associates does not address the fact that Appellees' counsel has over 30 years of practice experience, including 10 years of experience solely in ADA litigation involving individuals with hearing impairments. Nor does Fox Associates present any evidence that $450 is above the prevailing market rate for such an attorney in the St. Louis area. In fact, Fox Associates presents no evidence as to prevailing market rates in the St. Louis area other than the rates for its own attorneys. Because a district court is presumed to be familiar with the market rates in its jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266281\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/876/#p882\">\n    875 F.3d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and because Fox Associates has failed to present evidence that the market rate the district court chose is unreasonable, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting an hourly rate of $450.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Third and finally, Fox Associates argues that the district court should have reduced its fee award because Appellees' counsel impermissibly reconstructed time entries after the fact, billed an excessive number of hours, and impermissibly billed non-attorney work at the attorney rate. However, reconstructed time entries do not necessarily require a fee reduction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacDissi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535562\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/1054/#p1061\">\n    856 F.2d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the district court determined that the reconstructed entries, which dealt only with brief communications, satisfactorily documented the time. We agree. The district court conducted a thorough review of the time entries in this case and concluded that 5.7 hours of work were not compensable as either non-attorney work or unreasonably-expended hours. Fox Associates provides no evidence that the district court abused its discretion in failing to exclude more hours; indeed, Fox Associates does not even indicate how many hours it believes were excessive. Without more, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in failing to reduce its fee award further for inefficiency, and we uphold the district court's award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We affirm the district court's judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Honorable Catherine D.

Likewise, a litigation strategy can result in bad law leading to unforeseen consequences. I fear that may be the case here. For whatever reason, the Fox addressed only the question of meaningful access and failed to assert an undue burden defense at the summary judgment stage, even though the Fox says the cost of providing an in-person captioner at each performance is substantial. This has resulted in a decision that could undercut the meaningful access precedent of this circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Argenyi v.

And then, after litigation ensued, the Fox provided Childress with the specific accommodation she asked for, live captioning at one showing of each requested production. When Childress requested live captioning at a different showing, the Fox provided captioning at her requested showing. In fact, since their original compromise was reached, there is no evidence that any of the plaintiffs have been denied captioning at a requested showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Yet the court concludes that, although the Fox provides real time captioning from a live, in-person court reporter for at least one performance of every production at its theater and has demonstrated a willingness to work with patrons to accommodate requests for alternative dates, it must instead provide this service at\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   performance of every production in order to provide meaningful access. Childress expressly argued, and the court seemingly agrees, the Fox has no ability to limit the frequency of the live captioning services it provides. In my view, this conclusion effectively replaces the meaningful access test with an identical access standard. I also believe this conclusion improperly cabins arguments about what access qualifies as meaningful to the context of affirmative defenses even though the defenses test whether the auxiliary aid or service must be provided at all, not what level of access is meaningful.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710734\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/334/#p343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 451 n.3. It is the meaningful access analysis, not the undue burden standard, that determines whether it is necessary to provide a court reporter at every performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Fortunately for all concerned, advanced technology appears poised to moot this issue as a practical matter by making real time captioning of live performances inexpensive and routine. This does not, however, negate the legal problem. A legal standard requiring identical access in the context of auxiliary aids and services may have far-reaching unforeseen consequences in other contexts. Identical access would possibly require, for example, 24/7\n   sign language translation in hospitals as well as a myriad of other requirements. Such a result is not consistent with our meaningful access precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801146\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/494/#p499\">\n    625 F.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming district court's opinion rejecting the contention that \"an interpreter is mandated for every meeting\"). The benefit the Fox offers is the opportunity to attend traveling Broadway productions. Access to this benefit does not require live court reporters at each and every performance of every production in order to be meaningful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
