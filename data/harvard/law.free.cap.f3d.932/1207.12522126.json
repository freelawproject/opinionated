The Cupe\u00f1o\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Cupe\u00f1o are an Indian group originally from a village at Warner's Hot Springs, California (\"Warner's Ranch\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1851, the United States negotiated a treaty at the San Louis Rey Mission with several Indian tribes, including the Cupe\u00f1o. This treaty was never ratified. In 1865, the Office of Indian Affairs recommended that a reservation be made for the Cupe\u00f1o near Warner's Ranch, and a separate reservation be made for the San Luis Indians at Pala (the \"Pala,\" \"Luise\u00f1o,\" or \"Pala Luise\u00f1o,\" another tribe that was a party to the unratified treaty). Separate reservations were designated for the Pala Luise\u00f1o and the Cupe\u00f1o by an executive order of President Ulysses S. Grant in 1875. Five years later, President Rutherford B. Hayes issued an executive order canceling the order that had granted a reservation for the Cupe\u00f1o. Nevertheless, the Cupe\u00f1o continued to live on the land near Warner's Ranch throughout the late 1800s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Settlers later sought to quiet title to Warner's Ranch and succeeded in evicting the Cupe\u00f1o living there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker v.

Soon after, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land for the \"Mission Indians\" that had been residing at Warner's Ranch. The Secretary selected and purchased a tract adjacent to the Pala Luise\u00f1o where those Cupe\u00f1o Indians could live. These two tracts of reservation land are referred to as \"Pala.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Cupe\u00f1o and the Pala Luise\u00f1o did not integrate. Interior reports show that the \"Warner Ranch faction,\" i.e. the Cupe\u00f1o, demonstrated \"no desire or intention to affiliate with the resident local Indians.\" Census records show the U.S. government tracked the Cupe\u00f1o separately (as the \"Agua Caliente Tribe\") in at least one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act (\"Reorganization Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20984\">\n    48 Stat. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1934),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205101\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 29, \"which was intended in part to permit the tribes to set up legal structures designed to aid in self-government,\"\n   <em>\n    Kahawaiolaa v.

The Reorganization Act authorized any tribe to organize and \"adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws\" through a vote of the tribe's members and approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205123\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Reorganization Act did not apply to any reservation where a majority of the adult Indians voted against its application \"at a special election duly called by the Secretary of the Interior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 5125. Interior held a single election for the Indians residing on both tracts of the Pala Reservation-the Cupe\u00f1o and the Luise\u00f1o. The Indians overwhelmingly rejected the Reorganization Act. While the Indians residing at Pala considered themselves distinct, Interior considered it \"one reservation and no distinction [was] made between the lands acquired at different times.\" Some other federal government records from that period distinguish between the Cupe\u00f1o and the Luise\u00f1o at Pala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1959, the Indians at both tracts of Pala adopted Articles of Association to form one entity called the Pala Band of Mission Indians (\"PBMI\"). The PBMI included both the Cupe\u00f1o and the Luise\u00f1o at Pala. Even though they had voted against the Reorganization Act, the PBMI submitted their Articles of Association to Interior, and Interior approved them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1979, for the first time, Interior published a list of federally acknowledged Indian tribes in the Federal Register, and the list included the \"Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, Pala Reservation, California.\" Still, the federal government continued to acknowledge the distinct identities of the Cupe\u00f1o and the Luise\u00f1o at Pala in some other contexts, such as in a Federal Register notice regarding an archaeological site, and in the 2010 census.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the 1990s, the PBMI adopted a constitution, which Interior approved in 2000. The PBMI Constitution maintained the same membership requirements as the Articles of Association. One change from the Articles of Association to the PBMI Constitution allowed a six-member committee to amend or replace its existing enrollment ordinance with a new ordinance concerning membership and disenrollment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguayo v.

In 2011, the PBMI disenrolled approximately 150 members of Cupe\u00f1o descent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1220. Interior recommended against disenrollment but determined it could not intervene in the disenrollment decision and did not address the merits of the disenrollment decision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1220-21. Sixty-five of the disenrolled members brought suit in federal court, and we heard the case on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1221. We recognized that \"[t]ribal enrollment decisions are generally beyond the power of federal courts to review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1222. We agreed with Interior's hands-off approach,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1221, noting that, \"in the exercise of sovereignty and self-governance, tribes have the right, like other governments, to make good decisions, bad decisions, and decisions with which others may disagree,\" but that the federal government \"does not interfere in those decisions in the absence of specific authority to do so,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1229 (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2014, the Cupe\u00f1o resolved to withdraw from the PBMI and established their own constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2014, the PBMI requested that Interior list it as the \"Pala Band of Mission Indians of the Pala Reservation, California\" on all subsequent lists-in effect, the PBMI asked Interior to omit the word \"Luiseno\" from the PBMI's name on the Federal Register list.

The Claims Against Interior\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2014, the Cupe\u00f1o sent a letter to the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Indian Affairs enclosing the new Cupe\u00f1o Constitution and asking Interior \"to correct the 2015 list of federally-recognized Indian Tribes to reflect the independent sovereignty of the Agua Caliente Tribe of Cupe\u00f1o Indians of the Pala Reservation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Cupe\u00f1o sent a second letter to the Assistant Secretary in June 2015. In this letter, the Cupe\u00f1o argued that the PBMI is an \"association of tribes\" and \"not a federally-recognized tribe in its own right,\" and that it was administrative error not to include the Cupe\u00f1o on the Federal Register list. The Cupe\u00f1o again asked Interior to \"update the List of federally-recognized Indian tribes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Having received no response to their letters, the Cupe\u00f1o filed this suit in November 2015, seeking to compel the Assistant Secretary to respond to the request to correct or update the list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In February 2016, the Assistant Secretary denied the Cupe\u00f1o's request to be included on the recognized tribes list. In rejecting the request, the Assistant Secretary first noted a 2015 Policy Guidance that \"directs any unrecognized group requesting that the Department [of the Interior] acknowledge it as an Indian tribe, through reaffirmation or any other alternative basis, to petition under 25 CFR part 83.\" Second, the Assistant Secretary stated that the Cupe\u00f1o are distinct from other groups that have been \"reaffirmed\" outside of the regulatory process codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Part 83\" process), namely the Lower Lake Rancheria, the Ione Band of Miwok Indians, and the Tejon Tribe, because those groups established a pattern of dealings evidencing their long-standing and continuing governmental relationships with the United States. In particular, the fact that the Cupe\u00f1o resolved to withdraw from the PBMI and dissociate from the Pala Luise\u00f1o is a \"major distinction.\" The Assistant Secretary further explained that \"the people now seeking Federal recognition as the Agua Caliente Tribe of the Cupe\u00f1o Indians of the Pala Reservation are, or were until recently, members of the Pala Band of Mission Indians, a federally recognized tribe.\" The Assistant Secretary directed the Cupe\u00f1o \"to exhaust administrative remedies by proceeding through the Part 83 process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Cupe\u00f1o amended the complaint to seek an order reversing the Assistant Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted the Assistant Secretary's motion and ruled that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case or to compel Interior to correct the federally recognized Indian tribe list to add the Cupe\u00f1o. The district court recognized that Part 83 is a mandatory process, and the Cupe\u00f1o had failed to exhaust it. The district court stated that, outside of the Part 83 process, any recognition of an Indian tribe is a political question. The district court further concluded that Interior provided a rational explanation for why it made exceptions to the Part 83 process for three tribes but not for the Cupe\u00f1o because, until recently, the Cupe\u00f1o had received the benefits and services of membership in another federally recognized tribe, and they could not show they were treated as a separately recognized tribe.

First, Interior \"clarif[ied]\" the status of the Ione and announced that the Ione would be included on the list in 1994. Prior to 1995, the United States did not set aside land for the Ione, although it did attempt to purchase land for the Ione in the 1910s, the 1920s, and 1941, and announced an intention to hold land in trust for the Ione in 1972.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, Interior \"reaffirm[ed] Federal recognition of Lower Lake in 2000.\" The United States had purchased land for the Lower Lake Rancheria in 1916, attempted to purchase additional land for the tribe in 1935, and granted an assignment of land to the Lower Lake Rancheria in 1947. At the same time that Interior records characterized the Lower Lake Rancheria as \"terminated,\" Indian persons from the Lower Lake Rancheria lineal descent continued to assert their identity as a tribe and obtained funding from federal government agencies to research their tribal status and develop a tribal constitution, suggesting that the termination status was an error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   When adding the Lower Lake Rancheria to the list, the Assistant Secretary emphasized the \"long-standing governmental relationship\" of the Lower Lake Rancheria in contrast to \"groups that had previously been acknowledged, but whose relationship with the Federal Government had not continued to exist [and who] were subject to the acknowledgment process.\" Thus, a tribe whose relationship with the United States was \"continuous\" might avoid Part 83, and one whose relationship had \"lapsed\" or \"administratively terminated\" needed to petition through Part 83. According to Interior, both the Ione and the Lower Lake Rancheria decisions \"found some evidence of continuing Federal recognition in documentation of a relationship with the Federal Government near the time of the publication of the first list of federally recognized tribes in 1979.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Third, in 2011, the Assistant Secretary began to include the Tejon on the list. In 1851, the Tejon and the United States entered into a treaty. In 1873, a reservation was established by executive order for the Tejon and other bands of Indians. Not all of the Tejon moved to the reservation, and the federal government continued to try to secure lands for the Tejon in three ways: by purchasing land (through the 1930s); through litigation (1920-24); and by securing public lands (in 1916). In the 1960s and 1970s, Interior responded to U.S. Senate inquiries about the Tejon and explained that tribal members could remain on public lands for nominal rent. Again, the Assistant Secretary explained the listing as a product of an ongoing government-to-government relationship that had never lapsed or been terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Just as the Cupe\u00f1o seek exception to the Part 83 process by analogy to those three tribes, so did the Muwekma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Muwekma petitioned to be recognized and listed as a federally recognized tribe.\n   <em>\n    Muwekma Ohlone Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662139,3542167\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/209/\">\n    708 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, Interior denied the petition.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Muwekma then sued in federal court, where the \"principal claim was that Interior denied Muwekma equal protection by requiring Muwekma to proceed under the Part 83 process despite summarily recognizing two other Indian tribes-the Ione [ ] and the Lower Lake Rancheria [ ]-outside the Part 83 process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 214 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 215 (noting that this claim was brought as an equal protection and an APA claim). At the outset of the litigation, the district court required Interior to supplement the record with a detailed explanation of why it did not waive the Part 83 process for the Muwekma.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After Interior provided that explanation, the district court granted summary judgment for Interior,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 215, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 223. The courts recognized that the Ione and the Lower Lake Rancheria \"had multiple post-1927 government-to-government interactions with the United States,\" whereas the Muwekma did not.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 216. Applying rational basis review, the D.C. Circuit held that Interior had \"adequately explained why Muwekma is not similarly situated to Ione or Lower Lake,\" and therefore the Muwekma's equal protection claim failed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 217.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the present case, the Assistant Secretary explained the differential treatment of the Cupe\u00f1o from the Ione, the Lower Lake Rancheria, and the Tejon as follows: (1) \"In each of those reaffirmations, the group established 'a pattern of dealing with the [group] which evidences [its] long-standing and continuing governmental relationship with the United States' \"; and, (2) the \"major distinction\" that \"the people now seeking Federal recognition as the Agua Caliente Tribe of the Cupe\u00f1o Indians of the Pala Reservation are, or were until recently, members of the Pala Band of Mission Indians, a federally recognized tribe,\" whereas none of the other reaffirmed tribes claimed to be withdrawing or dissociating from a federally recognized tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The first \"pattern of dealing\" distinction is not elaborated upon in the Assistant Secretary's letter. The Cupe\u00f1o highlight that they, too, had early treaty and land negotiations with the United States, and have continued to be denoted separately in census and archaeological records. This is not, however, the Assistant Secretary's only explanation for the differential treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The second \"withdrawing or dissociating from a federal recognized tribe\" distinction satisfies rational basis review. The Ione, the Lower Lake Rancheria, and the Tejon had not in any way separated from a federally recognized tribe. The Cupe\u00f1o, in contrast, did have a recent association with the PBMI. In a 2014 resolution, the Cupe\u00f1o \"immediately withdr[e]w from the Association known as the Pala Band of Mission Indians and the constitutional entity known as the Pala Band of Mission Indians, Pala Band of Luise\u00f1o Mission Indians of the Pala Reservation, California.\" The Cupe\u00f1o's reply brief concedes this distinction from the Ione, the Lower Lake Rancheria, and the Tejon, stating that between the publication of the first list in 1979 and the PBMI's recent disenrollment decisions, \"the Cupe\u00f1o enjoyed the benefits of an active federal relationship that Ione, Lower Lake, and Tejon did not enjoy during their own periods of absence from the List.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There are specific Part 83 regulations for previously recognized tribes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083.12\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and for a tribe that is \"[a] splinter group, political faction, community, or entity of any character that separates from the main body of a currently federally recognized Indian tribe,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 83.4(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 83.11(f). The word \"splinter\" may be misleading or carry unfortunate negative connotations, especially if, as the record suggests, two historically distinct tribal entities had been recognized as one, the PBMI. Additional language in the regulation about the\n   <em>\n    perceptions\n   </em>\n   of a tribe's associations with a federally recognized Indian tribe is particularly poignant here. The section 83.11(f) regulations are for separated groups that \"some have regarded ... as part of or associated in some manner with a federally recognized Indian tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 83.4(b). This highlights the tension between federal recognition-which must be determined by the federal government-and inherent tribal sovereignty. Nonetheless, it is rational for Interior to ask the Cupe\u00f1o to demonstrate through the Part 83 process how they are a \"distinct community\" from the PBMI and \"politically autonomous\" so that Interior may make that federal-recognition determination.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 83.11(b), (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, it is not inconsistent for Interior to change the name of the PBMI in the Federal Register upon written request. The PBMI has been federally recognized since 1979. While the Secretary of Interior had approved the PBMI Constitution, which identified the tribe as the \"Pala Band of Mission Indians,\" decades earlier, it listed them as the \"Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians\" in the Federal Register. Not requiring a recognized and listed tribe to pursue a formal regulatory process for a name change-to what its name already was in the Secretary-approved tribal constitution-does not make Interior's present requirement that the Cupe\u00f1o follow the regulatory process irrational.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Interior's explanation for treating the Cupe\u00f1o differently from the Ione, the Lower Lake Rancheria, and the Tejon, and requiring the Cupe\u00f1o to adhere to the administrative process for federal recognition because many of the Cupe\u00f1o were recently members of the PBMI, passes muster. We agree with the district court that Interior had a rational basis for not making an exception to the Part 83 process for the Cupe\u00f1o.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Although the political-question doctrine was cited by the district court in its oral ruling, the Assistant Secretary does not argue that it applies.

At present, however, the federal government has an administrative process by which tribes may petition for and receive federal recognition. Where the Cupe\u00f1o have not pursued that process, and Interior has rationally distinguished the Cupe\u00f1o from the other tribes that were listed outside of that process, we cannot order Interior to add the Cupe\u00f1o to the list of federally recognized tribes published in the Federal Register.
