Plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201531\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Navajo Transitional Energy Company (\"NTEC\"), a corporation wholly owned by the Navajo Nation that owns the mine in question, intervened in the action for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 19 and 12(b)(7). NTEC argued that it was a required\n   party but that it could not be joined due to tribal sovereign immunity, and that the lawsuit could not proceed without it. The district court agreed with NTEC and dismissed the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Navajo Mine (\"Mine\") is a 33,000-acre strip mine. It produces coal from which the Four Corners Power Plant (\"Power Plant\") generates electricity. The Mine and Power Plant are both on tribal land of the Navajo Nation within New Mexico. The Mine operates pursuant to a surface mining permit issued by the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (\"OSMRE\") under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Transmission lines that distribute electricity from the Power Plant run west into Arizona through lands reserved to the Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe. The Mine, Power Plant, and transmission lines were built in tandem and have operated since the early 1960s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Navajo Nation is a federally recognized Indian tribe with its seat of government in Arizona and territory spanning areas of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. For many years, the Navajo Nation granted a coal mining lease to BHP Billiton Navajo Coal Company (\"BHP Billiton\"), a private company that owned and operated the Mine. In 2013, the Navajo Nation Council created the Navajo Transitional Energy Company (again, \"NTEC\") for the purpose of purchasing the Mine from BHP Billiton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Power Plant is owned by several utility companies, including Public Service Company of New Mexico, Tucson Electric Company, Salt River Project, and Intervenor-Defendant Arizona Public Service Company (\"APS\"). APS operates the Power Plant on behalf of all co-owners subject to a lease agreement, originally executed in 1960, with the Navajo Nation. Under the agreement, the Mine sells coal exclusively to the Power Plant, and the Power Plant buys its coal exclusively from the Mine. The Navajo Nation also authorizes easements for rights-of-way over Navajo lands for the Power Plant, and both the Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe authorize easements for rights-of-way for power transmission lines that cross tribal lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Mine and the Power Plant are key sources of revenue for the Navajo Nation. Under the federally approved leases and permits that are at issue in this case, operations at the Mine and the Power Plant are expected to generate between 40 and 60 million dollars per year in revenue for the Navajo Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This lawsuit stems from changes and renewals to the lease agreements, rights-of-way, and government-issued permits under which the Mine and Power Plant operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, APS and the Navajo Nation amended the lease governing Power Plant operations, including by extending the term of the lease through 2041. BHP Billiton\n   (which at the time still owned the Mine) then sought a renewal of the existing surface mining permit for the Mine and a new surface mining permit that would allow operations to move to an additional area within the Mine lease area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The lease amendment and accompanying rights-of-way could not go into effect, and the surface mining permits could not be granted, without approvals from several bureaus within the Department of the Interior. First, OSMRE needed to approve the surface mining permits. Second, approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") was required to effectuate the lease amendment. Third, BIA had ultimate responsibility to grant the associated rights-of-way for the Power Plant facilities and transmission lines that the tribes had approved. Finally, approval of the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") was required to ensure adequate resource recovery and protection on the tribal lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   OSMRE took the lead on considering the approval requests for the Mine. It cooperated with BIA and BLM, as well as with two additional bureaus within the Department of the Interior: the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service (\"Fish and Wildlife\"). OSMRE also coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Navajo Nation, and the Hopi Tribe on the review process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   OSMRE engaged in formal consultation with Fish and Wildlife, as required by the ESA when a project \"may affect listed species or critical habitat.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In April 2015, Fish and Wildlife completed formal consultation and issued a Biological Opinion concluding that the proposed action would not jeopardize the continued existence of any of the threatened and endangered species evaluated. Relying on Fish and Wildlife's assessments in the Biological Opinion, OSMRE produced an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") in May 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   OSMRE and BIA issued a Record of Decision in July 2015, which included the approvals by OSMRE, BIA, and BLM necessary for the continued operation and expansion of the Mine. The Deputy Secretary of the Interior approved the decisions of each of these bureaus within the Department of the Interior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since obtaining the required permits and approvals, APS and NTEC have made significant financial investments in the Power Plant and Mine, including by implementing conservation measures required by the Record of Decision. NTEC also moved mining operations into the areas designated in the new surface mining permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, NTEC secured a new $ 115 million line of credit in July 2016 that paid off the original note with which NTEC had purchased the Mine, and that provided additional capital. This line of credit is secured by, among other things, the Mine itself as an asset of NTEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In April 2016, the plaintiff conservation organizations sued BIA, OSMRE, BLM, Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of the Interior, along with its Secretary (collectively, \"Federal Defendants\"). Plaintiffs\n   challenged the opinions and approvals that authorized continued operations at the Mine and the Power Plant. Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that Fish and Wildlife's Biological Opinion violated the requirements of the ESA, and that BIA, OSMRE, and BLM violated the ESA by relying on the faulty Biological Opinion in deciding to approve the activities at issue. Plaintiffs also alleged that Federal Defendants violated NEPA by crafting an unlawfully narrow statement of purpose and need for the project in the EIS, failing to consider reasonable alternatives, and failing to take the requisite \"hard look\" at various impacts of the mining complex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

NTEC also sought to intervene in the action for the limited purpose of filing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 19 and 12(b)(7). The court granted NTEC's motion to intervene as a matter of right as owner of the Mine, and NTEC then moved to dismiss. NTEC asserted that it was a required party because of its economic interest in the Mine, that it could not be joined due to tribal sovereign immunity, and that the action could not proceed in its absence. Even though dismissal would have left their decisions intact, Federal Defendants opposed NTEC's motion to dismiss, arguing that the federal government was the only party required to defend an action seeking to enforce compliance with NEPA and the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court granted NTEC's motion to dismiss. The court concluded that NTEC had a legally protected interest in the subject matter of this suit, because the \"relief Plaintiffs seek could directly affect the Navajo Nation (acting through its corporation, Intervenor-Defendant NTEC) by disrupting its 'interests in [its] lease agreements and the ability to obtain the bargained-for royalties and jobs.' \" The court held that Federal Defendants could not adequately represent NTEC's interest in the litigation, because although the agencies had an interest in defending their analyses and decisions, \"NTEC's interests in the outcome of this case far exceed\" those of the agencies. The court observed that, although NTEC's interests were\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   aligned with those of Federal Defendants, there could be a \"later divergence of interests\" during the course of the litigation. The court further concluded that NTEC could not be joined due to the Navajo Nation's sovereign immunity, and that the litigation could not, \"in equity and good conscience,\" continue in NTEC's absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs timely appealed, arguing that NTEC did not have a legally protected interest in Federal Defendants' compliance with environmental laws; that even if NTEC did have such an interest, Federal Defendants would adequately represent that interest; and that even if NTEC were a required party, the litigation could continue in its absence under the \"public\n   rights exception\" to traditional joinder rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We review a \"district court's decision to dismiss [an] action for failure to join\" a required party for abuse of discretion, but we review its underlying legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    Paiute-Shoshone Indians of Bishop Cmty. of Bishop Colony, Cal. v.

Although Plaintiffs' challenge is to Federal Defendants' NEPA and ESA processes (rather than to anything that NTEC has done), it does not relate only to the agencies' future administrative process, but instead may have retroactive effects on approvals already granted for mining operations. If Plaintiffs succeeded in their challenge and the agency actions were vacated, NTEC's interest in the existing lease, rights-of-way, and surface mining permits would be impaired.

Although Federal Defendants have an interest in defending their decisions, their overriding interest, as it was in\n   <em>\n    Manygoats\n   </em>\n   , must be in complying with environmental laws such as NEPA and the ESA. This interest differs in a meaningful sense from NTEC's and the Navajo Nation's sovereign interest in ensuring that the Mine and Power Plant continue to operate and provide profits to the Navajo Nation. If the district court were to hold that NEPA or the ESA required more analysis that would delay mining activities, or that one of the federal agencies' analyses underlying the approval was flawed, Federal Defendants' interest might diverge from that of NTEC. As we suggested in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , a holding that one or both of these statutes required something other than what Federal Defendants have interpreted them to require could similarly change Federal Defendants' planned actions, affecting the lease, rights-of-way, and permits at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Southwest\n   </em>\n   , because while Federal Defendants have an interest in defending their own analyses that formed the basis of the approvals at issue, here they do not share an interest in the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of the approvals-the continued operation of the Mine and Power Plant. And no party in\n   <em>\n    Southwest\n   </em>\n   had explained how the tribe's \"sovereignty would be implicated,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540690\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1152/\">\n    150 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as the Navajo Nation has explained here. This case is also distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Alto\n   </em>\n   , where the tribe had specifically granted BIA final decisionmaking authority over tribal membership issues, making it more plausible that the government would represent the tribe's interest-or that the government's interest and the tribe's interest had become one and the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs resist the conclusion that no existing party can adequately represent NTEC's interest, arguing that APS, as operator and part owner of the Power Plant, can do so even if Federal Defendants cannot. In\n   <em>\n    Southwest\n   </em>\n   , we noted that the presence of other cities that were financially invested in, and dependent for their water supply upon, the facility lessened\n   the risk that the Community's interest would be impaired. Here, APS shares at least some of NTEC's and the Navajo Nation's financial interest in the outcome of the case. But APS does not share the Navajo Nation's\n   <em>\n    sovereign\n   </em>\n   interest in controlling its own resources, and in the continued operation of the Mine and Power Plant and the financial support that such operation provides. The Navajo Nation's interest is tied to its very ability to govern itself, sustain itself financially, and make decisions about its own natural resources. Because no other party to the litigation can adequately represent these interests, the district court did not err in determining that NTEC is a party that must be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rule 19 requires us next to ask whether NTEC can feasibly be joined as a party to this litigation.

Although relief could be shaped to avoid prejudice in the short term, such as by remanding for further administrative review without vacating the permits and approval decisions in the meantime, the Navajo Nation inevitably would be prejudiced if Plaintiffs ultimately succeeded and if, after further NEPA and ESA processes, Federal Defendants were not able to come to the same decisions without imposing new restrictions or requirements on the Mine or Power Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The third factor, on the other hand, weighs against dismissal.
