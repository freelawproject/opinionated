North Dakota requires a voter to present a specific form of identification at the polls before receiving a ballot. That identification\n   must provide, among other things, the voter's current residential street address. If a voter's identification is missing the required information, or if the information provided is not current, a voter may supplement with certain documents. Six plaintiffs sued the North Dakota Secretary of State, alleging that the provisions place an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote of many Native Americans. The district court agreed and enjoined the Secretary from enforcing certain statutory requirements statewide. The Secretary appealed. We conclude that the alleged burdens do not justify a statewide injunction, and we therefore vacate the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   North Dakota has no voter registration requirement, so a resident may appear at the polls on election day and cast a ballot without any previous expression of desire to vote. Election officials at the polls are charged with determining whether a person who appears is qualified to vote. Before 2013, voters could establish their qualifications by using certain forms of identification. If a voter could not present proper identification, the voter was nonetheless permitted to cast a ballot after swearing an affidavit or upon vouching by a poll worker. In 2013, the North Dakota legislature enacted HB 1332. That law limited the types of acceptable identification and eliminated the affidavit and vouching options. The legislature further limited the list of acceptable forms of identification in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The six appellees in this case originally filed suit in January 2016. Each plaintiff-appellee is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and a resident of North Dakota. The plaintiffs alleged that the voter identification requirements violated the Constitution of the United States and the North Dakota Constitution, as well as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. On August 1, 2016, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Citing statistical evidence, the court determined that the identification requirements imposed \" 'excessively burdensome requirements' on Native American voters in North Dakota\" that outweighed the State's asserted interests. The court concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their federal constitutional claim and did not consider state law or the Voting Rights Act. The court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the identification requirements statewide and required the Secretary to offer an affidavit alternative when a voter lacked proper identification. The Secretary did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The North Dakota legislature then modified the State's voting requirements once more. Effective August 1, 2017, the current provision requires qualified voters to provide \"a valid form of identification\" before receiving a ballot.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.1-01-04\">\n    N.D.

If a voter's identification lacks any of those three items, the voter may still cast a ballot if she can provide the missing information\n   using one of several supplemental documents: a current utility bill, a current bank statement, a check issued by a federal, state, or local government, a paycheck, or a document issued by a federal, state, or local government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.1-01-04\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(3)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A prospective voter who cannot provide a valid form of identification at the polls may mark a ballot that is set aside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016.1-01-04\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(5).

The Secretary moved to dissolve the August 2016 injunction in light of the intervening change in law; the plaintiffs moved for a second preliminary injunction. The district court granted both motions, dissolving the August 2016 injunction as \"moot\" and enjoining the Secretary from enforcing parts of the current North Dakota provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing three statutory requirements. First, the court forbade the Secretary to enforce the requirement of \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(2)(b) that a voter produce identification or a supplemental document with a \"[c]urrent residential street address.\" The court ordered the Secretary also to accept \"another form of identification that includes either a 'current residential street address' or a current mailing address (P.O. Box or other address) in North Dakota.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, the district court ordered the Secretary to accept as a valid form of identification under \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(3)(a)(2) \"an official form of identification issued by a tribal government; the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), any other tribal agency or entity, or any other document, letter, writing, enrollment card, or other form of tribal identification issued by a tribal authority,\" so long as it sets forth the voter's name, date of birth, and current residential street address or mailing address. The court noted that the Secretary already had interpreted the provision to allow these other forms of identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Third, the district court ordered the Secretary to accept as valid supplemental documents under \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(3)(b)(5) \"any documents issued by a tribal government, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), other tribal agencies or authorities,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   any other document, letter, writing, enrollment card, or other forms of tribal identification which provide the missing or outdated information.\" The court said that the Secretary was already accepting these documents too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In support of the residential street address portion of the injunction, the district court said the Secretary had acknowledged that Native American communities often lack residential street addresses. And, the court explained, \"\n   <em>\n    under current State law an individual who does not have a 'current residential street address' will never be qualified to vote\n   </em>\n   .\" The court thus thought the residential street address requirement was a \"clear 'legal obstacle' inhibiting the opportunity to vote.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court relied on statistical evidence to support the portions of the injunction expanding the acceptable valid forms of identification and supplemental documents. The court found that 4,998 otherwise eligible Native Americans (and 64,618 non-Native voters) did not possess a qualifying identification. The court cited evidence that 65.6% of those Native Americans also were missing at least one of the underlying documents needed to obtain a\n   valid identification from the State. And the Court found that 48.7% of Native Americans who lack a qualifying identification also lacked \"the supplemental documentation needed,\" such that 2,305 Native Americans would not be able to vote in 2018 under the North Dakota statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Secretary appealed, arguing that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the residential street address requirement, that the other two portions of the district court's injunction were unnecessary, and that the statewide injunction was improper because the plaintiffs had not established that the statute was invalid on its face. We granted the Secretary's motion for a stay of the residential street address portion of the district court's order pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    Brakebill v.

In reviewing the issuance of a preliminary injunction, we consider the threat of irreparable harm to the movant, the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits, the balance between the harm to the movant and injury that an injunction would inflict on other parties, and the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Dataphase Sys., Inc. v.

The dispute here turns on the district court's legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Secretary's first contention is that none of the six plaintiffs has Article III standing to challenge the statute's requirement that a voter provide a current residential street address. The plaintiffs, as the parties invoking federal jurisdiction, bear the burden of establishing standing.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560, 561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The Secretary posits that because each of the six plaintiffs has a residential street address, the statute has not caused any of them to suffer an injury in fact. The district court thought the Secretary had \"raised some legitimate concerns,\" but concluded that \"[t]he burden of having to obtain and produce an ID itself has been found sufficient to confer standing, regardless of whether the Plaintiffs are able to obtain an ID.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684374\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1340/#p1351\">\n    554 F.3d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1351 (11th Cir. 2009). The court reasoned that all of the plaintiffs were injured in fact by \"the requirement to maintain a 'current residential street address,' and thus an interest in real property, and the burden to maintain an ID or supplemental documents to prove he or she has a 'current residential street address.' \" The Secretary counters that nothing prevents these plaintiffs from voting either with the tribal identifications they already possess or with new tribal identifications listing their current residential street addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We conclude that at least one of the plaintiffs has standing to raise a facial challenge to the statute. It is true that all six plaintiffs have residential street addresses, but the statute at issue does not merely require a citizen to maintain a residential street address. The statute requires a voter to present a valid form of identification or a supplemental document that \"provide[s]\" a current residential street address. N.D. Cent. Code Ann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00a7 16.1-01-04.1(2). Even where a person has a residential street address, the burden of obtaining a qualifying identification or supplemental document is sufficient to constitute an injury that gives a citizen standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    Common Cause/Ga.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684374\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1340/#p1351\">\n    554 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, plaintiff Elvis Norquay presented evidence that when the amended complaint was filed, he lived at a homeless apartment complex in Dunseith, but that his tribal identification listed a \"prior\" address in Belcourt. To vote in the precinct where he currently resides, therefore, Norquay must either obtain a new form of identification with his current residential street address or a supplemental document that includes his current address. The Secretary contends that Norquay can vote either in his current precinct by making a copy of his utility bill, or in his former precinct by mail. Neither option, the Secretary argues, would place a severe burden on Norquay's right to vote. But the severity of the burden is a question relating to the merits, not to Norquay's standing to bring this action. Norquay is injured by the residential street address requirement because he must secure a new form of identification or a supplemental document, and obtaining either would require Norquay to expend time and resources. That burden is sufficient to give him standing to challenge the residential street address requirement and the two other disputed provisions. The option for Norquay to mail a ballot to a precinct where he lived at an earlier date does not eliminate injury, because Norquay is harmed by an inability to vote for representation in the precinct where he currently resides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the merits, the Secretary argues that the district court's statewide injunction was improper because the plaintiffs have not mounted a successful facial challenge to any part of the statute. The Secretary also contends that the court's order expanding acceptable valid forms of identification and supplemental documents was unnecessary, because the Secretary was already interpreting the statute to permit those other forms of identification and documents. The plaintiffs respond that the residential street address requirement is unconstitutional on its face, and that statewide relief was appropriate in any event on their as-applied claims. We consider the three challenged portions of the statute in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We conclude first that the plaintiffs' facial challenge to the residential street address requirement likely fails, and that the statewide injunction as to that provision cannot be justified as a form of as-applied relief.

A voter may reside at a street address without having an interest in the property where he resides: Elvis Norquay himself resides at a homeless shelter with a street address. And young adults living with parents and elderly parents living with children need not have an\n   interest in property. All that is required is that a voter show where he or she resides. The residential street address requirement furthers North Dakota's legitimate interest in preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence, so unlike a poll tax, it is not invidiously \"unrelated to voter qualifications.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 189,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p200\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Stevens, J.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs next contend that the district court's statewide injunction was appropriate because the residential street address requirement places severe burdens on some Native Americans' right to vote. The district court thought the requirement posed an impermissible legal obstacle because Native American communities often lack residential street addresses. The Secretary disputes whether street addresses are truly lacking in these communities, and complains the district court mistakenly relied on outdated evidence about two counties that had not finished assigning addresses as of 2011.

The court also found that 65.6% of the Native American group were missing at least one of the underlying documents needed to obtain a valid identification from the State. These data, however, leave 513,742 of 583,358 eligible voters in the State, or 88 percent, as to whom the plaintiffs have not shown a lack of qualifying identification. And for the relatively small percentage of eligible voters who lack both a qualifying identification and certain underlying documents, the findings (and the dissent) do not address how many voters attempted to acquire them but were unable to do so with reasonable effort.

So even if the State charged a fee for nondriver's identification cards at one point, the statutes did not authorize the fee, and the practice is no longer sanctioned by the department of transportation website.

Even assuming all 2,305 persons were unable to obtain\n   a supplemental document without a substantial burden, moreover, they represent less than 0.5% of all eligible voters in the State. The findings thus do not establish that the statute places a substantial burden on most North Dakota voters, and a statewide injunction against the supplemental document requirement is unwarranted.

In a thorough opinion premised on largely uncontested facts, the district court determined that North Dakota likely violated the Constitution by passing a law requiring all prospective voters to present a form of identification that is both difficult and costly to obtain. The unrebutted evidence demonstrates that the new law will have a particularly devastating effect on eligible Native American voters, thousands of whom will effectively lose the right to vote. North Dakota has proffered no evidence to justify the law's imposition.

Approximately half of Native Americans who lack an acceptable form of identification also lack the underlying documents necessary to obtain it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, and obtaining those documents also entails an expense.

The Secretary then moved to dissolve the district court's previous injunction. Plaintiffs moved for a new preliminary injunction on the same grounds as the original injunction request. They also supplemented their request with updated evidence. As with the first injunction motion, the Secretary did not contest any of plaintiffs' evidence, and the district court concluded that the uncontested evidence established that the new law likely violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brakebill v. Jaeger\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Brakebill II\n   </em>\n   ), No. 1:16-CV-008,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612190\">\n    2018 WL 1612190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, *7 (D.N.D. Apr. 3, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In addition to incorporating its prior discussion of the evidence submitted in connection with the first preliminary injunction, the district court recounted the updated statistical evidence: 19% of Native American eligible voters still lack one of the two forms of qualifying identification allowed under H.B. 1369, compared to only 11.6% of non-Native Americans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Of those Native Americans without a valid identification, 65.6% lack the underlying documents they would need to obtain one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And among those who would have a valid form of identification but for the current RSA requirement, 48.7% do not possess at least one of the supplemental documents accepted under H.B. 1369, compared to only 26.2% of non-Native American voters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The district court noted that the current RSA requirement is a particularly harsh burden for those living on tribal reservations because, as the Secretary acknowledged, \"Native American communities often lack residential street addresses,\" and many residents use only their mailing address, which is often a P.O. Box.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. An individual without a current RSA-or, more accurately, without adequate proof of one-\"will never be qualified to vote\" under H.B. 1369.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the law \"completely disenfranchises anyone who does not have a 'current residential street address[,]' ... includ[ing] homeless persons as well as many persons living on Native American reservations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The district court concluded that several of the Secretary's arguments about the availability of identification cards were not supported by the evidence. Specifically, it found that the Secretary's claim that non-driver's identification cards are available for free was directly contradicted by the North Dakota Department of Transportation's website, which at the time clearly stated that the cards cost eight dollars, and by the testimony of at least one plaintiff who was charged such a fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brakebill v.

And it found that the Secretary's claim that poll workers would accept any identification issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) appeared to conflict with the plain text of H.B. 1369, which requires identification to be issued by a \"tribal government\" and makes no mention of the BIA, a federal agency.\n   <em>\n    Brakebill II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612190\">\n    2018 WL 1612190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. As for the Secretary's claim that poll workers would accept as a supplemental document any document, even a letter, from \"tribal authorities\" that contained the voter's name, date of birth, and current RSA, the district court expressed skepticism that most poll workers would recognize a letter as an \"official form of identification issued by a tribal government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The\n   state had consistently interpreted this language-identical to that used in H.B. 1333-as requiring an official tribal identification card, not a letter. The Secretary produced no \"official state administrative rule, regulation, policy, procedure, memorandum, or any other document or public pronouncement espousing\" this \"new-found interpretation of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court also criticized H.B. 1369's new provisional ballot system, which was intended to replace the fail-safe provision reinstated by the prior injunction. It noted that the provisional ballot system will not help any voter who is unable to obtain qualifying identification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. Those living on reservations without clear residential street addresses, for example, would never be able to have their votes counted under this procedure. Even voters with the means to obtain a driver's license or nondriver's identification card are unlikely to be able to visit a Driver's License Site, acquire the required identification, and return to the relevant election official within the six days following an election in order to have their ballot counted. And, the district court noted, the law \"is vague and unclear as to where and to whom such a voter is to produce\" his identification or supplemental documents, exacerbating the problems created by the rest of the law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Overall, the district court explained, at least 4,998 otherwise eligible Native American voters lack a valid identification under H.B. 1369.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Approximately 48.7% of those individuals also lack adequate supplemental identification documents, meaning that at least 2,305 eligible Native American voters cannot vote under the new law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the district court addressed the evidence of potential voter fraud in North Dakota. In short, there is none. The Secretary produced \"no evidence of voter fraud in the past, and no evidence of voter fraud in 2016,\" when the first injunction remained in place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. At most, this left only \"the theoretical possibility of voter fraud [that] exists with every election nationwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After weighing the competing interests at stake, the district court dissolved its prior injunction as moot and granted plaintiffs' request for a new preliminary injunction. The new injunction prevented the Secretary from enforcing only a few discrete subsections of H.B. 1369. First, the district court enjoined the current RSA requirement and ordered the Secretary to accept identification bearing a current RSA or a current mailing address, thereby accommodating the many Native American voters who lack identification bearing a current RSA. Second, consistent with the Secretary's litigation positions, the court required the Secretary to accept two additional forms of identification and supplemental documentation: (1) tribal identification cards issued by the BIA and (2) letters issued by tribal authorities. Finally, the district court instructed the Secretary to promulgate guidance on how voters could comply with the new provisional ballot system. H.B. 1369 already requires the Secretary to \"develop uniform procedures\" for implementing the system, 2017 N.D. Laws ch. 152, sec. 2 (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016.1-01-04\">\n    N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 16.1-01-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1(6) ), so this aspect of the injunction simply amounted to requiring the Secretary to comply with the law as written. The district court did not reinstate the affidavit fail-safe option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Secretary appealed. He argues that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the current RSA requirement because they all possess current RSAs. He also argues that the injunction permitting the use of identification bearing a mailing address will allow nonresidents to vote and will allow residents to vote in the wrong precincts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   And he argues that plaintiffs, as members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, cannot obtain an injunction requiring acceptance of BIA-issued identification cards because the BIA only issues cards to members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Finally, he argues that the district court improperly ordered him to comply with his statutory duty to develop uniform procedures for the provisional ballot system.

This argument misses the mark. The law does not just require voters to maintain a residence but to obtain and present a qualifying form of identification (or a qualifying supplemental document) reflecting that residence's address.

Here, the district court concluded that North Dakota does impose a fee on all state-issued forms of identification. It is undisputed that a driver's license costs, at minimum, fifteen dollars. The Secretary claims that nondriver's identification cards are available for free, but plaintiffs presented contrary evidence that the district court found more credible. At the time of the district court's decision, the North Dakota Department of Transportation's official website plainly indicated that a nondriver's identification card costs eight dollars. Furthermore, one plaintiff testified that she was charged this fee to obtain a card. The district court did not clearly err in finding plaintiffs' evidence more credible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").

Unless the individual is a minor (in which case voting is not an issue), the Department of Transportation's website indicates that obtaining either a driver's license or nondriver's identification card requires a citizen to present one of five documents, which must\n   contain the individual's name and current physical address: (1) a government-issued property tax form; (2) a mortgage, lease, or rental document; (3) a homeowner's or renter's insurance policy; (4) a utility bill; or (5) a non-cellular phone bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brakebill III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518801\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/553/#p561\">\n    905 F.3d at 562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kelly, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   An individual cannot acquire any of these documents unless they own or rent real property in their own name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court's opinion today brushes these concerns aside by insisting that a voter only needs to show where he or she resides. But that is simply not true. To obtain a state-issued identification card, the prospective voter must jump through multiple hoops and acquire specific forms of underlying documentation. An individual cannot do so without paying a fee and maintaining an interest in property. The Indiana law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   did not impose such requirements, as Indiana offers free identification cards and does not require proof of an interest in property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p200\">\n    553 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   198 &amp; n.17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p200\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs' unrebutted evidence shows that 19% of Native American eligible voters in North Dakota lack a form of qualifying identification required under H.B. 1369\n   due to the current RSA requirement. Roughly half of those individuals also lack sufficient supplemental identification documents to comply with the statute, meaning that at least 2,305 Native Americans simply cannot vote. This amounts to the disenfranchisement of roughly 10% of all voting-age Native Americans in the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizen Voting-Age Population: North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Census Bureau (Nov. 15, 2016), https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/citizen_voting_age_population/cb16-tps18_nd.html.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs also presented evidence that eliminating the fail-safe option indirectly burdens Native Americans to a greater degree than other citizens. Native Americans disproportionately live in severe poverty, so the costs associated with acquiring a state-issued identification (and the necessary underlying documents) burden them to a greater degree. Compared to other North Dakota residents, Native Americans are less likely to have access to transportation, less likely to have internet access, and more likely to have difficulty taking time off work to travel. Even the physical distance that an individual must travel to obtain state-issued identification is, on average, twice as far for Native Americans than non-Native Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The current RSA requirement also disproportionately burdens Native Americans. The requirement that a voter's identification contain an RSA (instead of, for instance, a mailing address) largely affects those with tribal identifications, as state-issued forms of identification already include the individual's RSA. The district court found that Native American communities often lack RSAs. And among those who lack an acceptable identification due to the current RSA requirement, 48.7% of Native Americans do not possess one of the listed supplemental documents bearing their current RSA, compared to 26.2% of non-Native Americans.\n   <em>\n    Brakebill II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612190\">\n    2018 WL 1612190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

The Secretary argued that the laws further the state's interests in preventing voter fraud and maintaining voter confidence in elections. The district court correctly\n   held that these types of interests are legitimate. In\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , Indiana presented evidence of a distinct risk of voter fraud due to the state's inflated voter rolls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p200\">\n    553 U.S. at 192-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673974\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/181/#p200\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indiana's voter identification law directly addressed this risk, outweighing the indeterminate burden on the state's voters. Here, in contrast, North Dakota presented no \"evidence to show voter fraud has ever been a problem\" in the state,\n   <em>\n    Brakebill I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207118548\">\n    2016 WL 7118548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10, making the risk of voter fraud only a \"theoretical\" concern,\n   <em>\n    Brakebill II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612190\">\n    2018 WL 1612190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. And North Dakota has offered no evidence to support the inference that H.B. 1369 will measurably reduce the risk of voter fraud. This is insufficient to justify disenfranchising 10% of the state's Native American voters. In my view, the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The remaining\n   <em>\n    Dataphase\n   </em>\n   factors-the threat of irreparable harm to plaintiffs, the injury an injunction would inflict on other interested parties, and the effect on the public interest-also weigh in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief.

I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On appeal, the Secretary argues that the preliminary injunction issued by the district court \"expressly enables\" fraudulent voting by someone who resides outside North Dakota but maintains a P.O. Box within the state. But other aspects of the challenged statute not covered by the preliminary injunction expose the remoteness of such a possibility: the nonresident would still need to obtain a tribal- or state-issued identification card, neither of which may be issued to a non-North Dakota resident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brakebill III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518801\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/553/#p561\">\n    905 F.3d at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kelly, J., dissenting). This overblown concern does not outweigh the other factors favoring relief.

The court criticizes the relief ordered by the district court as overbroad, implying that a statewide injunction is not warranted because any unjustified burden is placed on a \"relatively small percentage of eligible voters.\" I disagree. A statute that imposes an unjustified burden on voting is unconstitutional in all its applications, even if some voters are able to comply with it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174691\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/663/#p670\">\n    383 U.S. at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174691\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/663/#p670\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The district court was faced with two problematic provisions of North Dakota law: the current RSA requirement and the elimination of the affidavit option. In a carefully crafted order, the district court enjoined the current RSA requirement only in part, requiring the state to accept identification or supplemental documentation bearing a mailing address instead of an RSA. As for the elimination of the affidavit option, the district court would have been within its discretion to simply re-instate its previous injunction, which had stood through the 2016 election without incident. Indeed, plaintiffs presented evidence suggesting that many Native\n   American voters had to utilize the affidavit option in 2016 because of the new identification requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brakebill II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612190\">\n    2018 WL 1612190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (indicating a 665% increase in the use of the affidavit option between 2012 and 2016 in the three counties with the highest percentage of Native American voters). But the district court attempted to craft a more narrow remedy. In light of H.B. 1369's new provisional ballot system, and in light of the Secretary's concessions that the state would accept a broad range of forms of tribal identification, the district court held the Secretary to his commitment that BIA-issued identification and tribal-issued letters would be accepted as either valid identification or supplemental documentation. It also ordered the Secretary to comply with his obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016.1-01-04\">\n    N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 16.1-01-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1(6) to clarify the procedures for voters to get their provisional ballots counted. The district court imposed no substantive limits on, nor a timeframe for, his compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This limited remedy was not an abuse of discretion. \"Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment .... In the course of doing so, a court need not grant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

The relief ordered by the district court addresses the most burdensome aspects of the challenged laws while leaving the rest of the provisions intact. Indeed, other than allowing tribal members to vote using a mailing address after showing tribal identification (which proves they are state residents), the injunction does nothing except memorialize the Secretary's litigation positions and statutory obligations. Ordering the Secretary to adhere to the interpretation of the law that he advanced in this very litigation does not constitute an abuse of discretion meriting reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   It is especially puzzling that the court today vacates the aspects of the district court's injunction that the Secretary did not even seek to stay prior to the 2018 election. The court's opinion says that it is \"unnecessary at this juncture to address\" the acceptability of BIA-issued identification cards and tribal letters,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 679, and asserts that there \"might\" be no problem with the provisional ballot system,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 680, but vacates these portions of the preliminary injunction anyway. These aspects of the injunction remained in place during the 2018 election, and there is no indication that the district court's order was unworkable or allowed for voter fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \"The abuse-of-discretion standard means 'the court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Novus Franchising\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071492\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/885/#p893\">\n    725 F.3d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kern v.

The district court here was in a unique position to appreciate H.B. 1369's effect on Native American voters' access to the ballot in light of North Dakota's particular demographic and geographic circumstances; it crafted a limited injunction tailored to address those realities.
