If the defendant's citizenship allegations are unchallenged factually, the answer is none. In such cases, all a removing party must do is provide a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal. Because Defendants Cox Communications' (and related entities') notice of removal did just that, and because Plaintiff David Ehrman did not factually attack Cox's jurisdictional allegations, we reverse the district court's grant of Ehrman's motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ehrman filed a class action complaint against Cox in Orange County Superior Court, alleging that Cox had engaged in unlawful business practices related to the advertisement and sale of residential internet services. Ehrman brought the case on behalf of himself and \"all consumers in\n   California who paid for [Cox's] residential Internet services within four years from the date this action was filed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cox removed the case to the district court pursuant to CAFA. Cox alleged in its notice of removal that Ehrman's suit met CAFA's removal requirements because it was a putative class action with more than 100 class members, that there was minimal diversity between the parties, and that the amount in controversy exceeded $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Cox, a purported citizen of Delaware and Georgia, asserted based on information and belief that Ehrman and all class members are citizens of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ehrman then moved to remand the case to state court. Asserting a facial challenge to Cox's notice of removal, Ehrman argued that Cox had failed to adequately plead the existence of minimal diversity. He claimed that Cox's allegations of citizenship were insufficient because they relied \"purely on an allegation of residency and [on] 'information and belief.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted Ehrman's motion to remand. It reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In the absence of instruction from the Ninth Circuit ... this Court declines to find that the complaint alone created a rebuttable residency-domicile presumption of removability. ... [T]he Court finds that Cox's reliance on the residency allegation in the complaint [ ] amounted to mere sensible guesswork such that it is insufficient for establishing minimal diversity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We granted Cox's motion for leave to appeal to provide guidance on what a defendant must allege, and what evidence it must provide, when removing a case pursuant to CAFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201453\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), which allows us to \"accept [a timely] appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's decision to remand a removed case and its determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Lively v.

At issue here is what that removing defendant must plead in its notice of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the removing party, Cox had the burden of pleading minimal diversity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abrego Abrego v.

It alleged that Ehrman and all putative class members were citizens of California. That Cox's notice of removal mentioned Ehrman's residency is immaterial to our analysis. Cox did not have to explain why it believed Ehrman or the putative class members were citizens of California. As we explained above, a defendant's allegations of citizenship may be based solely on information and belief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carolina Cas.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899049\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1082/#p1087\">\n    741 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, his motion to remand asserted a facial challenge to the legal adequacy of Cox's notice of removal.

No evidence was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We conclude by clarifying the scope of our decision. Although the district court focused much of its analysis on the question of whether allegations of a party's residency constitutes prima facie evidence of that party's domicile, we need not address that issue today.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mondragon v.

Because Ehrman did not factually challenge Cox's jurisdictional allegations, Cox did not need to provide evidence of either Ehrman's or the purported class members' citizenship. We hold only that Cox's jurisdictional allegations, which provided a short and plain statement of the parties' citizenships based on information and belief, satisfied Cox's burden of pleading minimal diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Congress enacted CAFA to \"\n   <em>\n    facilitate\n   </em>\n   adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593418\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/547/#p553\">\n    135 S.
