Hamilton Bank of Johnson City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    473 U.S. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By opinion filed June 21, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States overruled its prior holding in\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   that a property owner whose property has been taken by a local government has not suffered a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights and cannot bring a federal takings claim in federal court until a state court has denied his claim for just compensation under state law. Thus, the Supreme Court vacated this Court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In light of the action taken by the Supreme Court overruling\n   <em>\n    Williams County\n   </em>\n   , it is hereby ORDERED that this Court's prior opinion is vacated with respect to the Fifth Amendment takings claim. This Court's determination that Knick lacked standing to advance a Fourth Amendment claim was not considered by the Supreme Court of the United States on certiorari review. As such, this Court's opinion stands with respect to the Fourth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, it is now hereby ADJUDGED and ORDERED that the judgment of the District Court entered September 8, 2016, be and the same is hereby AFFIRMED as to the dismissal of the Fourth Amendment claims, VACATED as to the dismissal of the Fifth Amendment claims, and REMANDED for further proceedings. The parties shall bear their own costs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
