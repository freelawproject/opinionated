According to the presentence report, Perez had a lengthy criminal history, including a conviction for felony battery resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of California Penal Code section 243(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of this prior conviction, the presentence report determined that Perez had a base offense level of 20, which is applicable if \"the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2016). After taking into account various adjustments, the presentence report concluded that Perez had an adjusted offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of VI, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. The presentence report recommended a downward variance to a below-Guidelines sentence of 46 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At sentencing, the district court concluded that Perez's conviction under section 243(d) qualified as a crime of violence as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. It imposed a sentence of 61 months' imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Perez challenges the court's determination that section 243(d) is a crime of violence.
