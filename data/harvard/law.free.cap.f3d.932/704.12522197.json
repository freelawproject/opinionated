Cardoza petitions this court and argues his Iowa conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony and DHS violated his due process rights. We deny Cardoza's petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cardoza is a native and citizen of El Salvador who illegally entered the United States in approximately 2004. Cardoza has made no claim to United States citizenship or lawful permanent status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, Cardoza pled guilty to committing forgery in violation of Iowa Code \u00a7 715A.2(2)(b). Cardoza admitted to having\n   a false social security card in his possession. An Iowa court sentenced Cardoza to two years of imprisonment, but the sentence was suspended and Cardoza was placed on probation for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May of 2018, officials with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") encountered Cardoza during a vehicle stop. When Cardoza admitted being a citizen and national of El Salvador who was in the United States illegally, the ICE officials arrested Cardoza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DHS issued Cardoza a Form I-851, Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Order (\"Notice of Intent\"), which alleged Cardoza was deportable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) because Cardoza's Iowa forgery conviction was an aggravated felony as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(R). The Notice of Intent provided Cardoza a deadline to respond to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before Cardoza's deadline expired, DHS received a letter from Cardoza's attorney requesting to inspect DHS's evidence of removability, including documents establishing the existence of the conviction. The letter asserted that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(C) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20238.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(ii), Cardoza had an additional ten days to respond after DHS provided the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several days later, DHS responded to Cardoza's attorney's letter and provided the requested documents of conviction. But on that same day, DHS issued a Final Administrative Removal Order (\"FARO\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). DHS concluded Cardoza's Iowa forgery conviction was an aggravated felony, and therefore, he was removable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cardoza filed a petition for review with this court in May 2018 under docket number 18-2146. Meanwhile, Cardoza's proceedings before DHS continued pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because Cardoza expressed a fear he would suffer persecution or torture if he returned to El Salvador. Cardoza met with an asylum officer for a reasonable fear determination. The DHS asylum officer determined Cardoza was not likely to experience persecution or torture if returned to El Salvador. Upon Cardoza's request, the determination was referred to an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") for review. After reviewing the record, the IJ issued a decision concurring with the DHS asylum officer's determination. Cardoza then filed a petition for review of the IJ's final order\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   under docket number 18-2446. We consolidated the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before considering the merits of Cardoza's arguments, we first evaluate our jurisdiction and the scope of our review of both petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin by considering our jurisdiction to review Cardoza's petitions. Congress has provided this court with limited jurisdiction to review orders of removal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute dictates that courts do not have jurisdiction over certain types of proceedings, including \"any final order of removal against an alien who is\n   removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in ... [ 8 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the statute goes on to provide that jurisdiction does exist to review \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon petition of review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The statute later provides that a court may only review a final order of removal if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on this statutory scheme, jurisdiction over docket number 18-2146 (Cardoza's first petition) would not exist because the FARO was not a final order. After DHS issued the FARO, administrative review continued for a reasonable fear determination pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this conclusion does not mean we do not have jurisdiction to review the FARO under docket number 18-2446 (Cardoza's second petition). Indeed, the Attorney General concedes we have jurisdiction to decide the issues of whether Cardoza's due process rights were violated and whether Cardoza was convicted of an aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) because these issues constitute a constitutional question and a question of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Aggravated Felony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We next consider Cardoza's argument that his Iowa forgery conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(iii). \"To determine whether a state ... conviction is grounds for removal, the adjudicator is required to apply the so-called 'categorical approach.' \"\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Chavarria-Brito\n   </em>\n   , Cardoza's forgery conviction under Iowa Code \u00a7 715A.2(1)(d) and (2)(b) was for possessing a forged instrument with the intent to perpetuate a fraud or with the knowledge his possession was facilitating a fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This \"is unarguably an offense '\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to' forgery.\"\n   <em>\n    Chavarria-Brito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577641\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1184/#p1185\">\n    526 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

Congress has directed the Attorney General to prescribe regulations that provide due process protections, including that \"the alien has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the evidence and rebut the charges.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(C).

The regulations provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If an alien's written response requests the opportunity to review the Government's evidence, the [appropriate service officer] shall serve the alien with a copy of the evidence in the record of proceeding upon which the [appropriate service officer] is relying to support the charge. The alien may, within 10 calendar days following service of the Government's evidence (13 calendar days if service is by mail), furnish a final response in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20238.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 238.1(c)(2)(ii).

This violated the above-cited regulation and denied Cardoza the opportunity to rebut the government's position with arguments and evidence. This was a fundamental procedural error and violated Cardoza's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The problem with Cardoza's petition, however, is that he cannot show the outcome of his proceeding may well have been different had DHS given him the time necessary to rebut the government's position.
