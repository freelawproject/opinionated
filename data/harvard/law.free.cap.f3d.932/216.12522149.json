Henry McCollum and Leon Brown (\"Appellees\") spent 31 years in prison and\n   on death row\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   before being exonerated based on DNA evidence linking another individual, a man who was known to officers at the time of the investigation, to the crime. Following their release from prison, Appellees brought this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that the state and county law enforcement officers investigating the crime violated their Fourth Amendment and due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The officers moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court denied their motion, and this appeal followed. Because Appellees have alleged facts sufficient to show that the officers violated their clearly established Fourth Amendment and due process rights, we affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    The Underlying Crime and Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Eleven year old Sabrina Buie went missing on the evening of September 24, 1983, in Red Springs, North Carolina. Two days later, her body was discovered in a soybean field near a convenience store in Red Springs. She was found naked from the waist down, with her bra pushed up over the back of her head. Her panties were shoved down her throat with a stick, and she had been sexually assaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Red Springs Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (\"SBI\") worked together to investigate the case. SBI Agents Leroy Allen and Kenneth Snead and Robeson County Detectives Joel Garth Locklear and Kenneth Sealey (collectively, \"Appellants\") were assigned to the case. While processing the crime scene, Appellants discovered three Schiltz Malt Liquor beer cans, three match sticks, one Newport cigarette butt, and two wooden sticks reddened with blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 27, 1983, while canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses, Detective Locklear spoke to Henry McCollum, who denied any knowledge of Buie's disappearance. However, the following evening, Agent Snead and Detective Sealey interviewed Ethel Furmage, a high school student, who said that she had \"heard at school\" that McCollum \"had something to do with\" Buie's murder. J.A. 304.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly after 9:00 that evening, Snead, Sealey, and Agent Allen traveled to McCollum's home to interview him. McCollum agreed to ride with the officers to the police station, where he was fingerprinted and questioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Interrogations of Appellees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   What exactly happened in the interrogation room is at the heart of this case and is, as the district court determined, a dispute of material fact that must be determined by a jury. This is what we know for sure. At the time of these events, McCollum was 19 years old, and he suffered from severe intellectual disabilities. He scored a 56 on an IQ test, where any score below a 69 indicates intellectual disability. In high school, McCollum performed at the level of an eight to ten year old. And in 1990, McCollum was formally diagnosed as intellectually\n   disabled. McCollum had never been in legal trouble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   waiver form bearing McCollum's signature is dated September 28, 1983, at 10:26 p.m. At 2:10 a.m. on September 29, McCollum signed a handwritten confession that was drafted by Agent Snead and witnessed by Detective Sealey and Red Springs Police Department Chief Luther Haggins. This confession stated the following: McCollum, along with four other boys -- Darrell Suber, Louis Moore, Chris (last name unknown), and Leon Brown -- were with Buie at approximately 9:30 p.m. on September 24, the day she went missing. Suber and Chris left the group to buy a six-pack of beer from the nearby convenience store. When they returned, Suber, Chris, McCollum, Moore, and Brown discussed raping Buie, because she had not agreed to have sex with them voluntarily. After this conversation, Moore left. The rest of the group walked with Buie to the woods at the edge of a field and drank beer. Suber and Chris smoked Newport cigarettes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Per the confession, McCollum grabbed Buie's right arm while Brown grabbed her left arm. The group of boys then took turns raping Buie, with McCollum going third and Brown going last. Afterwards, Suber said they had to do something so that Buie would not tell the police what they had done. Chris tied Buie's pink panties to a stick, then used it to choke Buie to death. While this was happening, McCollum and Brown held Buie down and Suber cut her with a knife. Then, after they believed Buie was dead, the boys dragged her body to the edge of the woods. Suber had blood on his brown corduroy jacket and gray Nike tennis shoes, and Chris had blood on his sneakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After McCollum signed the confession, he was placed under arrest for Buie's rape and murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During McCollum's interrogation, his mother Mamie Brown and brother Leon Brown arrived at the police station. At approximately 2 a.m. on September 29, and based on McCollum's written confession, Detective Locklear and Chief Haggins began to interrogate Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brown was 15 years old at the time, and like his brother, he had been diagnosed with severe intellectual disabilities. He consistently scored in the mid-50s range on IQ tests, and although he was in seventh grade, he performed at a third grade level. In 1982, a school psychologist had placed Brown in a special education class. Like his brother, Brown had not previously been in legal trouble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At 2:24 a.m., Brown signed a form entitled \"Juvenile Rights Warning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, around 6 a.m., Brown signed a confession that had been drafted by Detective Locklear. Following Brown's confession, he was arrested for the rape and murder of Buie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Confession Inconsistencies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Brown's confession implicated Suber and Chris, but it differed in certain aspects from McCollum's confession. Notably,\n   Brown's confession makes no mention of Moore's involvement, and it does not reference a stick being used to force Buie's underwear down her throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The confessions of McCollum and Brown also contained certain details that were later proven false. For example, both confessions stated that Suber and Chris were involved in the crime and took turns raping Buie, but the police verified that Suber, Chris, and Moore all had alibis on the night of the murder. And contrary to the confessions, an autopsy revealed that Buie's panties were white, not pink, and she had no stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Criminal Proceedings and Post-Conviction Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1984 Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Appellees were indicted by a grand jury on January 3, 1984, on charges of first-degree murder and rape. They were tried together in Robeson County Superior Court in October 1984. The prosecutor was District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, McCollum was represented by Earl Strickland, and Brown was represented by Robert Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellees both moved to suppress their confessions. These motions were denied. The trial court concluded that both McCollum and Brown had voluntarily gone to the police station; each had knowingly and intelligently waived his rights; and each had made statements freely, voluntarily, and knowingly. Appellees both testified at trial, and each was convicted and sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Second Trials\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial based on error in the jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

Appellees were then tried separately in adjacent counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   McCollum was retried in Cumberland County in November 1991. The Cumberland County Superior Court denied McCollum's motion to suppress his confession, concluding that McCollum's constitutional rights were not violated by his arrest, detention, interrogation, or confession; that his confession was made freely and voluntarily; and that McCollum waived his rights freely, knowingly, and intelligently. During the November 1991 trial, and with McCollum's consent, McCollum's attorney argued to the jury that McCollum was present for the rape and murder of Buie, and he asked the jury to return a verdict of second-degree murder. McCollum was found guilty of first-degree murder and rape, and he was again sentenced to death. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed McCollum's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

Brown's motion to suppress his confession was denied after the trial court concluded that Brown knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights; that his constitutional rights had not been violated; and that his confession was voluntary. The trial court later granted a defense motion to dismiss the first-degree murder charge, finding that Brown had withdrawn from the conspiracy to commit\n   murder. The jury found Brown guilty of first-degree rape, and he was sentenced to life in prison. The North Carolina Court of Appeals and the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Brown's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

Brown did not file a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    NCIIC Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In 2009, Brown sought assistance from the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission (\"NCIIC\"), and the NCIIC accepted his case. The NCIIC then reached out to McCollum and accepted his case as well. In its investigation, the NCIIC uncovered DNA evidence on the Newport cigarette butt found at the scene of the crime. The DNA matched Roscoe Artis, a man known to Appellants during the investigation of Buie's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In 1984, Artis was convicted of a crime strikingly similar to Buie's murder: the first-degree murder and rape of Joann Brockman, also in Red Springs, North Carolina. On October 22, 1983 -- less than one month after Buie's murder -- Brockman's body was found naked except for a sweater and bra pushed up above her breasts, and an autopsy revealed that she died from manual strangulation during sexual intercourse. Artis was arrested the same day, and he was tried in August 1984. The prosecutor for Artis's trial was district attorney Joe Freeman Britt, and Artis was represented by Earl Strickland -- both of whom would be involved in McCollum and Brown's October 1984 trial just two months later. Appellants Agent Allen and Detective Locklear, who were involved in the investigation of Brockman's murder, testified for the state in Artis's trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artis received a death sentence, which was commuted to life in prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

At a hearing on these motions held September 2, 2014, the NCIIC's investigator testified about inconsistencies between Appellees' written confessions and the DNA match to Artis on the cigarette. The state did not contest that the newly discovered DNA evidence was favorable to Appellees, and it conceded that Appellees had satisfied the requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-270(c), which governs the relief available to petitioners who come forward with favorable DNA evidence post-conviction. The MAR court held, \"especially when considered together with the rest of the results of the [NCIIC]'s investigation,\" the favorable DNA evidence \"tend[s] to establish Henry McCollum's and Leon Brown's innocence of [the] crime for which they were convicted and sentenced.\" J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   309. Accordingly, the MAR court vacated Appellees' convictions and sentences from Robeson, Cumberland, and Bladen counties, dismissed with prejudice all charges in the cases, and ordered Appellees' immediate release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On June 5, 2015, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory issued full pardons of innocence to Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    District Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Appellees filed this action against Appellants on August 31, 2015. The amended complaint alleges four claims arising pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   : false arrest, malicious prosecution, deprivation of due process, and municipal liability. At the root of these claims, Appellees assert that Appellants coerced and fabricated Appellees' confessions, and then, to cover up this wrongdoing, Appellees allege that Appellants withheld in bad faith exculpatory evidence that demonstrated Appellees' innocence and buried pieces of specific evidence indicating that Artis -- and not Appellees -- raped and murdered Buie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Appellants sought summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court concluded that genuine disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment based on qualified immunity, and that a jury must determine whether Appellees' confessions were voluntary and whether Appellants acted in bad faith while investigating Buie's murder after the confessions were obtained. The district court summarized these disputes of material fact as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    The Confessions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The district court noted that \"[t]he parties offer[ed] drastically different versions of the events surrounding the confessions given by [Appellees].\" J.A. 318. Agent Snead and Detective Sealey stated that they began questioning McCollum around 9:30 p.m. But Snead and Sealey's recollections of when McCollum received his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning differ; Snead testified in his deposition that McCollum signed the waiver prior to questioning, whereas Sealey testified in his deposition that McCollum signed the waiver after he admitted to holding Buie down. Sealey testified that he asked few if any questions during the interview, and that Snead took the lead. Agent Allen was also present during the interview, according to Snead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After what Detective Sealey thought might have been five or ten minutes of questioning -- but Agent Snead recalls being anywhere from twenty to forty-five minutes -- McCollum admitted to them, \"I just held her down.\" J.A. 319. Sealey testified at his deposition that he thought McCollum was about to have a seizure just before he admitted this; meanwhile, Snead testified at his deposition that McCollum was extremely calm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   According to Agent Snead, he talked with McCollum until about 1:50 a.m., McCollum confessed, and Snead wrote out McCollum's statement. Then, Snead testified, McCollum confronted Brown and Suber, who were at the police station, and told them that he (McCollum) had told the truth and wanted them to also tell the truth about killing Buie. McCollum then asked Chief Haggins if he could go home, and Snead informed McCollum that things had changed and asked Haggins to arrest McCollum for murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As the district court noted, \"McCollum's description of his interview by Snead, Sealey, and Allen bears no resemblance to the [officers' accounts].\" J.A. 319. According to\n   McCollum, the officers told him that if he signed a form -- the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver form -- they would let him go home.

Brown testified at the 1984 trial that he could hear his brother crying when he arrived. At around 2:30 a.m., while Brown was waiting at the station with L.P. Sinclair (a friend of the boys and eventual witness in the case), Detective Locklear and Agent Allen took Brown to an interrogation room and began questioning him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Agent Allen testified at his deposition that he read Brown his juvenile rights, including the right to have a parent present, and that Brown stated he understood his rights and wished to answer questions without a lawyer or parent present. Allen stated that he did not recall Brown asking to speak with his mother, or Brown's mother asking to see Brown. Agent Snead testified at his deposition that he does not know why Brown was taken to an interview room, and that he witnessed Brown's rights form but was not in the room when Brown confessed. Detective Locklear testified at the 1984 trial that he took Brown's statement, and that Brown was \"quite alert of mind and very precise in what he wanted to say to me.\" J.A. 321. Further, Locklear testified that he made Brown no promises and did not threaten him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Brown, meanwhile, testified at his 1984 trial that Detective Locklear did not advise him of his rights, that Brown asked for his mother when an officer grabbed Brown's arm, and that Brown (like McCollum) was told he would be taken to the gas chamber if he did not sign the rights waiver. Then, Brown testified that when the officers gave him a piece of paper, he circled \"no\" on it. According to Brown, that \"no\" was supposed to indicate that he could not help the officers. Brown testified that the officers then \"began to hammer him, calling him racial epithets and stating that he [Brown] had committed the crime or that he knew something about it.\" J.A. 320. During Brown's interrogation, his mother was knocking on the door asking to see him, but she was refused entry. Brown denied any knowledge of the crime and stated that he was innocent. Brown testified at his deposition that he did not say the things that are written in the confession; instead, Detective Locklear drafted it and told Brown to sign it, which Brown did after an officer told him doing so would\n   ensure his release. Locklear then read the confession to Brown, and Brown told the officers that it was not true. Like his brother, Brown was then placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The district court noted additional disputes of material fact regarding Appellants' conduct during the investigation that precluded summary judgment on Appellees' due process claims. Specifically, these factual disputes involved Appellees' assertion that Appellants failed to investigate and withheld exculpatory evidence regarding (1) the similarities between the rape and murder of Buie and Artis's rape and murder of Brockhart; (2) a statement by a potential eyewitness, Mary McLean Richards, that she saw Artis attacking Buie; and (3) the alleged coerced testimony of Brown and McCollum's friend L.P. Sinclair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Appellees assert that Artis was a suspect in Buie's murder, but Appellants failed to disclose this to Appellees. According to Appellees, on October 5, 1984, three days before Appellees' first trial, investigators submitted Artis's fingerprints to the SBI for comparison to the latent prints found on the beer can at the Buie crime scene. Artis was listed as a suspect on the fingerprint comparison request. However, the investigators canceled the request that same day, and the fingerprint comparison was never completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, Appellees assert that Richards told Appellants that she witnessed Artis attacking Buie on the night of the murder, and that she attempted to intervene but Artis frightened her away. Richards further testified that when she went home and told her mother what she had seen, her mother would not allow her to call the police. Richards testified in her deposition that she provided this information to Detective Sealey during the investigation in 1983. However, Sealey's investigation notes do not reflect this information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, Appellees assert that Appellants coerced false testimony from Sinclair. After meeting with investigators multiple times, Sinclair submitted to, and passed, a polygraph test three days before Appellees' first trial, declaring he \"did not know anything about [Buie's death].\" J.A. 1305. SBI then marked him as a suspect in the case and ordered analysis of his fingerprints at the same time it requested an analysis of Artis's fingerprints. Sinclair then changed his story and testified at Appellees' 1984 trial that McCollum had confessed to him the day after Buie's murder. Sinclair further testified that McCollum and Brown had discussed raping Buie in his presence and that he (Sinclair) had declined to participate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For their part, Appellants dispute that they should have taken any additional action with respect to investigating Artis. Appellants further dispute that Richards made a statement in 1983 to any member of law enforcement that she witnessed Buie's attack, or that any Appellant coerced or instructed Sinclair to testify untruthfully at the 1984 trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We review a district court's denial of summary judgment in the qualified immunity context de novo, and we \"view all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light that is most favorable to the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

We address each issue in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Individualized Liability Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Appellants assert that the district court broadly misapplied the test for qualified immunity because it did not identify \"what each individual officer knew, when he knew it, and what specific actions he did or did not take.\" Appellants' Br. 20. Critically, Appellants did not argue before the district court that\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   officers were entitled to qualified immunity based on the officer's\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   actions, but instead asserted collective qualified immunity defenses. In other words, Appellants fault the district court for not identifying and resolving in their favor individual liability arguments that Appellants themselves did not raise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   It is true that the defense of qualified immunity is a defense for individual defendants. But it would be counterproductive to require a district court to wade through convoluted issues of fact at this stage in order to determine individual liability, where: (1) Appellants did not raise individualized qualified immunity arguments before the district court but instead\n   asserted collective qualified immunity defenses; (2) the facts have yet to be resolved, and the district court only determined whether qualified immunity applies as a matter of law;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) Appellees alleged that Appellants acted in concert to violate their constitutional rights.

The district court denied Appellants' motions after concluding that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Appellees, Appellees presented evidence that their confessions were fabricated or coerced, which was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Appellants violated Appellees' clearly established constitutional rights not to be arrested in the absence of probable cause and on the basis of a coerced confession. This dispute of fact precluded a ruling on qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Appellants argue that they did not violate Appellees' constitutional rights because probable cause existed for Appellees' arrest as a matter of law. Alternatively, Appellants argue that even if they did violate Appellees' constitutional rights, the officers could have believed that their conduct was lawful because those constitutional rights were not clearly established by existing precedent. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's denial of summary judgment as to Appellees' false arrest and malicious prosecution claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Whether Appellants' Violated Appellees' Constitutional Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Appellants argue that they did not violate Appellees' constitutional rights for three reasons: (1) North Carolina's collateral estoppel doctrine prevents relitigation of the constitutional issues alleged; (2) McCollum's attorney's admission at McCollum's 1991 trial judicially estops McCollum from challenging the voluntariness of his confession; and (3) and Appellants had probable cause to arrest Appellees as a matter of law.

Specifically, Appellants argue that under North Carolina law, (1) Appellees' criminal convictions -- though later vacated, and despite Appellees receiving pardons of innocence from the governor -- conclusively establish that probable cause existed for their arrest; and (2) the state court judges' rulings on the Appellees' motions to suppress their confessions in their criminal cases conclusively\n   establish that the confessions were voluntary.

As Appellants argue, this means that Artis's criminal history and the details of Artis's 1984 trial and conviction were well known to Appellees at the time of their first trial, and \"there is no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation where 'the defense already possesses the evidence.' \" Appellants' Br. 57 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Higgs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880604\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/726/#p735\">\n    663 F.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (4th Cir. 2011) ). Further, Appellants argue that they did not suppress\n   Artis's criminal history from the district attorney since he was already aware of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Appellants' arguments are unconvincing. Appellees' claim is not that Appellants should have turned over Artis's rap sheet, but that once the officers identified Artis as a suspect -- particularly in light of other evidence that pointed to Artis as the perpetrator of the crime -- they were obligated to disclose this exculpatory information. The fact that Artis's rap sheet was public information, the district attorney was aware of Artis's crimes, or that a member of the defense team was an attorney for Artis is not enough to disclose to Appellees that\n   <em>\n    the officers\n   </em>\n   , in the course of their investigation, recognized the similarities between Buie's murder and Artis's crimes and identified Artis as a suspect. Indeed, the fact that the same district attorney prosecuted Artis in a different rape and murder case does not mean that district attorney should have known that Artis was a suspect in Buie's rape and murder. It is the officers' job to investigate the crime and identify suspects, not the prosecutor's. The same is true for Attorney Strickland: the connection between Artis and one of Appellees' counsel is not enough to show that Appellees possessed the relevant information about Artis. Even if Strickland noticed the similarities between the crimes, he had no way to know that Appellants had considered Artis a suspect in Buie's murder, which is the key evidence Appellants failed to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Appellants' motion for summary judgment as to their failure to disclose evidence that Artis committed similar crimes in the same area and during the same time period as Buie's rape and murder, and that Artis was considered a suspect in the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    Richards's Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   As for Richards's statement to Detectives Sealey and Locklear that she had seen Artis attack Buie the night Buie went missing, we conclude that the evidence was clearly material, and a reasonable jury could conclude that it was suppressed by Appellants in bad faith. Indeed, the stark difference between what Richards alleges she told the officers and the two officers' interview notes supports the conclusion that if Appellees' allegations are true, this evidence was suppressed and obscured by Appellants. Neither set of interview notes from the officers mentions Artis, or the fact that Richards was an eye-witness to the crime. Instead, Detective Sealey's notes say Richards reported that she saw \"three (3) Indian males at Hardin's Grocery at this time and one (1) of the Indian males was talking rough to [Buie],\" J.A. 1595, whereas Detective Locklear's notes indicate only that the interview generated \"negative results,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Appellants argue that Appellees cannot establish a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation on these facts because Appellants disclosed that they interviewed Richards, and Detective Sealey's notes indicated that Richards stated she had seen Buie shortly before the crime with \"three (3) Indian males,\" one of which was \"talking rough\" to Buie. J.A. 1595. But viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Appellees, Sealey's notes egregiously mischaracterized the content of Richards's statement. This was insufficient to insulate Appellants from liability for a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, even if the fact of Richards's interview was disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Here, if Appellees' assertions are true, Appellants intentionally fabricated, obscured, and failed to disclose the most relevant and exculpatory evidence in the case: the statement from an eye-witness\n   affirmatively identifying a\n   <em>\n    different suspect\n   </em>\n   as Buie's attacker. Accordingly, Appellees adequately alleged that Appellants failed to comply with their\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   disclosure obligations, and that they did so in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <em>\n    Remaining Due Process Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In addition to the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   -based claims, Appellees raise three due process claims: (1) Appellants unconstitutionally coerced a witness, L.P. Sinclair, to testify falsely; (2) Appellees' confessions were unconstitutionally coerced (which violated Appellees' right to due process in addition to their Fourth Amendment rights); and (3) Appellants in bad faith failed to adequately investigate the crime. Appellants argue that each of these claims fails as a matter of law. For the reasons explained below, Appellants are incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    Coerced, False Testimony by L.P.

As Appellees allege, \"[t]his, combined with Sinclair's youth (age 16), along with the other evidence of [Appellants'] bad faith, suggest that Sinclair's statements were coerced or fabricated.\" Appellees' Br. 52 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Appellees, Appellants' assertion that Sinclair's testimony was voluntary as a matter of law is unsupported by the record. And whether any Appellants were present on October 5, 1984, when Sinclair changed his story to implicate McCollum, is a question of fact for a jury to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    Coerced Confessions by Appellees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In its decision, the district court suggested that the use of Appellees' confessions, if coerced, may violate Appellees' rights to due process. To the extent Appellees assert a due process claim on this basis, Appellants' arguments that these confessions were voluntary as a matter of law fail for the same reasons explained above. Further, like the district court, we conclude that Appellees' incarceration was a clearly foreseeable result of the alleged fabrication of Appellees' confessions. Accordingly, if Appellees' allegations are true, they have demonstrated both but-for and proximate causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156731\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/343/#p354\">\n    759 F.3d at 354-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    Failure to Adequately Investigate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Finally, Appellees assert that Appellants violated Appellees' right to due process by failing to sufficiently investigate Artis and Sinclair in connection with Buie's rape and murder.
