Nields,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">for the complainant, read the provisions of the American will relating to the real estate in question and also those of the English will reciting the same, and giving more specific directions as to the persons to whom the residue of the estate in America was to be paid. He also read the provision of the English will directing the sale and conversion into money of his property in England and the direction that his trustees should stand possessed of such proceeds of sale \u201cand also of the proceeds of sale and all other moneys here directed to be paid by the executor of my American will as aforesaid, all of which proceeds of sale and the rest of my estate and the investments for the time being representing the'same, are hereinafter collectively referred to as \u2018my trust fund\u2019 upon the trusts following.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">He contended that from these words the executor of the American will had a power of sale of the property in Newport, which had been devised to the testator\u2019s wife for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">The testamentary writing dated January 31, 1891, designated by the testator as his \u201cAmerican will,\u201d and the testamentary writing dated January 9, 1893, designated by the testator as his \u201cEnglish will,\u201d form together the last will and testament of William M. Parkin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">1. \u2014The two papers expressly refer in the main to the disposition of different properties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">2. \u2014The second paper expressly refers to, incorporates and ratifies the provisions of the first paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-11\">It is not essential that the last will of the testator be expressed in a single instrument. And there may be several papers of different natures and forms, constituting a will when taken together. <em>Schouler on Wills, (2d Ed.) sec. </em>280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>If the subsequent testamentary instrument is only partly inconsistent with one of earlier date the former instrument is revoked only as to those parts which are inconsistent, and are both entitled to probate. 29 <em>A. &amp; E. Ency. L. </em>303, <em>note </em>1, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">The fact that the subsequent instrument is described as the testator\u2019s \u201clast will and testament\u201d is entitled to very little weight. <em>LeMage vs. Goodban, L. R. </em>1 <em>P. &amp; D. </em>57; 29 <em>A. &amp; E. Ency. L. </em>302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">The testator directed a conversion of his real estate in America and bequeathed the proceeds thereof to cert\u00e1in beneficiaries in England.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">In order to work a conversion there must be either (1) a positive direction to sell; or (2) an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will; or (3) such a blending of real and personal estate by the testator in his will as to clearly show that he intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath the said fund as money. <em>Hunt\u2019s Appeal, </em>105 <em>Pa. St. </em>128, 141; <em>Peterson\u2019s Appeal, </em>88 <em>Pa. St. </em>397, 402; 2 <em>Woerner\u2019s Am. Law of Adm., sec. </em>342, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">Since the testator\u2019s intention must govern, if it can be ascertained from his language, the rule is equally applicable whether there be an express direction to convert or whether a conversion is necessarily impli\u00e9d. <em>Chandler\u2019s Appeal, </em>34 <em>Wis. </em>505; <em>Lent vs. Howard, </em>89 <em>N.

Parkin, deceased, and the paper writing executed by him in England, under date of January 9, 1893, proved in England as his last will and testament, together constitute the last will and testament of the said William M. Parkin, deceased, it appearing that the execution of the paper writing proved as a will in England is a sufficient execution under our own statute; and he was of opinion that it appears, upon consideration of the entire will, composed of the said two paper writings, to have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>intention of the testator that the real estate in the town of Newport, Delaware, described' in the bill, should be sold, and that an implied power of sale was thereby conferred upon and vested in the complainant, as trustee, who was thereby authorized and directed and empowered to sell the same and to distribute the proceeds of such sale as directed by the said last will and testament, .(the English will) and a decree was entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
