It belongs to that class of' cases which regulate the forms of administering justice by the courts. It is intended solely to facilitate the dispatch of business by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and is an incident of sovereignty presumed to be reserved in the enactment of all charters.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-5\">Where a town charter authorized not only the laying out of new streets, but the widening of streets already opened, but made no provision for the condemnation of land necessary for the widening of such streets, and an ordinance was passed widening a street; and subsequently to the passage of the ordinance the power of condemnation was conferred by an amendment to the charter; <em>held, </em>that the whole power of the Council at the time, was exercised by its adoption of the ordinance, which had the same effect as a statute fixing the width of the street; and when the power to exercise the right of eminent domain was subsequently conferred, condemnation proceedings regularly instituted and carried through were valid and effective.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">Injunction Bill.\u2014The complainants were owners of land in the town of Newark, in New Castle County, who sought to restrain the Council of Newark from taking portions of their land under the power of eminent domain for the purpose of widening a street. The Council, under the town charter, assessed the damages and from that assessment the complainants appealed by filing an' application in writing to Chief Justice Lore for the appointment of freeholders to assess the damages. The application to the Chief Justice was made upon the theory that he had jurisdiction of the matter under the statute by reason of the absence from the State of the resident judge of the county. The commissioners appointed by the Chief Justice made awards and afterwards, the complainants being dissatisfied therewith, upon notice to the president of the Council; made an application to the Associate Judge resident in New Castle County for the appointment of commissioners, they having then adopted the theory that in the resident Judge alone was vested the power to act in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">The application to the resident Judge was not acted upon and the town Council partially entered upon the premises in question, and were notified by the complainants, through their counsel, that they were trespassing.

The ownership by the complainants of the land in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">2.

Lore, Chief Justice, for the appointment of five freeholders to go upon the lands and assess the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">3.

The Council entered upon and occupied a part of the lands \u201cwithout the consent and against the will of the complainants,\u201d and \u201cintends to and will, unless restrained therefrom by the Chancellor, further enter upon and occupy\u201d the said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">6. That at its regular stated meeting on August 5,1891, a petition signed by thirteen freeholders of the town was presented to the respondent, requesting it to widen the Main street of the town, and at said meeting an alleged ordinance was introduced in and read twice by the Council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">7. At a special meeting of said Council, pursuant to a call recited in the minutes thereof, on August 12, 1891, the alleged ordinance so proposed on August 5, was adopted-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">8. The said alleged ordinance adopted on August 12, 1891, was not recorded in a book provided by Council for that purpose and called \u201cOrdinances,\u201d until August 1, 1895, and it was so recorded at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">9. The complainants within ten days after receiving notice of the intention to widen the street and the amount of damages allowed thereon, served written notice on the president of the Council to that effect, and within ten days after the expiration of the ten days allowed for appealings, made written application to the Honorable Ignatius C. .Grubb, Associate Resident Judge of New Castle County, for the appointment of commissioners to assess damages, under Chap. 175, Vol. 18, Laws of Delaware, and the amendments thereto, being Chap. 174, Vol. 19, which written application has never been presented to him in person, but was deposited in the office of the Prothonotary in New Castle County and by him marked filed. It was admitted that Judge Grubb was absent from the County and State from May 24, 1895, until after the filing of the bill, but that he is now, and has been for upwards of three months, within the County and State, and in good health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">10. It was admitted for the purpose of argument, that part of the premises taken for widening Main street ran along the whole front of the said two lots, a distance of 167 feet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that there is erected on lot No. la handsome and commodious mansion house where the complainants now reside, and have all their lives resided, and which has for generations been the home of complainant\u2019s ancestors; that on the land in front of said mansion and on part of the land sought to be taken are ornamental shrubbery and shade trees of many years growth, the loss of which, and the unlawful appropriation of them, would destroy the privacy, comfort and quietude of said mansion as a place of residence, which loss it would be impracticable to adequately determine, and that said appropriation would result in irreparable damages to the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">11. On July 19, 1895, the complainants, through their attorneys, served written notice upon the respondent that they were trespassing upon the lands of the complainants and notified them to abstain from entering on or occupying the same, or any portion thereof, for the purpose of widening Main street, or for any other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">12. Notwithstanding the said notice, the respondent continued in its occupation of the portion of the land, and threatened and intended to widen the Main street under the proceedings aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">13. The questions submitted by the case stated, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">(1) Was the alleged petition of freeholders presented to The Council of Newark on August 5th, 1891, as set forth in the agreement of facts, sufficient under the various Acts of Assembly incorporating the town of Newark?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">(2) Were all the formalities and prerequisites for the adoption of an ordinance by The Council of Newark under which the said Council is attempting to appropriate the said land 'complied with, and was said Ordinance properly adopted ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">(3) Did the failure of the Secretary of The Council of Newark to record the ordinance, under which the defendant is 'attempting to appropriate said land, in a book called \u201cOrdinances\u201d until August 1st, 1895, entitle the Complainants to maintain their Bill for an Injunction?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(4) Was the appointment, of the commission to assess the damages to the Complainants, by the Honorable Charles B.

Lore, Chief Justice, for the appointment of a commission as aforesaid?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">14. It was agreed that if after argument the Chancellor should be of opinion that the action of the Council of Newark in entering upon and occupying the lands described was lawful and that the complainants had not a right to maintain their bill, then a decree should be made dismissing the bill with costs. But if the Chancellor should be of opinion that the entering upon and occupation of the premises by the respondent was unlawful, and that the complainants had a right to maintain their bill, then a decree should be made perpetually restraining the Council of Newark from further entering upon and occupying the said premises, and that the respondents should pay the costs; the decree in each case to be as if heard on bill and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">The statute, under color of which the proceedings of the respondent were taken, was Sec. 38 of the town charter of the town of Newark, being 18 <em>Del.

Laws, Ch. </em>744.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">Under the said amended section, it was provided that when the Council should determine to lay out any new street etc., or to widen any street, etc., it should be their duty to notify in writing the owner of the lands through or over which the same was to go, and state the amount of damages or compensation allowed to the owner. If the owner should be dissatisfied with the amount, he had a right to appeal within ten days, by serving written notice thereof on the president of the Council, and within ten days after the expiration of the ten days allowed for appealings, the owner should make written application to the- Associate Judge resident in New Castl\u00e9 County for the appointment of commissioners to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the damages. Provisions were made for the assessment of damages, and return, and for filling vacancies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">The amount of damages must be paid or tendered within a month, if the owner be a resident, but the Council had the option to pay the damages within that time and to proceed with the improvement, or, upon payment of costs only, abandon the improvement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">The first application of the complainants for a commission was made to the Chief Justice under color of an Act concerning the judiciary, 20 <em>Del. </em>Laws, 184, which provided, \u201cThat during the illness or absence from his County of any Associate Judge, the powers and duties required by any statute of this State to be exercised and performed by him in relation to ********** or the proceedings for condemnation of property to be taken or applied to any municipal or other public use, may be as fully and effectually exercised and performed in all respects by the Chief Justice, or any other Associate Judge of this State, as by the said resident Judge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The award of damages by the commission not being satisfactory to the complainants, they declined to accept the same and, as appears from the argument, took the position that the Chief Justice had no power to act in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">The case came to a hearing on the agreed statement of facts, and the agreement of counsel that it should be heard as if upon bill, answer and proofs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-9\"><em>Charles B.

At that time the law made no provision for the assessment of damages to the abutting property owners, the Council, therefore, could proceed to appropriate the property of abutting owners only by an amicable adjustment of the damages. 18 <em>Del.

The minutes of the Council show that the ordinance in question was read twice at a stated meeting held August 5, 1891, and passed with the concurrence of a majority of the members at a subsequent meeting on August 12, 1891, This was a strict compliance with the law and requirements of the charter. 18 <em>Del.

The minutes of the special meeting show that its object was indicated with sufficient accuracy to notify all the members of the matters to be considered.

The commission issued by the Chief Justice appointing freeholders to assess the -damages was valid, under the Act of April 12, 1895, 20 <em>Del. Laws </em>184, <em>ch. </em>118. In so far as the act operates as an amendment to the charter of the town, it does not contravene the Constitution of the United States; since it is well settled in this state that municipal corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tians are revocable and subject to alteration at the pleasure of the Legislature and are not contracts within the prohibitory clause of the Constitution of the United States. <em>P.

Was the alleged petition of freeholders, presented to The Council of Newark on August 5, 1891, as set forth in the agreement of facts, sufficient under the various acts of Assembly incorporating the Town of Newark?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">This petition did comply in every particular with the requirements of the charter, 18 <em>Del. Laws </em>322, <em>ch. </em>175, <em>sec. </em>37, which section has not been affected by any subsequent amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">\u201cSecond. Were all the formalities and prerequisites for the adoption of an ordinance by The Council of Newark, under which the said Council has attempted to appropriate the said land, complied with, and was such ordinance properly adopted. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Counsel for the complainants urged that this ordinance was not properly adopted because it was passed at a special meeting, the call for which did not specify the adoption of the ordinance as one of the purposes for which the meeting was called.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The charter, <em>sec. </em>13, provides that Council shall \u201cmeet at least once in every month at such time or times and place as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>it shall appoint. Special meetings may be called, by the president of Council upon his own motion, or shall be called at the request of three members,\u201d It further provides that \u201cno ordinance shall be passed without the concurrence of a majority of the members of the Council, and unless it shall have had at least two readings at a previous stated meeting or meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The ordinance in question was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201cBe it Ordained by the Council of Newark, that Main Street of Newark, Delaware, between the eastern boundary line thereof and the Baltimore and Philadelphia railroad tracks, shall be of the uniform width of forty feet between curb lines and that the width of the pavements on Main Street in the town of Newark shall be six feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">This ordinance was read twice at a stated meeting held August 5, 1891, at which the petition above referred to was presented; and the call for the special meeting at which the ordinance was adopted stated, <em>inter aha, </em>that the meeting was called \u201cfor the purpose of consulting in regard to the question of damages for widening the street front of property of Benjamin Caulk estate,\u201d which is the property in dispute in this .cause, and it appears from the agreed statement of facts that it is situated on that portion of Main street to which the ordinance refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">I am of opinion, in view of the facts presented by the case stated, that it might be fairly understood from this notice that the passage of the ordinance, which had been read twice the week before, at the last regular stated meeting, was one of the purposes or objects for which the meeting was called.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">This is all that is required from a notice or a warrant for a special meeting, as is laid down by Judge Dillon in his authoritative work on municipal corporations, <em>Vol. 1, sec. </em>267, and the authorities are in accord upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u201cThird. Did the failure of the secretary of the Council of Newark to record the ordinance, under which the defendant is attempting to appropriate said land, in a book called \u2018Ordinances\u2019 until August 1, 1895, entitle the complainants to maintain their bill for an injunction?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Section 16 of the charter, 18 <em>Del. Laws </em>313, <em>ch. </em>175, provides, <em>inter alla, </em>that \u201che (the secretary) shall have in his charge the Ordinances, which shall be recorded in a book or or books provided, by Council for that purpose and called \u2018Ordinances,\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This is clearly directory and not a condition upon which depends the validity of the ordinance, so that the secretary\u2019s delay in recording the disputed ordinance until August 1, 1895, in no way affected its validity. 1 <em>Dill. Mun. Corp. sec. </em>335; <em>Trustees of the Erie Academy vs. City of Erie, </em>31 <em>Pa. St. </em>515; <em>Upington vs. Oviatt, </em>24 <em>0. St. </em>232, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In the cases cited by complainants\u2019 counsel, recording or publication was expressly made a condition precedent to the validity of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u201cFourth. Was the appointment of the commissioners to assess the damages to the complainants by Honorable Charles B. Lore, Chief Justice, according to law?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">It is provided in the charter, <em>sec. </em>38, \u201cAnd if any owner or owners shall be dissatisfied with the amount of the damages or compensation allowed by said council, he, she or they may within ten days after said notice is received, appeal from the assessment of damages or compensation aforesaid by serving on the president of said council, a written notice to that effect, and said owner or owners shall with (in) ten days after <em>the </em>expiration of the ten days allowed for appealings, and upon ten days notice to the president aforesaid, make written application to the associate judge of the superior court, resident of New Castle County, for the appointment of commissioners to hear and determine the matter in controversy; and thereupon the associate judge aforesaid, shall issue a commission under his hand, directed to five freeholders of said county, two of whom shall be residents of said town, commanding them to assess the damages which the owner or owners of said, lands through or over which said street, lane or alley is to pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Subsequently, April 12, 1893, a general statute was passed, 20 <em>Del. Laws </em>184, <em>ch. </em>118, which provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cThat during the illness or absence from his county of any associate judge the powers and duties required by any statute of this State to be exercised and performed by him in relation to the discharge of prisoners and convicts under Section 10, Chapter 133 of the Revised Code, the issue of fractional liquor licenses, the approval of assignment of liquor licenses, or the proceedings for the condemnation of property to be taken or applied to any municipal or other public use, may be as fully and effectually exercised and performed in all respects by the Chief Justice, or any other associate judge of this State, as by the said resident judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">1 The complainants being dissatisfied with the amount of damages or compensation allowed by the Council of Newark took their appeal in the manner provided by section 38 of the charter of Newark, above quoted, except that the Associate Justice, Honorable Ignatius C, Grubb, being at the time absent from the county, they made their application to the Chief Justice in accordance with the provisions of the general statute quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Counsel for the complainant now urges that the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction and his appointment of freeholders to assess damages was void, inasmuch as the general statute empowering him to act in the absence of the Associate Justice was an amendment to the charter of Newark, and, therefore, void, because it does not appear to have been enacted by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">A general provision of this nature, however, cannot be considered an amendment to the charter of any municipality. It belongs to that class of acts which regulate the forms of administering justice by the Court. It affects in no other respect the proceedings for condemnation prescribed in the charter of the town of Newark, nor does it in the slightest particular alter the rights conferred upon the town by its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">General legislation of this character allowing one Justice of the higher courts to act in the absence of another, solely to facilitate the dispatch of business by the Courts, is univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>sally held to be an incident of sovereignity presumed to be reserved in the enactment of all charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u201cFifth. Are the complainants precluded from seeking a remedy by injunction after having applied to Honorable Charles B. Lore, Chief Justice, for the appointment of a commission as aforesaid?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">What I have already stated in my consideration of the preceding questions render it unnecessary to consider this last question.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">There still remains to be considered one other contention which was strongly urged by complainants\u2019 counsel, although not specifically formulated as one of the questions submitted, it being urged by him that it was a defect lying at the bottom of the whole condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">At the time of the adoption of the ordinance widening Main street, power to widen was expressly conferred upon the Council by <em>section </em>37, but the power to condemn land for laying out new streets, squares, lanes or alleys, given in the following <em>section </em>38, was not made to include the power to condemn land for the widening of streets etc., already opened. This additional power was given by the amendment to the charter passed January 31, 1893, being <em>chapter </em>744, <em>Vol. </em>19, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>and it is the contention of the complainants\u2019 counsel that the Council, having no authority to condemn land for the widening of Main Street at the time of the adoption of the ordinance of August 12, 1891, the amendment of 1893, could not confer upon them the power to condemn under an ordinance which was adopted prior to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The authorities cited by counsel in support of this contention deal with delays occurring between the different steps in condemnation proceedings, but the question here presented is quite different.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The whole power to widen Main Street possessed by the Council of Newark at the time, was exercised by its adoption of the ordinance of August 12, 1891, which had the same effect as a statute, fixing\u2019the width, until it should be amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>or repealed. Then, when the power to exercise the right of eminent domain, was subsequently conferred, the condemnation proceedings regularly instituted and carried through, were independent proceedings and not connected with the ordinance determining the width of the street, otherwise than if it had been a statute determining its width. In fact, it appears that there was such a statute, although, having found the ordinance to be regular and effective, it has not been necessary for me to consider it. 16 <em>Del. Laws </em>659, <em>ch. </em>497, <em>sec. </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It follows, therefore, from the foregoing consideration of all the questions submitted and the agreed statement of facts, that the action of the Council of Newark, in entering upon and occupying the land in the statement of facts described, was lawful, and that a decree must be entered dismissing complainant\u2019s bill with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Let the decree be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
