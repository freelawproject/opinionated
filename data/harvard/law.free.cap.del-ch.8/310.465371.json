The complainants were the Mayor and Council of Wilmington, who, at the instance of the Board of Directors of the Street and Sewer Department .'f that City, filed a bill in equity, April 2, 1891, against the defendants, to restrain them from la}dng gas pipes in the streets of the City. The defendants demurred for want of proper parties, and the demurrer was heard by Chancellor <em>ad litem, </em>Henry R. Johnson, who had been appointed to that office, upon the certificate of Chancellor Wolcott that he had been of counsel for one or more of the defendants. The demurrer having been overruled by the Chancellor <em>ad litem</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendants filed their plea,with an answer in support of the same, and replication and rejoinder were entered and proofs taken. The plea was in substance that the bill did not contain proper parties, inasmuch as the defendants were officers, agents and employees of the OxyHydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, incorporated and organized and authorized to build gas works and lay gas pipes, and that the defendants were engaged in laying such pipes solely and only as officers and agents of the said company, and claimed no right in the premises otherwise. The plea averred that the said company was not, but should have been a party defendant to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">After the adoption of the new Constitution in 1\u00a797 an \u25a0application was made to the Chancellor, after his appointment under the new Constitution, for reinstatement of the case upon the regular docket of the Court of Chancery, upon the ground that by force of the Schedule to the Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the jurisdiction of the Chancellor <em>ad litem </em>was terminated.

Though it contained no limitation of the period of existence under the <em>Consktukon of </em>1831, <em>art. </em>II, <em>Sec. </em>17, it could not continue in force for a period longer than twenty years without re-enactment. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>action was taken under the charter for fourteen years after its passage and its existence must have expired April 2, 1893, before the filing of the plea, unless the corporate existence was continued by the attempt on January 28, 1892, to comply with the provision of 19 <em>Del.

Laws, Ch. </em>352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">Pursuant to that authority that Department, on April 9th, 1889, provided by general regulation when and how any person or corporation should be permitted to open the bed of a street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">By Act of May 14, 1891, passed before the attempted continuance of its corporate franchise by the Oxy-Hydrogen Company, the Legislature prohibited the opening or excavation of any highway in this State, in a city, town or village for the purpose of laying or placing wires or other conductors therein, without first obtaining the consent of the municipal authorities. 19 <em>Del.

The question of corporate existence was involved in the argument on demurrer, and the decision thereon necessarily assumed that the questions raised by the bill and the pleadings were proper for the decision of this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">(2) Upon the plea and answer now filed, the record raises the direct question of the existence and powers of this corporation, and it is submitted that as the defendants. justified their action as having been under the authority of an act of incorporation, and the powers thereby granted, the question must be determined by the Court in this case. <em>Owen vs. Sheppard, </em>8 <em>C.

Eq. </em>242, 244; <em>Booth vs. Wonderly, </em>36 <em>N. J. L. </em>250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\">(3) The reasons generally given for recognition of <em>de facto </em>corporations do not apply here, because a <em>de facto </em>corporation cannot exist without some law authorizing its formation. 1 <em>Thomp. Corp. sec. </em>505; 2 <em>id. sec. </em>1851; 2 <em>Morawetz, Corp. sec. </em>777; 2 <em>Cook, Corp. </em>637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">The question here is not of irregular or improper organization, but whether the corporation can exist under any law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of this State. We submit that it cannot, because the charter has expired by constitutional limitation and has not been revived. In such cases corporate existence can always be questioned in any proceeding. 6 <em>Thomp., Corp. secs. </em>7658 <em>to </em>7670.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">Even if the Court should consider that there are some elements of a <em>de facto </em>corporation, the general rule that such a corporation is sufficient does not apply. The defendants here claim rights in the streets of the City, which are under the control of complainant, and these rights they may claim only by a valid legislative grant. Since, therefore, the very right itself depends upon the existence of corporate authority, which is of necessity a condition precedent, and exercise of that right, the existence of the corporation may be questioned wherever and whenever a right is claimed, which can only arise by virtue of its existence. <em>New York &amp;c.

If there is proper cause for filing it, the leave will be granted of course, and the Court only examines the question so far as to see that the privilege is not abused for the purpose of delay and vexation to the defendant. <em>Eager vs. Pnce, </em>2 <em>Paige </em>333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">Upon arguing a plea alleging a want of proper parties the usual practice is, instead of allowing it, to give the complainant leave to amend the bill upon payment of costs, which liberty he may also obtain even if the plea be allowed according to the common course of the Court, for a suit is not determined by the allowance of such a plea. <em>Sto.

Ch. </em>337, 357:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-8\">\u201cI may add that the objection of the want of a party is never in the absence of gross <em>loches, </em>a fatal one. Whenever justice so requires, the Court will allow a necessary party to be made even after a hearing, upon just terms. This mode of amendment is liberally allowed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-9\"><em>Herbert H. Ward, Austin Harrington </em>and <em>C.

A charter or general law under which it might be organized, an attempt to organize, and an actual <em>user </em>of the corporate franchises. <em>Snider\u2019s Sons Co. vs. Troy, </em>91 <em>Ala. </em>224; <em>Johnson vs. Okerstrom, </em>70 <em>Minn. </em>303, 73 <em>N.

They have invoked the protection of the corporate franchises alleged to have been conferred upon the Oxy-Hydrogen Company, and the duty devolves upon them to sustain such allegation, and it is no answer to state that the plea is either double or inconsistent. If it be double, it was the privilege of the complainant to object to it on that ground, but since it has not done so, the defendants cannot avail themselves of any defect in their to its extent, that is to so much of the billas is covered by it, own plea. <em>Beach.

Whether an answer in this case is proper or not, it is now too late to consider, but it is, in such a case, always subsidiary to the purposes of the plea; <em>Sto. Eiq. Pl. secs. </em>670, 671, 673, and 697, and is never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>any part of the defense made by it; 1 <em>Dan. Ch. Prac. </em>624.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-5\">It is to be considered that the complainant has not set this plea down for argument, for it is sufficient in law to have joined issue on it, as to the facts therein alleged. It is therefore incumbent upon the defendants to est\u00e1blish the truth of that plea as pleaded, and this is the only matter before the Chancellor, for where issue is taken upon a plea the truth of the plea is-the only subject in question remaining so far as the plea extends, and nothing but the matters contained in the plea, as'to so much of the bill as the plea covers, is in issue between the parties. If therefore issue is thus taken upon the plea, the defendants must prove the facts it suggests. <em>Sto. Eq. Pl. sec. </em>697; <em>Milf. Eq. Pl.

It alleges that the respondents named in the bill are the officers, agents, and employees of the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware; \u201cthat the said company is a duly incorporated corporation of the State of Delaware, duly organized under its charter, and properly authorized to build gas works and lay gas pipes in the streets of the city of Wilmington; that the said defendants above named were engaged in the laying of pipes, as set out in the bill of complaint, solely and only as the officers, agents, and employees \u00aef the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, and claim no right to lay such pipes save and only by and through the authority and direction of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, yet the said complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ant has not made the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware a party defendant to the said bill, although said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware ought to have been made a defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This plea, if found to be sustained by the answer and proofs in the cause, discloses a. fatal objection to the bill as it now stands, and would entitle the respondents to a decree dismissing the bill, or an order, in accordance with the established precedents of the Court of Chancery in such cases, for the cause to stand over, with liberty to the complainants to amend their bill by making the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defense made by that plea has been already made in the progress of this cause by demurrer, and the demurrer overruled by Chancellor <em>ad litem, </em>Henry R. Johnson. The Chancellor <em>ad litem, </em>in his opinion overruling the demurrer, analyzed the case as it was presented to him, and reviewed the allegations of the bill; but there is so much that is exceptional in the history of this cause, and in the manner in which the complicated and important questions it involves have been presented to the Court, that it is impossible to arrive at a clear comprehension of the issues actually presented at this stage of the long litigation, without a review of the whole case from the filing of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The complainants, the Mayor and Council of Wilmington, at the instance of Joseph L.

After a hearing upon the said rule, the rule was discharged, the preliminary injunction continued until further order of the Chancellor, and leave granted to amend the bill.

In the meantime the late Chancellor Saulsbury died, and on the 5th day of May, 1892, the Honorable James L. Wolcott was appointed Chancellor to succeed him. Owing to the fact that Chancellor Wolcott had been of counsel for one of the defendants, the Honorable Henry R. Johnson was appointed Chancellor <em>ad litem </em>to hear and determine this cause. On the 28th day of June, 1893, the defendants filed their demurrer to the bill, as above stated, and set forth for cause of demurrer that \u201cit appears by said complainants\u2019 bill that the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware therein named, is a necessary party to the said bill, inasmuch as it is therein stated, in the fifth paragraph thereof, that the said Oxy-Hydrogen 'Company of the State of Delaware, by its counsel, had notified the Board of Directors of the Street and Sewer Department that it was its intention, on the 31st day of March, A. D. 1891, to begin laying gas pipes in the streets of the said City of Wilmington; that, by the sixth paragraph thereof, it is further alleged that the present defendants claim to be officers, servants, and agents of said company in the opening and excavation of Liberty Street, in said City, as therein set forth; that, -by the seventh and eighth paragraphs of said bill, it appears that the said company was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly of the State of Delaware, a copy of which act is to said bill attached, and that said defendants claim to be acting thereunder; that, by the ninth paragraph and other paragraphs of said bill, it is alleged that, even if said company is possessed of a legal organization, it would not have any right or authority under said act, without the permission of said Board of Directors of the Street and Sewer Department, to enter upon, open, or excavate any of the streets of said City for the purpose of laying gas pipes therein; that it further generally appears by said bill that the whole scope and object of said bill is the determination of the rights and powers of said company under the said char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ter to lay gas pipes in the streets of said City of Wilmington, and that the result and effect of said suit will be to judicially determine the rights and powers of said company under its said charter, but the said complainant has not made the OxyHydrogen Company of the State of Delaware a party to said bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">After hearing arguments of counsel, the Chancellor <em>ad htem </em>rendered his decision, overruling the demurrer, on the 24th day of November, 1893, and in his opinion said as follows: \u201cIt is undoubtedly true that whenever a want of proper parties appears on the face of the bill, the proper mode to take advantage of the objection is by a demurrer. <em>Mitf. Ch. PI. &amp; Prac. </em>206.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cDoes it appear on the face of the bill filed in this cause \u25a0 that the complainant has failed or omitted to make a party defendant who ought to have been made such?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cWhile it is true that the complainant in certain paragraphs of the bill, which are fully set forth above, refers to a certain alleged corporation, called the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, yet at the same time [it] in no way recognizes in said paragraph, or in any other parts of the bill, the valid or legal existence of such a corporation as the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, but on the contrary, expressly charges that no legal or valid organization of said company has ever been effected. It nowhere appearing on the face of the bill that there is in existence a corporation possessing a valid legal organization by the name of the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, but a corporation by that name, possessing a legal or valid organization, being expressly denied by the bill, I do not see how a demurrer for want of proper parties would properly lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cBy demurring to the bill instead of adopting some other course of pleading, the defendants have necessarily admitted the proof of the matters and facts contained in the bill, and as it is alleged in the bill that no legal or valid organization of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>has ever been effected, the effect of the demurrer is to admit the truth of such allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u201cIf it is the object and purpose of the defendants to controvert the allegations contained in the bill, they should do so by some other mode of pleading than by demurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cAs it is my opinion that this demurrer should be overruled for the reason above given, I have not thought it necessary to deal with many of the questions discussed at the argument, especially as most of them will more appropriately arise at some subsequent stage of the cause, when the cause shall be at issue upon the proper pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201cThe demurrer must be overruled, and leave is granted to the defendants to plead or answer.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Upon the 13th of January, 1894, the defendants filed the plea which I have cited above, and an answer in support of the plea, setting up the same defense in another form. To this plea the complainant replied, filing its replication <em>gratis, </em>on the 14th of March, 1894. A rule for commissions on both sides was entered, Samuel A. Macallister being appointed examiner to take testimony, and the cause subsequently came to a hearing before Chancellor <em>ad litem, </em>Johnson. Before he had rendered his decision in the cause, a Constitutional Convention was held in the State of Delaware, and anew Constitution went into effect on the 10th day of June, 1897. This Constitution provided, in section 9 of the Schedule, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u201cAll the Courts of Justic\u00e9 now existing shall continue with their present jurisdiction, and the Chancellor and Judges shall continue in office until the tenth day of June, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, upon which day the said Courts shall be abolished, and the offices of the said Chancellor and Judges shall expire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Upon the 10th day of June, 1897, I was duly appointed Chancellor under the new Constitution, and thereupon the defendants filed in the Court of Chancery a petition praying that this cause should be re-instated upon the regular docket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of the Court, and a day appointed for the rehearing of the cause by the Chancellor, upon the ground that the office and duties of the said Chancellor <em>ad htem </em>had been abolished by the Constitution of the State of Delaware recently adopted, and there was no legal or equitable reason why the present Chancellor should not take cognizance of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Upon this petition, I ordered a rule to issue, directed to the Mayor and Council of Wilmington, and William Simmons, William A. Pratt, and Ayers S. Webster, at that time members of the Street and Sewer Department for the City of Wilmington, the complainant in the cause, and to the Honorable Henry R. Johnson, the said Chancellor <em>ad </em>htem, requiring them to show cause why the said cause should not be reinstated upon the regular docket of the Court, and a day apr pointed for a rehearing before the Chancellor. This rule was made returnable on the 13th day of September, A. D. 1897.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">After hearing argument of counsel for the respective parties, I granted the prayer of the petition, and on the 11th day of October, 1897, ordered the case put upon the regular calendar. <em>Ante p. </em>147.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The cause first came to a hearing before me in July, 1898. Supplementary briefs were afterwards filed by consent of counsel on both sides, and a further argument had in February, 1899, on points not discussed by counsel in their former arguments or briefs, and upon which counsel on both sides desired to be heard before a decision should be rendered. The briefs filed and the arguments made by the numerous counsel engaged in this cause during the eight years of litigation so abnormally prolonged, constitute, when taken together (and they are all submitted to me by consent of counsel), a veritable monument of industry and legal research. Although these briefs and arguments are both interesting and instructive, yet they contain much that would only be considered in <em>quo warranta </em>proceedings, and much that would only be relevant upon pleadings which brought the cause before the'Court upon its merits, for final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Several c\u00e1ses analogous to the present one, in the one respect that the attempt has been made to enjoin persons as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>individuals from performing acts which they sought to justify on the ground that they were acting as officers of a corporation whose valid existence was denied, have been decided by the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, and by the courts of New York, sitting as courts of equity, and have been cited and discussed at length by counsel. <em>In re Brooklyn, W. &amp; N. Ry. Co., </em>72 <em>N. Y. </em>245, 75 <em>N. Y. </em>335; <em>Brooklyn Steam Transit Co. vs. City of Brooklyn, </em>78 <em>N. Y. </em>524; <em>New York Cable Co. vs. Mayor, etc., of New York, </em>104 <em>N. Y. </em>1, 10 <em>N. E. </em>332; <em>In re New York, L. &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>35 <em>Hun. </em>226; 99 <em>N. Y. </em>12, 1 <em>N. E. </em>27; <em>Gas Co. vs. Dwight, </em>29 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>244. But all these cases came before the courts upon bill and answer for a hearing on the merits, and the courts proceeded to decide finally upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the cause before me, however, the defendants, instead of answering, have chosen to file a plea of want of parties,\u2014 a mode of pleading rare in this jurisdiction, but one for which there is abundant English authority, controlling in the Court of Chancery of Delaware, and furnishing precedents by which the rules and principles governing the plea are well established and defined. Mitford says: \u2018 \u2018 Though a plaintiff may be fully entitled to the relief he prays, and the defendant may havd no claim to the protection of the court, which ought to prevent its interference, yet the defendant may object to the bill if it is deficient to answer the purpose of complete justice. This is usually for want of proper parties, and, if the defect is not apparent on the face of the bill, the defendant may plead the matter necessary to show it.\u201d <em>Mitf. Ch. PI. &amp; Prac. (6th Am. from 5th Eng. Ed.) </em>324, <em>(marginal </em>280). He further says <em>(page </em>353): \u201cIf the plea is, upon argument, held to be good, or the plaintiff admits it to be so by replying to it, the truth of the plea is the only subject of question remaining, so far as the plea extends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In the cause pending, complainant has replied. Counsel have discussed at some length the requisites of a good plea, the function and effect of the answer in support of the plea, and of the proof, but I do not consider it necessary to review their discussion. The whole subject is elementary, and is so ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>haustively treated by Mr. Mitford in his chapter on the plea, which is authoritative, that in this jurisdiction there is no need to go beyond it. In fact, I consider it to be practically conceded by counsel, and it is unquestionably true, that the question of the existence (whether <em>de jure </em>or only <em>de facto) </em>of the alleged corporation called the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware is at last properly before this Court, and that it is the only question before the Court that is seriously contested. Indeed, it is obvious from the citations, which I have made already from the pleadings, etc., that, if there be such a corporation as the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, it is a necessary party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The final argument made before me in February, 1899, was partly upon the question whether the corporate existence, thus put at issue, was merely its existence as a corporation <em>de facto, </em>or whether it was within the competence of this Court to pass also upon the question of its existence <em>de jure, </em>in determining whether or not it was a necessary party to the suit. At the same time counsel for the complainant laid the greatest stress upon their contention that the alleged Oxy-Hydrogen Company was not even a corporation <em>de facto. </em>In Thompson\u2019s Commentaries on the Law of Corporations the general rule is laid down, \u201cthat when a corporation has an existence <em>de facto </em>the rightfulness of its existence can only be questioned by the State, and cannot be questioned collaterally in a litigation between it and a private party,\u201d 1 <em>Thomp. Corp. sec. </em>511, at least a hundred cases being cited in illustration and support. Judge Strong, subsequently one of the justices of the United States Supreme Court, spoke to the same effect in <em>Cochran vs. Arnold, </em>58 <em>Pa. St. </em>405, saying: \u201cIf there is anything settled, it is that the corporate existence of a corporation <em>de facto, </em>cannot be inquired into collaterally. Upon this subject the authorities are too numerous to admit of citation.\u201d It is only by <em>quo warranta </em>proceedings in the name of the State that its right to exist can be determined. This is indisputable, and is not denied by counsel for complainant, as a general proposition. The apparent exceptions, as in the cases where the aid of the courts is invoked by corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>seeking to condemn land, or obtain certain other special rights, rest upon principles that in no way conflict with the general rule. The modern cases illustrating and discriminating these principles are almost innumerable, and counsel upon both sides have spared no pains in their examination, classification, and analysis, but to discuss the principles and distinctions to be deduced from the cases in advance of the careful examination of what is really presented by the indisputable facts in the cause before me would be to provide matters suitable for a special treatise perhaps, but irrelevant to the- decision of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">I will first consider, then, what are the grounds upon which the complainant contends that the alleged Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware is not a corporation, either <em>de facto </em>or <em>de jure. </em>The regularity and validity of the act of incorporation passed April 3, 1873, is not disputed, and, although the bill alleges that \u201cyour orator is informed, believes, and charges that no legal or valid organization has ever been effected,\u201d it is proved beyond a doubt by the answer in support of the plea and the proofs which give every step in detail, that a legal and vaild organization was effected under the charter. In fact, this objection has apparently been abandoned by complainant\u2019s counsel in the course of the argument. But it further appears in the answer, in support of the plea and defendants\u2019 proofs, that upon January 25, 1892, nine months after the filing of the bill, at a special meeting of the stockholders of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company, it was resolved, by a unanimous vote of the stockholders of the said company, to take advantage of an act passed February 5, 1891, entitled \u201cAn act to revive private acts and extend the time of recording the same,\u201d which provided, <em>inter alla, </em>\u201cthat all unpublished acts heretofore passed which have not by special acts been repealed or become void by lapse of the time for which they were limited, be and the same are hereby specially renewed and re-enacted, and together with the provisions therein contained are respectively declared to be in full force henceforth fora like period, as that provided for in the original act,\u201d etc.; being 19 <em>Del. Laws </em>26, <em>ch. </em>15. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>further appears in the answer and proof, that upon the 28th day of January, 1892, the said company procured a certified copy of the act of incorporation under the great seal of the State of Delaware, under the hand of D. T. Marvel, then Secretary of State, after having given due notice of the intention of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware to take advantage of the act above referred to, said notice being filed in the office of the Secretary of State, at Dover, and upon February 1, 1892, the said certified copy of the act of incorporation was duly recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds at Dover.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Upon these facts thus appearing in the defendants\u2019 answer in support of the plea, the complainant\u2019s counsel claim that the charter of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company expired by the twenty years constitutional limitation, in 1893, and that it was not revived by the act above cited, passed February 5, 1891. No time was limited in the original act of incorporation of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company; it was upon its face perpetual; but complainant\u2019s counsel argue that it expired by constitutional limitation in 1893, and was not renewed by the act of February, 1891, for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">First, because the act renewed and re-enacted the class of acts specified in it \u201c for a like period as that provided for in the original act,\u201d and, no period being provided in the act incorporating the Oxy-Hydrogen Company, the renewing act could not apply to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Second, because the said renewing act was unconstitutional and void, inasmuch as it was a general incorporation law prohibited by the constitution, for it attempted to renew \u2014that is, reincorporate\u2014all corporations coming within the description of a class defined in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">One of the counsel for complainant, in one of his briefs, put his contentions upon this point as follows: \u201cThe Chancellor is not called upon in this case to determine any disputed question of fact, or any question of forfeiture or noncompliance with conditions, or any imperfection in organization or creation. The sole question presented is, could the Oxy-Hydrogen Company now be in existence under any claim made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>it, if it had complied with all conditions precedent to a proper organization? The authorities are a unit in deciding that there can be no <em>de facto </em>corporation when there is no possibility <em>of </em>the <em>existence of </em>a corporation. In such cases, corporate existence claimed can always be questioned in any proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Defendants\u2019 counsel contend, on the other hand, in reply to these arguments, that the constitutional limitation of twenty years must be re\u00e1d into the original act of incorporation, and therefore the renewing act does apply. At the same time they strenuously contend that the renewing act is not a general incorporation act, within the meaning &lt;pf the constitutional provision, and is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Defendants further contend that, at the time of filing the bill, the contentions now made by the complainant could not have been made, inasmuch as the twenty years had not then elapsed from the time of granting the original charter, and that the decision of this Court .must be made upon the status of the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware at the time the bill was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It is to be also noted that the complainant, at the final hearing, asked leave to file a supplemental bill, alleging, <em>inter alla, </em>the expiration of the charter by limitation of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Before proceeding to discuss all these conflicting views, and the reasons and authorities adduced in support of them, I will consider the one remaining contention of the defendants\u2019 counsel, which, if it be correct, disposes of most of the above noted facts and arguments, rendering them obviously immaterial and irrelevant to the question at issue. This contention of defendants\u2019 counsel is absolutely inconsistent with their other contentions, and, in brief, is that the act of incorporation of the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware is an act for public improvement, and is therefore exempt from the constitutional limitation of twenty years, which applies only to corporations other than those for public improvement, and, there being no limitation of time expressed in the act itself, the charter is consequently a perpetual one.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Section </em>17, <em>art. </em>2, <em>of the Conshtuhon of </em>1831, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u201cNo act of incorporation, except for the renewal of existing corporations, shall be hereafter enacted without the concurrence by two-thirds of each branch of the legislature; and with the reserved power of revocation by the legislature; and no act of incorporation which may be hereafter enacted, shall continue in force for a longer period than twenty years, without the re-enactment of the legislature, unless it be an incorporation for public improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Our courts have never been called upon to define \u201can incorporation for public improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">It is undoubtedly a term of very broad and vague significance, and, in the absence of judicial construction, a prudent lawyer would, in any case where a doubt could possibly arise, advise any corporation, which he might represent, to obtain an act of renewal from the legislature, rather than take any chance whatever of an adverse decision, the consequence of which would mean irremediable disaster to his clients. About ditches, canals, etc., there has been always such a consensus of opinion that renewal acts have rarely been sought; but, in the case of gas companies, the history of our legislation shows that, prior to the exceptional experience of the corporation whose status we are now considering, a specific renewal act was invariably obtained within the twenty years. This practice of those interested in gas companies, however, can in no way affect the question which the present case obliges me to consider and determine as a case of first impression, so far as our state tribunals are concerned; and in its determination all the provisions of the charter under consideration must, of course, be taken together, among them being the following: \u201cAnd that the said corporation is hereby empowered to lay pipes and conductors with all the appurtenances thereto in any and all the roads, streets, highways and public grounds of the State of Delaware. And do all things necessary for the purpose of lighting the same, and all dwellings, stores, mines, tunnels and other places: provided, that public travel shall not be unnecessarily and unreasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>bly obstructed thereby. And the said corporation shall put such streets, roads, highways and public grounds in as good condition as the same were before laying said pipes and erecting said posts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">There are many decisions in other states to which we may look in some degree for guidance, weighing the force of the reasoning and authority which have led other courts to conclusions which, although not authority in this State, ye.t cannot but have great influence, especially as they all agree; there being, so far as I have been able to 'ascertain, not one discordant case. An interesting one is that of <em>Bloomfield &amp; Rochester Natural Gas Light Co. vs. Richardson, </em>63 <em>Barb. </em>437, decided by the Supreme Court of New York in 1872. The corporation undertook to conduct gas to the city of Rochester, a distance of thirty miles, and it became necessary to exercise the right of eminent domain, in order to acquire a right of way across private lands. The contention before the Supreme Court, by some of the landowners, was that this was not a public use, and private property could not be taken for it. Mr. Pomeroy, counsel for the landowners, argued at great length and with great earnestness that the carrying of gas could not be classed with the carrying of water, the drainage of swamps, the construction of canals, turnpikes, and railroads, as a public use; that it is perhaps more convenient to use gas than candles, or sperm oil, or even kerosene, but it is not a necessity, as is water. The Court held, that the conducting of illuminating gas, is such a public improvement, as to entitle a company, incorporated for that purpose, to be vested with the right of eminent domain. I will quote from the opinion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u2018\u2018It is unnecessary, in this case, to enter into any discussion as to whether the lighting of the dwelling of an individual, or any number of such dwellings, for the convenience of the occupant, can be considered a public.use, since one of the objects of the act in question is to facilitate the lighting of the streets and public places. Is the lighting of the streets and public places a public benefit? The modern practice of the civilized world answers the question. But it is said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>a gas company already .exists in Rochester, which is ready to supply all gas which may be needed. The same answer, in principle, might be made to almost any attempt to take any particular property for any particular public use. In almost all cases, it could be demonstrated that the particular method by which the legislature has attempted to authorize the public benefit to be conferred, or the particular property proposed to be taken, is not absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of the object. If the court can see that a public benefit is contemplated, the mode and method and means of producing this result must belong to the legislature, to be authorized in its discretion. It may be that the quality or price may influence the legislature to select one method over another. It must be a matter wholly resting in legislative discretion, or else the power is nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cSide by side with the gas mains of this company, leading to the city of Rochester, and, as was stated on the argument, at the very locality where the question in this case arises, are also placed the main conduits of the Rochester Waterworks Company, upon which the legislature conferred the right to conduct water from a distance, for the purpose of supplying the city with water, together with the power to take such private property as should be necessary in accomplishing the object. This Court has had occasion to confirm an appraisal of damages under the provisions of the waterworks charter, conferring the right to take private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cBut it might well be alleged that Rochester might be supplied with water from other sources, and even within the city itself. The use of gas for illuminating purposes has become almost a necessity of modern civilization. The right to take private property of those who\" own the fee of the streets and highways may be absolutely necessary to the public enjoyment of the benefits of this invention, and we think there can be no doubt, upon principle and upon the adjudicated cases, that the conduction of illuminating gas, with such public objects as are specified in the act conferring the special powers upon this company, is within the category of those public improvements to enable which to be carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>out the legisl\u00e1ture may confer upon the parties engaged in the enterprise the right to take the private property necessary to effect the object, upon making compensation according to the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In the case of <em>New Orleans Gaslight Co. vs. Louisiana Light &amp; Heat Producing &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>115 <em>U. S. </em>650, 6 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>262, decided in 1885, the question was upon the constitutional power of the legislature to grant an exclusive franchise to a gas company. Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the Court, said <em>(jpage </em>658, 115 <em>U. S., </em>and <em>page </em>256, 6 <em>Sup. Ct.):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cIt is true, as suggested in argument, that the manufacture and distribution of illuminating gas, by means of pipes or conduits placed, under legislative authority, in the streets of a town, or city, is a business of a public character. Under proper management, the business contributes very materially to the public convenience, while, in the absence of efficient supervision, it may disturb the comfort and endanger the health and property of the community. It also holds important relations to the public through the facilities furnished, by the lighting of streets with gas, for the detection and prevention of crime. An English historian, contrasting the London of his day with the London of the time when its streets, supplied only with oil lamps, were scenes of nightly robberies, says that \u2018the adventurers in gaslight did more for the prevention of crime than the government had done since the days of Alfred.\u2019 7 <em>Knight, c. </em>21; <em>Macaulay, </em>c. 3. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Authority for the position that the supplying of gas to a city and its people may become a public purpose is found in <em>New Orleans vs. Clark, </em>95 <em>U. S. </em>652. That case involved the liability of a municipal corporation upon coupon bonds issued to a company which had undertaken, for a valuable consideration, to light its streets with gas. Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the Court, said: \u2018A private corporation, as well as individuals, may be employed by a city in the construction of works needed for the health, comfort, and convenience of its citizens; and, though such works may be used by the corporation for its own gain, yet, as they advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the public good, the corporation may be. properly aided in their constructio\u00f1 by the city.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Counsel for defendants also cited <em>New Orleans vs. Rivers </em>115 <em>U. S. </em>674, 6 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>273; <em>State vs. Milwaukee Gaslight </em>Co., 29 <em>Wis. </em>454.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It may be noted, in this connection, that the lighting of large cities by gas was becoming general about the time the \"constitution of 1831 was adopted. London was generally lighted by gas in 1814, and the streets of New York were first so lighted in 1823 and 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The reasoning of the learned judges which I have cited is conclusive of the question, independent of any weight that the cases cited may have as adjudications. I am unable to conceive any intelligent construction of the phrase, \u201cincorporation for public improvement,\u201d which will exclude a gas company empowered, as was the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware, \u2018to lay pipes and conductors, with all appurtenances thereto, and to erect the necessary posts and lights in any and all the roads, streets, highways, and public grounds in the State of Delaware, and do all things necessary to the purpose of lighting the same.\u201d Therefore, the charter of the Oxy-Hydrogen Company being in terms perpetual, and as a corporation for public improvement being specially exempted from the constitutional limitation of twenty years, it is a perpetual charter, subject only to the constitutionally reserved power of revocation by the legislature. It follows, therefore, that the renewing act above recited has no application whatever to the Oxy-Hydrogen Company charter, and any further comment upon the arguments connected with it is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">It may be argued, however, that, a charter being a contract between two parties, the acts of the stockholders of the said Oxy-Hydrogen Company, one of the parties already set forth, declaring their acceptance of an alleged renewing act, and attempting to do all the acts and things necessary to obtain the benefit of its provisions, amount to a surrender or forfeiture of the existing grant of a perpetual charter. But whatever may be the force of that contention, it is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that is not before me. The only way to raise it is by <em>quo warranta </em>proceedings in the name of the State, as <em>it is </em>one of the settled principles of corporation law that the State alone can proceed, to exact a forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">An act was duly passed in 1873, incorporating the OxyHydrogen Company of the State of Delaware. That act contained no express limitation of time, and was on its face perpetual. It was an incorporation for public improvement, and therefore, in terms, exempted by the Constitution from the limitation of twenty years applicable to either corporations. A regular organization and user followed, and no objection remains, which, upon any tenable theory, would be within the competence of this Court to pass upon. With subsequent inconsistencies in the conduct of its stockholders, and the position assumed hy the company and its counsel, I have nothing to do. For the purposes of this suit, the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware has been shown to be an existing corporation of this State, and a necessary party. Therefore the bill is fatally defective; for want of a necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">It is the practice of the Court of Chancery in such cases not to dismiss the bill, but to give the complainant leave to amend upon the payment of costs. Chancellor Kent, in <em>Cook vs. Mancius, </em>3 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>427; Chancellor Bates, in <em>Sattherwait vs. Marshall, </em>4 <em>Del. Ch. </em>337.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">I shall let the cause stand over, with liberty to the complainants to amend their bill by making the Oxy-Hydrogen Company of the State of Delaware a party, and it must be on the payment of the costs of the pleas and subsequent proceedings. It is evident that this involves the refusal of leave to file the supplemental bill which was presented.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">This opinion has since been reported, 7 <em>Del.
