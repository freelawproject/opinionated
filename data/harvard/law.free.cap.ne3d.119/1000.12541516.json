Plaintiff-appellee is Tresa Lyn Nethers (\"Wife\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Husband and Wife were married on May 29, 1999. No children were born as issue of the marriage. The parties separated in November, 2016. Wife filed a complaint for divorce on January 17, 2017. Husband filed a timely answer. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order on January 18, 2017, restraining both parties \"from selling, damaging, destroying, removing, encumbering, disposing of\" marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to final hearing before the magistrate on September 11, 2017. The dispute centered around four pieces of property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1). 12205 Marne Road, Newark, Ohio, which Husband purchased prior to the marriage. The Marne Road property consists of a residence on one acre of land and was appraised at $20,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2). 68819 Mount Herman Road, Cambridge, Ohio, which Husband purchased prior to the marriage. The Mt. Herman Road property consists of 80 acres of land and was appraised at $160,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3). 2975 Indian Camp Road, Cambridge, Ohio, which was purchased during the marriage on September 18, 2001. It consists of two tracts, totaling 80 acres, and a residence. It was appraised at $180,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4). 68435 Boden Road, Cambridge, Ohio, which was purchased during the marriage on January 31, 2014. It consists of 26.891 acres and was appraised at $70,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 10, 2012, Husband and Wife each executed a revocable living trust, known as the Randy J. Nethers Living Trust, and the Tresa L. Nethers Living Trust, respectively. Husband is the settlor and trustee of his trust. Wife is the settlor and trustee of her trust. The initial funding of each trust included an undivided one-half interest in the Marne Road, the Mt. Herman Road, and the Indian Camp Road properties as well as personal property and non-titled equipment. Husband executed warranty deeds on September 10, 2012, transferring an undivided one-half interest in the real properties to Wife as trustee of her trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Attorney Keith Plummer represented both parties during the preparation and execution of the trusts and deeds. Attorney Plummer testified he explained the trusts and the purpose of the instruments during two meetings with the parties prior to the execution of the documents. Attorney Plummer explained Wife was both the trustee and beneficiary of her trust; therefore, she had total authority and control over the assets of her trust. Likewise, Husband was both the trustee and beneficiary of his trust and had total authority and control over the assets of his trust. Attorney Plummer added Husband and Wife retained control over only the assets contained in his or her trust, and each was free to revoke, terminate, or distribute only the property in his or her trust. Neither party had the authority to make any changes to the other's trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Attorney Plummer further testified he prepared and notarized the warranty deeds transferring the real properties to each parties' respective trust, and would have explained to the parties the purpose and legal effect of the deeds. Attorney Plummer opined the parties signed the trusts and deeds knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Attorney Plummer stated it was clear to him both parties wanted a trust because \"basically they wanted everything in one spot to keep things out of Probate. Keep them private and that was the tone of the conversations I had with both clients.\" Tr. of Sept. 11, 2017 Hearing at 13. Wife testified the parties met with Attorney Plummer together. Wife stated Attorney Plummer explained the documents, page by page, and had the parties initial each page prior to signing the instruments. Wife indicated the parties wanted to pool their assets together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} With respect to the parties' personal property, Wife explained she left the marital residence with her clothes, a small television, and financial records. Wife compiled a list of the personal property which remained at the marital residence and assigned a value to each item. She assigned the values to many of the items based upon the purchase price as she had the receipts for those items. Wife did not hire an expert to appraise the property. Wife\n   denied Husband's assertion she had the majority of the assets in her possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On cross-examination, Husband stated he had purchased real estate on four occasions during his life and understood what a deed was. Although Husband acknowledged he signed the deeds transferring one-half interest in the Marne Road, the Mt. Herman Road, and the Indian Camp Road properties to Wife as trustee of her trust, Husband maintained he did not understand what he was signing. Husband admitted he did not read the deeds prior to signing the documents. Husband explained, \"I thought the Trust, all this Trust was going to my nephew. That is what I thought a Trust was. I thought it was going so if something happened to me and her it would go to my nephew.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. Husband claimed Attorney Plummer did not review each document with him, but conceded he initialed each page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Husband testified Wife took 80% of the personal property, and he sold or junked some of the personal property in his possession after the parties separated. Husband testified he \"junked\" a four wheeler, but did not know the year of the vehicle; sold a Kubota belly mower for $500; sold a Kubota 4800 tractor for $2,000, but refused to provide the name of the buyer until the trial court demanded he do so; sold a Kubota tiller for scrap and received $100; junked a hole digger, brush hog, and excavator, claiming they were vandalized and totaled as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Via Decision filed September 27, 2017, the magistrate granted the divorce, divided the parties' assets and liabilities, and ordered the parties to revoke their respective trusts to facilitate the division of the assets and liabilities. The magistrate found \"a clear reading of the trust documents shows donative intent on the part of Husband to gift an undivided one-half interest in the [Marne Road, Mt. Herman Road, and Indian Camp Road] properties * * * to Wife.\" Magistrate's Decision at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Husband filed objections to the magistrate's decision on January 8, 2018. Via Entry filed February 6, 2018, the trial court overruled Husband's objections, finding the magistrate \"properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law.\" February 6, 2018 Entry at 2, unpaginated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It is from this judgment entry Husband appeals, raising the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I.

Attorney Plummer testified Husband and Wife were present when the trusts were executed. He reviewed the documents, page by page, and the parties initialed each page of his and her individual trust. Wife was both the trustee and beneficiary of her trust, and had total authority and control over the\n   assets of her trust. Likewise, Husband was both the trustee and beneficiary of his trust and had total authority and control over the assets of such. Husband and Wife retained control over only the assets contained in his or her own trust, and each was free to revoke, terminate, or distribute only the property in his or her own trust. Neither party had the authority to make any changes to the other's trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Husband executed the warranty deeds transferring an undivided one-half interest in the real properties in question to each parties' respective trust. Despite Husband's testimony he did not know what he was signing, the documents make clear the trusts were meant to be individual estate planning and the deeds were transferring property to the trusts. Once the trusts were executed and the deeds delivered, Husband relinquished \"ownership, dominion and control over\" the property given to Wife. By his actions, Husband conveyed a present possessory interest in an undivided one-half interest in his separate property to Wife. The purpose was two-fold: 1) to pool assets, and 2) to avoid probate. While part of the purpose of the transfers was for estate planning, the trial court's determination there was also an intent to make an inter vivos gift in order to \"pool\" assets is supported by the nature and terms of the trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court's finding Husband made an inter vivos gift of the property to Wife was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Husband's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In his second assignment of error, Husband challenges the trial court's division and valuation of the parties' marital assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In order to make an equitable division of property, the trial court must first determine the value of the marital assets.\n   <em>\n    Cockerham v.

Husband explains, despite Wife's claim she valued the assets based upon receipts she kept from the original purchases of the items, she refused to provide him with copies of said receipts during discovery. Husband adds there was no expert testimony or documentary evidence to support the values assigned. Husband submits he established, through his own \"detailed testimony\", $101,000 worth of the assets had been sold or junked, or were in Wife's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Wife filed her personal property disclosure statement on January 17, 2017. Therein, Wife indicated all of the property was in Husband's possession. Husband filed his personal property disclosure statement on September 8, 2017. Husband's list was identical to Wife's list with respect to the specific items and values assigned to such, however, Husband indicated Wife was in possession of most of\n   the property. At trial, Husband submitted a revised list, which showed the following items as \"Sold after separation or disposed as junk\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Kawasaki 4 wheeler (previously valued by Husband at $2,500, and in Wife's possession)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Kubota belly mower ($7,000, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Kubota 48000 tractor ($30,000, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Kubota tiller ($5,000, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Hole digger ($4,500, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Brush hog ($5,000, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Excavator ($5,000, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   2 Stihl weed eaters ($600, Wife)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Husband testified he \"junked\" the Kawasaki four wheeler, although he did not know the age of the vehicle; sold the Kubota belly mower for $500; sold the Kubota 4800 tractor for $2,000, but refused to provide the name of the buyer until the trial court demanded he do so; sold the Kubota tiller for scrap and received $100; junked a hole digger, brush hog, and excavator, claiming they were vandalized and totaled as a result. Husband's testimony was unclear as to who compiled the personal property disclosure statement filed September 8, 2017. However, Husband noted any discrepancies between his two statements were \"mistakes\". Husband sold or junked this property despite the temporary restraining order which had been issued when the complaint was filed. Although Husband claimed Wife did not provide the receipts for the marital assets in discovery, he did not file a motion to compel the production of said documentation. Wife testified the items sold or disposed as junk were purchased sometime in 2013, and purchased with money the parties received from the oil and gas leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Upon review of the record, we find the trial court's valuation of the personal property is supported by the evidence and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the marital assets.
