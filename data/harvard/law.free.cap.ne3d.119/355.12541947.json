L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). On appeal, he raises two arguments concerning his defense of self-defense. First, the defendant contends that the judge's finding that he did not actually believe that he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury was clearly erroneous because it was based on an incorrect subsidiary finding that the defendant's trial testimony differed from his testimony before the grand jury. Second, the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not actually believe he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The trial judge made extensive oral findings at the conclusion of the trial. The defendant argues clear error with respect to one of them, namely the judge's finding that the defendant did not testify before the grand jury that the victim \"wiggled and therefore he became fearful she was going to attack him.\" Because that finding was clearly erroneous, he argues, it was also clear error when the judge found that the defendant's trial testimony differed from his grand jury testimony on this point. It follows, he contends, that the judge therefore could not discredit his testimony that the victim's \"wiggling\" caused him to actually believe he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The record presented to us does not include a copy of the grand jury testimony. However, the trial transcript reflects that the defendant, during cross-examination, was shown a copy of the grand jury testimony by the prosecutor who read passages from it, including one where the defendant testified that the victim was \"wiggling her shoulders and at that point I d[id]'t know if she has a knife or anything on her.\" On this basis, it appears that the defendant is correct that the judge erred in finding that the defendant's trial testimony differed from his grand jury testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   However, the remainder of the defendant's argument does not follow. First, the supposed contradiction was not the sole basis for the judge's finding regarding the defendant's state of mind. Indeed, in the very sentence of the judge's findings upon which the defendant focuses, the judge stated that, \"given\n   <em>\n    the circumstances as a whole\n   </em>\n   [I find] that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Daley did not actually believe when he stabbed Miss Brown that he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury\" (emphasis added). Moreover, the judge stated that he could infer the defendant's state of mind from many circumstances, which he then proceeded to outline in extensive detail over several pages of transcript. It is thus clear that the judge's finding concerning the defendant's actual belief did not rest on the supposed contradiction alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Second, given the judge's explicit rejection of the defendant's claim that he had seen the victim with a knife in her hand, the victim's \"wiggling\" (even if credited), would not have given the defendant reasonable ground to believe he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury from which he could save himself only by deadly force.

If an assault includes the threat of an action that would cause the defendant serious bodily injury, this is sufficient to require such an instruction. Self-defense using deadly force is not justified in the absence of such a threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651253\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/393/#p396\">\n    428 Mass. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396 (1998), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009002\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/32/570/#p578\">\n    32 Mass.

The judge also could have credited generally the victim's testimony that she did not threaten the defendant's personal safety, either verbally or physically, before he attacked her and the defendant's own testimony that he initiated the attack in order to recover his personal property. On these facts, \"[a] rational [fact finder] could thus infer that the defendant had no reasonable basis to believe that he was in imminent danger of suffering death or serious bodily harm from the victim and that he had not 'availed all proper means to avoid physical combat.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McAfee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157410\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/483/#p496\">\n    430 Mass. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (1999), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Niemic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310296\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/718/#p722\">\n    427 Mass. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Deciding as we do, we need not address the Commonwealth's argument that the evidence, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, did not suffice to put self-defense in issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
