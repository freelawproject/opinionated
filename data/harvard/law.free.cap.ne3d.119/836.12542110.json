Grubb, Esq. (\"Attorney Grubb\") and Grubb &amp; Associates, L.P.A. (collectively \"Grubb\") appeal the decision of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas granting a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss in favor of Defendant-Appellee, Medina County Publications, Inc. (the \"Medina Gazette\"). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 18, 2014, the Medina Gazette published an article entitled \"Former client sues attorney[.]\" According to the article, Grubb's former client, Amanda France, had filed a lawsuit accusing Grubb of fraud, breach of duty, and failure to provide competent services. The article went on to describe the allegations Amanda France made in her complaint against Grubb. The article also reported on statements made by Amanda France's attorney, Stephen Brown, regarding the claims alleged in Amanda France's action against Grubb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, on December 13, 2016, Grubb filed suit against the Medina Gazette alleging claims of defamation per se and tortious interference with a business relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grubb filed her first amended complaint (the \"complaint\") on June 15, 2017, which asserted only two claims, counts two and three, against the Medina Gazette. In the complaint, Grubb claimed that the Medina Gazette published a defamatory article that \"falsely accused [Grubb] by numerous allegations that on their face reflect upon Attorney Grubb's character in a manner that will cause her to be ridiculed, hated, held in contempt, or in a manner that will injure her in her trade or profession as an attorney.\" Further, Grubb claimed that the Medina Gazette tortiously interfered with Grubb's \"existing business relationship\" with Grubb's \"then client, John France.\" Grubb explains in the complaint that John France was the husband of Amanda France-the\n   former client who filed the lawsuit against Grubb prompting the article in the Medina Gazette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Medina Gazette responded with a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion seeking dismissal of counts two and three of the complaint. Grubb opposed the motion. The trial court granted the motion, finding that Grubb failed to state claims, for defamation and tortious interference with a business relationship, upon which relief could be granted. By way of the August 29, 2017 journal entry, the trial court dismissed Grubb's claims against the Medina Gazette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Grubb timely appealed the trial court's decision, asserting three\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   assignments of error. For ease of analysis, we consider the assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in granting the [Medina] Gazette's motion to dismiss when Count II of the first amended complaint is sufficient to state a claim against the [Medina] Gazette for libel/defamation per se as a matter of law.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the second assignment of error, Grubb submits that the trial court erred in dismissing the claim of libel-defamation per se-for failure to state a claim. The trial court determined that the Medina Gazette article reported the allegations actually made in Amanda France's complaint, but did not assert the truth of those allegations. The trial court concluded, inter alia, that the pleadings established that the article, as presented, was true, and therefore not actionable. Grubb challenges the trial court's determination and argues that the complaint sufficiently stated a claim. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This Court reviews an order granting a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss de novo.\n   <em>\n    Perrysburg Twp. v.

The \"Background\" section of Grubb's complaint precedes the stated causes of action and includes a subsection entitled \"The Defamatory Article in the Medina Gazette\" which summarizes and quotes portions of the article. Those portions of the article that Grubb references either report statements made by Amanda France's attorney, Stephen Brown, or describe the allegations contained in Amanda France's lawsuit. Within this subsection there is no indication which, if any, of these quoted statements Grubb believes to be false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In count two of the complaint, Grubb asserts the claim of libel/defamation per se and, in addition to incorporating all preceding paragraphs by reference, states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   54. The [a]rticle was false and defamatory per se, as it falsely accused [Grubb] by numerous allegations that on their face reflect upon Attorney Grubb's character in a manner that will cause her to be ridiculed, hated, held in contempt, of in a manner that will injure her in her trade or profession as an attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   55. The [Medina] Gazette could have been [sic] easily verified that Amanda France had no standing to bring her action against [Grubb] and that the [m]ortgage [d]eed was signed by John France.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   56. The [a]rticle is further false and defamatory per se because it accuses Attorney Grubb of mortgage fraud, which is a criminal offense of moral turpitude.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   57. The [a]rticle was published without privilege in the [Medina] Gazette, a Medina County publication that is widely circulated to the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   58. The [Medina] Gazette was at least negligent in failing to make any attempt to ascertain the truth or veracity of the France Complaint or statements made to the [Medina] Gazette by Brown, which a casual search of public records would have revealed as false. Further, the [Medina] Gazette has published unverified and false statements regarding [Grubb] and their clients in the [a]rticle and numerous other articles over the past several years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   59. As a direct and proximate result of the published false statements in the [Medina] Gazette, [Grubb is] presumed as a matter of law to have suffered damages * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although Grubb refers to \"numerous allegations\" and makes passing reference to \"unverified and false statements\" in the article, Grubb only identifies one statement in the article that she claims is false and defamatory per se: an accusation that Attorney Grubb engaged in mortgage fraud, a criminal offense of moral turpitude. While Grubb alleges as a matter of fact that the article contains an accusation of mortgage fraud, such a claim is belied by the article itself, which is attached to the complaint as \"Exhibit F\" and incorporated into the pleading. We accept as true not only the factual allegation in the complaint, but also all items properly incorporated into the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Vagas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6794\">\n    2009-Ohio-6794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The article stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A Medina attorney who pleaded guilty to a fraud charge last year now faces a lawsuit from a former client accusing her of fraud, breach of duty[,] and failure to provide competent services. Amanda France, of Tampa, Florida, filed a suit last week against attorney Natalie Grubb in Medina County Common Pleas Court. In the suit, France alleges Grubb failed to file a civil suit she was hired to prepare and accuses her of mortgage fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The suit also alleges that Grubb acquired an open-end mortgage deed worth $130,000 on France's Florida home. According to the Hillsborough County auditor's website, the property Grubb secured the mortgage on is owned by France's husband, John France. Brown said Grubb took out the mortgage without notifying France or her husband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is clear based on a plain reading of the article attached to the complaint that the Medina Gazette does not accuse Grubb of mortgage fraud, but rather reports that Grubb's former client is suing Grubb for mortgage fraud. The article informs that Amanda France's lawsuit alleged that Grubb committed mortgage fraud by acquiring a mortgage on her home, and the reporter further notes that the home appeared to be in the name of John France only. Such statements are verifiably true because Grubb also attached a copy of Amanda France's lawsuit to the complaint as \"Exhibit E\" and incorporated it into the pleading. Again without accusing Grubb, the article indicates that France's attorney, Brown, said that Grubb took out the mortgage without notifying France or her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The essence of Grubb's argument is that the Medina Gazette published an article reporting on Amanda France's lawsuit without first investigating the allegations of the lawsuit or considering the merit of the claims. However, the article did not report any of the allegations in Amanda France's lawsuit as matter of fact, but, rather, qualified them as having been alleged in Amanda France's complaint or stated by her attorney. Grubb has not pleaded the existence of any actionable\n   statement in the article falsely accusing Attorney Grubb of any act, let alone an act reflecting upon her character in a manner that will cause her to be ridiculed, hated, or held in contempt; or in a manner that will injure her in her trade or profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gosden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1163237\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/116/195/#p207\">\n    116 Ohio App.3d at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20N.E.2d%20481\">\n    687 N.E.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Grubb cannot establish any set of facts to support the first element for a defamation claim that the article is libelous per se. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing the second count of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Grubb's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in granting the [Medina] Gazette's motion to dismiss when Count II[I] of the first amended complaint is sufficient to state a claim against the [Medina] Gazette for tortious interference with business relationship.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The same de novo standard of review applies to Grubb's third assignment of error, arguing that the trial court erred by dismissing its claim of tortious interference with a business relationship pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\n   <em>\n    Rossford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1503031\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/103/79/\">\n    103 Ohio St.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-4362\">\n    2004-Ohio-4362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=814%20N.E.2d%2044\">\n    814 N.E.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 5.

There was an existing business relationship between [Grubb] and their then client, John France.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   62. The Defendants knew of this business relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   63. The Defendants have [tortiously] interfered with said business relationship, causing Mr. France to cease to conduct business with [Grubb].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   64. Defendants' interference with [Grubb]'s business relationship with Mr. France was undertaken knowingly, maliciously and without right, privilege or justification, for their own economic benefit and personal gain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Examining the first element of the claim, the existence of a contractual or business relationship, Grubb\n   alleges that that there was an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   business relationship with John France. Grubb then makes the bald assertion that defendant tortiously interfered with this relationship and caused Mr. France to cease to conduct business with Grubb. As this claim relates to the Medina Gazette, it appears from the complaint that the allegedly tortious conduct is publication of the article on July 18, 2014. However, in the complaint, Grubb avers that the attorney-client relationship between Grubb and John France-the only relationship alleged in the complaint-ended on May 20, 2013, citing to a court order granting a motion to withdraw as counsel attached to the complaint and incorporated into the pleadings as \"Exhibit D.\" Thus, the facts that Grubb has alleged in the complaint, taken together with the incorporated material, establish that the only alleged relationship between Grubb and John France was not \"existing\" when the Medina Gazette published the article at issue, but rather that it had terminated more than a year prior to any alleged action on the part of the Medina Gazette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Specific facts alleged in the complaint refute the vague assertion that a business relationship existed, and we conclude that Grubb has failed to plead the existence of a contractual or business relationship to satisfy the first element of the claim. Further, having failed to establish the existence of a business relationship, Grubb has not alleged any facts to support a claim that the article published by the Medina Gazette caused John France to terminate or discontinue a business relationship with Grubb. Accordingly, we determine that Grubb also failed to plead the third element of a claim of tortious interference with a business relationship, and we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing this claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Grubb's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial Court Erred in Granting the [Medina] Gazette's Motion To Dismiss When [Grubb]'s First Amended Complaint Set Forth Such Facts That Could Entitled Appellants To Recover for the Claims Asserted.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In the first assignment of error Grubb contends that the complaint set forth sufficient facts to recover on claims against the Medina Gazette. However, aside from setting forth the standard of review for a motion to dismiss, Grubb makes only a single conclusory claim that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [t]he [t]rial [c]ourt erred in going beyond the sufficiency of the [complaint] to find in favor of the [Medina] Gazette on its motion to dismiss, despite the fact that there is a set of facts, when all factual allegations in the complaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of [Grubb], consistent with the [complaint], which would allow [Grubb] to recover on their claims against the [Medina] Gazette.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Grubb has not cited to authorities, statutes, or parts of the record, and has not presented an argument supporting this contention as required by App.R. 16(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 22} To the extent that Grubb intended to assign error to the manner in which the trial court applied Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we find the issue moot because the proper standard has been articulated and applied in our determination of the second and third assignments of error. In so far as this assignment of error was intended to present any argument distinguishable from the second and third assignments of error, Grubb has neither presented nor supported such an argument and so we decline to consider it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(2), App.R. 16(A).

However, Grubb did not present that assignment of error or argue it in the brief. Moreover, our review of the record reflects that there has been no summary judgment ruling in this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
