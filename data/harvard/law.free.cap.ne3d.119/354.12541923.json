The father argues that the judge improperly considered additional earnings from the father's secondary employment with the city of Springfield in modifying the father's child support obligation because it is undisputed that he did not have that secondary job when the original child support order was entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The guidelines and our case law leave the definition of income flexible, and the judge's discretion in its determination broad.\"\n   <em>\n    M.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    T.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    463 Mass. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (2012).

Notwithstanding this broad definition of income, the guidelines specifically provide that \"[i]f after a child support order is entered, a payor or recipient begins to work overtime or obtains a secondary job, neither of which was worked prior to the entry of the order, there shall be a presumption that the overtime or secondary job income should not be considered in a future child support order.\" Guidelines \u00a7 I.B.2.

At the modification hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the father maintained, and the mother did not dispute, that he did not have his second job with the city at the time of the original judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge's findings and rationale, however, included two child support calculations, one that \"includ[ed] [the father's] second job,\" and resulted in a differential of eighty-eight dollars between the parties' incomes, and one that did \"not include[ ] his second job,\" and resulted in a differential of fourteen dollars between the parties' incomes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge ultimately ordered the father to pay ninety dollars per week, finding that the father was \"in a better place financially\" than he had been at the time of the original order, a plain reference to his additional income from his second job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the amount of child support ordered, and the judge's finding on the father's improved financial situation, it appears that the judge considered the father's second job when determining the child support amount, despite the contrary presumption allowed under the guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Guidelines \u00a7 I.

The father also claims the judge erred when he made the upward deviation from the guidelines amount, without a finding that the mother was unable to meet the child's reasonable needs under the existing order, and without a finding that the application of the guidelines would result in a \"gross disparity\" between the standard of living between the two households such that the mother was left with an unreasonably low percentage of the combined available income. See Guidelines \u00a7 IV.B.11. As the father agrees, a judge may award child support to \"ensure that the child enjoys economic adequacy and a standard of living not grossly inferior to that of either parent, and that the child is not deprived of important life opportunities that would have been available had the child resided with that parent.\"\n   <em>\n    M.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    463 Mass. at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is within the judge's discretion \"to determine whether and to what extent [the children's] needs are unmet by [the] existing order.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1221118\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/62/130/#p137\">\n    62 Mass.

There is no \"factual basis\" for an increase in child support if the payee parent is able to \"provide for the child's reasonable needs while the child [is] in [their] care\" and maintain a consistent standard of living for the child.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the father contends that the judge improperly used an income-equalization approach to calculate child support. An income-equalization approach is inappropriate because \"it does not account for the noncustodial parent whose income far exceeds any reasonable needs the child might have,\" and \"may constructively distribute the noncustodial parent's estate, provide a windfall to the child and custodial spouse, and infringe upon the noncustodial parent's right to direct the lifestyle of his or her children.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011170\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/156/#p160\">\n    52 Mass. App. Ct. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (2001). Income equalization is even more problematic \"where parents have similar standards of living and share physical custody\" because both parents experience \"the added expenses of living with a child (e.g., food, clothing, and third-party child care) and the opportunity costs of being a residential parent (e.g., diminished chances to attain work experience and market skills).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    M.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    463 Mass at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A judge may not require a parent \"to fully share his [or her] earnings ... for the purpose of equalizing household standards of living\" because doing so \"would invade the higher-income parent's reasonable interest in benefiting from the fruits of his or her labor\" by \" 'impos[ing] all the economic costs of family dissolution on the [higher-income] parent,' while holding the parent with lower income harmless from such costs\" (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once again, in light of our decision to vacate the modification judgment based upon the father's first ground of appeal, we decline to further address this issue, which shall remain open to be addressed by the parties and the judge on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   .
