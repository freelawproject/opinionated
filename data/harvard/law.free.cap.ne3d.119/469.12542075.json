Testa and the state of Ohio (together, \"the State\"). For the following reasons, we affirm that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Many Ohio municipal corporations impose a tax on income earned within their boundaries. When applied to businesses, that tax is known as the municipal net profit tax. This case focuses on the constitutionality of the General Assembly's efforts to streamline aspects of the various municipalities' income tax systems and centralize the collection and administration of the net profit tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Two recent enactments are at issue in this case. First, in 2014, the 130th General Assembly enacted Sub.H.B. No. 5 (hereinafter, \"H.B. 5\") to establish more uniformity in the way Ohio municipalities administer their income tax systems. As amended by H.B. 5, R.C. 715.013(B) permits municipal corporations to levy an income tax \"in accordance with Chapter 718 of the Revised Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   R.C. 718.04(A) (\"A municipal corporation may levy a tax on income and a withholding tax if such taxes are levied in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in [R.C. Chapter 718].\"). In relevant part, the provisions adopted in H.B. 5 require that municipal corporations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \u2022 Maintain a local board of tax review with the composition, powers, and procedures set forth in R.C. 718.11 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Charge interest on untimely or partial income tax payments at the rate specified in R.C. 718.27(A) and (C)(1) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Charge a penalty at the rate specified if a taxpayer makes an untimely or partial income tax payment or a taxpayer fails to timely file a return ( R.C. 718.27(C)(2) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Ensure that any rules adopted to administer a municipal income tax do not conflict with any provision of R.C. Chapter 718 ( R.C. 718.30 ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Not pay a person hired or retained to examine or inspect a taxpayer's books on a contingency basis ( R.C. 718.31 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, H.B. 5 sets forth standards a municipal tax administrator may consider when deciding whether to accept a compromise or payment-over-time agreement to resolve a claim for unpaid income taxes. R.C. 718.28(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2017, the 132d General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 49 (hereinafter, \"H.B. 49\"), the biennial budget bill for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. H.B. 49 adopted new sections R.C. 718.80 through 718.95. These sections provide business taxpayers with the opportunity to opt for the State to collect and administer the taxpayer's municipal net profit taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to the advent of H.B. 49, each municipality that imposed a net profit tax controlled the collection and administration of that tax, resulting in significant compliance costs for business taxpayers that operated in multiple municipalities. Those taxpayers may now register to file a single return and pay all net profit taxes through the State's centralized system. If a business taxpayer does not opt into the state system, it remains subject to the rules and procedures of the municipalities in which it owes net profit taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under the new provisions, the tax commissioner is the sole administrator of all municipal net profit taxes owed by taxpayers who choose to file with the State. R.C. 718.80(A)(1). Consequently, the tax commissioner collects the taxes and estimated tax payments, audits taxpayers, makes assessments against taxpayers for delinquent or incorrect returns or payments, and issues refunds of overpaid taxes. R.C. 718.85(A)(1) (requiring submission of annual net-profit-tax returns and taxes to the tax commissioner); R.C. 718.88(C) (requiring submission of declarations of estimated net profit taxes and estimated net-profit-tax payments to the tax commissioner); R.C. 718.90 (authorizing the tax commissioner to make assessments and pursue collection of unpaid assessments); R.C. 718.91 (authorizing the tax commissioner to issue refunds); R.C. 718.93 (authorizing the tax commissioner to examine a taxpayer's records to verify the accuracy of a return or to ascertain the amount of net profit tax due).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Each month, the tax commissioner must certify to the director of budget and management the amount of net-profit-tax revenue due to each municipal corporation. R.C. 718.83(A). The director of budget and management must then distribute the certified amount to each municipal corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the State retains one-half percent of all net profit taxes paid to the tax commissioner as a fee for the collection and administration services the commissioner provides. R.C. 718.85(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} To enable the tax commissioner to administer the disparate net profit taxes of each municipality, all municipalities with an income tax must certify to the tax commissioner the rate of the tax, as well as any increase in that rate. R.C. 718.80(C)(1)(a) and (b). Additionally, within 90 days of receiving notice that a taxpayer has opted to file with the State, a municipality must report to the tax commissioner specified information about the taxpayer, including whether the taxpayer is entitled to any net operating loss carryforward or tax credits. R.C. 718.80(C)(2). If a municipal\n   corporation fails to timely provide any of the required information, the tax commissioner may penalize it by withholding 50 percent of the net-profit-tax revenue due to it. R.C. 718.80(C)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When a business taxpayer conducts operations both inside and outside a taxing municipality, the business only owes tax on the net profit apportioned to the municipality. For all municipal net profit taxpayers, a three-factor test based on a business' payroll, sales, and property determines the portion of a business' net profits attributable to a particular municipality. R.C. 718.02(A) (setting forth the three factors applicable to business taxpayers\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   electing to file with the State); R.C. 718.82(A) (setting forth identical factors for apportioning net profit for business taxpayers electing to file with the State). If a taxpayer opts into the State's centralized system, the tax commissioner may approve an alternative apportionment if the three factors do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in a municipal corporation. R.C. 718.82(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In addition to permitting the State to collect and administer net profit taxes, H.B. 49 also eliminated the \"throwback rule.\" Under that rule, a business taxpayer's net profit in a particular municipality included gross receipts from sales of goods shipped from the municipality to purchasers outside the municipality if the taxpayer had not solicited sales at the location of the delivery. Former 718.02(D)(1)(c). In other words, in certain circumstances, gross receipts from sales to customers outside a municipal corporation were \"thrown back\" to the municipal corporation and counted as taxable net profit. Due to the amendments made in H.B. 49, municipalities are no longer permitted to tax such net profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Finally, in uncodified Section 803.100(B), H.B. 49 required each municipal corporation to adopt, by ordinance or resolution, the provisions of R.C. 718.80 through 718.95 by January 31, 2018. This requirement corresponds with the mandate of R.C. 718.04(A), which obligates municipal corporations to levy income taxes \"in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in [R.C. Chapter 718].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On November 16, 2017, a coalition of Ohio municipalities (collectively, \"the Athens plaintiffs\") filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, the Athens plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the provisions of H.B. 5 and H.B. 49 set forth above. The Athens plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment stating: (1) the challenged provisions of H.B. 5 violate the Ohio Constitution's Home Rule Amendment; (2) the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 violate the Ohio Constitution's Home Rule Amendment; (3) H.B. 49 violates the Ohio Constitution's One-Subject Rule; (4) the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 unconstitutionally impair contractual obligations in violation of Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution ; (5) the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 effect a conversion of the Athens plaintiffs' property; (6) the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 effect a taking of property without just compensation in violation of Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution ; and (7) the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 effect a deprivation of property without remedy by due course of law in violation of Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution. The Athens plaintiffs also sought preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining the\n   State from taking any action to enforce the challenged provisions of H.B. 5 and H.B. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} With the agreement of all parties, the trial court entered an order temporarily staying the mandate of uncodified Section 803.100(B) of H.B. 49. Under the terms of the stay, municipalities did not have to adopt the provisions of R.C. 718.80 through 718.95 until February 24, 2018 or until further order of the court. In the same order, the trial court set a briefing schedule for the Athens plaintiffs' anticipated motion for a preliminary injunction. The trial court also scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for February 12 and 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Before briefing of the preliminary injunction motion concluded, a second coalition of Ohio municipalities (collectively, \"the Elyria plaintiffs\") moved to intervene in the Athens plaintiffs' action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Elyria plaintiffs had filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas on December 12, 2017. In their complaint, the Elyria plaintiffs had asked the trial court to (1) declare that the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 violate the Home Rule Amendment of the Ohio Constitution and (2) enjoin the implementation, application, and effectiveness of the challenged provisions of H.B. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Rather than answering the Elyria plaintiffs' complaint, the State moved to transfer the action to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. When the Lorain County court granted that motion, the Elyria plaintiffs decided to move to intervene in the Athens plaintiffs' action so they could participate in the upcoming preliminary injunction hearing. The trial court granted the Elyria plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} At the preliminary injunction hearing, the Athens and Elyria plaintiffs and the State presented witnesses and documentary evidence. The trial court, however, never explicitly ruled on the motion for preliminary injunction. Instead, in a judgment issued February 21, 2018, the trial court concluded that it could resolve the actions before it on their merits because the outcome of those actions hinged on legal determinations, i.e., whether the challenged provisions of H.B. 5 and H.B. 49 were facially unconstitutional. The trial court found: (1) the challenged provisions of H.B. 5 and H.B. 49 were constitutional under the Home Rule Amendment, (2) H.B. 49 did not violate the One-Subject Rule, and (3) the Athens plaintiffs' remaining legal challenges to H.B. 49 all failed. The trial court also dissolved the stay of the municipalities' obligation under uncodified Section 803.100 of H.B. 49 to adopt the provisions of R.C. 718.80 through 718.95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Athens plaintiffs now appeal the February 21, 2018 judgment and assign the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1. The trial court erred in granting judgment to the Defendant[s]-Appellees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2. The trial court erred in denying Plaintiff[s]-Appellants' request for preliminary injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Elyria plaintiffs also appeal the February 21, 2018 judgment, and they assign as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [1.] The trial court acted in derogation of Civ.R. 65(B)(2) when, in addressing Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, it dismissed Plaintiffs' Complaint without first issuing an order consolidating the trial on the merits with the preliminary injunction hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [2.] The trial court erred in finding that H.B. 49's amendments to Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code did not violate Plaintiffs' Home Rule Authority under Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We will begin our review with the Elyria plaintiffs' first assignment of error. By that assignment of error, the Elyria plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint without first consolidating the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Initially, the Elyria plaintiffs misapprehend the nature of the trial court's February 21, 2018 judgment. That judgment did not dismiss the Elyria plaintiffs' action; it entered a judgment on the merits in the State's favor. We thus interpret the Elyria plaintiffs' first assignment of error as challenging the February 21, 2018 judgment as a premature resolution of the merits of their action. While we agree that the trial court erred as argued, we do not find that the error warrants a reversal of the February 21, 2018 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Generally, a trial court may not dispose of a case on the merits following a hearing for a preliminary injunction without first consolidating that hearing with a trial on the merits or otherwise giving notice, either before or during the hearing, that the court intends to consider the merits.\n   <em>\n    Cairelli v.

This prohibition arises from Civ.R. 65(B), which states, \"Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a preliminary injunction, the court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application.\" Allowing discretionary consolidation saves time and expense for the court and the litigants.\n   <em>\n    Cairelli\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26 ;\n   <em>\n    Ohio Serv.

This argument misreads\n   <em>\n    Ohio Service Group\n   </em>\n   .

The Athens plaintiffs are incorrect. Municipal income tax administration is a line item in the Department of Taxation's budget. In uncodified Section 409.10 of H.B. 49, the General Assembly appropriated to the municipal-income-tax-administration fund $ 2.4 million in fiscal year 2018 and $ 5.15 million in fiscal year 2019. Previously, the money in the municipal-income-tax-administration fund solely paid the costs of administering the municipal income tax on electric-light and local-exchange-telephone companies.

Compared with the amount allocated to that fund for fiscal year 2017, the 2018-2019 budget \"provide[d] an additional $ 2.25 million in FY 2018 and $ 5.0 million in FY 2019 for the Department's administrative costs from the expected additional workload\" occasioned by R.C. 718.80 through 718.95.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Thus, contrary to the Athens plaintiffs' assertions, the General Assembly did not intend the State's retention of one-half percent of the net profit taxes collected to cover all the expected costs.

Here, however, the provisions at issue not only require an expenditure, they also relate to government revenue, the other main concern of an appropriations bill. While the revenues at issue stem from municipal-not state-tax, we cannot ignore the interconnected nature of the municipal and state fiscal systems. Given this connection, there is a practical, rational, and legitimate reason to include the challenged provisions in H.B. 49.

We thus turn to dictionaries published in the early twentieth century to determine the common, ordinary meaning of \"levy,\" a word not defined in the Constitution. At the time Article XVIII, Section 13 was written, the definition of \"levy\" included \"[t]o raise or collect by assessment; as, to\n   <em>\n    levy\n   </em>\n   taxes, toll, tribute, or contributions.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Webster's Unabridged Dictionary\n   </em>\n   768 (1911). Alternatively, \"to levy\" meant \"[t]o impose or assess (a tax) on property and collect it under authority of law.\" 1\n   <em>\n    Funk &amp; Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1024 (1906).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 45} From these definitions, we deduce that the General Assembly's authority over municipalities' power to levy taxes extends beyond limiting the imposition of taxes. By granting the General Assembly the authority to limit municipalities' power to levy taxes, Article XVIII, Section 13 endows the General Assembly with the capability to circumscribe the imposition, raising, and collection of a municipal tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Additionally, the history of Article XVIII, Section 13 extinguishes any doubt that the drafters interpreted \"levy\" more expansively than plaintiffs do. The delegates of the 1912 Constitutional Convention assigned the task of drafting home-rule related provisions to the committee on municipal government. During a meeting of all delegates, George W. Knight, a member of that committee, introduced the provision that became Article XVIII, Section 13 and answered questions about it. At that time, the proposed provision read, \"The general assembly shall have authority to limit the power of municipalities to levy taxes * * * for local purposes.\" 2\n   <em>\n    Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Ohio\n   </em>\n   , 1451 (1912), available at www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/LegalResources/LawLibrary/resources/day64.pdf (accessed Jan. 25, 2019).

In\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Imaging Venture\n   </em>\n   , the appellants challenged the constitutionality of a state statute requiring municipalities to pay interest on a municipal income tax refund. The appellants argued that the state statute transcended the authority reserved to the General Assembly under Section 13 of Article XVIII, asserting that \"while Section 13, Article XVIII permits the General Assembly to limit the levy of taxes by municipalities, it does not allow the General Assembly to interfere with local administration and regulation of lawfully levied taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20N.E.2d%20528\">\n    686 N.E.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the court found the challenged administrative measure a constitutional limitation on the municipality's taxing authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In arguing that \"levy\" does not include collection or administration, the Athens plaintiffs point this court to\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Keller v. Forney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"972449\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/108/463/\">\n    108 Ohio St. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20N.E.%2016\">\n    141 N.E. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1923). In that case, the Supreme Court of Ohio interpreted the phrase \"laws providing for tax levies\" as it appears in Article II, Section 1d of the Ohio Constitution. Not only does\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   focus on a different constitutional provision, its analysis turns on the word \"providing\" not \"levies.\" Consequently, we find\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   of no consequence to the resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Based on the common meaning of \"levy,\" the drafters' interpretation of Article XVIII, Section 13, and relevant precedent, we conclude that Article XVIII, Section 13 permits the General Assembly to enact legislation limiting municipalities' power to impose, collect, and administer taxes. Thus, because the provisions of R.C. 718.80 through 718.95 limit municipalities' ability to collect and administer net profit taxes, those provisions do not violate the Home Rule Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The Athens plaintiffs also attack uncodified Section 803.100(B) of H.B. 49, which provides that \"[i]n accordance with division (A) of section 718.04 of the Revised Code, each municipal corporation shall adopt, by ordinance or resolution, the provisions of sections 718.80 [through] * * * 718.95 of the Revised Code on or before January 31, 2018.\" The Athens plaintiffs contend that uncodified Section 803.100(B) is an unconstitutional attempt to dictate municipalities' legislative function, which is a power of local self-government. We reject this argument. Because Article XVIII, Section 13 permits the General Assembly to limit the municipalities' power to levy taxes, the General Assembly can require municipalities to enact legislation that accomplishes that aim. Therefore, uncodified Section 803.100(B) is a constitutional exercise of the General Assembly's authority under Article XVIII, Section 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Finally, we turn to plaintiffs' specific challenge to the constitutionality of R.C. 718.80(C)(3) and 718.85(B) under the Home Rule Amendment. R.C. 718.80(C)(3) authorizes the tax commissioner to withhold 50 percent of the net-profit-tax revenues due to a municipality if the municipality does not timely submit specified information to the tax commissioner. R.C. 718.85(B) directs the treasurer to retain one-half percent of the net profit taxes paid to the State as a fee for the collection and administration services provided. Plaintiffs argue that these provisions unconstitutionally empower the State to confiscate municipal funds. We disagree. Both provisions at issue are part of a broader statutory scheme to collect and administer net profit taxes, and both provisions enable and advance the collection and administration of net profit taxes. Consequently, as integral components of a statutory scheme constitutionally enacted to limit the power of municipalities to collect and administer taxes, R.C. 718.80(C)(3) and 718.85(B) are also constitutional under Article XVIII, Section 13 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Having dealt with the constitutionality of H.B. 49 under the Home Rule Amendment, we now consider the constitutionality of H.B. 5 under the same amendment. The Athens plaintiffs raise one argument regarding H.B. 5: it unconstitutionally eliminated municipal taxing\n   authority. This argument arises from the amendments to R.C. 715.013, which now reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (A) Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Revised Code, no municipal corporation shall levy a tax that is the same or similar to a tax levied under Chapter 322., 3734., 3769., 4123., 4141., 4301., 4303., 4305., 4307., 4309., 5707., 5725., 5726., 5727., 5728., 5729., 5731., 5735., 5736., 5737., 5739., 5741., 5743., 5747., 5749., or 5751. of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (B) This section does not prohibit a municipal corporation from levying an income tax or withholding tax in accordance with Chapter 718. of the Revised Code, or a tax on any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (1) Amounts received for admission to any place;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (2) The income of an electric company or combined company, as defined in section 5727.01 of the Revised Code ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (3) On and after January 1, 2004, the income of a telephone company, as defined in section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 54} A plain reading of this section reveals that it does not prohibit municipal corporations from levying taxes. It does restrict municipalities' ability to tax income by requiring municipalities to levy that tax in accordance with the limitations in R.C. Chapter 718.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 718.04(A) (\"Notwithstanding division (A) of section 715.013 of the Revised Code, a municipal corporation may levy a tax on income and a withholding tax if such taxes are levied in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in [R.C. Chapter 718].\"). However, as we concluded above, the General Assembly may constitutionally limit municipalities' power to levy taxes. While H.B. 5 increases regulation of the municipal power of taxation, it does not eliminate that power as the Athens plaintiffs claim. Accordingly, the General Assembly did not violate the Home Rule Amendment in enacting H.B. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 55} We next turn to the Athens plaintiffs' arguments that the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 violate other provisions of the Ohio Constitution. First, the Athens plaintiffs argue that the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 unconstitutionally impair the contracts many municipalities have executed with third-party tax administrators. Under these sorts of contracts, a municipality hires an entity, such as the Regional Income Tax Agency (\"RITA\") or another municipality, to collect and administer the municipality's income tax. The Athens plaintiffs contend that the State's implementation of a centralized system for the collection and administration of net profit taxes will cause the contracting municipalities to lose the benefits of their bargains with third-party tax administrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Pursuant to Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution, \"[t]he general assembly shall have no power to pass * * * laws impairing the obligation of contracts.\" To determine whether a statute violates Article II, Section 28, a court must first consider whether a state law has, in fact, substantially impaired a contractual relationship.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

First, the Athens plaintiffs fear that the tax commissioner will approve refunds or alternative apportionments that they themselves would not approve, thus decreasing the revenue they would otherwise derive from net profit taxes. While the Athens plaintiffs have identified possible future injury, they have not shown that that injury is certainly impending. At this point, the alleged injury is merely speculative. Consequently, the Athens plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact and, thus, cannot rely on third-party standing to pursue their due-course-of-law challenge to the refund and apportionment provisions of H.B. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Second, the Athens plaintiffs complain that the State will deprive them of revenue by appropriating one-half percent of the net-profit-tax revenues the State collects. Unlike the first alleged injury, the State's retention of funds is certainly impending, so the municipalities have demonstrated an injury in fact on that basis. However, the Athens plaintiffs have\n   no need to establish third-party standing. By their due-course challenge to the half-percent fee, the Athens plaintiffs want to be accorded a meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding their deprivation of property. This litigation is the Athens plaintiffs' meaningful opportunity. Through this lawsuit, the Athens plaintiffs have challenged the legality of the half-percent fee and sought relief from it by due course of law. Thus, regarding the half-percent fee, the Athens plaintiffs have received the protection of Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution, regardless of whether they have any direct claim to that protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 63} In the Athens plaintiffs' final constitutional argument, they contend that the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 will effect an unconstitutional taking under Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution. However, the Athens plaintiffs' takings argument consists of only a bald statement that an unconstitutional taking will occur. The Athens plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to satisfy their burden to affirmatively demonstrate error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Petro v.

Consequently, we reject the Athens plaintiffs' takings challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In their last claim, the Athens plaintiffs maintain that the challenged provisions of H.B. 49 convert municipal net-profit-tax revenues for use by the State. \"[C]onversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over property to the exclusion of the rights of the owner, or withholding it from his possession under a claim inconsistent with his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Joyce v.

Because Article XVIII, Section 13 of the Ohio Constitution authorizes the State to collect and administer municipal net profit taxes, the implementation of the challenged provisions does not result in conversion of municipal property. In short, the State's limited exercise of control over net-profit-tax revenues is neither wrongful nor violative of any property rights municipalities may have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 65} As a final matter, we acknowledge the numerous policy arguments made by the parties and the amici curiae in their briefs. Each side tries to convince us of the rightness of their position in the policy debate over the State's forays into the collection and administration of municipal taxes.

The parts of the legislation with which I disagree are the charging municipalities of one-half percent of all net profit taxes and allowing the state to keep as much as one-half of those taxes. No matter how you spin it or attempt to gloss over it, the state of Ohio is charging municipalities a tax. I do not believe the state of Ohio can legally tax municipalities. Nor do I believe the state of Ohio can legally seize and keep 50 percent of the net-profit tax due to a municipality, whether you call it a penalty or call it something else. I note that the state of Ohio now apparently has the sole power to decide if it can keep half of the tax revenue due to a city or municipality. An Ohio statute, passed by the Ohio legislature and signed by an Ohio governor, supposedly gives the state of Ohio the power to take large sums of income tax monies due cities and municipalities irrespective of local codes and ordinances. Apparently the legislature and the trial court feel that Home Rule does not apply in tax matters. I fear the majority of this court reinforces that feeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The Supreme Court of Ohio has ignored the One-Subject Rule repeatedly, especially when laws are enacted at the end of a legislative session, commonly called a Lame Duck Session.

I doubt that the Supreme Court of Ohio will begin to enforce the One-Subject Rule any time soon, but I am willing to be proven wrong on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 71} In short, the cities and municipalities are right to contest this legislative action to allow the state to seize and keep large sums of local tax dollars. I am especially not impressed by the attempt to avoid the clear requirements of the Home Rule Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 72} I dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
