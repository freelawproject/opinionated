Specifically, a class of laborers (\"the Class\") formerly employed by Linkmeyer Development II, LLC, and its members Steve Linkmeyer and Brian Bischoff (collectively, \"the Defendants\"), appeal the trial court's denial of their motion for summary judgment and the granting, in part, of the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Defendants appeal the remaining issues for which their motion for summary judgment was denied. The parties now present several issues for our review which we consolidate and restate as two: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying the parties' motions for summary judgment on the issue of breach of contract, and (2) whether the trial court erred in denying the Defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding the Indiana Wage Payment Statutes. Concluding the trial court did not err, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] Around June of 2009, Steve Linkmeyer approached the City of Lawrenceburg requesting a $ 3,000,000 loan to facilitate a development project on behalf of his company, Linkmeyer Development. On November 30, 2009, Linkmeyer, along with another member of Linkmeyer Development, Brian Bishoff, signed a document entitled \"Development Agreement Between the City of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and Linkmeyer Development II, LLC\" (\"the Development Agreement\"). Appellants' Appendix, Volume II at 103. The City of Lawrenceburg's city manager, Tom Steidel, and mayor, William Cunningham, also signed the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] The Development Agreement involved three properties: the Ellis property, the Walters property, and the Tanners Creek property. According to its terms, the City of Lawrenceburg would provide a $ 3,000,000 line of credit to Linkmeyer Development in return for the excavation and filling of the properties. Linkmeyer Development was required to purchase the Ellis property and the Walters property. The Lawrenceburg Redevelopment Commission would then convey the Tanners Creek property to Linkmeyer Development, some 21.5 acres of land which ran adjacent to Tanners Creek Drive, free of charge. Dirt was to be moved from the Ellis property to both the Walters property and the Tanners Creek property in order for the properties to be elevated out of the flood plain. In so doing, all three previously-undevelopable properties would become developable. Linkmeyer Development also agreed to petition the City of Lawrenceburg for the annexation of the Ellis property at the completion of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] The loan itself was to be paid in three installments, with the first $ 1,000,000 to be paid at the completion of the work on the east side of Tanners Creek, the second $ 1,000,000 to be paid at the completion of the project, and the third $ 1,000,000 to be paid when the Ellis property was successfully annexed. The $ 3,000,000 was loaned for a maximum of five years with an annual interest rate of 2%. Steidel prepared the Development\n   Agreement using a form document that he generally used in connection with loans made by the City of Lawrenceburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] Under \"Section II\" entitled \"Responsibilities of the Developer\" the Development Agreement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   The Developer must begin the project on or before August l, 2009 and complete the project by October 1, 2010. Developer shall comply with all appropriate codes, laws and ordinances including the payment of prevailing wages for labor as required by the State of Indiana and the City of Lawrenceburg. The Developer shall provide a final set of engineering plans and a final project construction cost estimate that shall be attached to, and become a part of, this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   The Developer(s) and their spouses must agree to sign personal guarantees for the amount borrowed as well as provide first mortgages for both the Ellis Properties and any city owned land that is conveyed to the Developer as part of this agreement. In, addition, they must agree to sign any other documents that may be appropriate to ensure that the City investment is secure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants' App., Vol. II at 46-47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [6] Consistent with the Development Agreement, the parties executed several additional documents, including a Promissory Note and a Mortgage in favor of the City of Lawrenceburg on the Tanners Creek and Ellis properties. Additionally, Bischoff, Linkmeyer, and both of their spouses, executed a personal guaranty. The guaranty stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ln consideration of the extension of credit by The City of Lawrenceburg, Indiana ... (\"Lender\") to Linkmeyer Development ... (\"Debtor\") and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged [by] the undersigned, jointly and severally if more than one, hereby guarantee to Lender the prompt performance and payment of all indebtedness, interest, principal, liabilities and obligations of Debtor to Lender pursuant to Debtor's Note ... in the principal amount of $ 3,000.000.00, Mortgage of Real Property (\"Mortgage\"); and Development Agreement (\"Development Agreement\") .... This is a Guaranty of payment and performance, including all collection efforts. Without limiting the foregoing, the undersigned, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally indemnifies and saves Lender harmless from and against all liabilities, suits, proceedings, actions, claims, assertions, charges, demands, delays, injuries, expenses (including reasonable attorney fees and disbursements) which are incurred by Lender as a result of any allegation determination or that the Obligations involve a fraudulent conveyance, transfer or obligation under federal or state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [7] At the completion of the project, Linkmeyer Development made the first few payments on the loan but eventually defaulted. On July 3, 2013, the six individuals now composing the Class,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint in Dearborn County Circuit Court alleging that a Lawrenceburg City Ordinance was incorporated by the Development Agreement and that the ordinance required the payment of prevailing wages.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    An Addendum to the Development Agreement was executed on November 30, 2009 \"[e]xtending the time line to complete the project to October 1, 2014.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 52.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The trial court certified the Class on December 26, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Entitled \"Contractors Required to Pay Prevailing Wages,\" Lawrenceburg Code Section 33.02 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    On any construction project approved by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation and financed in whole or in part by proceeds from sale of economic development bonds, grants or approved by or financed through any city agency, board, committee or commission, pursuant to an Investment Incentive Program, contractors retained to complete the project shall be required to pay the employed on the project wages equal to the prevailing wage customarily paid to each class of worker engaged in similar work in Lawrenceburg and surrounding areas.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    ('94 Code, \u00a7 33.02) (Ord. 1-1986, passed 4-7-86).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Pursuant thereto, the Class brought the following claims:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    Count I: Breach of Contract\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    Count II: Violation of the Indiana Common Construction Wage Act\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    Count III: Violations of Indiana Wage Statutes\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    Count IV: Request for Declaratory Relief\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    Count V: (Pleaded in the Alternative) Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Appellants' App., Vol. II at 37-41. The Defendants answered, arguing that neither the Development Agreement nor Section 33.02 required the payment of prevailing wages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    [8] During a telephonic pre-trial conference on May 15, 2017, the trial court agreed with the parties' joint request that liability be addressed by way of cross-motions for summary judgment, rather than a bench trial. On June 5, the Class filed its motion for partial summary judgment along with a brief and designation of evidence in support thereof, requesting summary judgment in its favor on Count I: Breach of Contract.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    at 71-96. On July 13, the Defendants filed their reply in opposition to the Class's motion for partial summary judgment and their cross-motion for summary judgment, requesting that the trial court deny the Class's partial motion for summary judgment and grant the Defendants' summary judgment as to all claims. The Class then filed a combined reply and response and the Defendants filed a reply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    [9] On September 12, the trial court held a hearing on the parties' respective motions for summary judgment and took the matter under advisement. Soon thereafter, the trial court issued an order denying the Class's motion for partial summary judgment and granting the Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment in part and denying in part. The order provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    The Court hereby denies [the Class's] Motion for Summary Judgement [sic] as to Count I - Breach of Contract and Count III - Violations of Indiana Wage Statutes. The Court grants Defendant's [sic] Motion for Summary Judgment as to the Count V - Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit. In all other respects, Defendant's [sic] Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Appealed Order at 1-2.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    [10] Agreeing this matter was suited for summary disposition, the parties jointly sought and obtained certification for interlocutory appeal from the trial court and we granted the parties' joint interlocutory appeal request on March 16, 2018.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    I. Motion to Strike\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    [11] Before preceding to the merits of this appeal, we must first address the Class's motion to strike portions of the Defendants' Reply Brief. Indiana Appellate Rule 42 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    Upon motion made by a party within the time to respond to a document, or if there is no response permitted, within thirty (30) days after the service of the document upon it, or at any time upon the court's own motion, the court may order stricken from any document any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, scandalous, or other inappropriate matter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    [12] The Class begins by asking that we strike four portions of the Reply Brief in which the Defendants assert that the Class raised a new argument \"that prevailing-wage statutes are remedial and are to be construed liberally.\" Appellants/Cross-Appellees' Motion to Strike Portions of Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Brief at 1. This argument centers around the following paragraphs in the Class's reply brief on appeal:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    In construing Section 33.02, it is important to recognize that \"[a] prevailing-wage statute is remedial in nature and should be applied liberally to carry out its purpose. Exceptions to prevailing-wage statutes must be narrowly construed.\" 51B C.J.S. \u00a7 1331 (2010). Further, the purpose of prevailing-wage laws is to \"safeguard workers' efficiency and general well-being and to protect them as well as their employers from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels detrimental to efficiency and well-being.\" 64 AM. JUR. 2d Public Works and Contracts \u00a7 214 (footnote omitted).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Should any doubt remain, it should be resolved in favor of the Class as \"[a] prevailing-wage statute is remedial in nature and should be applied liberally to carry out its purpose.\" 51B C.J.S. \u00a7 1331. And the purpose of prevailing-wage laws is to \"safeguard workers' efficiency and general well-being and to protect them as well as their employers from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels detrimental to efficiency and well-being.\" 64 AM. JUR. 2d Public Works and Contracts \u00a7 214 (footnote omitted).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Appellants' Reply and Cross-Appellees' Br. at 29-30, 35-36.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    [13] The Class argues that it raised this argument in its reply brief on summary judgment. Indeed, our review of the record reveals that the Class presented the first of the two paragraphs verbatim and the second paragraph is merely a derivative thereof.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Appellants' App., Vol. III at 144-45;\n    <em>\n     Spudich v. Northern Ind. Public Serv. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10819362\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/745/281/#p285\">\n     745 N.E.2d 281\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 285-87 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (holding new arguments can be raised in a reply brief on summary judgment),\n    <em>\n     trans. denied\n    </em>\n    . In response, the Defendants concede that the Class made such an argument in its reply brief on summary judgment but nevertheless maintain:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    When the Class mentioned 51B C.J.S. \u00a7 1331 in their summary judgment reply brief, they\n    <em>\n     cited\n    </em>\n    to it as a general standard of review when interpreting a prevailing wage ordinance in general. On the other hand, in their final appellate submission, they cited to it twice and\n    <em>\n     argued\n    </em>\n    it for the first time relative to their argument on the application of the Investment Incentive Plan.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Response in Opposition to Appellants/Cross-Appellees' Motion to Strike Portions of Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Br. at 2, \u00b6 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    [14] As the Defendants now acknowledge, the Class presented 51B C.J.S. \u00a7 1331 as a \"general standard of review when interpreting a prevailing wage ordinance in general.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10819362\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/745/281/#p285\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It is entirely consistent then, and well within the perimeters of their previously raised argument, for the Class to apply this general standard to a specific issue within the ordinance-such as the application of the investment incentive plan. That being said, we also recognize the nuance of the Defendants' argument, however inartfully presented. Because the Defendants presented a good faith argument and never expressly alleged that the Class's argument was waived, we decline to strike the relevant portions of the Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Brief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    [15] Next, the Class asks that we strike several of the Defendants' statements regarding the Class's construction of Section 33.02 of the Code of Lawrenceburg. Specifically, the Class takes issue with the following paragraphs of the Defendants' argument:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    [The Class] included words and punctuation in their diagram of \u00a7 33.02 during the summary judgment proceedings which were not present in the ordinance. In doing so, they advanced an argument that completely defeated their construction of \u00a7 33.02 as the proper one because it would result in the payment of prevailing wages on \"\n    <em>\n     all\"\n    </em>\n    construction projects approved by the city. When confronted with the erroneously broad interpretation of \u00a7 33.02, they then claimed they erred in their diagram of \u00a7 33.02 and shifted to another argument.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    The Class dissected \u00a7 33.02 differently than it did in their summary judgment papers thereby acknowledging that they overstated the application of \u00a7 33.02. They included words and punctuation in their diagram of \u00a7 33.02 during the summary judgment proceedings which were not present in the ordinance. In doing so, they advanced an argument that completely defeated their construction of \u00a7 33.02 as the proper one because it would result in the payment of prevailing wages on \"\n    <em>\n     all\"\n    </em>\n    construction projects approved by the city. When confronted with the erroneously broad interpretation of \u00a7 33.02, they then claimed they erred in their diagram of \u00a7 33.02 and shifted once again to another argument. They argued for the first time in the [sic] their Reply Brief that \u00a7 33.02 is remedial in nature and should be interpreted in a manner that results in the payment of prevailing wages.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Br. at 6, 14-15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    [16] During summary judgment proceedings, the Defendants pointed out that the Class, in its brief in support of partial summary judgment, had\n    <em>\n     incorrectly\n    </em>\n    included a comma in quoting Section 33.02.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Appellants' App., Vol. III at 26. The Class, in their summary judgment reply brief, responded that it \"was a typographical error, unnecessary to interpretation.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 147. Now, in its motion to strike, the Class highlights its admission of its mistake and contends that it is \"patently false to claim, as [the Defendants] now do, that the Class 'included words and punctuation in their diagram of \u00a7 33.02 during the summary judgment proceedings which were not present in the ordinance.' \" Appellants/Cross-Appellees' Motion to Strike Portions of Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Br. at 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    [17] Although the Class immediately acknowledged that it had incorrectly included a comma in Section 33.02, it did, in fact, add punctuation. And, to the extent that the Defendants argued the Class \"included\n    words\" to Section 33.02, when viewed in the greater context of their argument on appeal, it becomes evident that Defendants do not allege that the Class\n    <em>\n     literally\n    </em>\n    added words to the ordinance. Rather, the thrust of the Defendants' argument, as discussed further below, is that in order to arrive at the Class's desired interpretation of the ordinance, words must be\n    <em>\n     figuratively\n    </em>\n    added to the text. Thus, once again, we conclude the Defendants presented a good faith argument and we decline to strike the relevant portions of their Appellees/Cross-Appellants' Reply Brief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    II. Summary Judgment\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    [18] The Class bought five claims against the Defendants: Count I: Breach of Contract; Count II: Violation of the Indiana Common Construction Wage Act; Count III: Violation of the Indiana Wage Statutes; Count IV: Request for Declaratory Relief; and Count V: (pleaded in the alternative) Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit. Thereafter, the Class filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Count I: Breach of Contract and the Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to all claims. The trial court denied the Class's motion for partial summary judgment, granted the Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment as to Count V: Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    and denied the Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment in all other respects.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    On appeal, both the Class and the Defendants argue the trial court erred in denying their respective motions for summary judgment as to Count I: Breach of Contract. Additionally, the Defendants argue the trial court erred in denying their cross-motion for summary judgment as to Count III: Violation of Indiana Wage Statutes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

A third-party beneficiary contract is one in which the promisor has a legal interest in performance in favor of the third party and in which the performance of the terms of the contract between two parties must necessarily result in a direct benefit to a third party which was so intended by the parties.

Entitled \"Employment Standards,\" Section 33.01 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    On any construction project approved by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation financed in whole or in part by proceeds from sale of Economic Development Bonds or approved by or financed through any city agency, board, committee, or commission, pursuant to an investment incentive program, the Economic Development Commission or the Community and Lawrenceburg Development Corporation shall recommend that the contractor set as a goal the employment of at least 50% of the worker hours on a craft-by-craft basis, to be performed by bona fide residents of the\n    city or Dearborn County, and the employment of at least 10% minorities on a craft-by-craft basis.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    ('94 Code, \u00a7 33.01) (Ord. 1-1986, passed 4-7-86)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    [39] Although Section 33.01 reads \"approved by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation financed in whole or in part by proceeds from sale of Economic Development Bonds or approved by or financed through any city [entity][,]\" Section 33.02 reads, \"approved by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    financed in whole or in part by proceeds from sale of Economic Development bonds, grants or approved by or financed through any city [entity][.]\" (Emphasis added.) Without \"and\" or the addition of \"grants[,]\" Section 33.01 clearly applies to two different scenarios: (A) approval by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation accompanied by financing from the sale of Economic Development Bonds\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    (B) approval or financing through a city entity. These sections clearly serve a similar purpose as Section 33.01 sets forth goals to hire local and minority labor while Section 33.02 requires the payment of prevailing wages to labor. Reading the ordinance as a whole, therefore, we can find no reason why Section 33.01 would make approval of the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation optional while Section 33.02 would make such approval mandatory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Adams v. State,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7140516\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/960/793/#p798\">\n     960 N.E.2d 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 798 (Ind. 2012) (noting \"we read the statute as a whole, avoiding excessive reliance on a strict, literal meaning or the selective reading of individual words.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    [40] This interpretation also preserves the existence of the ordinance because the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation was dissolved on February 12, 1990.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eddy v. McGinnis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10925506\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/523/737/#p738\">\n     523 N.E.2d 737\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 738 (Ind. 1988) (noting \"[i]f there are two possible interpretations of the statute, and by one interpretation the statute would be invalid but by the other valid, the Court should adopt the interpretation which will uphold the statute\"); Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts \u00a7 5 (2012) (Presumption of Validity: \"An interpretation that validates outweighs one that invalidates (ut res magis valeat quam pereat)\"). If approval by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation was a sine qua non to Section 33.02's application, as the Defendants contend, the Section 33.02 would have been a nullity since 1990. The City of Lawrenceburg recodified its ordinances in 1994 and an additional fifteen years passed between recodification and the signing of the Development Agreement in 2009. In the absence of the ordinance's repeal in the interim, we find additional cause to interpret the ordinance so as to preserve its validity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    [41] For all of these reasons, we read Section 33.02 to provide two, separate prerequisites for its application. That is to say, Section 33.02 requires the payment of prevailing wages on any construction project \"[A] approved by the Lawrenceburg Development Corporation and financed in whole or in part by proceeds from sale of economic development bonds, grants\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      or\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    [B] financed through any city agency, board, committee or commission, pursuant to an Investment Incentive Program[.]\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    [42] Consistent therewith, the Class \"proceeds under the second half of Section 33.02, subsection [B] as diagramed.\" Appellants' Br. at 30. The next requirement for Section 33.02's application then, is that the project must have been \"approved by or financed through any city agency, board, committee or commission ....\" The face of the Development Agreement states the contract was made \"pursuant to Order Resolution dated July __, 2009, which was duly passed by the Lawrenceburg City\n    Council[.]\" Appellants' App., Vol II at 103. Furthermore, the project was financed by a $ 3,000,000 loan from the City of Lawrenceburg. These facts clearly establish that the project was\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    approved by and financed through the city.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    [43] Finally, Section 33.02 required that the construction project was approved or financed by the city \"pursuant to an Investment Incentive Program[.]\" Although the capitalization of \"Investment Incentive Program\" indicates a defined term carrying special meaning, the Code of Lawrenceburg does not provide a corresponding definition.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Schane v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters Union Local No. 710 Pension Fund Pension Plan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147849\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/585/#p588\">\n     760 F.3d 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 588 (7th Cir. 2014) (noting that a \"term [was] capitalized as if it were a specially defined term, [but] it is not listed in the definitions section of the plan.\"). And the term \"Investment Incentive Program\" appears only one other time in the Code of Lawrenceburg and is left uncapitalized in Section 33.01.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 38 (\"pursuant to an investment incentive program\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    [44] Undefined words in a statute or ordinance are given their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.\n    <em>\n     600 Land, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180195\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/889/305/#p309\">\n     889 N.E.2d at 309\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"In determining the plain and ordinary meaning of a term, courts may use English language dictionaries as well as consider the relationship with other words and phrases.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180195\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/889/305/#p309\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The terms \"investment incentives\" are broadly defined as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    inducements offered by the government or local authorities to encourage capital investment by the private sector either generally or in a specific area. Government inducements may take the form of capital grants towards the cost of equipment or tax reliefs on any profits earned. Local authority inducements usually take the form of reductions or exemptions from local taxes and organizing the local infrastructure for the convenience of potential investors. The rationale for such incentives depends primarily upon the government's objectives. It may want to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment, in which case investment through the multiplier effect will help, or it may want to give certain assisted areas additional help in tackling local problems of unemployment or urban renewal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Collins Dictionary of Economics (4th ed. 2005) (emphasis and parentheticals omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    [45] In the absence of a specific definition of an investment initiative program, the Class argues the \"sweetheart loan\" of $ 3,000,000 and the \"gratuitous transfer of 21.5 acres\" from the City of Lawrenceburg to Linkmeyer Development was intended to be an \"investment incentive.\" Appellants' Br. at 40. Although we agree that such generous terms could be fairly characterized as an investment incentive, Section 33.02 includes additional requirements that the construction project be approved or financed by the city \"\n    <em>\n     pursuant to\n    </em>\n    an\n    Investment Incentive\n    <em>\n     Program\n    </em>\n    [.]\" (Emphasis added.) Black's Law Dictionary defines \"pursuant to\" as \"[i]n compliance with; in accordance with; under\" or \"[a]s authorized by.\" (10th ed. 2014). The word \"program\" in this context is commonly defined as \"a plan or system under which action may be taken toward a goal.\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/program (last visited January 4, 2019). Therefore, read as a whole, we conclude Section 33.02 required more than simply an investment incentive that benefited the area. The City of Lawrenceburg must have approved or financed the construction project pursuant to a specific investment incentive program. One such investment incentive program in place at the time of the Development Agreement can be found in Indiana Code section 5-28-24-2. The statute provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    The [Indiana Economic Development] corporation shall establish policies to carry out an investment incentive program. The purpose of the program is to provide grants and loans to counties and municipalities that will, in turn, be loaned to certain new or expanding businesses for construction or for the purchase of real or personal property.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    [46] At this juncture, the Class has yet to designate evidence that the Development Agreement was approved or financed\n    <em>\n     pursuant to\n    </em>\n    Indiana Code section 5-28-24-2 or any other investment incentive program. The only evidence in the record is Mayor Cunningham's affidavit that he was:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    ... unaware of any project approved or financed by a City agency, board, committee or commission pursuant to any \"Investment Incentive Program\" while I served as Mayor or as Council Member.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Appellants' App., Vol. III at 55, \u00b6 12. The record further reflects that Mayor Cunningham was a signatory of the Development Agreement on behalf of the City of Lawrenceburg and he played a key role in its inception and subsequent approval. His testimony, therefore, is probative of whether the project was approved or financed pursuant to an investment incentive program.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    [47] Although Mayor Cunningham's affidavit did not \"affirmatively negate\" the Class's claim and thus it did not satisfy the Defendants' burden on their own motion for summary judgment,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hughley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925762\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/15/1000/#p1003\">\n     15 N.E.3d at 1003\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , it was sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925762\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/15/1000/#p1003\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, we conclude the trial court correctly denied\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    parties' motions for summary judgment regarding breach of contract.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

The City of Lawrenceburg's ordinance requires the payment of prevailing wages to those employed on any construction project financed by a city agency or similar entity pursuant to an investment incentive program.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 33.02.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    [3] Under the facts presented here-especially the fact that, under the Development Agreement, the City of Lawrenceburg extended a three-million-dollar line of credit with a two percent annual interest rate to Linkmeyer Development in return for work done on certain properties-there can be no dispute that the City of Lawrenceburg financed the construction. But the parties split hairs over the meaning of the phrase \"Investment Incentive Program\" found in section 33.02. And while the majority finds the parties' dispute over this phrase raises a genuine issue of material fact, I do not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    [4] The parties contest how this phrase should be interpreted. A question of statutory interpretation is a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     Nash v. State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8394154\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/881/1060/#p1063\">\n     881 N.E.2d 1060\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1063 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008). And summary judgment should be granted when the moving party deserved judgment as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     Goodwin v. Yeakle's Sports Bar &amp; Grill, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137688\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/62/384/#p386\">\n     62 N.E.3d 384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 386 (Ind. 2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    [5] Neither party offered evidence of a formal \"Investment Incentive Program\" in the City of Lawrenceburg. Thus, I can only conclude that Section 33.02 refers generally to investment incentive programs that benefit the area, not to any one specific or official program. And, simply put, the Development Agreement acted as an investment incentive program for the City of Lawrenceburg. Specifically, the City of Lawrenceburg incentivized this development-the investment-by agreeing to finance it. The Defendants then performed work that benefitted the City of Lawrenceburg. If that does not constitute an investment incentive, I do not know what does.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    [6] Therefore, I would find that the Class is entitled as a matter of law to the payment of the prevailing wage, and that the only issues of material fact are whether the Class did the work to qualify for the prevailing wage and if so, what the prevailing wage was.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
