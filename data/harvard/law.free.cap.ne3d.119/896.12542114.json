For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In January 2017, Carter was charged in a four-count indictment as follows: Count 1, aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A) ; Count 2, murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) ; Count 3, felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and Count 4, felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). The charges stemmed from the shooting and death of Donovan Alexander on December 22, 2016, at Jolly's Place, a bar located on the corner of Hulda Avenue and East 110th Street on Cleveland's east side. Carter pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Alyson Widen testified that she lives across the street from Jolly's Place and called 911 at approximately 11 p.m. on December 22 to report gunshots at Jolly's. The jury listened to Widen's 911 call, in which she reported that she had seen two men arguing in what appeared to be a \"standoff\" and heard five quick gunshots and later two more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Dominic Alexander, Donovan's brother, testified that he and Carter grew up in the same neighborhood, and their families knew each other. Dominic said\n   that he and others in the neighborhood knew Carter as Lil Ru or Vito.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Dominic testified that he and Donovan arrived at Jolly's at approximately 5:30 p.m. on December 22, and he set up his equipment to DJ for a birthday party that evening. People began arriving around 6:30 p.m.; Dominic said he and his brother knew almost everyone in the bar that night because it was a neighborhood gathering place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Around 9:30 p.m., Dominic went outside to smoke and saw Donovan standing outside. Dominic said that as he and Donovan stood outside near a stop sign mounted on a telephone pole in front of Jolly's, smoking and talking with other people, he saw Carter come from the empty field on East 110th Street across the street from Jolly's and approach Donovan. Dominic testified that Carter grabbed Donovan's arm and told him he wanted to talk to him, but Donovan pushed him off and told him to leave him alone. Dominic said that Carter was angry, and the two men began \"having words with each other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Dominic testified that Sierra Mason, a close friend of the family who was standing outside with Donovan, tried to calm Donovan down. Dominic said that other people from the neighborhood got between Carter and Donovan, trying to calm them down, and Reginald Jolly, the bar owner, grabbed Carter and tried to push him away. Dominic then saw Carter pull out a chrome semi-automatic gun and shoot four or five shots towards Donovan, \"right past the owner of the bar.\" Dominic saw Donovan run into the bar and Carter run down East 110th Street toward Shale Avenue. Dominic said that he heard two or three more gunshots after he ran into the bar but did not know who was shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Dominic testified that prior to his death, Donovan told him about an incident that occurred in August 2015 and created \"bad blood\" between Carter and Donovan. Dominic testified that he believed this incident led to the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Dominic testified that he did not have a firearm on his person that evening and did not observe anyone other than Carter fire a gun that evening. The police arrived only a few minutes after the shooting, and Dominic identified Carter as the shooter. Later that night, Dominic picked Carter out of a photo array, stating that he was \"100 percent\" sure of his identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Dominic identified state's exhibit No. 228 as a sketch he drew for the police that evening indicating where Dominic and Carter were standing when the shooting occurred. The drawing reflects that Donovan was standing in front of the stop sign, and Carter was standing a short distance away on East 110th Street, in a southeasterly direction from Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Dominic gave the police on the scene permission to search his Impala, which was parked next to Jolly's on the sidewalk on East 110th Street. The police found a handgun in Dominic's car, which Dominic testified did not belong to him. The police performed a gunshot residue test on Dominic that evening; he testified that he learned only three weeks prior to trial that the result was positive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Andre Hobbs testified that Donovan was his cousin, and that he, Donovan, and Carter, who he knew as Vito, grew up in the same neighborhood. Hobbs testified that he rode to Jolly's on December 22, 2016, with Dominic and Donovan and that during the ride, he saw a gun on the floor of the passenger side of the car that he thought belonged to Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Hobbs said that he sat in the DJ booth when Dominic and Donovan went outside to smoke. He testified that a little\n   later, he saw Donovan run into the bathroom of the bar, and he followed him inside. He saw Donovan sitting on the toilet, breathing heavily, and asked him what was wrong. When Donovan replied, \"He shot me,\" Hobbs asked \"Who?\" Hobbs testified that Donovan replied, \"Vito,\" lifted up his shirt, showed him the bullet wound, and then passed out. Hobbs identified Dominic and himself on state's exhibit No. 231, police body camera video from Cleveland police officer Brandon Melbar, who responded to the scene minutes after the shooting. Dominic can be seen on the video shouting that Vito shot his brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Hobbs also testified about an incident that happened in September 2015, at his residence. Hobbs said that at about 2:00 a.m. one morning, he heard someone banging on the front door. When Hobbs asked from an upstairs window who was there, the person replied, \"Vito.\" Hobbs said that when he asked Vito what he wanted, Vito replied, \"Tell your brother to give me my gun.\" Hobbs replied that he did not know what Vito was talking about, got dressed, and went downstairs. He said that by the time he came downstairs, his mother was talking to Vito, who Hobbs could see through the front door. Hobbs said that his mother told Vito that Donovan was not her son and did not live at that house, but Vito replied, \"If Don don't give me my gun, I'm going to get my other gun and I'm coming back and shooting this house up.\" Hobbs said that his mother immediately called the police. State's exhibit No. 210, the 911 call placed by Hobbs's mother, was played for the jury. In the call, Hobbs's mother states that she told the man he had the wrong house, but he told her he wanted his gun and if he did not get it, he was going to come back and \"light this whole house up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Hobbs testified that his brother and Donovan looked alike and frequently hung out together, which could have been why Vito thought Donovan was Hobbs's brother. Hobbs testified further that he later learned from Donovan about an earlier incident between Carter and Donovan that led to the incident at his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Sierra Mason testified that she grew up with Dominic, Donovan, and Carter, who she knew as Lil Ru or Vito. Mason said that she went to Jolly's on December 22, 2016, to celebrate a friend's birthday. She saw Carter come into the bar about 45 minutes after she arrived, and later noticed that he had left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Mason said that she smoked and talked with Donovan in the bar for awhile, and he then went outside. She testified that when he had not returned after 15 minutes, she went outside to look for him. She said that there were three cars parked on the sidewalk next to the bar: a Saab closest to the door, then a Cadillac, and behind the Cadillac, an Impala near a gate to a fenced-in area at the back of the bar. Mason said that when she walked out, she saw Reginald Jolly standing by the gate in front of Carter, holding him back. Mason said that she saw Donovan walking toward her from back by the gate, and heard him yelling and cussing about Carter. Mason testified that she walked toward Donovan, and pulled on him, trying to convince him to go back inside the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Mason said that she and Donovan walked between the Cadillac and the Saab toward the street, and stopped near the telephone pole at the corner; Mason said she was in the street; Donovan was on the curb. She then saw Carter, who had been standing between the Saab and Cadillac, walk into the middle of the street. Mason said she again urged Donovan to go back in the bar, but as she looked back at Carter, she saw him pull out his gun and point it. Mason testified that Donovan immediately pushed her down, and she fell to\n   the ground, where she curled up in a fetal position. She said that she heard five or six quick shots, after which she saw Carter run towards Shale Avenue. Mason testified that she did not see or hear anyone else shooting that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Mason said that when she went back in the bar, people told her that Donovan had been shot. Mason said that she went into the bathroom, saw Donovan sitting on the toilet, and heard him say he had been hit twice. She said that Andre asked him \"Who?\", and Donovan responded, \"Vito.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Reginald Jolly testified that when he walked outside Jolly's the evening of December 22, 2016, he immediately heard a \"small commotion\" but did not know what it was about. He said that he walked around the telephone pole and when he reached the front of the Saab, he saw Carter, who was standing on East 110th Street near the front of the Cadillac, pull a gun out of his pants. Jolly said that when he turned his head to see why Carter was pulling out a gun, he heard gunshots that sounded like they went by his head. He then saw Carter run down the street. Jolly testified that although he did not see Carter pull the trigger, he did not see anyone else with a gun that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Jolly testified that he finds old shell casings outside his bar every week, and that he told the police on the scene that evening that the casings they found were probably old. Later that evening, Jolly identified Carter in a photo array as the shooter, and told the police he was \"100 percent\" sure of his identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On cross-examination, Jolly said that he did not see Donovan outside the bar that night, and denied that he told police officers on the scene that Donovan had been standing in the area outside the bar where shell casings were found. Jolly admitted that he gave a statement to police in April 2017, but denied that he told the police that \"there were a lot of people on the side of the building with guns\" and that there were two people behind him with guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Paramedic Stacie Nofer testified that she responded to Jolly's within four minutes after the 911 call came in. She testified that she observed Donovan slumped over on the toilet, barely breathing. Nofer testified that Donovan was unconscious both at the scene and during the trip to University Hospitals, and that he went into cardiac arrest, and later died, as the paramedics transferred his care to UH personnel at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Brandon Melbar was one of several police officers who responded to the scene within three to four minutes of the 911 call. Melbar said he and his partner secured the area with caution tape, but said the scene was chaotic and nearly 50 people were milling around inside and outside the bar. Melbar identified state's exhibit No. 241 as video from his body camera at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Melbar said that he interviewed Dominic at the scene and learned that the shooter's name was Lil Ru. Melbar also spoke with the bartender, who told him that Donovan did not have a gun and that a second volley of shots occurred while Donovan was in the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Cleveland Police Officer James Thomas also responded to Jolly's after the 911 call. Thomas testified that he was advised while on the scene that there had been another shooting nearby on Shale Avenue but the police never found a link between the two shootings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Thomas testified that the police found eight shell casings in front of the door to Jolly's, as well as a live bullet in the street near the front of Cadillac. He testified that Jolly told him that the shooter\n   was near the Cadillac at some point during the shooting, and that Donovan was shot in front of the bar where the casings were found. Officer Thomas said that the shots that killed Donovan did not come from near the Cadillac because no spent shell casings were found there. He testified that the officers on the scene believed that the shooter's gun likely malfunctioned when the shooter was by the Cadillac, and the shooter then cleared the malfunction, ejecting the live bullet that was found near the Cadillac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Ballistics testing conducted on the eight shell casings retrieved from the crime scene demonstrated that the casings were from two different guns. Five of the shell casings - those located on the sidewalk close to the bar door - were fired from the same 9 mm pistol. The other three shell casings - recovered from the street in front of the telephone pole - were fired from a different 9 mm pistol. None of the casings matched the morgue pellet recovered from Donovan's body, and none of the casings were fired from the guns retrieved from Dominic or Reginald. Likewise, DNA testing conducted on the eight casings revealed no statistical match to Carter or to Donovan. Gunshot residue tests on Dominic and Donovan's hands were positive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The jury found Carter not guilty of Count 1, but guilty of Counts 2 through 4, and the accompanying firearm specifications. At sentencing, the parties agreed that Counts 3 and 4 were allied offenses of Count 2, and the state elected to sentence on Count 2. The trial court sentenced Carter to 15 years to life on Count 2, and three years on the firearm specification, to be served consecutively, for a total sentence of 18 years to life. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dying Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court admitted the hearsay statements made by Donovan to Hobbs, and overheard by Mason, when Donovan told Hobbs in the bathroom immediately after the shooting that Vito shot him. Defense counsel did not object to Hobbs's testimony about what Donovan told him, but objected when Mason testified about Donovan's statement. The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the hearsay statement as a dying declaration. In his first assignment of error, Carter contends that Donovan's statement was not a dying declaration, and that by allowing the statement, the trial court violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" In\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

However, although not admissible under a hearsay exception, such testimonial statements may be admissible under one of the two historical exceptions to the Confrontation Clause recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court: forfeiture by wrongdoing (when the defendant engaged in conduct designed to keep the witness from testifying) and dying declarations.\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

Thus, the statements qualified as an excited utterance under Evid.R. 803(2). Furthermore, the statements met the requirement for relevancy under Evid.R. 401.

The third step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5695\">\n    2012-Ohio-5695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Applying this test to the challenged testimony, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in admitting the evidence. The other acts evidence was relevant because it tended to show why Carter shot Donovan. Although neither Dominic nor Hobbs testified as to what occurred during the earlier incident, they both testified they were aware of an incident between the two men that they believed led to the shooting. Dominic specifically testified that the earlier incident created \"bad blood\" between Carter and Donovan. The testimony was therefore admitted for a legitimate purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), which provides that other acts evidence may be admitted to show motive. Dominic and Hobbs's testimony was relevant to Carter's motive for shooting Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 48} And despite Carter's arguments otherwise, the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial court carefully limited Donovan and Hobbs's testimony about the prior incident. It did not permit them to testify as to what the initial incident involved because neither had any firsthand knowledge of the incident. Moreover, it did not allow the state to establish why 15 months elapsed between the incident at Hobbs's house and Donovan's shooting because evidence that Carter was\n   incarcerated shortly after the September 2015 incident was inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Nevertheless, Carter argues that Hobbs should not have been allowed to testify about the incident that occurred at his house in September 2015 because that incident had no relationship to Donovan's murder. He contends that Carter was looking for Hobbs's brother, not Donovan, that morning and, in any event, there was no evidence that Carter did anything in the year after that incident to carry out his threats. Carter's arguments have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Carter was not looking for Hobbs's brother that morning; he was looking for Donovan, who he believed to be Hobbs's brother and who he apparently thought lived at that address. As demonstrated on the 911 call made by Hobbs's mother, Carter threatened to \"light the place up\" if Donovan did not return his gun. Thus, the incident was related to Donovan's murder. And there was no testimony about what Carter did in the year after the incident because he was incarcerated, an inadmissible fact that was not presented to the jury precisely because it would have been unfairly prejudicial to Carter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 51} A trial court's decision to admit other acts evidence is within the trial court's discretion, and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Carter acknowledges that he was acquitted of aggravated murder charged in Count 1 (thus any alleged error regarding that jury instruction is moot), but contends that the jury should have been instructed on involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault regarding Counts 2, 3, and 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Count 2 charged felony murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), which provides that \"[n]o person shall cause the death of another as a proximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree and that is not [voluntary or involuntary manslaughter].\" Involuntary manslaughter under R.C. 2903.04(A), defined as \"no person shall cause the death of another * * * as a proximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit a felony,\" is almost identically worded but expands the definition to include\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   felony offense, instead of limiting the predicate crime to a first- or second-degree felony offense of violence. Thus, Carter contends the jury should have been instructed on involuntary manslaughter, with aggravated assault as the predicate offense. We disagree, because the record lacks any evidence that Carter was provoked to shoot Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 63} The evidence was clear that Carter initiated the confrontation: he approached Donovan on the street outside Jolly's and grabbed his arm. According to Dominic, Carter was already angry, and after he grabbed Donovan's arm, the men began \"having words with each other.\" There was testimony that Donovan insulted Carter using vulgar language. Words alone, however, will not constitute reasonably sufficient provocation to incite the use of force in most situations.\n   <em>\n    Shane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714659\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/630/#p632\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20272\">\n    590 N.E.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no evidence that Donovan physically threatened Carter, or that he pulled out a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Rather, the evidence established that although people got between Carter and Donovan and tried to calm them down, Carter pulled out a gun and shot Donovan. Although Carter speculates that there were multiple shooters, all of the witnesses to the shooting testified that he was the only individual who pulled out a gun. Furthermore, although the police found multiple shell casings from multiple guns at the scene, which Carter argues supports the multiple-shooter theory, Reginald Jolly testified that he finds shell casings on the ground outside his bar every week, and that the casings found by the police were likely already there before the shooting. Moreover, although the gun residue tests on Donovan and Dominic were positive, there was evidence that one can test positive for gun shot residue by being in close proximity to gunfire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 65} In short, we find no evidence to support Carter's assertion that the jury could have reasonably concluded that he was provoked to shoot that night. Rather, in light of the incident that occurred in August 2015, the evidence demonstrated\n   that Carter still carried a grudge against Donovan that he had apparently not gotten over more than a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Without any evidence of serious provocation, no jury could reasonably conclude that the evidence in this case supported an acquittal on the felony murder charge and a conviction for involuntary manslaughter with aggravated assault as the underlying felony, or that the felonious assault charges were merely aggravated assault.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

Furthermore, although Jolly testified that Carter had to shoot over the Saab because he was standing in front of the Cadillac, he clarified on redirect that Carter was standing on East 110th Street when he pulled out his gun. And police\n   officer Thomas testified that Jolly told him that evening that the shooter was by the Cadillac where the live round was found \"at some point\" but that the shooting occurred in front of the bar where the casings were found. The jury could have reasonably concluded from this evidence that Carter was standing in the street when he shot Donovan, in a direction from which he could aim and hit Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Carter also argues that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because none of the shell casings matched the bullet recovered from Donovan's body. But Jolly told the police immediately after the shooting that the shell casings on the ground were probably old because he found old casings outside the bar every week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 76} Furthermore, the evidence demonstrated that more than 50 people were milling around in and outside the bar when the police arrived. Officer Thomas testified that it was difficult to secure the scene because there were so many people walking around outside, and that the police finally put a bar stool in front of the door to Jolly's to keep people from walking through the area where the shell casings were found. Officer Melbar likewise testified that the scene was chaotic when the police arrived, and that it was possible that evidence on the ground had been moved around because of the large number of people milling around outside the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 77} Carter's argument that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because there were multiple shooters that evening and he was provoked to shoot Donovan is based on mere conjecture. The jury heard the inconsistencies in the testimony and resolved them accordingly. This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against the convictions and the jury lost its way. The assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, P.J., and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   SEAN C. GALLAGHER, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
