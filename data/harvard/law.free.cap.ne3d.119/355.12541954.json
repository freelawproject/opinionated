The essential elements of OUI under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, are \"(1) operation of a motor vehicle, (2) on a public way, (3) while under the influence of alcohol.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826208\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/630/#p631\">\n    420 Mass. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that the apartment complex parking lot where the defendant was observed pulling out of a parking spot was a \"way,\" that is, \"any place to which the public has a right of access,\" or \"any way or ... any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\" G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1). We disagree. The evidence established that the parking lot was paved, that visitors parked there, and that motorists used the lot as a \"cut-through\" to avoid traffic at the intersection of Winter and Middle Streets. There were no \"no trespassing\" signs, gates, or any other barriers at either entrance to the parking lot. Thus, the judge could have reasonably inferred that \"the physical circumstances of the way [were] such that members of the public may reasonably conclude that it [was] open for travel to invitees or licensees.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157075\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/26/235/#p238\">\n    26 Mass.

While residents had called the police to tow illegally parked cars in the past, \"it is the objective appearance of the way that is determinative of its status, rather than the subjective intent of the property owner\" or residents.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1038815\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/41/545/#p549\">\n    41 Mass.

General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24, is intended to \"protect the public from drivers whose judgment, alertness, and ability to respond promptly and effectively to unexpected emergencies are diminished because of the consumption of alcohol.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p172\">\n    394 Mass. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172-173 (1985). Thus, to obtain a conviction under the statute, \"the Commonwealth need not prove the defendant actually drove unskillfully or carelessly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p172\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p172\">\n    . at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the evidence must be sufficient to support an inference that the defendant's consumption of alcohol diminished his \"\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   \" and \"\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   \" to operate a motor vehicle safely (emphasis in original).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p172\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p172\">\n    . at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (1994).
