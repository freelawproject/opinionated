Flynn, filed a complaint against defendant, the Town of Normal (Normal), alleging Normal's negligent and willful and wanton misconduct caused a motor vehicle collision, which resulted in serious personal injury to George, including the amputation of both of his legs, and loss of consortium to Irene. The trial court granted summary judgment in Normal's favor and plaintiffs appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 17, 2012, at approximately 5 p.m., George was involved in a motor vehicle accident on a two-lane historic bridge in Normal, Illinois. The bridge was known as the \"Camelback Bridge\" due to its distinctive \"humped configuration.\" It was originally built around 1871, and in 2001, it was reconstructed. Normal was granted federal funding for the bridge reconstruction and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) administered the funds. Prior to the reconstruction, Normal was required to submit proposed plans for the bridge to IDOT and the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office for review and approval. During the reconstruction, the bridge was widened, and its vertical crest was lowered by several inches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 On the date of the accident, George was traveling eastbound over the crest of the bridge at approximately 25 miles per hour when he observed a vehicle driven by Jill M. Laird stopped in traffic ahead of him. George attempted to stop his vehicle but was unable to do so and struck the rear of Laird's vehicle. He then exited his vehicle, spoke with Laird, and walked between Laird's vehicle and his own. As George was between the two automobiles, a vehicle driven by Dr. Smita Amit Vyas traveled over the crest of the bridge in the eastbound lane and struck George's vehicle. George's vehicle was propelled forward and struck George, pinning him between the vehicles and, ultimately, resulting in the amputation of his legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In November 2012, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Vyas, alleging negligence and loss of consortium. In October 2013, they filed a 15-count amended complaint, naming Vyas, Normal, Normal Township, and the county of McLean as defendants. The record reflects plaintiffs' claims against Vyas were dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement and their claims against Normal Township and the county of McLean were dismissed without prejudice on plaintiffs' own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Relevant to this appeal, plaintiffs raised claims of negligence (count III), willful and wanton misconduct (count IV), and loss of consortium (counts V and VI) against Normal. Plaintiffs asserted Normal \"owned, operated, managed, maintained[,] and controlled\" the Camelback Bridge. Relative to their negligence claim, plaintiffs asserted that Normal was negligent in the following ways:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"a. Owned, operated, managed, maintained[,] and controlled the bridge and adjacent roadway with an excessive and unsafe crest obscuring vision of approaching vehicles to vehicles on the bridge and beyond in an unsafe proximity to the crest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   b. Posted, caused[,] and/or allowed an excessive speed limit for the bridge; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   c. Owned, operated, managed, maintained[,] and controlled the bridge and/or adjacent roadway with an unsafe and improper road surface relative to the coefficient of friction.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs maintained Normal's negligent acts or omissions proximately caused George's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 In alleging willful and wanton misconduct by Normal, plaintiffs reasserted that Normal owned, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled the Camelback Bridge. They further alleged that the bridge was \"extremely dangerous and unsafe for motorists\" due to a combination of the \"severe\" crest of the bridge that obstructed the sight line of approaching motorists, the speed limit of the bridge approach, a road surface that was too slick, and the lack of any warning regarding the dangers posed by the bridge. According to plaintiffs, \"the speed set for vehicles approaching the bridge increased the danger of collisions with vehicles on the bridge.\" They alleged Normal knew that the bridge was unsafe and motorists would not realize its dangers but allowed the unsafe conditions to remain, exhibiting \"a course of conduct of utter indifference and conscious disregard for the safety of motorists using the Camelback Bridge and its approaches.\" Additionally, plaintiffs alleged George's injuries were proximately caused by Normal's willful and wanton acts, which consisted of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"a. Refused to cause or allow the bridge crest to be modified to a safe elevation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b. Refused to cause or allow the speed limit at and around the bridge to be reduced;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   c. Refused to cause or allow the bridge to be resurfaced with [a] proper and safe surface;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   d. Refused to close the bridge to vehicular traffic;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   e. Refused to warn motorists of the above unreasonably dangerous conditions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs reiterated the allegations raised in connection with their negligence and willful and wanton misconduct claims against Normal in their counts alleging loss of consortium to Irene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 In February 2016, Normal filed a motion for summary judgment. It maintained, in part, that (1) plaintiffs' action was barred by Illinois's 10-year construction statute of repose ( 735 ILCS 5/13-214(b) (West 2012) ), (2) it owed no duty of care to George because he was not an intended and permitted user of the roadway at the time he was injured as set forth in section 3102(a) of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Tort Immunity Act) ( 745 ILCS 10/3-102(a) (West 2012) ), and (3) its conduct did not proximately cause George's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 Normal filed a statement of facts in support of its motion along with numerous attachments. The attachments included depositions from the individuals involved in the October 2012 accident and various Normal employees, a police report and photographs from the October 2012 accident, documents pertaining to the bridge reconstruction, and portions of the Normal Municipal Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10 The record reflects that, during his deposition, George testified he was familiar with the Camelback Bridge, having traveled across it \"with some degree of frequency\" when going to and from his office in downtown Bloomington, Illinois. On the day of the accident, it was damp outside with light rain. George stated he traveled in an easterly direction over the bridge. As he traveled over the bridge's crest, he saw Laird's vehicle stopped in his lane of travel. He also noticed that there was a line of vehicles \"all the way up to the stop sign\" at the upcoming intersection. George testified he \"slammed on [his] brakes\" but his vehicle slid forward rather than stop and he collided with Laird's stopped vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   He recalled that he put his vehicle in park and hurriedly exited his vehicle. George stated the collision \"made a pretty good noise\" and, because he was concerned for the welfare of the other driver, he did not pull his vehicle over or move it off the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 According to George, Laird also exited her vehicle. They \"had a brief exchange\" regarding whether either had been hurt and both reported that they were uninjured. They also discussed whether or not to report the accident to the police. They determined that there was no damage to the vehicles and, thus, no need to report the accident. Laird then noticed \"a little chip of paint\" on her rear bumper. George testified he walked between the vehicles to look for damage and to converse with Laird regarding whether she had been hurt. He stated that, as they conversed, Laird stood near the right rear taillight of her vehicle. While George was positioned between Laird's vehicle and his own, a third vehicle, driven by Vyas, traveled across the bridge and struck the back of George's vehicle. George testified the impact pushed his vehicle forward and pinned him between the two vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 At her deposition, Laird testified similarly to George. She described the weather as \"drizzling rain\" and stated she had stopped her vehicle at the \"base\" or \"at the bottom of the bridge\" due to a line of cars ahead of her. She was then rear-ended by George. Laird and George exited their vehicles and \"very quickly\" confirmed with each other that they were both \"okay\" and insured. According to Laird, they started to look to see if either vehicle was damaged and spoke about calling the police. She testified both she and George were positioned between the vehicles but she \"stepped over\" to look at her exhaust pipe. Laird recalled that George was walking toward her when a third vehicle \"came over the bridge and could not stop.\" The vehicle struck George's vehicle and pinned George between his and Laird's vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 Laird testified that after George rear-ended her, she did not move her car off to the side of the road because there were guardrails and \"nowhere to go.\" When asked whether she had been concerned about another vehicle colliding with George's vehicle while they discussed the incident, Laird responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"You know, it happened so fast. It was like I got out of my car, he got out of his car, we made sure we were okay, we just walked between those cars. And I-we were going to call the police and my guess-my thinking was then just move the cars somewhere. We would have had to have gone off on [the next street] somewhere or down the street further. There's not too much space from when you come off the bridge, I would guess maybe four or five car lengths, to [the next street]. But we would have had to have moved probably to another place.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 During her deposition, Vyas testified she was traveling slowly over the bridge. She did not see anything out of the ordinary until she reached the \"top\" of the bridge. She did not recall whether she first saw George or his vehicle. Vyas stated she \"slammed the brakes\" in an attempt to avoid a collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 As stated, Normal also submitted the depositions of several of its current and former employees who testified regarding the bridge reconstruction process, as well as documents pertaining to the reconstruction. Those depositions and attachments showed that, at the time of the bridge reconstruction, Normal installed a traffic calming device, called a partial traffic circle, at the west approach to the Camelback Bridge for the purpose of slowing traffic. Sometime after its installation and prior to the accident at issue on appeal,\n   the partial traffic circle was removed. Normal's city manager, Mark Peterson, testified the partial circle was removed because it presented a maintenance problem, it was not effective in calming traffic, and it was a traffic hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 Normal's filings also showed that the default speed limit for the Camelback Bridge was 30 miles per hour. Employees testified that Normal had no documentation or records demonstrating that it posted or removed speed limit signage near the bridge after reconstruction. However, Wayne Aldrich, Normal's city engineer from 1998 to 2002, testified that 10-mile-per-hour advisory signs were posted at both bridge approaches after the bridge was reconstructed. He did not know if the signs were ever removed. Further, Aldrich did not recall any document that required the posting of 10-mile-per-hour advisory speed signs as part of the reconstruction project. John Hopper, a traffic technician for Normal, testified at the time of his October 2015 deposition that 10-mile-per-hour advisory speed signs were \"currently\" posted on both sides of the bridge. Hopper did not know when the sign for eastbound traffic was placed or who made the decision to install it. In connection with its filings, Normal asserted there was \"no speed limit signage on the eastbound approach to the bridge\" in 2009 as evidenced by a \"2009 aerial sign inventory.\" Further, it alleged that, at the time of George's accident, \"there was a 10 miles per hour traffic signal for westbound traffic approaching the bridge, but no similar signal for eastbound traffic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 In May 2016, plaintiffs filed a response to Normal's motion for summary judgment. They maintained that the vertical crest of the Camelback Bridge was unsafe with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour and, following back and forth discussions with IDOT during the reconstruction process, Normal agreed to lower the speed limit of the bridge. According to plaintiffs, Normal also agreed to the installation of a partial traffic circle on the west side of the bridge to slow traffic. Plaintiffs asserted Normal's agreements as to the reduced speed limit and partial traffic circle were incorporated into the final plans for the bridge reconstruction. They argued Normal initially implemented the agreed-upon measures but then failed to maintain them and that they were not in place at the time of George's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 Relevant to this appeal, plaintiffs further maintained that George was a motorist at the time of the incident at issue and, thus, an intended and permitted user of the Camelback Bridge under the Tort Immunity Act. Further, they asserted George's injuries were proximately caused by Normal's acts or omissions, in that Normal knew the Camelback Bridge was unsafe with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour but failed to post \"lowered speed signs\" or maintain the traffic calming device. Finally, plaintiffs asserted the 10-year construction statute of repose did not apply because they raised failure-to-maintain claims against Normal rather than claims solely related to the design or the construction of the bridge. In particular, they asserted Normal had an ongoing ministerial duty to maintain the lowered traffic speed signs and the partial traffic circle but that Normal failed in its duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 Plaintiffs also attached several documents to their response. Those attachments included police reports regarding other accidents on the bridge that showed the Camelback Bridge had a posted speed limit of 10 miles per hour in November 2006 and August 2007 but a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour during the later months of 2007, in 2008, and in 2009. They also submitted IDOT records showing that on February 1, 2000, during the reconstruction\n   process, Aldrich sent correspondence to IDOT requesting a \"design variance\" for the bridge's \"vertical curves on the east and west approaches.\" Aldrich stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"For a 30 MPH design speed, approximately 200 foot vertical curves are required. However, the posted speed limit will be 20 MPH with an advisory speed limit of 10 MPH at the bridge. At these speeds, 100 foot vertical curves are acceptable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Aldrich then proposed a 100-foot vertical curve \"[t]o better match the existing roadway,\" to minimize the effects of reconstruction on adjacent property owners, and to \"minimize the limits of the roadway reconstruction.\" On February 23, 2000, IDOT responded to Aldrich's letter and stated it had approved his request for a design variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20 IDOT's records further contain a document titled \"Local Project Development Report For Group II Categorical Exclusions And Design Approval,\" which was signed by various individuals involved in the reconstruction process in July 2000. That document showed that the plans included lowering the vertical crest of the Camelback Bridge by seven inches to increase sight distance and identified 10 miles per hour as the recommended posted speed for the new bridge. Further, it noted the following design variance for the reconstruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Variance for vertical curves-For a 30 mph speed, a 200-foot vertical curve length is required. For the proposed posted speed of 20 mph with an advisory speed limit of 10 mph at the bridge, 100-foot vertical curves are requested.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Kenneth Hemstreet, a licensed civil engineer and former IDOT employee with 45 years of experience in road, highway, and bridge construction and design. Hemstreet stated he reviewed documentation from Normal, IDOT, and private contractors regarding the Camelback Bridge reconstruction project. He averred that \"stopping sight distance\" was central to safe road and bridge design and described it as \"the line of sight for the driver and the distance needed for a given speed limit.\" Hemstreet stated that \"[t]he greater the speed, the more distance the driver covers in a period of time\" and \"the greater the stopping distance must be.\" When stopping sight distance is impaired, the speed limit must be reduced to bring a road or bridge into conformity with IDOT standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22 Hemstreet maintained that IDOT rejected proposed plans for the bridge reconstruction project that left the bridge's vertical crest largely intact and had a 30-mile-per-hour speed limit. He asserted that, ultimately, Normal proposed the installation of a partial traffic circle, a reduced speed limit of 20 miles per hour, and an advisory speed limit of 10 miles per hour for the bridge. Hemstreet asserted these proposals were accepted and included within Normal's final project development report. According to Hemstreet, Normal was required to reduce the speed limit of the Camelback Bridge from 30 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour with an advisory speed limit of 10 miles per hour and to install and maintain a partial traffic circle. Hemstreet asserted the failure to maintain both the reduced speed limit and the partial traffic circle rendered the bridge unsafe. He maintained that \"[t]he rear-ending accidents that precipitated [George's] injuries\" were \"precisely the kind of accident that the IDOT minimum stopping sight distance standards [spoke] to and [were] designed to avoid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 23 In September 2016, the trial court conducted a hearing on Normal's motion for summary judgment and granted the\n   motion. In October 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider and for leave to file a second amended complaint. In December 2016, the trial court entered a written order denying both plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and for leave to file a second amended complaint. Additionally, the court clarified its previous order, stating it only granted summary judgment in Normal's favor on the bases that (1) the Illinois construction statute of repose barred plaintiffs' claims, (2) George was not an intended or permitted user of the Camelback Bridge, and (3) the \"Doctrine of Proximate Cause\" barred plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 24 This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 On appeal, plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by granting Normal's motion for summary judgment. They contend the court erred in finding (1) George was not an intended and permitted user of the Camelback Bridge under the Tort Immunity Act, (2) Normal demonstrated its actions did not proximately cause George's injuries as a matter of law, and (3) the construction statute of repose barred plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs contend the court also erred by denying them leave to file a second amended complaint, which would have conformed their pleadings to the proof and not added any new issues to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 \"Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and other matters on file establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

Plaintiffs maintain that because George was a motorist at the time of the initial traffic collision with Laird, he was clearly an intended and permitted user of the roadway. They assert his action in exiting his vehicle after the collision was entirely foreseeable. Further, plaintiffs maintain that George was an intended and permitted user of the bridge because he was required by the Illinois Vehicle Code (Vehicle Code) to remain at the scene of his accident with Laird. See 625 ILCS 5/11-401, 11-402 (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 In response, Normal characterizes George as \"a pedestrian standing on the bridge roadway\" rather than a motorist.

Further, they seek to impose a duty upon Normal to keep the Camelback Bridge safe for use by motor vehicles, not pedestrians. Additionally, we note plaintiffs also argue that Normal's negligence caused both of the underlying collisions in this case-George's initial collision with Laird, which occurred when he was indisputably a motorist, and the second collision between Vyas's vehicle and George's vehicle. Thus, unlike\n   <em>\n    Sisk\n   </em>\n   , where the county's alleged negligence only resulted in harm to the plaintiff as he used the road as a pedestrian, Normal's alleged negligence in this case resulted in harm to George as a motorist on the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 42 Finally, we note that the Tort Immunity Act provides that a public entity owes a duty to maintain its property in a reasonably safe condition for \"people whom the entity intended and permitted to use the property in a manner in which * * * it was\n   <em>\n    reasonably foreseeable\n   </em>\n   that it would be used.\" (Emphasis added.) 745 ILCS 10/3-102(a) (West 2012). Thus, to the extent Normal suggests that George simply cannot be considered a motorist because he exited his vehicle and stood or walked on the bridge, we must disagree. As demonstrated by\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   , a reasonably foreseeable use of a city street by a motorist may include exiting a disabled vehicle. We find it is reasonably foreseeable that a motorist involved in a motor vehicle collision might exit a vehicle for safety reasons; to warn other motorists of a collision; to render aid to a person involved in the collision; or, as in this case, to determine the well-being of another driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 43 Accordingly, we find that George, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   , was utilizing the Camelback Bridge as a motorist.

The record reflects no such measures were present for eastbound traffic on the day of George's accident and that the default speed limit on the bridge was 30 miles per hour, a speed that was not in line with IDOT's standards for stopping sight distance. Both George and Vyas testified to observing obstacles in their lane of travel as they went over the crest, or the \"top,\" of the bridge, and being unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. Evidence reflects that George was traveling at a speed of 25 miles per hour while Vyas testified she was traveling \"slowly.\" Additionally, Hemstreet averred that rear-end collisions like the ones that occurred in this case were \"precisely the kind of accident that IDOT minimum stopping sight distance standards\" were \"designed to avoid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 51 Under these circumstances, we find a question of fact exists as to whether George's injury would have occurred absent Normal's failure to maintain speed limit signage or a traffic calming device at the eastbound approach to the bridge. A reasonable jury could find that, had measures been employed to slow traffic, George and Vyas would have reduced their speeds when crossing the bridge and avoided colliding with the vehicles that were stopped ahead of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 52 Additionally, we find that the injury here was reasonably foreseeable by Normal. Again, plaintiffs presented evidence that the danger posed by an inadequate stopping sight distance is that motorists will not have sufficient time to perceive and react to a hazard in the roadway. According to expert testimony, where stopping sight distance is impaired, speed limits should be reduced. Given these circumstances, Normal could reasonably anticipate that, without measures to reduce speeds across a bridge that had an impaired stopping sight distance, motorists would be unaware of the danger posed and fail to reduce their speeds in order to avoid obstacles in the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 53 As stated, Normal also contends that George's decision to exit his vehicle and stand upon the roadway was an intervening act that broke the chain of causation between its actions and George's injuries. However, that George's alleged negligence may have contributed to his injury does not necessarily sever the causal relationship between his injury and Normal's alleged negligent conduct.

As Normal does not argue that any additional alleged bases would support the court's grant of summary judgment in its favor, we do not address them. Finally, given that we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment, we find it unnecessary to address plaintiffs' additional contention on appeal that the court erred by denying their motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 65 III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 66 For the reasons stated, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 67 Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Justices Holder White and Turner concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
