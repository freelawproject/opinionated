On direct appeal, the defendant challenged the judge's jury instruction on eyewitness identification and certain statements made in the prosecutor's closing argument. We affirmed his convictions.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201131\">\n    87 Mass.

The motion was denied without a hearing, and the defendant appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant's argument on appeal is an attempt to circumvent the prospective-only mandate of the\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   court through a collateral attack based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   made the same collateral attack, which the Supreme Judicial Court rejected earlier this year.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547354\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1148/\">\n    478 Mass. 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (\n   <em>\n    Gomes II\n   </em>\n   ). In\n   <em>\n    Gomes II\n   </em>\n   , the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"We also recognize that defense counsel cannot reasonably be found to have performed in a manner that falls measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer simply because counsel, in the attempt to persuade the judge to give an eyewitness identification jury instruction that differed from the model instruction earlier adopted by this court in [\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337363\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/296/#p310\">\n    378 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310-311 (1979) ], failed to demonstrate that each principle in the defendant's proposed instruction was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. An attorney who would make such an effort is worthy of commendation by the defense bar, but the attorney who does not can hardly be deemed incompetent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finally, we reject, as did the Supreme Judicial Court in\n   <em>\n    Gomes II\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's claim, based on\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174131\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/743/#p767\">\n    474 Mass. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (2016), and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brescia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319608\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/381/#p389\">\n    471 Mass. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389-390 (2015), that even if the judge did not err and counsel was not ineffective, he is still entitled to a new trial because there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Gomes II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12547354\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/1148/\">\n    478 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1026 n.1. The defendant's attempts to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Gomes II\n   </em>\n   are unavailing. In view of the weight of the evidence supporting the convictions, and the jury being provided the then-proper\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   instruction, we are not persuaded that there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in this case. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Herndon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457212\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/324/\">\n    475 Mass. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 &amp; n.13 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    At trial, the defendant requested a modification of the then-customary instruction from\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337363\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/296/#p310\">\n     378 Mass. 296\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 301-302, 310-311 (1979), based on\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Henderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151901\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/208/\">\n     208 N.J. 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). The judge denied the request. After briefing on direct appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court decided\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Gomes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145229\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/352/#p354\">\n     470 Mass. 352\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 354 (2015), which in fact adopted many of the changes requested by the defendant in this case. However, as explicitly stated in\n    <em>\n     Gomes\n    </em>\n    , those changes only apply prospectively.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145229\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/352/#p354\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145229\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/352/#p354\">\n     at 376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . On direct appeal, we held that, as in\n    <em>\n     Gomes\n    </em>\n    itself, the judge's refusal to give the requested instruction, where the defendant presented no expert testimony or scholarly articles on the topic, was not an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
