Mr. Spaulding argued that the affidavit demonstrates how counsel failed to properly prepare for trial and how Mr. Fields' investigation was hindered by defense counsel's inattention, passiveness, and lack of involvement in the case. He argued that Mr. Fields discovered several potential witnesses who could have testified that there were multiple shooters or masked men who committed the crimes, but counsel provided ineffective assistance by choosing not to call the potential witnesses to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The trial court stated that the decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and that Mr. Fields failed to explain in his affidavit how he is qualified to render an opinion on counsel's performance. Moreover, the court stated that the \"two shooters/masked men\" theory was presented at trial and Mr. Fields' affidavit does not demonstrate a failure to investigate by defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. \"[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   at 691,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p689\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Mr. Fields lists his concerns in the affidavit as to how Mr. Spaulding's case was handled in comparison to how he sees cases \"typically\" handled, his affidavit does not demonstrate a failure to investigate by defense counsel. While Mr. Fields avers that he never had any \"meaningful discussions\" with attorney Jason Wells, he admittedly recalls having \"significant discussions\" with attorney Donald Walker about Mr. Spaulding's case. Mr. Fields avers that it was \"difficult and slow to get guidance and information\" and that he received discovery \"very close to the trial date,\" but he does not claim that he never received guidance, information, or discovery from counsel. He avers that he made audio recordings of potential witnesses during his investigation and urged counsel to listen to them, but he is \"uncertain\" if counsel listened to all of the recordings. Mr. Fields does not claim, however, that counsel did not listen to the audio recordings or that counsel refused to listen to them. He also avers that he was \"surprised and disheartened\" that counsel decided to not call any witnesses at trial. Finally, Mr. Fields avers that he had \"limited\n   time and guidance[,]\" but concludes that his investigation was nonetheless sufficient enough to create serious doubts as to the State's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We conclude that Mr. Fields' affidavit does not contain sufficient operative facts to establish that the trial court incorrectly denied his petition without holding a hearing. While we certainly commend Mr. Fields on his desire to work tirelessly alongside counsel throughout the case and although we empathize with his apparent discomfort in working on a difficult investigation under what may have been unfamiliar and stressful time constraints, he nonetheless admits in his affidavit to having completed a sufficient investigation after engaging in significant discussions with lead counsel in this case. Although the amount of communication with counsel in this case may not have been what Mr. Fields is typically used to, it does not appear that counsel was deficient in performance or that Mr. Spaulding was prejudiced as a result. Also, an investigator's disagreement with counsel's decision to not call certain witnesses to testify at trial does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. \" 'Decisions regarding the calling of witnesses are within the purview of defense counsel's trial tactics[ ]' and absent a showing of prejudice, the failure to call witnesses will not be deemed erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Elyria v.

She avers that Ms. Singleton had drugs and a gun with her. Keyona also acknowledges that she was contacted by Mr. Spaulding's investigator in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Mr. Spaulding also attached a police report completed by Detective Richard Morrison, which states that Shera C. was interviewed at the scene on Grant Street.

On December 15, 2011, Cierra H. called Shaunday when Ms. Singleton came to Cierra's house. Shaunday overheard Ms. Singleton say, \"[T]hese dudes came in my boyfriend's house trying to rob him.\" She also spoke to Mr. Spaulding's investigator in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In Mr. Fields' affidavit, he avers that he spoke with both Cierra and Shaunday. Cierra told him that, at approximately 2:00 A.M. on December 15, 2011, Ms. Singleton arrived at Cierra's residence and stated that \"two guys came into the house and started shooting.\" Ms. Singleton had drugs and a gun with her and appeared scared when a silver car with two men in it pulled up in front of the house. Shaunday told Mr. Fields that she was on the phone with Cierra when Ms. Singleton arrived that night and confirmed that she overheard what Ms. Singleton said to Cierra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Mr. Spaulding also attached the affidavit of Niechelle B. and a police report by Detective John Bell. Detective Bell testified that he is not related to Niechelle in any way. Niechelle avers that she gave Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas a ride back to Tallmadge after the shooting of Mr. Griffin, and Mr. Thomas said he thought they were being robbed, but did not know who would want to rob them. She avers that both Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas \"thought that there was more than one shooter.\" Niechelle spoke to two attorneys before trial and then testified at trial. In the police report, Detective Bell states that he interviewed Niechelle and she discussed giving the victims a ride three hours before they were murdered. She told the detective that Mr. Thomas mentioned firing a gun, which may have caused the suspects to leave after the Griffin shooting. Mr. Thomas did not mention to Niechelle that he knew the suspects. Niechelle did, in fact, testify at Mr. Spaulding's trial, but defense counsel repeatedly and successfully objected to her testifying on direct examination as to anything Mr. Thomas told her on December 15, 2011. She was then cross-examined by defense counsel and later asked during redirect examination, \"Did [Mr. Thomas] suggest any knowledge of [who] did this?\" She answered, \"No.\" When she was asked what Mr. Thomas had to say about that topic, she replied, \"He really was just, like, I don't know. He was saying, 'I don't know who could have done this.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In Mr. Fields' affidavit, he avers that he spoke with both Dan F. and Pat F. Dan and Pat lived next door to the house on Grant Street where the shootings occurred. Mr. Fields avers that Dan and Pat told him it is a known drug house and that a drive-by shooting recently happened there. Mr. Fields avers that Dan told him he saw Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas get out of a cab and soon thereafter he heard gun shots. Dan looked and saw a man in the driveway and heard at least one other person inside the house. It sounded to him like the house was being \"ransacked.\" An upset man came out of the house to tell another man who was on his cell phone to move the black Chevy Impala that was parked in the driveway. Dan did not mention seeing anyone with braids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Mr. Spaulding also attached an affidavit from William S. to his petition. William avers that he overheard Mr. Spaulding in jail talking about how he was being \"railroaded.\" William knew both Mr. Griffin and a man named \"Manny\" as dope dealers who lived close to one another on Grant Street. William avers that Manny told him that Mr. Griffin was involved in a recent robbery of Manny. Moreover, William believes Manny \"confessed\" to shooting Mr. Griffin afterward when he told William, \"[Y]ou heard about the boys down the road? That's what those n*****s get for robbing me.\" William also avers that Manny threatened to shoot him sometime later over forty dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The trial court found that Mr. Fields interviewed Keyona, Shaunday, and Cierra, and that Niechelle testified at trial. The \"two shooters/masked men\" theory was presented at trial and witnesses were cross-examined regarding it. Furthermore, the court found that Mr. Spaulding's evidence dehors the record was only marginally significant in advancing his theory and he failed to explain how his arguments could not have been raised on direct appeal; thus, they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} We conclude that some of the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence.

One of them, Niechelle, did in fact testify at Mr. Spaulding's trial and was subjected to cross-examination by defense counsel. Although Mr. Fields avers that Dan and Pat told him they were next door when one of the shootings occurred, we agree with the trial court that it is unclear which shooting incident Dan and Pat described to Mr. Fields, and Mr. Spaulding did not attach affidavits from either Dan or Pat to his petition. Moreover, the jury watched videos at trial of the first and third police interrogations of Mr. Spaulding, where Mr. Spaulding urged police to speak to Cierra and Keyona regarding \"four masked men\" being mentioned by Ms. Singleton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spaulding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 31-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20554\">\n    89 N.E.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Spaulding attached a report from Mr. Vassel to his petition in which Mr. Vassel opines that some of Detective Robert Moledor's testimony at trial is not supported by data. Mr. Vassel avers that \"[a] person's location cannot be pinpointed so precisely by using data from cell phone towers.\" Although he does not disagree that the evidence shows Mr. Spaulding's cell phone connected to the Grant Street cell tower at some point on December 15, 2011, he avers that it is \"just as likely that the defendant's handset device was at least a mile away from the crime scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court found that Mr. Spaulding did not point to any American Bar Association (\"ABA\") guidelines requiring defense counsel to hire experts to advance marginally significant evidence in rebuttal to the State's evidence. The court further found that, while Detective Moledor testified about the ability to map a person's location by cell phone use, he clarified that Mr. Spaulding's location could only be determined to be in the sector or zone of the Grant Street cell tower and the location could not be pinpointed. This was contrary to Mr. Spaulding's statement to the police that he had been on the other side of town. Furthermore, the court found that counsel chose to cross-examine Detective Moledor instead of presenting an independent witness, which is a matter of trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. The trial court correctly stated that Detective Moledor's testimony did not indicate an exact pinpoint of Mr. Spaulding's location, as Mr. Spaulding has argued. Detective Moledor testified at trial that he uses mapping software to display the \"general area\" of a cell phone's location when it uses a cell tower. In Mr. Spaulding's case, Detective Moledor was able to narrow down a location for certain times and dates for Mr. Spaulding's cell phone and he only concluded that Mr. Spaulding's phone placed multiple calls between 2:04 A.M. and 2:15 A.M., and between 7:58 A.M. and 8:08 A.M., on December 11, 2011, using cell phone towers in the vicinity of 1104 Grant Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Mr. Spaulding also argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to call an eyewitness expert, such as Dr. Harvey Schulman, who could have testified at trial and challenged Mr. Wilbur's and Mr. Griffin's eyewitness identification testimony. He argued that Mr. Wilbur's identification was suspect, unreliable, and not convincing because his identification evolved over time and his second identification was more detailed. He further argued that Mr. Griffin identified Mr. Spaulding even though evidence existed that the shooter wore a mask. Moreover, Mr. Griffin failed to identify Mr. Spaulding in the first photo array, but then positively identified him in the second photo array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Mr. Spaulding attached a report to his petition from Dr. Schulman, a retired psychology professor trained in the field of cognitive psychology, specifically the areas of attention, perception, and memory. Dr. Schulman states in his report that Mr. Griffin's eyewitness identification may have been influenced by several factors, including: poor viewing conditions, Mr. Griffin's focus on the gun, other reports that the assailant may have worn a mask, and officers informing him in between the two photo arrays that Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas had been murdered. Dr. Schulman further states that\n   Mr. Wilbur's eyewitness identification may have been influenced by several factors, including: less than ideal visibility conditions, multiple targets to view, his only identification occurring in court nine months after the crime despite having said he was unable to describe the face of the individual he saw, and the difficulty of cross-racial identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The trial court found that the ABA Guidelines do not mandate the hiring of experts to challenge the State's evidence. Moreover, the court found that defense counsel cross-examined both Mr. Wilbur and Mr. Griffin at length about their eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding, including questioning Mr. Griffin as to whether the shooter wore a mask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 45} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. First, by his own admission, Dr. Schulman states in his report that it contains only a list of factors that \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have operated in this case\" and \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have influenced the testimony\" of Mr. Griffin and Mr. Wilbur. (Emphasis added.). Nothing in the report suggests that these factors actually affected the testimony of Mr. Griffin or Mr. Wilbur. Second, defense counsel cross-examined both Mr. Wilbur and Mr. Griffin extensively as to their eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding. Counsel questioned Mr. Wilbur as to what he saw and heard at the crime scene, the weather conditions that day, any distractions such as buckling his son's seat belt, whether Mr. Wilbur was intoxicated or on medications at that time, whether he saw the suspect's face or just some braided hair, Mr. Wilbur's description of the suspect, and why he did not identify Mr. Spaulding during his first or second interactions with police and instead waited until a third interview to give a \"complete statement.\" Counsel also questioned Mr. Griffin at his deposition as to his relationship with David \"Frog\" Clark, whether he had been involved in a robbery earlier on the night he was shot, whether he had used drugs or consumed alcohol the night he was shot, whether he had been selling drugs the night he was shot, what clothes the shooter wore, how far away the shooter was from Mr. Griffin, whether the shooter was alone, whether he previously told anyone that the shooter wore a red mask, and whether he had been on a lot of medications while in the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to hire and call an expert, such as Dr. Sergio Bergese, to review Mr. Griffin's medical records and challenge Nurse Lynne Trenkelbach's testimony. He argued Mr. Griffin was still sedated when he first identified Mr. Spaulding in the second photo array at the hospital. He also argued that shutting the sedation off approximately five minutes before police spoke to Mr. Griffin, as Nurse Trenkelbach testified, was an insufficient amount of time for the medication to be out of his system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Mr. Spaulding attached a report to his petition from Dr. Bergese, Director of Neuroanesthesia at the Ohio State University. Dr. Bergese concludes in his report that the drug propofol affects a person's cognitive recovery after the drug is stopped for at least 90 minutes after having been used for several days. He states that Mr. Griffin's medical records showed him being on a propofol drip for five days. Along with propofol, Mr. Griffin had been on Ativan and morphine, which Dr. Bergese states would prolong the timeframe for a full cognitive recovery into several hours. Dr. Bergese also states that Mr. Griffin's medical records showed no change in sedation status on December 20, 2011, between 10:00 A.M. and 12:00 P.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The trial court found that defense counsel had Mr. Griffin's medical records\n   prior to trial. Moreover, the court found that counsel cross-examined Nurse Trenkelbach extensively about the effects of Mr. Griffin's medications and whether they may have affected his judgment when he identified Mr. Spaulding, and counsel's decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert is not ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 49} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Griffin's medical records were entered into the record at trial. Defense counsel questioned Nurse Trenkelbach extensively at trial and asked who was allowed to visit Mr. Griffin at the hospital, whether his visits from family members were private, whether he was aware of the murders of Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas, whether family members may have told him who they believed was responsible for the murders, what medications he was on and when he received them, and the circumstances surrounding the photo arrays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to call a ballistics expert, such as John Nixon, who could have challenged Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\"BCI\") forensic scientist Michael Roberts' testimony that cartridges found at both crime scenes were fired from the same gun, Mr. Roberts' methods of comparison, and his qualifications to determine whether the cartridges came from the same gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Mr. Spaulding attached a report from Mr. Nixon, who cites to and attaches a 2009 report published by the National Academy of Sciences (\"NAS Report\"). Mr. Nixon emphasizes that, with regard to toolmark uniqueness, the NAS Report states: \"The validity of the fundamental assumptions of uniqueness and reproducibility of firearms-related toolmarks has not yet been fully demonstrated * * *.\" Mr. Nixon states that the NAS Report contains \"a lot of criticism\" regarding firearm toolmark comparisons. He also cites to a 2013 letter from U.S. Department of Justice Special Counsel John Crabb to a Mississippi prosecutor (\"2013 Letter\") as providing the FBI's official position on firearm toolmark uniqueness as \"not permit[ting] examiner testimony that a specific gun fired a specific bullet to the exclusion of all other guns in the world.\" He claims \"the concept of uniqueness has been disproven,\" no firearm or unfired ammunition from the same batch existed in this case which diminished confidence in the results, and Mr. Roberts' testimony contained 31 statements that were misleading or false. He also challenges the December 22, 2011, BCI report as \"epitomi[zing] all that is wrong with laboratory reports\" and speculates that \"two shooters were probably responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The trial court found that Mr. Nixon did not elaborate on how he is qualified to render an opinion that it is unlikely one shooter shot both victims. The court also found that Mr. Spaulding admitted in his petition that defense counsel had the BCI report prior to trial, so the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Furthermore, the court found that speculation that different tactics may have improved the defense does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and counsel's decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert witness to testify is not ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 53} We conclude that some of the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. While Mr. Nixon challenges Mr. Roberts' education in the areas of metallurgy, engineering, and statistics, he concedes that \"Mr[.] Roberts is a court qualified expert with regard to performing comparisons.\" Instead\n   of hiring an expert, counsel chose to cross-examine Mr. Roberts at trial as to his BCI report listing a variety of manufacturers that could have possibly made the firearm used to fire the cartridges recovered in Mr. Spaulding's case. Mr. Spaulding has not shown how counsel's choice to cross-examine the witness instead of calling another expert to testify was anything other than a legitimate, tactical decision, which cannot establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The NAS Report and 2013 Letter were not made part of the trial record and purportedly discredit statements contained in the BCI report; thus, they are evidence dehors the record that meet the threshold standard of cogency. Although this particular claim is not barred by res judicata, we again reiterate that \"this Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court's analysis[,]\" but we shall instead \" 'affirm a trial court's judgment that is legally correct on other grounds, that is, one that achieves the right result for the wrong reason, because such an error is not prejudicial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wesson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-4495\">\n    2012-Ohio-4495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 31, quoting\n   <em>\n    Rude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-6789\">\n    2011-Ohio-6789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 21, quoting\n   <em>\n    Billings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-764\">\n    2006-Ohio-764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 19.

Ms. Moran avers that she only had contact with attorney Walker and she only spoke to attorney Wells approximately five times, which she categorizes as \"highly unusual.\" She never met attorney Wells until the first day of the mitigation phase. In Mr. Spaulding's case, there was only one team meeting, whereas in Ms. Moran's experience there are typically ten-to-fifteen team meetings. Attorney Wells was not present at the meeting in Mr. Spaulding's case. Ms. Moran spoke to attorney Walker, but felt like he was ill-prepared and \"did not quite grasp what mitigation was all about.\" Right before the mitigation phase began, Ms. Moran concluded that attorney Wells \"had nothing prepared,\" so she handwrote an opening statement for him to read. Attorney Wells initially used Ms. Moran's statement, but then purportedly strayed from it and instead used his own words. Consequently, he mistakenly told the jury that they would hear from a particular witness, although that person was now deceased. Ms. Moran avers that \"it appeared to [her] that\n   the defense witnesses had not been prepped.\" She also avers that she handed attorney Walker notes with questions that she believed needed to be asked of witnesses, and in her opinion neither attorney properly rehabilitated the witnesses. She felt frustrated and disheartened because she believed Mr. Spaulding's case was \"winnable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Mr. Spaulding also attached an affidavit from Dr. John Fabian, a forensic psychologist and clinical neuropsychologist hired by the defense to assist with mitigation. Dr. Fabian avers that he was concerned that attorney Walker \"didn't seem to grasp the idea, concept, and process of mitigation\" and he urged attorney Walker to hire Ms. Moran as a mitigation specialist. Dr. Fabian avers that he never spoke to attorney Wells. Dr. Fabian contacted both attorney Walker and Judge Gallagher in November of 2012 to request more time to fully conduct a mitigation investigation, and Judge Gallagher then continued sentencing in this matter until the end of January 2013. He avers that Mr. Spaulding's family appeared to not trust the attorneys and were very frustrated with what the attorneys did not do at trial, which hindered the ability to build a rapport with the family. Dr. Fabian avers that he recently learned that there were hospital records regarding Mr. Spaulding apparently having four separate head injuries, although Dr. Fabian's own report listed no head injuries, which he claims was due to not having the hospital records. Mr. Spaulding also purportedly ingested bleach once as a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The trial court found that part of this argument is barred by res judicata because ineffective assistance of counsel during the mitigation phase was raised and rejected in Mr. Spaulding's direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spaulding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    151 Ohio St.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280649\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/378/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 168-180,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20N.E.3d%20554\">\n    89 N.E.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court found that Dr. Fabian failed to explain how knowledge of head injuries and ingesting bleach could have been mitigating in Mr. Spaulding's case or how his report was rendered unreliable because that information was missing. The court also found that Ms. Moran did not elaborate on what aspects of the case she believed to be \"winnable.\" The court found that the truth or falsity of Dr. Fabian's and Ms. Moran's affidavits is inconsequential, as the information contained within them does not demonstrate ineffective assistance. The court found that given the work performed and evidence presented during mitigation, \"it was a reasonable strategic decision for counsel to create sympathy for Spaulding's family in mitigation[,]\" as Spaulding himself is an unsympathetic individual. Even debatable trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance and will not be second-guessed after a thorough mitigation is conducted. The court found that Mr. Spaulding failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from any of the alleged mitigation errors, he presented no evidence dehors the record identifying specific, additional evidence for mitigation, and he failed to demonstrate how, but for the alleged errors, his sentence would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 67} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. \"The presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ms. Norwood never testified at Mr. Spaulding's trial and nothing in the evidence dehors the record demonstrates that Ms. Norwood would have testified as to multiple, masked shooters, as Mr. Spaulding now speculates. Apart from broadly claiming that he and Ms. Norwood had \"competing interests,\" Mr. Spaulding failed to explain what those competing interests were and failed to show any actual conflict of interest. Mr. Spaulding further failed to demonstrate how representation of Ms. Norwood in two other separate cases adversely affected attorney Walker's performance in Mr. Spaulding's case or how Mr. Spaulding suffered any prejudice from attorney Walker's representation of Ms. Norwood.

Several witnesses also testified and were cross-examined regarding the murder of Mr. Clark. Moreover, the court found that the possibility the eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding were tainted by media exposure was pure speculation.

Counsel questioned Lieutenant Phister on cross-examination and he agreed that a robbery can still occur when nothing is actually taken.

Mr. Spaulding argued that this was a gross exaggeration and misstatement of the evidence. During closing arguments, the prosecutor also stated, \"His cell phone puts [him] there while they're being shot and moving away shortly after. And we're not talking about two or three streets away or two or three miles away. We're talking about within blocks. [His] cell phone is there.\" Mr. Spaulding argued that this was a misrepresentation of the facts and evidence.

Mr. Spaulding has also failed to demonstrate how he has been prejudiced and failed to establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. While Mr. Spaulding focuses exclusively on the conversations between Mr. Griffin and this unknown individual on November 4th and November 7th to support his argument that Mr. Griffin led a \"dangerous lifestyle\" and \"threaten[ed] to kill\" someone who was \"pleading for his life,\" he ignores the overwhelming majority of text messages between these two individuals afterward, indicating that the two appear to be friends. The two text each other often on November 10th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 30th, December 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 13th.

The State then misrepresented this evidence in closing arguments to suggest that the blood of one of the victims was found on Mr. Spaulding's shoes. He further argued that the State elicited testimony from Lieutenant Phister which it \"knew or should have known to be misleading or categorically false[,]\" specifically that Lieutenant Phister conducted a \"victimology\" to attempt to determine what could make Mr. Griffin the target of a crime, but he was unable to determine any suspects who would want to shoot Mr. Griffin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 104} Mr. Spaulding attached no evidence dehors the record to support his argument regarding the blood on his shoes, but instead stated that \"the dehors the record evidence that will prove the State's misconduct is the results from the DNA testing of the remaining blood spots.\" He attached various exhibits to demonstrate Mr. Griffin's \"dangerous lifestyle\" involving drugs, gangs, and violence, including: Mr. Griffin's text messages; Mr. Fields' affidavit; numerous police reports regarding Mr. Clark's murder; an affidavit from an FBI agent investigating Mr. Griffin for extortion; an online newspaper article regarding the shooting of Mr. Griffin and the murders of Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas; indictments for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin that include criminal gang activity for Mr. Thomas and drug-related charges for both men; an online docket for a case involving gang-related charges for Mr. Thomas; and police reports from separate incidents where Mr. Griffin and other individuals were shot, robbed, or arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 105} The trial court found that the DNA evidence presented at trial proved to be irrelevant to the State's case and that it only demonstrated the extent of the police investigation conducted. The court further found that these arguments were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that \"[t]here is no authority for the proposition\n   that the prosecutor commits misconduct by 'eliciting testimony' from its witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b6 106} We conclude that the trial court's findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Ms. Violi testified that she conducted DNA analysis on three swabs that were presumptively positive for blood and were found on Mr. Spaulding's shoes. One swab contained a profile consistent with Mr. Spaulding, but no DNA profiles were obtained from the other swabs. In her closing arguments, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   [W]e do have blood on his shoes. Now, you all saw that booking video. It was deliberate, pick up one foot, check it out, pick up the other foot, and check it out. Now, shoes cost more than clothes. I think we all know that. So perhaps he thought, Oh, I'll just give my shoes a good scrub and get rid of all the blood; but the clothes, you know, maybe you can't get it out. We know he's been sitting in the jail watching CSI so I can assume he's watching it at home, but he missed some spots, because there is blood on his shoes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Nowhere in this statement does the prosecutor \"misrepresent[ ] the evidence [and argue that] the blood belonged to one of the victims[,]\" as Mr. Spaulding has argued. Ms. Violi's DNA report was entered into evidence at trial and Mr. Spaulding failed to submit any evidence dehors the record in support of his argument. As the report, Ms. Violi's testimony, and closing arguments were all in the record, Mr. Spaulding's argument could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 107} Lieutenant Phister testified that the police conducted a \"victimology\" of Mr. Griffin whereby:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   We look at the victim of the crime and when it's an unknown suspect, and we try and determine what has the victim done, what's his -- who are his associates, what are his previous crimes, who are his friends, and trying to figure out what would make him a victim of that crime or what would make him the target of that crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   He further testified that the police were not able to determine any suspects who would have wanted to shoot Mr. Griffin. Mr. Griffin's criminal history was all drug-related. He was never charged with any robberies or shootings and he was never a suspect in the murder of Mr. Clark. No weapons had been found on Mr. Griffin or in his vehicle after he was shot. Mr. Spaulding has not demonstrated that Lieutenant Phister's testimony was false or that the prosecutor knew the testimony to be false or misleading. Moreover, this argument could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   {\u00b6 108} We cannot conclude that the prosecutor's questioning of these witnesses was improper. We also cannot conclude that the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments were improper. Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate how he was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cumulative Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <em>\n    Grounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   {\u00b6 109} Mr. Spaulding argued that even if none of his grounds for relief are well-taken, the cumulative effect of the errors and omissions warranted relief.

The trial court found no errors in Mr. Spaulding's grounds for relief and, therefore, rejected his cumulative error grounds for relief. Mr. Spaulding mistakenly claims that the trial court failed to specifically rule on his 35th ground for relief. But, a footnote to the subheading entitled \"CUMULATIVE ERROR * * *\" in the trial court's order clearly states that the section addresses \"Grounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35.\" Moreover, in the trial court's \"CONCLUSION\" section, it explicitly states: \"Spaulding's cumulative errors claims (Grounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35) fail as a matter of law for failure to demonstrate a single meritorious error during the trial or mitigation phase.\" This Court, having reviewed all of Mr. Spaulding's grounds for relief, concludes that the trial court did not err in rejecting Mr. Spaulding's cumulative error grounds for relief without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 112} After a thorough review of the record in this case, we conclude that Mr. Spaulding did not present sufficient operative facts and evidence dehors the record in support of his grounds for relief in his petition for post-conviction relief, and thus the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying his 35 grounds for relief and in determining that an evidentiary hearing was not warranted. Some of Mr. Spaulding's arguments are barred by the doctrine of res judicata as they could have or should have been raised in his direct appeal, while others actually were raised in his direct appeal. The evidence dehors the record that he submitted, while voluminous in size, did not add much, if anything, to the substance of his claims. Mr. Spaulding sometimes strategically focused only on certain parts of evidence out of context, while ignoring other parts that did not support his arguments and sometimes even contradicted them. Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, or cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b6 113} Accordingly, Mr. Spaulding's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED SPAULDING RELIEF WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM THE NECESSARY DUE PROCESS TO MEET HIS BURDEN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   {\u00b6 114} In his fourth assignment of error, Mr. Spaulding argues that he was denied \"the necessary due process to which he should be entitled\" during the post-conviction process because he had no right to a hearing, no ability to obtain discovery, and his arguments were constrained\n   by the three-page per claim limit under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.
