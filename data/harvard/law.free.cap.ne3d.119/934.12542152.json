For the reasons set forth below, this court affirms the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 25, 2015, appellee/cross-appellant Mark S. Buck (hereafter plaintiff or \"Mr. Buck\") filed a complaint for divorce against appellant/cross-appellee Janet Yackee Buck (hereafter defendant or \"Mrs. Buck\") after over 30 years of marriage. The parties were married on August 31, 1985, and separated in late November 2012. Following a period of discovery and mediation, a final hearing was held on July 18, 2016. On August 19, 2016, the parties filed post-hearing \"final arguments\" along with a total of 38 joint stipulations and agreements. Unresolved and contested divorce matters were decided by the magistrate on March 20, 2017, who recommended \"Plaintiff should be granted an absolute Divorce from Defendant, and that the Parties are released from the obligations of that marriage except as identified below.\" Each party filed objections to the magistrate's decision, and as journalized on December 18, 2017, the trial court filed a decision and judgment entry overruling the objections and granting the divorce due to incompatibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mrs. Buck sets forth four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. The trial court erred when it stated a \"de nova review\" of the magistrate's analysis of the [$3,000.00] monthly gifts from appellant's mother when no such analysis took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. The [trial] court erred when it blended the issues of division of marital property and spousal support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   III. The trial court erred when it inequitably divided the marital accounts 65% to appellee and 35% to appellant and is an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   IV. The trial court erred when it limited appellant's attorney fee award to $5,000.00 and [is] an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Buck sets forth three assignments of error in his cross-appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. As a matter of law, the trial court erred concerning its application of the [parol] evidence rule to the parties' settlement agreement and its interpretation of [its] integration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. The trial court erred by finding that the money remaining in the parties' managed account was \"marital\" property\n   and divided it 65% to Mr. Buck and 35% to Mrs. Buck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III. The trial court's decision to award Mrs. Buck attorney fees is against the manifest weight of the evidence, not supported by equity, and contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We will address the assignments of error out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thereafter, the parties entered into a \"Confidential Settlement Agreement\" with Mr. Buck's employer that resulted in a settlement award payment. The record contains the settlement agreement dated January 21, 2005, which the parties entered into during their marriage. After various deductions the net of $692,592.40 was paid \"to Mark S. Buck and Janet Yackee Buck JTWROS (Joint Tenants with Right to Survivorship)\" into an account at Smith Barney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The record refers to the original account into which the net settlement award was deposited as the \"settlement account,\" and, later, the \"joint money market account\" or \"joint money market checking account.\" In late 2005, the parties agreed to open with Smith Barney a new, joint, professionally managed account (also titled \"Mark S. Buck and Janet Yackee Buck JTWROS\") \"with more long-term investments\" and withdrew $300,000 from the \"joint money market account\" and deposited that sum into the professionally managed account. The record refers to this second account into which approximately one-half of the net settlement award was deposited as the \"managed account\" or \"joint managed account.\" Later, the parties transferred the \"joint money market account\" from Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley (identified in the record as account No. ending 1965), and they also transferred the \"managed account\" from Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley (identified in the record as account No. ending 2336).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The parties received the settlement award after they jointly signed the settlement agreement, which broadly describes the release of claims by both parties as including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   any and all past, present and future claims, and potential claims, demands, damages, actions * * * losses, * * * and causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, which are now existing or might arise in the future, specifically including claims of * * * survivorship, loss of consortium, loss of services, medical expenses, * * * lost wages, lost earning capacity * * * and other expenses or damages, incurred or to be incurred, known or unknown, which arise out of or are related in any way to the February 16, 2004 accident * * * and BUCK's employment with FCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The magistrate found the settlement agreement contained no dollar amount for each individual type of claim that was resolved, and, other than pointing to paragraph two of the settlement agreement, Mr. Buck \"did not present any evidence whatsoever\" to trace the settlement award entirely to \"Plaintiff's medical expenses, future medical expenses, loss of income, or future lost wages\" to the exclusion of Mrs. Buck's \"claim of loss of consortium, [and] loss of services.\" The record contained testimony that after the accident Mrs. Buck, a registered nurse, became Mr. Buck's full-time nurse at home, eliminating the need for Mr. Buck \"to hire any outside nursing assistants to care for [his] physical injuries.\" The record also contained testimony that Mrs. Buck continued to stay at home even after their child became a teenager, and that Mr. Buck did not work again in construction, although he started a snow plow business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In the trial court's December 18, 2017 judgment entry, the trial court agreed with the magistrate's analysis and determined the settlement award was\n   made as a settlement to the parties \"listed as a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     single party\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   to the contract\" (emphasis sic) and \"consisted of claims for personal injuries (non-marital property) and lost income, companionship, etc. (marital property).\" The trial court concluded \"the Magistrate correctly determined the Morgan Stanley account to be a marital asset.\" The trial court previously explained the \"Morgan Stanley account\" was the former Smith Barney \"settlement account\" into which the parties' were paid the original net settlement award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In support of his first and second assignments of error, Mr. Buck argues paragraph two of the settlement agreement is clear that the entire settlement award is his separate property solely for his \"physical injuries and illness\" pursuant to R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vi), and Mrs. Buck \"did not dispute the actual tracing of the settlement money back to the Settlement Agreement.\" In addition, he argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Stipulation # 17 of the parties acknowledged that \"(n)o 'marital funds' were deposited into this managed account in the following years thereafter right up to the present.\" Here, there was no \"transmutation\" of the settlement funds into other marital assets, and no co-mingling of other marital assets with the settlement account. The tracing here is untainted and documented back to the settlement release. * * * Here, the tracing is very simple and unaltered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The parties to the settlement agreement are Mr. Buck, Mrs. Buck and Fru-Con Construction Corporation, Mr. Buck's employer on the date of the accident. Paragraph two of the settlement agreement states, \"Per communication from Bucks' counsel\" the check was \"made payable to 'Mark and Janet Buck, and Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., their attorneys.' \" That settlement award \"constitute[s] damages on account of physical injuries or illness, within the meaning of Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and are paid to fully end all possible litigation by and between [Mark Buck and Janet Buck] and [Fru-Con Construction Corporation].\" We are unpersuaded by Mr. Buck's argument because the express language of paragraph two of the settlement agreement used the phrase \"physical injuries or illness\" solely to be defined for the purpose of IRS income tax consequences of the settlement award, which is not an issue appealed by either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Mr. Buck further argues Mrs. Buck testified in her deposition she did not suffer physical injuries or illness as a result of Mr. Buck's accident. Mr. Buck believed since he meet his burden by a preponderance of the evidence to trace the \"marital funds\" to his separate property for personal injury, the burden then shifted to Mrs. Buck \"to produce the evidence to back up [her marital property] claims.\" We are unpersuaded Mr. Buck met his burden by clear and convincing evidence to overcome the marital property presumption because the settlement award was acquired by both spouses during the marriage. It is undisputed both parties signed the settlement agreement during their marriage that resulted in the settlement award being deposited as a lump sum into a joint money market account with a right of survivorship for full access by both parties. R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(a). We find paragraph two of the settlement agreement alone did not satisfy the requirements under R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vi). We find the comingling of both parties' claims in the lump sum settlement award is not traceable to Mr. Buck's exclusive separate property. R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b). We find the record also contains some evidence Mrs. Buck received a later diagnosis of depression\n   that was considered a result of Mr. Buck's accident and her full-time care for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The record also shows Mrs. Buck testified at the July 18, 2016 hearing that although both parties had equal control over the two settlement award accounts, she was the one responsible for handling the family's finances.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   It was always family money from the beginning. It was both of ours. * * * It was just assumed that it was our money. We used it to live on. We used it for our family. * * * Because it was always in both of our names. We used it to live off of. I used that money to pay all our bills for ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Mr. Buck further argues the trial court improperly considered \"Defendant's Exhibit A\" as \"supplemental evidence of what the settlement\n   <em>\n    really\n   </em>\n   encompassed.\" (Emphasis sic.) The result is \"the odd proposition that some signatories to contracts are bound by the [Parol] Evidence Rule while others are not.\" Mr. Buck argues the trial court erred as a matter of law applying the parol evidence rule to the settlement agreement, specifically the integration clause, because the rule \"forbids such testimonial evidence [by Mr. Buck on cross-examination about his 'understanding' of the settlement agreement] in contradiction of the terms of the release itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Mr. Buck testified at the final hearing that although he viewed the settlement award as entirely to take care of him \"years down the road if I have complications of whatever reason because of the [thirteen percent permanent foot] disability that I have,\" he acknowledged the settlement award was split partly \"to accommodate and help us pay bills since I couldn't generate money to pay\" and partly \"into a fund to be able to build wealth for later on in my years when I was more so not going to be able to take care of myself and possibly have to buy it for myself.\" Mr. Buck admitted placing the settlement award in a joint account \"was a matter of convenience to put it in both of our names\" so that bills could get paid. Mr. Buck further testified that although his \"plan was never for the family to live off the settlement account,\" he admitted, \"That is the way it turned out * * * because my wife refused to go back to work.\" It is undisputed the record shows neither party worked, and they both lived off the \"settlement account.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 22} We find Mr. Buck's reliance on the parol evidence rule and on paragraph 17 of the stipulations to be misplaced as the trial court found some competent and credible evidence in the settlement agreement and the stipulations, outside of the disputed defendant's exhibit A, to support finding the settlement award was marital property. The trial court agreed with Mr. Buck regarding the parol evidence rule as applied to the settlement agreement, but still disagreed with Mr. Buck the settlement award was not marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 23} According to the trial court, \"There is no way to determine the source of the dollars which were paid to support the Parties' ongoing expenses and sometimes exorbitant lifestyle.\" We will not disturb the trial court's finding the settlement award was marital property from all of the evidence in the record. The trial court also found approximately half of the net settlement award ($300,000 out of $692,592.40) funded the \"managed account\" and the rest remained in the \"joint money market account.\" We find paragraph 17 regarding the \"managed account\" is consistent with the trial court's finding the settlement award was marital property. Mr. Buck testified at the July 18, 2016 hearing \"what is in the managed account now at Morgan Stanley is directly traceable all the way to\n   the settlement.\" The record shows the \"managed account\" was a passive investment account and earned interest and dividends that were reinvested into the $300,000 deposit from the net settlement award. Paragraph 24 of the stipulations states as of December 31, 2012, the \"managed account\" contained $327,473.75, and by July 12, 2016, the \"managed account\" contained $390,336.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We find the trial court's determination the \"settlement account,\" which resulted in the \"joint money market account\" and the \"managed account,\" was marital property was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because its determination was supported by some competent and credible evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mr. Buck's first and second assignments of error are not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Mrs. Buck's first assignment of error challenging the classification of her mother's cash gifts as marital property mirrors her objection Nos. 2, 3 and 5 timely filed April 20, 2017, in response to the magistrate's March 20, 2017 decision. Mrs. Buck argues the trial court failed to conduct a de novo review of the magistrate's determination the $3,000 monthly gifts were marital property because the balance in the \"joint money market checking account\" can be directly traced to the gifts from mother to daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We find paragraphs 17, 21, 30, 35, and 36 of the August 19, 2016 stipulations directly relate to the cash gifts from Mrs. Buck's mother during the parties' marriage. These cash gifts either were directly deposited into the \"joint money market account,\" totaling $392,000 (of which $267,000 derived from $3,000 monthly gifts), or directly paid on joint credit card debt, totaling $49,975.08. According to paragraphs 19 and 24 of the stipulations, the parties paid all their obligations and living expenses by withdrawals from the \"joint money market account,\" and at the time of filing of divorce the account balance was \"approximately $6,678.27.\" The issue of credit card debt was not appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Where a party timely files objections to a magistrate's decision the trial court is required to rule on the objections after \"an independent review as to the objected matters to ascertain that the magistrate has properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law.\" Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d). This \"independent review\" is the equivalent of a de novo determination.\n   <em>\n    Barker v. Barker\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

There is no way to determine the source of the dollars which were paid to support the Parties' ongoing expenses and sometimes exorbitant lifestyle. If the Defendant objected to the use of these funds, she could have chosen to have the $3000 transfers from her mother terminated at any point in time; or placed * * * the funds in a separate account completely under her control. She did not. * * * Both of these Parties\n   deposited their money into a common fund which was utilized by both Parties for their personal benefit. That is the simple truth which cannot be ignored - and which this Court will not ignore. The Court reviewed the Magistrate's analysis of the Court's treatment of the $3000 monthly transfers.

The trial court determined, after independently reviewing R.C. 3105.171(C)(1) and (F), \"the Magistrate properly considered those provisions and concurs with the analysis provided with the Magistrate's Decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The record also contains the trial court's judgment entry of \"Temporary Orders,\" journalized January 13, 2016, in which the parties agreed on joint access to, and withdrawals from, the \"managed account\" after the divorce filing. The parties agreed, and the trial court ordered, those \"withdrawals shall be credited as an adjustment to whatever sums the court may grant each party at final hearing.\" Upon determining the 65 percent to 35 percent division of the net settlement award, the trial court then determined in its December 18, 2017 judgment entry that for the period from December 1, 2015, to March 1, 2017, each party received $48,000 from the \"managed account\" according to the temporary orders. The trial court then granted to Mr. Buck a 65 percent credit for his share of the $48,000 received from the\n   \"managed account\" and to Mrs. Buck a 35 percent credit for her share of the $48,000 received.

In particular, we find it was within the trial court's discretion to consider \"[a]ny other factor that the court expressly finds to be relevant and equitable\" when making a division of marital property under 3105.171(F)(10).

Mrs. Buck argues in her fourth assignment of error the trial court abused its discretion when it limited her attorney fee award to $5,000. In support, Mrs. Buck argues her evidence of attorney fees reflects two years of litigation \"largely to address appellee's continuing contention that the 'managed' account funds are all his.\" Mrs. Buck further argues she and her attorney \"spent countless hours reconstructing the financial history of the parties, and most of appellee's exhibits were prepared by appellant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Mr. Buck argues in his third assignment of error any attorney fees award to Mrs. Buck \"is against the manifest weight of the evidence, not supported by equity, and contrary to law\" because each party should pay their own attorney fees and one-half of the court costs. In support,\n   Mr. Buck argues the magistrate wrongly stated he made obtaining information difficult because he had roughly equal attorney fees, and his counsel \"prepared the extensive written Stipulations in the Appendix so as to narrow the issues at trial\" and timely responded to all discovery requests. Mr. Buck concedes the \"reason this case went to trial was a disagreement between counsel as to whether the residue in the managed account was marital or separate.\" Mr. Buck maintains the record supports his claim the \"disputed account is Mr. Buck's separate property under R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vi).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The relevant statute for an award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses in a divorce action is R.C. 3105.73(A), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   In an action for divorce * * *, a court may award all or part of reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses to either party if the court finds the award equitable.

A trial court is authorized, but not required, to consider factors such as \"the conduct of the parties, and any other relevant factors the court deems appropriate\" when awarding attorney fees.

The Court can find nothing in the record that does not support the Magistrate's evaluation of how this case developed, the conduct of the Parties or the other factors determined to be relevant to the Magistrate's determination of this issue. The Court therefore must rely on the Magistrate's observations and Findings in this regard. Therefore both Plaintiff's and Defendant's Objections as to the award of attorney's fees is overruled and DENIED. (Emphasis sic.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The trial court then ordered, \"The Defendant should be awarded the sum of $5000 for attorney fees in this matter, to be adjusted by any set offs awarded to Plaintiff in this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The record shows Mrs. Buck submitted at the July 18, 2016 final hearing evidence of her attorney fees and expenses of $17,646.16 for the period from October 12, 2015, to July 15, 2016. Mr. Buck did not submit evidence of his attorney fees other than testifying he believed his \"legal fees [are] roughly that or maybe even more.\" The parties then briefed the issue of attorney\n   fees to the magistrate. The magistrate's March 20, 2017 decision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   There were few, if any, meaningful negotiations in this case. Not as a result of the Attorneys being unwilling to negotiate or resolve matters, but what appears to be more a self-interested and unbending attitude from the Parties. Neither put forth a true effort to reach resolution or move towards resolution in any meaningful way. However, [the magistrate] does find that Plaintiff in several instances made it difficult to obtain information, or merely ignored the potential for resolution. In light of these factors, and in consideration of R.C. 3105.73(A), it is the Decision of the [magistrate] that Defendant should be awarded the sum of $5000 for attorney fees in this matter, to be adjusted by any set offs awarded to Plaintiff in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 51} In this case the trial court considered the conduct of the parties as relayed by the magistrate's decision and further found nothing in the record to rebut the magistrate's evaluation of the parties' conduct. We find that although both parties rely on the issue of the designation of the \"managed account\" as either marital or separate property as a determinative factor in the attorney fee award, the trial court found the entire net settlement award, from which the \"managed account\" derived, was a marital asset. The trial court's December 18, 2017 judgment entry summarizes its view of the parties' marital property dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   It has been the observation of this Court that when Parties are getting along, there is no discussion about whether monies (which are being utilized for ongoing expenses) are \"gifts,\" the source of the funds or the appropriateness of the expenditures made. Those issues only become paramount when the Parties are not getting along and are considering divorce. Hindsight is 20/20. Both Parties appear to have recreated in their own mind a scenario which best benefitted them at the time of the divorce. This Court is not impressed with such a self-serving manipulation of history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 52} We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the objections and ordered the attorney fees award of $5,000 to Mrs. Buck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Mrs. Buck's fourth assignment of error and Mr. Buck's third assignment of error are not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The judgment of the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.
