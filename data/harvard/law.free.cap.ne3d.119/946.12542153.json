The defendant, Terrance Edmonds, was returned to custody at the local jail soon after the adjudication of bond forfeiture and appeared twice in this case between his return to custody and the show cause hearing, once where he was provided a new bond and once where he stipulated to probable cause for a probation violation after having been released on the bond with a new surety. The surety argues the trial court abused its discretion in entering judgment on the bond forfeiture, and this court agrees. Accordingly, the trial court's decision, entering judgment against the surety on the adjudication of bond forfeiture, is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The defendant was convicted of obstructing official business and placed on probation. After failing to appear for a probation violation hearing, the defendant was arrested and incarcerated in the local jail (Mahoning County). On May 17, 2017, the court set the defendant's bond at $2,500. On May 22, 2017, the surety secured the defendant's release on a recognizance surety bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The defendant failed to appear for the probation violation hearing set for June 13, 2017. In a judgment entry issued that same day, the court issued a capias and ordered the bond forfeited under R.C. 2937.35. On June 14, 2017, the municipal court clerk of court sent notice to the surety under R.C. 2937.36 explaining: the defendant failed to appear, a warrant was issued, the bond was ordered forfeited, and a hearing was scheduled for August 1, 2017 for the surety to show cause why judgment should not be entered against it for the amount of the bond posted. A similar letter was mailed to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A June 21, 2017 judgment entry demonstrates the defendant appeared before the court after being arrested on the court's June 13, 2017 order. The court's magistrate set a new bond of $5,000 and scheduled the probation violation hearing to proceed before the judge on July 18, 2017. In separate entries, the court appointed an attorney to represent the defendant\n   for the bond forfeiture hearing and the probation violation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 26, 2017, the surety's counsel filed a motion asking the court to vacate the bond forfeiture and to release the surety from further liability. As grounds, the motion pointed out the defendant was returned and presented to the Mahoning County Sheriff's Department on June 19, 2017 and was locally incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On June 30, 2017, a different surety posted the defendant's new bond securing his appearance at the July 18, 2017 probation violation hearing. The defendant appeared before the trial judge for this hearing and stipulated to probable cause. The court set a final probation violation hearing for August 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 1, 2017, the day of the scheduled bond forfeiture show cause hearing, the court entered judgment against the surety in the amount of the $2,500 bond. The court's entry stated the surety did not appear or show cause as to why judgment should not be entered against it. The court opined the surety's motion did not address the issue pertinent to the show cause hearing or excuse the appearance of the surety or its counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The surety filed a timely notice of appeal. We granted the surety's motion for stay pending appeal. After the surety filed its brief, the city provided notice that no responsive brief would be filed. Where an appellee does not file a brief: \"in determining the appeal, the court may accept the appellant's statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant's brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\" App.R. 18(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR: BOND FORFEITURE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The surety raises four assignments of error, the first of which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY ENTERING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE APPELLANT IN ITS AUGUST 1, 2017 JOURNAL ENTRY BECAUSE GOOD CAUSE WAS SHOWN BY THE APPELLANT TO AVOID JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO R.C. 2937.36(C), AS THE APPELLANT ARRESTED AND RETURNED THE DEFENDANT TO THE TRIAL COURT'S CUSTODY ON JUNE 19, 2017, AND THIS GOOD CAUSE WAS SHOWN TO THE TRIAL COURT THROUGH THE APPELLANT'S JUNE 26, 2017 MOTION TO VACATE FORFEITURE AND THE DEFENDANT'S SUBSEQUENT APPEARANCES IN COURT PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE BOND FORFEITURE SHOW CAUSE HEARING.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The surety recognizes the trial court has discretion in entering judgment on a bond forfeiture and the decision is evaluated under the abuse of discretion standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The surety states the production of the defendant's body prior to the show cause hearing equates to a showing of good cause at the hearing which prohibits the entry of forfeiture. It is said the defendant was arrested by the surety on June 19, 2017 and presented to the local jail due to the capias in\n   this case. The surety also notes it is irrelevant who apprehended the defendant, and there was thus no need for the surety to appear to explain to the court exactly how the defendant was returned to local custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The purpose of bail is to ensure the appearance of a criminal defendant before the court at a specific time.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Recognizance is a \"written undertaking by one or more persons to forfeit the sum of money set by the court or magistrate, if the accused is in default for appearance.\" R.C. 2937.22(A)(3). A surety's recognizance bond is a contract between the surety and the state whereby the state agrees to release the defendant into the surety's custody and the surety agrees to ensure the defendant is present in court on the appearance date.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A final judgment of forfeiture in the case of a recognizance surety bond has two steps: an adjudication of bail forfeiture under R.C. 2937.35 and a bond forfeiture show cause hearing under R.C. 2937.36. \"Upon the failure of the accused or witness to appear in accordance with its terms the bail may in open court be adjudged forfeit, in whole or in part by the court or magistrate before whom he is to appear.\" R.C. 2937.35 (or the court \"may, in its discretion, continue the cause to a later date certain, giving notice of such date to him and the bail depositor or sureties, and adjudge the bail forfeit upon failure to appear at such later date\"). If the bail is \"adjudged forfeit\" under R.C. 2937.35, then R.C. 2937.36 provides the subsequent procedure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon declaration of forfeiture, the magistrate or clerk of the court adjudging forfeiture shall proceed as follows: * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (C) As to recognizances the magistrate or clerk shall notify the accused and each surety within fifteen days after the declaration of the forfeiture by ordinary mail at the address shown by them in their affidavits of qualification or on the record of the case, of the default of the accused and the adjudication of forfeiture and\n   <em>\n    require each of them to show cause on or before a date certain to be stated in the notice\n   </em>\n   , and which shall be not less than forty-five nor more than sixty days from the date of mailing notice,\n   <em>\n    why judgment should not be entered\n   </em>\n   against each of them for the penalty stated in the recognizance.\n   <em>\n    If good cause by production of the body of the accused or otherwise is not shown, the court or magistrate shall thereupon enter judgment against the sureties\n   </em>\n   or either of them, so notified, in such amount, not exceeding the penalty of the bond, as has been set in the adjudication of forfeiture, and shall award execution therefor as in civil cases. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   R.C. 2937.36(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Pursuant to R.C. 2937.36(C), a surety may be exonerated\n   after the adjudication of bail forfeiture if good cause \"by production of the body of the accused or otherwise\" is shown.\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1428074\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/57/11/#p14\">\n    57 Ohio St.3d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=564%20N.E.2d%201066\">\n    564 N.E.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

We recognize these were appeals after post-judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In any event, in the case before us, the defendant was incarcerated after the adjudication of bond forfeiture but before the show cause hearing. There is no need to resort to extrajudicial evidence. This is established by judgment entries in the case and other filings. At the time of\n   the surety's motion: the defendant was locally incarcerated; he was brought before the court; the court set a new, higher bond; and he had not yet posted the new bond through a different surety. The defendant may not have been incarcerated locally at the time of the show cause hearing. However, the defendant had been arrested and released in this case\n   <em>\n    after the initial adjudication of bond forfeiture\n   </em>\n   and before the show cause hearing, and he appeared before this judge for a probation violation probable cause hearing in this case (while out on the new bond pending his final probation violation hearing). The surety's motion explaining the situation, filed prior to the show cause hearing and while the defendant was still incarcerated, should have prompted the court to believe its own docket in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Although the surety failed to appear at the show cause hearing, the statute provides the surety is required to \"show cause on\n   <em>\n    or before\n   </em>\n   a date certain to be stated in the notice.\" R.C. 2937.36(C) (emphasis added). The motion was filed well before the date certain stated in the notice, at a time when the defendant was not only incarcerated but had been recently presented to this trial court and provided a new, higher bond. Contrary to the trial court's ruling, the surety's motion did address the issue pertinent to the show cause hearing. We need not be concerned with the evidentiary quality of claims in the surety's motion as we have the trial court's docket and corresponding filings. Added to the motion, the docket showed the defendant appeared yet again (after being released on the new bond through a different surety) for a probable cause hearing in the case and was instructed to appear for final probation violation hearing on August 24, 2017 (after the scheduled show cause hearing). A court is not bound by statements in a party's motion, but the court is bound by its own docket and its own judgment entries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In sum, where a motion was filed informing the court the defendant was returned to the sheriff and incarcerated and where the docket and entries in the very case before the court showed the defendant appeared in open court (and thus his body was produced to the court between the bond forfeiture and the show cause date), the trial court abused its discretion in entering judgment against the surety on the bond forfeiture. Accordingly, the surety's first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The surety sets forth three other assignments of error. The second assignment of error complains about the lack of a record confirming that the court called the case for hearing before entering the final judgment (which judgment indicates the case was called for hearing). The third assignment of error states\n   <em>\n    the defendant's\n   </em>\n   notice was returned by the post office. Notably, a subsequent judgment entry was filed on June 21, 2017 appointing counsel for the defendant for the August 1, 2017 bond forfeiture hearing and the June 14, 2017 notice was sent by ordinary mail to the address for the defendant in the recognizance as per R.C. 2937.36(C).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
