Upon review, the Court denies Stutz's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 17, 2018, the Indiana Board of Tax Review issued a final determination that permitted Stutz to withdraw its administrative appeal over the Assessor's objection. (Resp't Corr. Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Resp't Br.\") at 1.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Pet. Original Tax Appeal Final Determination Ind. Bd. Tax Review (\"Pet'r Pet.\") \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, Attach.) On November 1, 2018, the Assessor filed a \"Petition for Original Tax Appeal of a Final Determination of the Indiana Board of Tax Review\" with the Clerk of the Tax Court challenging the Indiana Board's final determination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Pet.) On the same day, the Petition was served by hand delivery on the Attorney General of Indiana, the Chairman of the Indiana Board, the Assessor, and the two attorneys that represented Stutz at the administrative level. (Pet'r Pet. at 5.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Resp. Opp'n Resp't Mot.

That same day, the Clerk mailed the summons and a copy of the Petition to: \"Stutz Business Center, LLC[;] 1036 North Capital Avenue[;] Suite C-200[;] Indianapolis, IN 46204[,]\" return receipt requested. (Resp't Br. at 2.) On November 9, 2018, the Clerk received the return receipt. (Resp't Br. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 21, 2018, Stutz filed a Motion to Dismiss the Assessor's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction together with its brief in support. On December 10, 2018, after the matter was fully briefed, the Court took Stutz's Motion under\n   advisement. Additional facts will be supplied when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction, the power of a court to hear and determine a particular class of cases, is conferred upon a court by either the Indiana Constitution or statute.\n   <em>\n    Grandville Co-op., Inc. v.

Although challenges regarding the timeliness of filings may be raised by motion under Indiana Trial Rule 12(B)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the issues raised are \"jurisdictional\" only in the sense that they involve the statutory prerequisites to docketing an appeal in the Tax Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Packard v.

Whether the Assessor timely initiated an original tax appeal?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stutz first argues that the Assessor's appeal must be dismissed because he failed to comply with all the requirements for initiating an appeal under Indiana Trial Rule 3 and Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5(c). (Resp't Br. at 3-5.) More specifically, Stutz explains that both provisions required the Assessor to provide the Clerk with the Petition\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a summons no later than November 1, 2018, but he did not provide the Clerk with a summons until November 2, 2018. (Resp't Br. at 3-5; Resp't Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Resp't Reply Br.\") at 1-3.) Stutz, therefore, contends that the Assessor failed to timely initiate this appeal and his case should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stutz's argument is premised on its claim that Trial Rule 3, which governs the commencement of civil actions in general, applies to the initiation of original tax appeals in the Tax Court because they are civil actions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 3 (citing Ind. Tax Court Rule 2 (providing that the forms of civil action in the Tax Court include \"an original tax appeal arising under the tax laws of the State of Indiana by which an initial judicial appeal of a final determination of ... the Indiana Board of Tax Review ... is sought\") ).) Trial Rule 3 provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [a] civil action is commenced by filing with the court a complaint or such equivalent pleading or document as may be specified by statute, by payment of the prescribed filing fee or filing an order waiving the filing fee, and, where service of process is required, by furnishing to the clerk as many copies of the complaint and summons as are necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ind. Trial Rule 3. Accordingly, to initiate an appeal pursuant to Trial Rule 3 a litigant must satisfy three requirements: 1) timely file the complaint or equivalent pleading, 2) timely file the prescribed filing fee or applicable waiver,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   3) contemporaneously provide the clerk with the appropriate process papers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T.R. 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ray-Hayes v. Heinamann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455336,9455347\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/760/172/\">\n    760 N.E.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. 2002)\n   <em>\n    aff'd in part and rev'd in part on reh'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9427949\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/768/899/\">\n    768 N.E.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. 2002). Trial Rule 3, however, does not control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Tax Court has promulgated several rules to \"govern the procedure and practice in all actions jurisdictionally cognizable\" in its forum. Ind. Tax Court Rule 1. To that end, Tax Court Rule 3 governs the commencement of civil actions in the Tax Court: \"[a]n original tax appeal from a final determination of the Indiana Board of Tax Review is commenced by filing a petition in the Tax Court and filing a written\n   notice of appeal with the Indiana Board of Tax Review.\" Ind. Tax Court Rule 3(B). Accordingly, to initiate an original tax appeal pursuant to Tax Court Rule 3 a litigant need only satisfy two requirements: 1) file a petition in the Tax Court; and 2) file a written notice of appeal with the Indiana Board. Tax Ct. R. 3(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plain language of Tax Court Rule 3 indicates that it differs from Trial Rule 3 because it does not require litigants to provide the clerk with the appropriate process papers in order to\n   <em>\n    initiate\n   </em>\n   an original tax appeal in the Tax Court.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tax Ct.

When, as in this instance, the Trial Rules are \"clearly inconsistent\" with the Tax Court Rules the more specific Tax Court Rule takes precedence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tax Ct. R. 1 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10819155\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/745/194/\">\n    745 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   197 n.3 (providing that a specific court rule of procedure controls over a more general one on the same subject matter). Accordingly, pursuant to Tax Court Rule 3 and Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5(c), the Assessor was only required to file his Petition with the Tax Court and his notice of appeal with the Indiana Board within 45-days after the Indiana Board gave him notice of its final determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tax Ct. R. 3(B) ; IND. CODE \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5(c) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The undisputed facts show that the Assessor's Petition and notice of appeal were filed with the Tax Court and Indiana Board within the statutorily required 45-day period. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp't Reply Br. at 4 n.3.) Therefore, Stutz has not established that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Assessor's appeal on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the Assessor timely served the Petition on Stutz?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Stutz maintains that the Assessor's appeal should be dismissed because he failed to timely serve his Petition directly on Stutz. (Resp't Br. at 5-7.) Stutz explains that both Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5 and Tax Court Rule 3(D) required the Assessor to serve his Petition on Stutz directly on or before November 1, 2018, and by serving the Petition on Stutz's counsel of record for the administrative proceedings, he failed to comply with the statutory requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 5-7; Resp't Reply Br. at 3-6.) As a result, Stutz maintains the Assessor's appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5 establishes the requirements that a party must follow in order to initiate an appeal of an Indiana Board final determination in the Tax Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) A party may petition for judicial review of the final determination of the Indiana board regarding the assessment or exemption of tangible property. In order to obtain judicial review under this section, a party must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) file a petition with the Indiana tax court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) serve a copy of the petition on:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (A) the county assessor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (B) the attorney general; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (C) any entity that filed an amicus curiae brief with the Indiana board; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) file a written notice of appeal with the Indiana board informing the Indiana board of the party's intent to obtain judicial review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5(b), (e). The statute further provides that \"a party must take the action required by subsection (b) not later than ... forty-five (45) days after the Indiana board gives the person notice of its final determination, unless a rehearing is conducted under subsection (a)[.]\" I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5(c). In turn, Tax Court Rule 3(D) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Copies of the petition ... shall be served upon those persons designated by any applicable statute. A petitioner complies with this Rule by serving a copy of the petition in the manner provided by Trial Rules 4.1 through 4.11 as applicable. Copies of the petition shall be served upon public officers only in their official capacities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tax Ct. R. 3(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5 is silent about how a litigant must serve the petition, Tax Court Rule 3(D) states that service is proper if copies of the petition are served in the manner provided by the applicable provisions of Trial Rules 4.1 through 4.11.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-15-5\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tax Ct. R. 3(D). To that end, Trial Rule 4.6 provides that \"[s]ervice upon a[ domestic or foreign] organization\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be made ... upon an executive officer thereof, or if there is an agent appointed or deemed by law to have been appointed to receive service, then upon such agent.\" Ind. Trial Rule 4.6(A)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Indiana Trial Rule 4.6(A)(1) permits various methods of service on an organization that, when followed, constitute proper service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Assessor maintains that because he caused the Petition to be served on Stutz's attorneys, as its agents, he perfected service in accordance with Trial Rule 4.6(A)(1). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 1-3.) While the Court is not persuaded by the Assessor's argument, his technical failure to comply with the trial rules does not necessitate dismissal of this appeal because the plain language of Indiana Trial Rule 4.6(A)(1) provides a safe harbor, rather than a mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T.R. 4.6(A)(1);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Beyer v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Pet. \u00b6 3, Attach. at 1, 10.)

That case is not applicable to the issues in this case because\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   did not involve the propriety of a party's method of service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11676152\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/711/1259/#p1263\">\n    711 N.E.2d at 1262-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
