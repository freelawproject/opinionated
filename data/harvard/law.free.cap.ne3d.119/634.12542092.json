Upon review, the Court affirms the Indiana Board's final determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Meijer Stores LP owns and operates a 180,000 square foot retail store and a 2,432 square foot gas station/convenience store, both situated on one 32.42 acre parcel of land in Jeffersonville, Indiana (the subject property). Meijer constructed the stores in 1998/1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the years at issue, the Assessor assigned the following assessed values to the subject property:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-12\"><em>2008:</em> $12,160,100 <em>2009:</em> $12,167,000 <em>2010:</em> $11,732,600 <em>2011:</em> $11,732,600 <em>2012:</em> $10,017,000 <em>2013:</em> $ 9,904,400 <em>2014:</em> $10,021,000 <em>2015:</em> $ 9,966,000 <em>2016:</em> $ 9,969,100</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1 - 2, 13 - 14, 26-27, 40-41, 52-53, 72-73, 86-87, 105-06, 142-43.) Believing those values to be too high, Meijer filed appeals first with the Clark County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals and then with the Indiana Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November of 2017, the Indiana Board conducted one administrative hearing on all of Meijer's appeals. For purposes of the hearing, however, Meijer and the Assessor agreed to litigate only the subject property's 2012 assessment, stipulating that the other years' assessments could be determined by applying an agreed-upon trending formula to the finally-determined 2012 assessed value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 128-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board Hearing: Meijer's Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the Indiana Board hearing, Meijer presented, among other things, an Appraisal\n   Report, completed in conformance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), that valued the subject property as of March 1, 2012. Meijer also presented the testimony of Laurence Allen, a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI), who prepared the Appraisal Report (\"Meijer Appraisal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To value the subject property, Allen first employed the sales comparison approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this approach, he examined data relating to the fee simple sales of numerous other big-box stores that had occurred throughout the Midwest between 2006 and 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 389, 431-40, 1633-44.) After adjusting the sales prices of those properties to account for differences in the age and condition of their improvements, their location, as well as the condition of the market at the time of sale, Allen used the data to determine a probable sales price for the subject property of $ 7,570,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 450-98, 1645-54, 1658.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Allen also employed the income approach to value the subject property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this approach, Allen first estimated the subject property's net operating income using market-based rental rates, occupancy rates, and operating expense levels. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R at 1659-66.) Allen explained that he used the market-based rental rates from existing big-box stores rather than rates from big-box properties with \"built-to-suit\" leases in place, because the former were more representative of both occupant expectations and improvement age. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 564-69.) Allen then considered investor surveys and comparable property sales and performed a band-of-investment analysis to determine the capitalization rate to apply against his net operating income estimate. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 580-84, 1666-68.) Under his income approach, Allen estimated the 2012 value of the subject property to be $ 7,610,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1668-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ultimately, Allen reconciled his sales comparison and income approach values into a final value conclusion for 2012 of $ 7,600,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1676-77.) In concluding this final value, Allen explained that he did not consider the third generally accepted appraisal technique, the cost approach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to be a reliable method of valuing the subject property for two reasons. First, he stated that buyers and sellers of big-box stores typically do not rely on the cost approach to determine value. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 430-31, 1631.) Second, he stated that the use of the cost approach to value the subject property is redundant because like most big-box retail properties, it suffered from significant obsolescence that \"is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate without extracting from the other approaches to value.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 590-601, 1631.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 415-17, 421-24, 430-31, 592-94, 597-98 (where Allen explains that big-box properties suffer from obsolescence immediately upon construction because they are built for their users' exact specifications; subsequent users will never pay \"cost\" for these properties because they must incur extensive expenditures to adapt the properties to their own use).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board Hearing: The Assessor's Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the Indiana Board hearing, the Assessor offered her own USPAP-certified appraisal that valued Meijer's property for the 2012 tax year (\"Assessor's Appraisal\") at $ 11,200,000. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1728-32.) In addition, she presented the testimony of David Hall, MAI, the primary author of the Assessor's Appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his testimony, Hall first stated that he disagreed with Allen regarding the propriety of using the cost approach. Indeed, Hall reasoned that the cost approach was the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   approach to value the subject property because it was depreciating at a rate consistent with its age and suffered from no obsolescence whatsoever. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 892-94, 919-20, 1849 (stating there could be no functional obsolescence because \"the subject has been continuously occupied since completion of construction, and [ ] the buildings are consistent with market norms in construction quality, size, utility, and design\"), 1850 (stating there could be no economic obsolescence because local and national economic trends \"were positively impacting [the] demand\" for properties like Meijer's).) Under his cost approach, Hall estimated that the subject property's 2012 market value-in-use was $ 11,300,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1845-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hall also performed an income approach to value the subject property. In calculating net operating income, Hall, unlike Allen, used rental, occupancy, and expense rates derived from built-to-suit leases (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   leases to first-generation users). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 971-74, 1877-80, 1882-85.) Like Allen, however, Hall considered investor surveys and comparable property sales and performed a band-of-investment analysis to determine the capitalization rate to apply against his net operating income estimate. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1888-91.) Ultimately, under his income approach, Hall estimated the 2012 value of the subject property was $ 11,200,000. (Cert. Admin. R. at 1891.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, Hall valued the subject property using two separate sales comparison approaches. In his first sales comparison valuation, Hall used the leased-fee sales of occupied big-box properties as his comparables. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1751-52, 1853 (asserting that the leased-fee properties best reflected Meijer's utility because they were 100% occupied as retail space at the time of their sale).) Hall maintained that\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   , 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   edition, instructed that because the leased-fee properties were all leased at market rates, no adjustments were necessary to account for the difference in the type of property rights conveyed. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 922-24, 928-37, 1746, 1853-55, 1857, 1876.) Based on this analysis, Hall determined a probable sales price for the subject property of $ 11,200,000. (Cert. Admin. R. at 946, 1863.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For his second sales comparison valuation, Hall relied on fee simple sales of vacant big-box properties as his comparables. (Cert. Admin. R. at 1751-52, 1853 (explaining that these comparables transferred fee simple property rights and were not new construction, just like the subject property).) Hall adjusted the sales prices of these comparables by 45% to account for the fact that they, unlike the subject\n   property, were vacant. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 787-91, 927, 958-69, 1748-51 (explaining that \"[v]acancy adversely impacts a property's utility\" because it might indicate atypical motivations to sell, such as excess supply or duress, that adversely influence sale price).) From this analysis, Hall determined a probable sales price for the subject property was $ 10,900,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2251-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hall reconciled all four values into one final value conclusion of $ 11,200,000. (Cert. Admin. R. at 1898.) His reconciliation gave his second sales comparison approach value the least amount of weight. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1899.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board's Final Determination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Indiana Board issued its final determination on December 1, 2017. In it, the Indiana Board explained that because both Meijer and the Assessor presented USPAP-compliant appraisals from qualified experts, it needed to weigh the competing appraisals and determine which one was more persuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2423 \u00b6 78.) Ultimately, the Indiana Board determined that Meijer's Appraisal was more persuasive than the Assessor's Appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to the parties' income approaches, the Indiana Board's analysis was rather brief, stating that while each party's income approach suffered from some infirmities that detracted from its overall reliability, each one was still somewhat probative. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2427-29 \u00b6\u00b6 92-97, 2431 \u00b6\u00b6 102-04.) In reviewing the parties' sales comparison approaches, the Indiana Board stated that the Meijer Appraisal presented a sufficient quantity and quality of data to arrive at the subject property's March 1, 2012, value of its fee simple interest. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 2398 \u00b6 1, 2403 \u00b6 19, 2425 \u00b6 85, 2426 \u00b6 87, 2427 \u00b6 91.) In contrast, the Indiana Board found neither of the Assessor's sales comparison approaches probative at all:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In [its first] sales analysis, we find that [the Assessor's Appraisal] actually measured the leased[-]fee value of the subject property. In [its second] sales analysis, we find [the] vacancy adjustment entirely unsupported. These two errors render [the Assessor's] sales-comparison approaches entirely unreliable[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Cert. Admin. R. at 2431-32 \u00b6 105.) In fact, the Indiana Board held that these two errors were so significant and fundamental that they effectively undermined any probative value overall that the Assessor's Appraisal may have had otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2398 \u00b6 1, 2435 \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, in addressing the use of the cost approach to value the subject property, the Indiana Board explained that it was not necessary to apply the cost approach because deriving an obsolescence adjustment from the sales comparison and income approaches alone was appropriate. (Cert. Admin. R. at 2425 \u00b6 85, 2430 \u00b6 100.) Thus, the Indiana Board found that the fact that Allen did not perform a cost approach to value the subject property was not improper. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2425 \u00b6 85, 2430 \u00b6 100.) The Indiana Board reasoned that due to the \"large discrepancy\" between the Meijer Appraisal's values computed under its sales comparison and income approaches and the Assessor Appraisal's cost approach, the subject property suffered from obsolescence that the Assessor's Appraisal failed to account for. (Cert. Admin. R. at 2435 \u00b6 114.) Accordingly, the Indiana Board deemed the Assessor's cost approach unreliable. (Cert. Admin. R. at 2435 \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finding that the Meijer Appraisal was more persuasive than the Assessor's Appraisal, the Indiana Board reduced the subject property's 2012 assessment consistent with the Meijer Appraisal's reconciled\n   value of $ 7,600,000. (Cert. Admin. R. at 2435-36 \u00b6\u00b6 114-15.) The Assessor subsequently initiated this original tax appeal on January 12, 2018, and the Court conducted oral argument on the matter on July 19, 2018. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The party seeking to overturn an Indiana Board final determination bears the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Osolo Twp.

Tax Ct. 2003). Accordingly, the Assessor must demonstrate to the Court that the Indiana Board's final determination in this matter is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of or short of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations; without observance of the procedure required by law; or unsupported by substantial or reliable evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 33-26-6-6(e)(1)-(5) (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Assessor claims the Indiana Board's final determination must be reversed because it is contrary to law, not supported by substantial evidence, and constitutes an abuse of discretion. More specifically, she asserts that the final determination is contrary to law because in accepting Meijer's valuation over hers, the Indiana Board ignored the generally accepted appraisal practices that 1) required Allen to adjust his sales comparables to account for expenditures incurred after those properties were purchased, and 2) permitted Hall to use leased-fee sales as comparable properties. (Pet'r Br. at 7-15; Oral Arg. Tr. at 4-6, 25-27.) The Assessor also argues that the final determination must be reversed because there is no evidence to support the Indiana Board's conclusion that 1) the leased-fee sales used in her first sales comparison valuation were not credible and reliable, and 2) Meijer's property suffered from obsolescence. (Pet'r Br. at 15-20; Oral Arg. Tr. at 29, 35-37.) Finally, the Assessor argues that the Indiana Board's final determination constitutes an abuse of discretion because it \"failed to apply a consistent burden of proof[.]\" (Pet'r Br. at 20-21; Oral Arg. Tr. at 39-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Contrary to Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1)\n   <em>\n    Post-Purchase Adjustments to Sales Comparables\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, the Assessor explains that she presented evidence demonstrating that several properties used as comparables in the Meijer Appraisal's sales comparison approach incurred large post-purchase expenditures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 4-5 (citing Cert. Admin. R. at 705, 1294, 1301, 1310, 1326); Pet'r Reply Br. at 2.) The Assessor contends that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   , 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   edition, Allen was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to adjust the sales prices of those comparable properties to account for those expenditures. (Pet'r Br. at 10.) Because he did not, the Assessor claims that the final determination that ultimately adopted the Meijer Appraisal's final value conclusion is contrary to law and must be reversed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 7-11; Oral Arg. Tr. at 4-19.) The Court finds the Assessor's argument unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the two pages of\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   that the Assessor cites do not\n   <em>\n    mandate\n   </em>\n   adjustments for post-purchase expenditures. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 10\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   APPRAISAL INSTITUTE, THE APPRAISAL OF REAL ESTATE 412-13 (14th ed. 2013).) Rather, they (along with a few other pages) indicate that adjustments for\n   <em>\n    certain types\n   </em>\n   of post-purchase expenditures\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be appropriate\n   <em>\n    but only after\n   </em>\n   the terms of the sale transaction have been verified through\n   interviews with the transaction's participants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   THE APPRAISAL OF REAL ESTATE at 404-05, 412-14. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 18 (where the Assessor concedes that\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   does not mandate the adjustments but then \"clarifies\" that an appraiser should, at a minimum, consider whether a post-purchase expense adjustment is appropriate).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Notwithstanding, both the Assessor and Meijer have indicated that adjustments for post-purchase \"re-imaging\" costs are not necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Reply Br. at 3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 454-77, 592-93\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Resp't Resp. Br. at 11-12.) The evidence to which the Assessor cites indicates how much the owners of the comparable properties incurred in post-purchase expenditures but does not show what the expenditures were for. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 4-5; Cert. Admin. R. at 705, 1294, 1301, 1310, 1326.) Nonetheless, Meijer's appraiser, Allen, testified that the costs presented by the Assessor were all attributable to re-imaging and that adjustments were therefore unnecessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 476-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, and more importantly, a final determination of the Indiana Board is contrary to law only if it violates a statute, constitutional provision, legal principle, or rule of substantive or procedural law.\n   <em>\n    Shelbyville MHPI, LLC v. Thurston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7112347\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/978/527/#p529\">\n    978 N.E.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2012). The\n   <em>\n    Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   is not a statute, constitutional provision, legal principle, or rule of substantive or procedural law; it is a textbook, used by the appraisal profession, to instruct its members on the \"principles of appraisal and the sound application of recognized valuation methodology.\" THE APPRAISAL OF REAL ESTATE at ix. To the extent an appraiser relies on the guidance provided in\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   to complete an appraisal assignment, the result, his appraisal, is still merely his opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinson v.

Consequently, the Assessor has not shown that the Indiana Board's final determination is contrary to law on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2)\n   <em>\n    Use of Leased-Fee Sales in Sales Comparison Approach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As previously indicated, the Indiana Board rejected the Assessor's sales comparison approach analysis that used leased-fee sales of occupied big-box properties as comparables because it failed to measure the fee simple value. The Assessor contends, however, that the Indiana Board's rejection of that analysis was contrary to law because it ignored the generally accepted appraisal practice noted in\n   <em>\n    The Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   that permits the use of leased-fee sales as comparable properties in the sales comparison approach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 11-15; Oral Arg. Tr. at 20-27.) The Assessor's claim fails because, as the Court just explained,\n   <em>\n    The\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appraisal of Real Estate\n   </em>\n   is not law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, the Court notes that the Indiana Board rejected the Assessor's first sales comparison approach as unreliable because it was not supported by the evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2433 \u00b6 108.) Indeed, the final determination acknowledged that the leased-fee sales may be used as comparables, but only if they are properly adjusted to put them on \"a level playing field\" with the subject property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2426 \u00b6 87.) Hall did not make any adjustments, however, to account for the differences in the type of property rights conveyed between the subject property and the leased-fee sales comparables; instead, he asserted that his leased-fee sales comparables did not require adjustment because they were all leased at market rates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 922-24, 928-37, 1746, 1853-57, 1876.) The Indiana Board found that even if his assertion that market rate leases relieved the requirement to adjust were correct, Hall failed to prove that the leased-fee properties were in fact leased at market rates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2432-33 \u00b6 107 (stating that Hall's claim that the comparables were leased at market rents was based largely on \"circular reasoning\").) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2415-16 \u00b6 56 (where, in relaying Hall's testimony, the Indiana Board indicates that Hall's sole support for asserting his comparables were leased at market rates \"was the data and conclusions from his own income approach,\" which itself used the same leased-fee properties as comparables), 2432 \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Not Supported by Substantial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Next, the Assessor argues on appeal that the final determination must be reversed because it is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, she maintains that there is no evidence to support the Indiana Board's conclusion that 1) the leased-fee sales comparables she used in her first sales comparison approach were not credible and reliable, and 2) Meijer's property suffered from obsolescence. (Pet'r Br. at 15-20; Oral Arg. Tr. at 29, 35-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1)\n   <em>\n    The Credibility and Reliability of the Assessor's Leased-Fee Sales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As previously discussed, the Indiana Board gave no weight to Hall's first sales comparison analysis because the Assessor did not prove that his leased-fee sales comparables were leased at market rents. The Assessor claims on appeal, however, that \"the evidence, facts, and circumstances surrounding th[ose] sales ... undoubtedly support the conclusion that the[y] ... were leased[ ] at market rent\" and therefore the first sales comparison approach \"provided a reliable and credible opinion of value [that] should have been adopted by the [Indiana] Board.\" (Pet'r Br. at 11-12, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Assessor's claim asks the Court to reweigh the evidence that was presented to the Indiana Board in her favor. The Court cannot reweigh the evidence absent a showing that the Indiana Board has abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trimas Fasteners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7209749\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/923/496/#p502\">\n    923 N.E.2d at 498-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty Co. v.

Tax Ct. 2010) (explaining that the Indiana Board abuses its discretion when it either misinterprets the law or when its final determination is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before it). To demonstrate an abuse of discretion, the Assessor first points out that in her first sales comparison approach,\n   four of Hall's six comparable properties were leased at rates between $ 5.13 and $ 6.90 per square foot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 14 (citing Cert. Admin. R. at 1862, 2415).) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1854-55.) She then maintains that there was \"no logical path\" for the Indiana Board to determine those rental rates were not at market levels because \"[t]here's no evidence that ... suggests these properties were leased at above market rents\"; moreover, \"all [the rates] fall within the range of [ ] rents [that were] provided by Allen [in the Meijer Appraisal.]\" (Pet'r Br. at 14-15; Oral Arg. Tr. at 27-28, 31.) The Assessor's argument does not, however, rise to the level of demonstrating an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First of all, her argument is\n   <em>\n    argumentum ad ignorantiam\n   </em>\n   , meaning that she claims \"a proposition is true simply on the basis that it has not been proved false[.]\" PHILOSOPHY 103: INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAM , https://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2019). This \"logical fallacy\" is a type of argument used to shift the burden of proof\n   <em>\n    improperly\n   </em>\n   from the one who actually bears it. ARGUMENT FROM IGNORANCE , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, the final determination states that the only evidence Hall relied on to support his conclusion that the rental rates were at market levels was his own income approach analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 2415-16 \u00b6 56 (citing Cert. Admin. R. at 931, 934), 2432 \u00b6 107 (noting that Hall's reasoning was circular because he used the same comparables in both his income approach and his first sales comparison approach analysis).) If, however, the Assessor wanted the Indiana Board to follow a specific path to conclude that the leased-fee rental rates were at market levels (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , comparing her rental rates to with those used by Allen in the Meijer Appraisal),\n   <em>\n    she\n   </em>\n   needed to walk the Indiana Board down that path during the administrative process. Because the Assessor failed to do so, she cannot now rectify her misstep.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blesich v. Lake Cty.

Accordingly, the Court will not reverse the Indiana Board's final determination on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2)\n   <em>\n    Obsolescence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Assessor also argues that there is no evidence in the administrative record to support the Indiana Board's conclusion that the subject property suffers from obsolescence. (Pet'r Br. at 15-17.) She asserts that simply because sales prices were much lower per square foot than the per square foot value under the cost approach does not prove obsolescence has occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 16; Pet'r Reply Br. at 8.) As a result, she concludes that Meijer failed to both identify and quantify the amount of obsolescence it claimed was present in its property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 15-18; Oral Arg. Tr. at 35-36.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hometowne Assocs. v.

Indeed, he explained numerous times that big-box properties generally, and the subject property specifically, suffer from obsolescence immediately upon construction because they are built for first-generation users to their exact specifications, and in turn, subsequent users will never pay \"cost\" for these properties because they must incur extensive expenditures to adapt the properties to their own use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 415-17, 421-24, 430-31, 592-94, 597-98.) Allen's testimony adequately identifies the cause of the obsolescence and is consistent with a paradigm this Court has long accepted as valid.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Meijer Stores Ltd.

As this Court has previously explained, all three approaches to valuation quantify obsolescence, they just do it differently. Indeed, while the cost approach to valuation accounts for the obsolescence explicitly, the sales comparison and income approaches account for it implicitly.\n   <em>\n    Millennium Real Estate Inv., LLC v.
