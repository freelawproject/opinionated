In July 2006, Carrols implemented a Mandatory Arbitration Policy (\"MAP\") that required employees to arbitrate nearly all claims associated with their employment. Although Carrols required all new employees to sign a copy of the MAP, it did not require current employees to do so. Instead, Carrols distributed a memorandum to franchise managers to be disseminated to the employees. The memorandum stated that, by reporting to work on or after August 1, 2006, the employee was agreeing to the MAP. Carrols also required managers to hang a poster containing the MAP in the office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Jones was fired in December 2012. On December 16, 2013, Mr. Jones filed a complaint against Defendants, alleging racial and age discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and negligent supervision. Defendants moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the MAP, and Mr. Jones opposed their motion, arguing that he had never agreed to the MAP and had been unaware of its existence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} We further set forth the factual background and procedural history of the case in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

It also concluded, without any explanation or analysis, that the MAP was neither procedurally or substantively unconscionable. Mr. Jones appealed the trial court's decision to this Court, raising five assignments of error for our review. We reversed and remanded the matter on the basis that the trial court did not make a determination as to whether Mr. Jones knew about the MAP, noting that \"a party cannot assent to a term of which the party is unaware.\" [\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   ] at \u00b6 8, 12.

In doing so, it analyzed the evidence presented at the hearing and applied the applicable law. It also noted that it had previously determined that the MAP was lawful, that it was not unconscionable, and that the subject matter of Mr. Jones' claims fell within its scope. It, therefore, granted Defendants' renewed motion to compel arbitration and dismissed Mr. Jones' complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Jones appealed a second time to this Court, and again we reversed and remanded to the trial court for further analysis by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b64} Upon remand, the trial court granted Defendants' second renewed motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the case, concluding that: (1) the MAP was neither substantively nor procedurally unconscionable; (2) the MAP was not against public policy; (3) the MAP was valid and enforceable under Ohio law; (4) Mr. Jones' claims fell within the scope of the MAP; and (5) Mr. Jones waived his right to a jury trial by agreeing to be bound by the MAP.

While it is well-established that such language constitutes a broad clause, Mr. Jones offers no authority for his theory that such language should be construed as overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b612} Mr. Jones next argues that the agreement \"incorporates terms that are so unfair to one party the enforcement would be unreasonable.\" In support of this theory, Mr. Jones points to the language of the agreement stating that claims subject to arbitration include \"personal or emotional injury to you or your family * * *.\" Mr. Jones contends such language means that his wife or minor child would have to arbitrate any claims they had against Carrols. The agreement, however, is only between Carrols and Mr. Jones, and as such, no language in the agreement can bind other parties to arbitrate. Likewise, there is no other signatory to the agreement. This language would only be enforceable to the extent that Mr. Jones could bring a\n   claim for his own damages that were a result of an underlying injury to a family member. The language is also not given in isolation, but in the context of an agreement that, as a whole, references only the obligations of the employee and Carrols. To construe this language as Mr. Jones proposes, i.e., that it would be binding upon third-party family members, would not simply be unreasonable, but unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b613} Mr. Jones further argues that the terms of the arbitration agreement are unfair and one-sided. In support of this argument, Mr. Jones points to the language of the agreement stating: \"You also understand that the parties reserve the right to go to court if they are faced with the risk of irreparable harm, such as the disclosure of confidential information.\" Mr. Jones contends this language exempts claims more likely to be brought by Carrols, and is therefore unbalanced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b614} In support of his argument, Mr. Jones directs us to\n   <em>\n    Post v. Procare Automotive Serv. Solutions\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87646,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-2106\">\n    2007-Ohio-2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201290091\">\n    2007 WL 1290091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , contending that his agreement is of the same one-sided variety found to be unconscionable in\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   . The provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , however, is substantially different than the provision in the agreement between Mr. Jones and Carrols. In\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , the provision states that nothing in the arbitration agreement at issue \"shall be construed so as to deny Employer's right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach of Employee of any of his covenants * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Unlike the provision in the MAP, the\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   provision only creates an exception for the employer, and not for the employee, and it is thus inherently one-sided. The provision in the MAP applies equally to both Mr. Jones and Carrols, and although Mr. Jones states that the employer is more likely to bring a claim of the variety exempted, he offers no evidence that Carrols is more likely to face irreparable harm than he himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b615} Mr. Jones next argues that the terms of the arbitration agreement are misleading and ambiguous. Specifically, he contends that a MAP poster was ambiguous and misleading in stating \"[a]rbitration is similar to a lawsuit\" and that \"it is quicker and less expensive for both sides.\" Mr. Jones directs us to\n   <em>\n    Olah v. Ganley Chevrolet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the Eighth District Court of Appeal examined language in an arbitration agreement which provided: \"ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE\n   <em>\n    SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED\n   </em>\n   THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\" (Emphasis sic.) 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86132,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-694\">\n    2006-Ohio-694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20350204\">\n    2006 WL 350204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20. The Eighth District found the language to be ambiguous, and it was one of several factors that led the court to conclude that the arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b616} With regard to the MAP poster, such a simplified description of the arbitration process is incomplete by nature of its brevity and broad generalities. Importantly, however, the language that Mr. Jones refers to from the poster was not part of the arbitration agreement itself. Therefore it does not lend itself to making the actual agreement ambiguous and misleading. Mr. Jones also notes other language from promotional materials that he believes is misleading; however, once again, because the language is not from the agreement itself, we cannot conclude that such language makes the actual agreement substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b617} Mr. Jones further argues the language used in the employee handbook to describe the MAP is ambiguous, namely the statement that \"a formal grievance\n   procedure is available for you whenever you wish. An Arbitration procedure is also available. Carrols urges you to take advantage of either procedure if the need arises.\" Mr. Jones contends that this language is ambiguous because it is \"permissive not imperative suggesting the employee has the option of requesting arbitration rather than going to court.\" We find no ambiguity in these statements, nor are they part of the agreement itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b618} Mr. Jones next directs us to a MAP memorandum that states \"Under MAP, employment related disputes that cannot be resolved internally will proceed to arbitration rather than in a lawsuit.\" He argues this language is problematic because the MAP itself provides that employees \"are not required to use [the in-house grievance procedure] program * * *.\" We do not find this language to be ambiguous or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b619} Mr. Jones argues that the potential costs of arbitration render the agreement unconscionable; however he fails to provide any evidence of those costs.

None of these facts, however, are evidence of the substantive unconscionability of the terms of the agreement.

In pertinent part, the arbitration agreement provides: \"Claims subject to arbitration shall include, without limitation, disputes, claims, or controversies relating or referring in any manner, directly or indirectly, to * * * the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act or similar state statutes * * *.\" While the language of the agreement may not specifically refer to claims falling under Section 34a of the Ohio Constitution, the agreement does anticipate claims brought under state statutes similar to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The purpose of the Ohio Fair Minimum Wage Amendment, implemented by statute under R.C. 4111.14, is to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (1) Ensure that Ohio employees, as defined in division (B)(1) of this section,\n   are paid the wage rate required by Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (2) Ensure that covered Ohio employers maintain certain records that are directly related to the enforcement of the wage rate requirements in Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (3) Ensure that Ohio employees who are paid the wage rate required by Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution may enforce their right to receive that wage rate in the manner set forth in Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (4) Protect the privacy of Ohio employees' pay and personal information specified in Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution by restricting an employee's access, and access by a person acting on behalf of that employee, to the employee's own pay and personal information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   R.C. 4111.14(A).

Here, undoubtedly, there was a disparity in the bargaining power between the parties. Carrols drafted the arbitration agreement and was a large entity with thousands of employees. Mr. Jones was a high school graduate who was supporting a family, did not understand arbitration, and whose only option to maintain his employment was to agree to the arbitration agreement. Thus, his situation was not like that of a potential employee looking for a job who could simply apply somewhere else. Mr. Jones would have to leave a job he already had and then search for a new one if he were to object to the arbitration agreement. Thus, I would determine that the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b650} \"Substantive unconscionability encompasses those factors that concern the contract terms themselves[.] Contract terms are [substantively] unconscionable if they are unfair and commercially unreasonable.\" (Internal quotations and citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    First Natl.

Here, the arbitration agreement required that Mr. Jones arbitrate \"any and all disputes, claims or controversies for monetary or equitable relief arising out of or relating to [his] employment, even disputes, claims or controversies relating to events occurring outside the scope of [his] employment[.]\" Those claims included \"disputes, claims or controversies relating or referring in any manner, directly or indirectly to: * * * personal or emotional injury to [him] or [his] family[.]\" Thus, it seems Carrols was requiring that Mr. Jones arbitrate far more than disputes relating to his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b651} The arbitration agreement also states that the claims \"shall be arbitrated before JAMS, a national arbitration association, and conducted under the then current JAMS rules on employment arbitration.\" However, the copy of those rules presented by Carrols, which notably are effective as of July 15, 2009, state that \"JAMS may amend these Rules without notice. The Rules in effect on the date of the commencement of an Arbitration (as defined in Rule 5) shall apply to that Arbitration, unless the Parties have agreed upon another version of the Rules.\" Those rules include, inter alia, provisions about how to commence arbitration, arbitrator selection and replacement, scheduling and location of the hearing, awards, and fees. Accordingly, it would seem impossible for Mr. Jones to know what rules would apply to him given that there would be no way to know in advance what rules would be in effect when arbitration was finally sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.
