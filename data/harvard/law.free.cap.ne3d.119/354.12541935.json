The husband appeals, claiming that the judge erred in assigning a portion of his pensions to the wife, and that the alimony order and its termination date were error. He also claims that the judge erred in treating the funds from his State of Connecticut pension as both an asset and a stream of income (\"double dipping\") in awarding alimony. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Property division\n   </em>\n   . The husband claims that the division of the marital estate was inequitable and does not flow rationally from the findings. We disagree. \"A judge has broad discretion when awarding alimony and dividing marital assets pursuant to G.

The judge found that this was a long-term marriage of over thirty years, during which both parties worked and earned an income. The judge also explained that the parties' pensions were the largest part of the marital estate. The judge found that it was fair and equitable to treat the pensions as assets and therefore divided them equally so that each party would have the benefit of the pension accumulated by the parties during the marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This division is also consistent with the majority of our cases, which \"have treated retirement benefits and pensions as marital assets subject to equitable distribution.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841454\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/623/#p629\">\n    79 Mass.

However, the judge divided the marital portion of the pensions equally between the parties.

The husband claims that the alimony award does not appropriately consider G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 48 - 55, and that the duration of the award is arbitrary.

L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 49 (\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ) and 53 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ).\"\n   <em>\n    Duff-Kareores\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kareores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173583\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/528/#p535\">\n    474 Mass. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535-536 (2016). The purpose of alimony remains the payment of support from one spouse, who has the ability to pay, to the other spouse, who is in need of support. See\n   <em>\n    Gottsegen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gottsegen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874764\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/617/#p624\">\n    397 Mass. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, the judge properly considered the statutory factors for awarding alimony, which included the parties' health, income, employment, and employability, \"economic and non-economic contribution of both parties to the marriage[,] marital lifestyle[,] [and the] ability of each party to maintain the marital lifestyle.\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). The judge determined that the wife's current income and the result of the division of the marital estate would put her in a superior financial position to the husband as she continued to work full time and the husband was in need of support. The judge took into account the parties' current earnings or ability to earn, the husband's expenses (including that his expenses were being subsidized by his girl friend and his daughter and her boy friend), and the postdivorce health insurance costs. She also acknowledged that the husband's knee problems may limit his work opportunities, but found that he did have the ability to work and earn more than a nominal amount based on his skills and experience. The husband contends that the judgment leaves him in an inferior financial position; however, he does not cite to any expenses that he cannot meet. In sum, the amount of the alimony award was not plainly wrong. See\n   <em>\n    Heins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ledis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890257\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/477/#p480\">\n    422 Mass. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The husband also claims that the judge erred in setting the termination date of alimony. The parties' marriage was for more than thirty years, and therefore the judge would have been permitted to \"order alimony for an indefinite length of time.\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49 (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ). The alimony order in place does not deviate from any presumptive durational limit and does not require any special written findings. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53 (\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ) ;\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317542\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/653/#p658\">\n    467 Mass. 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (2014). Also, the order for alimony to terminate in three years when the wife turns sixty-two was not an abuse of discretion, as the judge properly considered the positions of the parties. Specifically, the husband was able to retire early at the age of forty-seven and the judge explained that the wife should have the same opportunity to retire at an age less than the \"full retirement age\" as defined by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48. The wife testified that her plan is to retire early at the age of sixty-two. Should circumstances change, the husband may seek modification of the alimony award pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Double dipping\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the husband claims that the judge erred in impermissibly double dipping by treating his State of Connecticut pension as both an asset and a stream of income. We disagree. Double dipping is a term used \"to describe the seeming injustice that occurs when property is awarded to one spouse in an equitable distribution of marital assets and is then also considered as a source of income for purposes of imposing [or not imposing] support obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987464\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/215/#p219\">\n    54 Mass. App. Ct. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (2002). \"[T]here is nothing ... that prohibits double dipping as matter of law.... Rather, ... the judge must look to the equities of the situation to make [her] determination\" (quotations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Fehrm-Cappuccino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cappuccino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461237\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/525/\">\n    90 Mass. App. Ct. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 n.4 (2016). Here, it was not an abuse of discretion to treat the State of Connecticut pension as a marital asset and to divide it equally. Dividing the husband's State of Connecticut pension between the parties is not inequitable double dipping where it is the wife who is ordered to pay alimony to the husband in consideration of her superior financial position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The judge assigned the husband fifty per cent of the accrued benefit in the wife's Baystate Health Inc. Retirement Program pension, which was \"frozen\" as of December 31, 2015, meaning there will be no more contributions to it. The judge assigned the wife a fifty per cent interest in the husband's accrued benefit in his State of Connecticut pension, which was in payout, and also a 43.75 per cent interest in the husband's military pension benefit, which was not yet vested at the time of trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Evidence was presented that the wife's anticipated monthly pension benefit would be about $600 at the age of sixty-two.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The wife's request for attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Mass.
