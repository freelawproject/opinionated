The defendant contends that Burgos recanted her trial testimony by stating, \"I believe [the defendant's] conviction and sentence are a terrible injustice.\" Burgos avers that she opposed the defendant's prosecution, repeatedly informing the prosecutor that she \"wanted [the defendant] to get help and not be locked up.\" In addition, the defendant points to Burgos's statement that if she had been contacted by the defense, she would have testified that at the time of the incident she was aware that the defendant suffered from mental illness, and that he broke into her apartment under the delusional belief that she was in danger, intending to rescue, not harm, her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Burgos's affidavit does not contain newly discovered evidence. If the defendant was not actually aware of Burgos's advocacy on his behalf at the time of trial or his first motion for new trial, he could have discovered it through reasonable diligence. See\n   <em>\n    Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874767\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/303/#p307\">\n    397 Mass. at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant had known Burgos for many years in both a social and professional capacity, and she considered him a friend. As the victim and principal witness, it was inevitable that Burgos would testify at trial, and the defendant could have obtained an identical affidavit before trial or elicited the same information on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nor can Burgos's knowledge of the defendant's alleged mental illness be considered newly discovered. The defendant's main defense at trial was that he suffered from a delusion and broke into Burgos's apartment to save, not harm, her. Burgos's affidavit states that she has \"decades of experience with [the defendant's] mental illness and was involved in getting him services.\" In particular, in her work for a counselling agency, Burgos helped the defendant locate housing and \"often acted as a go-between for social services caseworkers.\" Burgos's opinion of the defendant's mental illness was thus known to or readily discoverable by the defendant at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Furthermore, Burgos's affidavit is not so material that it \"would probably have been a real factor in the [fact finder's] deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874767\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/303/#p307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874767\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/303/#p307\">\n    at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She does not recant her trial testimony, but rather expresses regret at the consequences of the defendant's conviction. A defendant is not entitled to a new trial because \"with the benefit of hindsight, any collateral or contingent consequences flowing from the conviction appear to work an unfairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011077\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/631/\">\n    52 Mass. App. Ct. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 n.8 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nor is Burgos's claim, that she could have aided the defendant's mental illness defense, material. The defendant offered extensive expert testimony that he could not be held criminally responsible because he broke into Burgos's apartment under a delusional state. The information in Burgos's affidavit \"is not substantially different from the defense offered at trial,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shuman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2822391\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/268/#p272\">\n    445 Mass. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (2005) ; it is \"merely cumulative,\" and not grounds for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vieira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877544\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/828/#p838\">\n    401 Mass. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (1988), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"477981\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/565/#p576\">\n    380 Mass. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The judge did not commit legal error or an abuse of discretion in denying the defendant's second motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying second motion for new trial affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Shortly after trial, the defendant filed his first motion for new trial claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.
