L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32, and he pleaded guilty to doing so as a subsequent offender, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). On appeal, the defendant argues that his motions to suppress were erroneously denied for three reasons. First, he contends that the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application failed to establish a sufficient risk to officer safety to justify the \"no-knock\" provision of the warrant. Second, he argues that the affidavit failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the firearm described in the search warrant and the locus and that the information in the affidavit was stale. Third, he contends that the motion judge, based on clearly erroneous findings, erred in denying a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing. See\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p155\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155-156 (1978).

In reviewing the magistrate's determination, we look solely to the \"four corners of the affidavit,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346372\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/296/#p297\">\n    440 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (2003), and approach the contents \"with a view toward common sense, read in their entirety and with considerable latitude allowed for the drawing of inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5683746\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/573/#p576\">\n    452 Mass. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant argues that the affidavit did not provide probable cause to allow a no-knock entry. \"In order to justify suspension of the knock and announce requirement, the Commonwealth must establish that there is probable cause to believe that, in the particular circumstances of the search to be undertaken, evidence will be destroyed or officer safety put at risk if the rule is observed.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201328\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/213/#p216\">\n    438 Mass. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (2002). Where, as here, the Commonwealth relies on officer safety, the affidavit must \"articulat[e] ... facts and circumstances present in the specific case, which, with the benefit of inference, experience, and the application of common sense, establish a substantial basis for concluding that officer safety would be at risk.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"298431\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/358/747/#p749\">\n    358 Mass. 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749-752 (1971).

The defendant's illegal possession of a deadly weapon or weapons, combined with his criminal history, including acts of violence and the distribution of narcotics, established sufficient substantial risk to officer safety to justify a no-knock entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant's next argument is that the affidavit did not provide sufficient nexus between the revolver and the residence to be searched, and that the information from the confidential informant was stale. \"The basic question for the magistrate, when evaluating an affidavit supporting an application for the issuance of a search warrant, is whether there is a substantial basis on which to conclude that the articles or activity described are probably present or occurring at the place to be searched.\"\n   <em>\n    Spano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903245\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/178/#p184\">\n    414 Mass. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the affidavit stated that a reliable confidential informant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had seen the defendant display a gun while in the residence where he stayed with his girlfriend. This \"clearly established a link\" between the gun and the house.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thevenin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848289\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/822/#p826\">\n    82 Mass. App. Ct. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 (2012) (affidavit stated that one of the residence's occupants \"had displayed a gun while on the porch of the residence\"). Further, the affidavit stated that the defendant not only stayed at the house, but also conducted his drug business there. It was reasonable to infer that the gun was stored at, or remained in, the residence because a gun is \"durable, [and] of continuing utility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848289\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/822/#p826\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848289\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/822/#p826\">\n    . at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117631\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/770/#p778\">\n    424 Mass. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778 (1997). The durability and utility of a firearm, and the reasonable inference that the defendant's connection to the house was ongoing, also defeat the defendant's argument that the information was stale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117631\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/770/#p778\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117631\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/770/#p778\">\n    at 778-779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finally, the defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying him a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p155\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). \"[W]here the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p155\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/#p155\">\n    . at 155-156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant's\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   motion posited that the affiant officer had fabricated his affidavit \"as a courtesy\" to the defendant's landlord, who was a retired State police trooper, and was also involved in a summary process action against the defendant.
