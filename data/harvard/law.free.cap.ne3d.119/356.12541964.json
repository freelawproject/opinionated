App. Ct. 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (2006). Furthermore, the touching must be either harmful or nonconsensual.

App. Ct. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (2018). Putting aside momentarily the question of self-defense, the evidence established an intentional, nonconsensual touching. The victim testified that, while they were \"grappling,\" the defendant pushed him, threw him on the floor, and grabbed his head. \"Offensive physical contact, such as a push ..., undertaken without consent, constitutes a battery in the Commonwealth.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Travis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890892\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/408/1/#p8\">\n    408 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (1990).

Moreover, the victim testified that he \"didn't hold [the defendant's] arms until he was trying to punch me with the brick.\" Evidence that the physical conflict began with the defendant's trying to punch the victim with a brick was sufficient to defeat the defense of self-defense.
