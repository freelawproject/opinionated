CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b61} Before this court is an appeal taken by plaintiffs-appellants from a February 15, 2018 judgment entry issued by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees. The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b62} This case emanates from the tragic shooting at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012, perpetrated by Thomas M. Lane, III, which resulted in the deaths of three students: Daniel Parmertor, Russell King, Jr., and Demetrius Hewlin. Another student, Nick Walczak, was paralyzed, and two other students were injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b63} The circumstances of the shooting are generally undisputed. Lane was a student at Lake Academy, an alternative school for students with academic or behavioral issues. Lane's bus ride to Lake Academy required him to change buses at Chardon High School. On February 27, 2012, Lane took a gun and ammunition, hidden in his backpack, on his bus ride to school. He got off the bus at Chardon High School and waited in the school cafeteria for his transfer bus to Lake Academy. Other students were congregated in the cafeteria. When the bell rang and students began to disperse, Lane reached into his backpack and fired the concealed handgun, striking and killing Russell King, Jr. Lane then removed the gun from the backpack and continued firing, striking and killing Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin and injuring two others. Frank Hall, the high school football coach on cafeteria duty, confronted Lane and chased him down the hall from the cafeteria. Lane shot Nick Walczak in the back as he ran down the hallway, seriously injuring him, and then Lane ran out of the school. Surveillance video establishes 6 seconds elapsed between the first shot that was fired while the gun was still in the backpack and the last shot that was fired in the cafeteria. Approximately 22 seconds\n   elapsed between the first shot and Lane's exit from the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b64} A complaint was filed in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas on February 27, 2014. The plaintiffs in the case are Robert and Dina Parmertor, each individually and as administrators of the estate of Daniel Parmertor, deceased; Jeffrey T. Orndorff, administrator of the estate of Demetrius Hewlin, deceased; Phyllis Ferguson; Jeannie King, individually and as administratrix of the estate of Russell King, Jr., deceased; Russell King; and Nick Walczak. The Parmertor, Hewlin, and King Plaintiffs asserted claims against all defendants for wrongful death: negligence and recklessness; wrongful death: conscious disregard, malice, willful and wanton misconduct; survivorship; and loss of consortium\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Plaintiff Walczak asserted claims of negligence and recklessness; and conscious disregard, malice, and willful and wanton misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b65} The named defendants in the complaint are Chardon Local Schools, Chardon Local School District, and Chardon High School (collectively, \"Chardon Schools\"); Joseph Bergant, II, Dana Stearns, Andy Fetchik, Drew Trimble, and Michael J. Sedlack (collectively, \"Chardon School Employees\"); Chardon Board of Education and Chardon Local Schools Board of Education (collectively, \"Chardon School Board\"); Debbie Seenarine-Wilson, Blake Rear, Cindy Sague, Karen Blankenship, David Fairbanks, Paul Stefanko, Guy Wilson, and Larry Reiter (collectively, \"Chardon School Board Members\"); The Lake Academy Alternative School, The Lake Academy Alternative School-Lake County Educational Service Center, Lake Academy, and Lake County Educational Service Center (collectively, \"Lake Academy\"); and Bill Kermavner, John Weiss, and Brian Bontempo (collectively, \"Lake Educational Service Center Employees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b66} On November 25, 2014, the trial court dismissed Plaintiffs' claims against Chardon Schools, Chardon School Board, Chardon School Board Members, and Lake Academy based upon statutory immunity pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. The trial court also granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Chardon School Employees on Plaintiffs' claims for negligence, pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' claims against the Lake Educational Service Center Employees were also dismissed, pursuant to a Civ.R. 41(A) notice of dismissal, on August 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b67} The Chardon School Employees subsequently moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' remaining claims, on the basis that there is legally insufficient evidence of specific conduct that rises to the level of malice, bad faith, wanton, or reckless so as to overcome the statutory immunity to which they are entitled. They argued the deposition testimony reflects the School Employees considered the safety and security of students and staff as their top priority. The school administrators worked with local law enforcement to provide safety training to students and staff, and each school conducted state-mandated emergency drills, including an active shooter drill at Chardon High School in 2009, with the involvement of local police and fire departments. The school had a safety and security plan in place, which was evaluated by law enforcement for possible improvements; law enforcement was never critical of the protocols\n   in place, including not having a school resource officer (\"SRO\") stationed at the school. Police officers were in the building on a daily basis, either responding to calls or meeting with students and staff; the Chardon Police Department also required an officer to walk through the high school twice a day when school was in session. Lieutenant Troy Duncan, the police department's liaison to the school district, was at the high school at least once per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b68} The School Employees also engaged in efforts to increase security and safety by having staff and administrators act as a visible presence throughout the school day, but particularly in the mornings when the students arrived at school. Staff monitored the cafeteria, where large numbers of students would congregate before classes began. The administrators also provided guidance counselors, worked to become acquainted with individual students, and regularly attended school safety and security conferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b69} The Chardon School Employees also argued that summary judgment in their favor was appropriate because, even without statutory immunity, they owed no legal duty to Plaintiffs or their decedents to protect against Lane's unforeseeable criminal acts. They contended Ohio law does not recognize a \"special relationship\" between school officials and students that creates a duty to prevent criminal acts of third parties. Further, they claimed not to have a legal duty because Lane's actions were not foreseeable: there was no history of violent crime at Chardon High School; the School Employees had no knowledge Lane intended to bring a gun to school or intended to kill other students; they had no knowledge of any behavioral issues or violent propensities; Lane attended Lake Academy at the request of his guardians, not due to academic or behavioral issues; he had no disciplinary issues; and Lane was on track to graduate early despite attendance issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b610} Finally, the Chardon School Employees argued summary judgment in their favor was appropriate because Lane's actions were the sole proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries and damages. They argued that Plaintiffs' claim that the Chardon School Employees failed to employ an SRO, and that this measure would have prevented the shooting, is legally insufficient to hold them liable. First, the decision to hire an SRO is within the exclusive province of the Board of Education, not the School Employees. Second, Plaintiffs did not present legally sufficient evidence that an SRO would have prevented the shooting, which was over in approximately 22 seconds, or that it would have deterred Lane from bringing a gun to the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b611} Plaintiffs duly opposed the motion, contending triable issues of fact were established upon the claim that the lives and safety of the Chardon High School students had been recklessly endangered. Plaintiffs asserted the School Employees' motion for summary judgment ignored deposition testimony that established critical security recommendations that would have either prevented or deterred Lane's criminal actions were \"rashly rejected.\" They contended Chardon High School was not nearly as safe as suggested by the School Employees and that local police were called to the school 500-600 times per year, \"typically in response to reports of fighting, threats to faculty and staff, drugs, thefts, and vandalism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b612} Plaintiffs concluded that if an SRO had been present at the high school, it is doubtful the shooting would have occurred. Superintendent Bergant, Principal Fetcik, and Assistant Principal Trimble all agreed that Lane should have been removed from the cafeteria when he arrived\n   at the school wearing a sweatshirt on which was printed the word \"KILLER.\" Video surveillance shows that Lane was never confronted in the 30 minutes before he began shooting in the cafeteria. Plaintiffs contend the cafeteria would have been the most likely location an SRO would have been stationed. This argument was based on the report of Gregory M. Baeppler, a security consultant hired by Plaintiffs as an expert witness. Baeppler also concluded it was likely Lane would have been deterred from bringing a gun, knowing an armed SRO was present at the school. Plaintiffs further bolster their argument with the fact that an SRO was hired following the shooting and that Bergant has acknowledged criminal activity at the school has diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b613} Plaintiffs alleged the Chardon School Employees prevented the hiring of an SRO. A Safety and Security Action Team (\"SSAT\") was formed in 2006, which included Police Chief Timothy McKenna and Lieutenant Troy Duncan, with Assistant Principal Trimble as the Chairperson. The SSAT was tasked with creating a proposal to address security issues and presenting it to the Chardon School Board. Plaintiffs alleged the original proposal included a recommendation for a full-time SRO, which had been endorsed by Lt. Duncan, but that Trimble unilaterally crossed it off and handwrote \"supervision\" before it was presented to the School Board in April 2007. Plaintiffs also contended that by September 2008 it was foreseeable a gunman could enter Chardon High School. This argument was based on a letter sent from Superintendent Bergant to school parents and staff that addressed an incident involving a student with a handgun at a nearby high school. Bergant had discussed the option of an SRO with Chief McKenna and Lt. Duncan but did not address the issue with the School Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b614} Plaintiffs further argued that schools do have a legal duty to keep their students safe and that school shootings are foreseeable, based on the recent increase in such incidents. They argued the risk was known to the Chardon School Employees, as evidenced by the active shooter drill performed in 2009. But, they argued, the Chardon School Employees were indifferent to critical preventative measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b615} In their reply, the Chardon School Employees responded that, \"whatever the plaintiffs' criticisms of Chardon High School and its administrators, * * * the absence of a [SRO] at the high school does not rise to the level of malicious, reckless or wanton misconduct or bad faith on the part of individual school administrators. Consideration and action upon this issue ultimately rested with the Board of Education, not the individual administrators. In light of the existing presence of and relationship with law enforcement at Chardon High School, the absence of a [SRO] cannot reasonably be said to be misconduct so perverse as to discard statutory immunity.\" They further argued that the opinion of Plaintiffs' expert witness that an SRO would have prevented the shooting was merely speculative and pure conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b616} On February 15, 2018, the trial court granted the motion and entered summary judgment in favor of the Chardon School Employees. The trial court concluded there was no evidence of bad faith or of malicious, wanton, or reckless behavior on the part of the Chardon School Employees, nor was there any evidence they knew or should have known Lane posed a danger to other students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b617} The trial court also noted that Plaintiffs had significantly misstated the history of police interaction with Chardon High School. Based on Chief McKenna's\n   deposition testimony, the 500 to 600 calls to which Chardon Police responded each year included visits to all schools in the Chardon School District and the twice-a-day routine walk-throughs at the middle and high schools. The number one reason for calls requiring a police response were faulty alarm signals, not violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b618} This matter is now before us on the notice of appeal filed by Plaintiffs, who raise the following two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [1.] The trial judge abused his discretion by finding that the report that had been prepared by Plaintiff-Appellants' security specialist was too 'speculative' to be submitted to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [2.] The trial judge erred, as a matter of law, by granting summary judgment upon Plaintiff-Appellants' claims for reckless and wanton liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Chardon School Employees responded and raise one cross assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   As an alternative basis for summary judgment, the Chardon School Employees were also entitled to summary judgment because [Lane] was the sole proximate cause of the Appellants' injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b619} \" 'Summary judgment is a procedural device to terminate litigation and to avoid a formal trial when there is nothing to try.

Baeppler, a security consultant, in support of their allegations. In the report, Baeppler made the following findings and opinions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 The Chardon Schools Administrators had a responsibility to protect the children attending the Chardon Schools. It was their responsibility to promulgate and implement security measures and policies to provide a safe and secure environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 The Chardon Administrators had a responsibility to provide a safe and secure environment including taking measures to deter and prevent intruders or active shooters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 The security measures put in place by the Defendant Administrators at the time of the shooting were grossly insufficient to protect students and staff. Proper security measures should have included an SRO, restricted access and entrance monitoring would have likely prevented the tragedy of February 27th 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 The Safety and Security Action Team, including Chardon Police Department Chief McKenna and Lieutenant Duncan, specifically recommended that an SRO was needed in Chardon High School in 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Superintendent Bergant concluded on his own in early 2011 that an SRO was needed in Chardon High School, but took no action to have the SRO put into place. This egregious and inexcusable failure included not going to the board for approval or discussing the need for an SRO with other administrators. Bergant's conduct was reckless and wanton in failing to take action on his conclusion that an SRO was needed prior to the 2011-2012 school year at the High School.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Prior to the February 27th 2012 shooting, there was an overwhelming amount of criminal activity occurring at Chardon High School, including fights, assaults and drug activity. By the estimate of the Police Chief, Chardon Police Department was called to the Chardon schools 500 - 600 times per year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The Defendant Administrators deliberately disregarded the recommendations of their own local law enforcement in failing to arrange, provide and employ an SRO in Chardon High School prior to the shooting. This conduct by the Defendant Administrators is reckless and wanton, and placed the safety of Chardon High School students and staff at risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 The actions of the Defendant Administrators in failing to employ and utilize an SRO in violation of the SSAT recommendations and local law enforcement recommendations were reckless and wanton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 This shooting incident was foreseeable. That the Chardon schools recommended practicing a scenario involving an active shooter situation in 2009 speaks directly to their awareness of the issue. Superintendent Bergant also admitted this was a well-recognized threat the school faced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Interestingly, a school math teacher, Thomas Ricci, thought an active\n   shooter in the High School was foreseeable enough to have TWO ballistic vests available in his classroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Vice Principal Trimble, without any authorization and in direct contradiction of the SSAT's report and recommendations, crossed off the recommendation of an SRO on the SSAT strategic planning report. As a result, the determined and recommended need for an SRO was not presented to the board as planned and anticipated. This conduct is reckless and wanton, and placed students and staff at risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 The tragic murders of Russell King, Jr., Demetrius Hewlin, and Daniel Parmertor and the senseless crippling of Nick Walczak, by gunshot occurred as a direct and proximate result of the egregious conduct and actions of the Defendant Administrators documented in the materials I reviewed and outlined in my report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b625} Baeppler ultimately concluded in his report that (1) \"an SRO would have deterred and prevented the incident from occurring in the first place\"; and (2) the failure of the Defendant Administrators to employ an SRO was reckless and wanton, placed students and staff at risk, and \"directly led to this tragedy, including the deaths * * * and catastrophic injuries\" of the students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b626} The trial court found the expert report is inadmissible because it is speculative and renders a conclusion within the province of the finder of fact.

Her function was not to \"approve\" the plan but to submit the plan based upon the findings of the group as a whole. Id. at p. 31. The committee's task was to evaluate security issues for the entire district, not just the high school, and the group met approximately ten times. Id. at pp. 24, 52. Trimble recalled that, with input from law enforcement, the committee determined safety and security issues in Chardon were being \"handled\" and although an SRO would have been a nice addition, it was not deemed \"necessary.\" Id. at p. 22. The term \"SRO\" was crossed off the final plan and replaced by \"Supervision\" after the group decided a full-time SRO was not needed, and student/security issues would be addressed by in-building administration and/or the Chardon Police Department or Geauga Sheriff's Department if necessary. Id. at p. 142. Trimble gave the completed Safety Proposal to Superintendent Joseph Bergant, II (\"Bergant\") before it went to the Chardon School Board but she had no involvement in the creation or promulgation of the Safety Plan which was subsequently enacted.

He did not recall being present when the SRO recommendation was changed to \"Supervision,\" nor did he know who was responsible for making the change. Id. at pp. 65, 67. Nonetheless, he considered the security apparatus in place at Chardon High School to be adequate and appropriate, and stated that he would not have sent his daughter to the school if he did not think it was safe.

Specifically, they assert that no meaningful supervision was being furnished in the cafeteria because (1) the School Employees conceded that Lane's sweatshirt, on which was printed the word \"KILLER,\" should have been a warning and a red flag that Lane should have been immediately removed from the cafeteria, and (2) Fetchik was only able to identify a single teacher, a study hall monitor, who monitored approximately 150 students in the cafeteria in the mornings. Additionally, Plaintiffs assert that the School Employees' defense of Lane's character is not credible because of his frequent absences caused by alleged migraines that were never verified. None of these contentions creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the School Employees acted in bad faith or engaged in other conduct that obviates their statutory immunity. These contentions merely highlight the instability and hindsight nature of Plaintiffs' claim. Absent is reference to any definitive breach of an established duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b660} Appellants additionally filed a notice of supplemental authority, which offers, in support of their arguments on appeal, the opinions in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Olsen v.

Both cases arose after two young students committed suicide, allegedly as a result of ongoing bullying at the students' schools. Appellants specifically direct our attention to the following passage from a Sixth Circuit opinion, applying Tennessee law, which is quoted in both district opinions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Our newspapers and television networks consistently report instances when young people harm themselves or others after being bullied by their peers. Such occurrences may not be common within an individual school, but because reports of these tragedies are consistent and well-publicized, all school districts should realize that self-harm is a reasonably foreseeable result of bullying, without requiring specific evidence of the victim's mental state. If a school is\n   <em>\n    aware\n   </em>\n   of a student being bullied but does nothing to prevent the bullying, it is reasonably foreseeable that the victim of the bullying might resort to self-harm, even suicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Tumminello v.

Further, they do not support appellants' position on appeal; there is no evidence\n   in the record whatsoever that any of the School Employees were aware of but consciously disregarded Lane's propensity for violence or his intention to carry out an attack on the school. In fact, there is no evidence Lane had any propensity for violence at all until the shooting occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b661} After reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, we conclude the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the Chardon School Employees. We are very mindful that what took place at Chardon High School is nothing less than tragic; what was lost that day can never be replaced. The evidence upon which Plaintiffs rely simply does not create a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the School Employees acted in bad faith or engaged in conduct that was malicious, wanton, or reckless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b662} Plaintiffs' second assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b663} As we have found no basis upon which to reverse the trial court's judgment, we decline to review Chardon School Employees' cross assignment of error regarding Lane's actions as the sole proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries and damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2505.22.
