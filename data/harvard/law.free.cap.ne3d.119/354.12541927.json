Moreover, because the assault and vandalism charges led the victim to seek an abuse prevention order, the charges were \"inextricably intertwined\" and that evidence would have been permitted at a separate trial had one occurred.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801944\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/379/#p394\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801944\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/379/#p394\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marrero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310362\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/65/#p67\">\n    427 Mass. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67 (1998).

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When evaluating sufficiency, the evidence must be reviewed with specific reference to the substantive elements of the offense. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677-678 (1979).

Rather, the defendant claims the sole issue is whether the defendant's intent was to commit a battery against the victim when he threw rocks through her bedroom window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was evidence that the victim was awakened by baseball-sized rocks crashing through her bedroom window and entering the room. The defendant was standing outside the window angrily yelling at the victim and accusing her of having a man in her bedroom. As the defendant had been in the victim's bedroom in the past, he would have known that her bed was placed against the wall where the rocks entered the room. In fact, the rocks and the broken glass were found on the floor next to the bed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was sufficient to establish that the defendant was engaged in objectively menacing conduct and that he intended to place the victim in fear of an imminent battery.
