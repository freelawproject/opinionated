L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C. Almost ten years later, he moved to vacate his plea on the grounds that there was no factual basis for the plea and that he did not plead voluntarily and intelligently because the Commonwealth's recitation of facts did not support a finding that the person in a lewd photograph he possessed was younger than eighteen years of age. A judge who was not the plea judge denied the motion and this appeal followed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . At his plea colloquy, the defendant agreed to the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"[O]n August 22nd, 2006, the Somerset Police Department was conducting an undercover prostitution sting operation at the Super 8 Motel in Somerset. The defendant was present at the motel during the sting operation, and a subsequent search of the defendant produced one photograph of a young teenaged male considered to be portrayed in a pose involving lewd exhibition of the unclothed genitals as defined under Chapter 272, Section 29C.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant contends that the Commonwealth's recitation did not provide a sufficient factual basis for his plea because the Commonwealth did not prove that the subject of the photograph was younger than eighteen years. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The factual basis requirement is distinct from the requirement that a defendant's plea be made voluntarily and intelligently.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780244\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/756/#p758\">\n    88 Mass.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant only challenges proof of the age element of \u00a7 29C. Here, contrary to the defendant's contention, the Commonwealth's recitation that the photograph depicted a \"young teenaged male\" in violation of the statute was sufficient to support a finding that the subject was younger than eighteen years of age.

The factual basis for the plea was adequately supported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Voluntariness and intelligence\n   </em>\n   . We are similarly not persuaded that the Commonwealth's failure to state the photograph subject's age prevented the defendant from pleading voluntarily and intelligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"A plea is voluntary if entered without coercion, duress, or improper inducements.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Berrios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730657\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/701/#p708\">\n    447 Mass. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (2006), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20U.S.%20907\">\n    550 U.S. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).

He then admitted that all those facts were true, including the characterization of the photograph as containing \"a young teenaged male.\" This was sufficient to establish that he pleaded intelligently.
