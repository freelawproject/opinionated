After his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olmande\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163516\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/231/\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), the defendant moved for a new trial. On appeal from the denial of that motion, the defendant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain expert testimony, and that the prosecutor's closing argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On April 7, 2011, a jury convicted the defendant of four counts of rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At trial, the then eighteen year old victim identified the defendant, her grandmother's former boy friend, as the man who raped her for a period of years starting from the time she was four or five.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although there was no physical evidence, the Commonwealth introduced corroborating testimony from a first complaint witness, the grandmother, and an aunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The aunt testified that on more than one occasion, while giving the child a bath, she noticed a \"discharge\" in the child's underwear that looked like the underwear of a \"sexually active\" adult woman. Alarmed, she consulted with the grandmother and questioned the child about whether someone had harmed her. After the child stated that no one had \"mess[ed] with\" her, the aunt attributed the stain to the victim's eczema and the infrequency with which the victim bathed on account of that condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Expert witness\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that trial counsel's failure to move to stay trial to obtain an expert witness to testify about innocent explanations for stains in a child's underwear constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, requiring a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We apply a two-pronged test for determining whether to grant a new trial for ineffective assistance of counsel. \"[A] defendant is denied constitutionally effective assistance of counsel if the representation fell 'measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,' and that the performance inadequacy 'likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kolenovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320338\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/664/#p673\">\n    471 Mass. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (2015), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because there is no affidavit from trial counsel regarding that decision, it was within the judge's discretion to conclude that \"the defendant's assertions about what counsel did not do is speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411762\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/441/291/#p304\">\n    441 Mass. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (2004), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734955\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/487/\">\n    437 Mass. 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 n.17 (2002).

It is far from clear that expert medical testimony providing alternative explanations for the stains would have accomplished anything more for the defense, or could have improved upon the concessions already obtained on cross-examination of the percipient witness that the alternative explanation satisfied her at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Closing argument\n   </em>\n   . In our prior decision we rejected the defendant's argument that the prosecutor's improper vouching, while error, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Olmande\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163516\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/231/\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant renews that argument in this appeal, albeit in slightly different form. We can identify no new factual or legal issue warranting further review.

App. Ct. 371\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 373-374 (1991). However, the direct appeal was previously heard by this court, and the parties at that time had included the trial transcripts in the record.
