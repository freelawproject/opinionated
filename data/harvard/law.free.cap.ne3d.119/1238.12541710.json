INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 1}\n   </strong>\n   This expedited elections case involves an initiative petition proposing an\n   ordinance that would amend the city of Solon's zoning map to create the Kerem Lake Mixed-Use District. Relators, Mark A. Harris, Richard N. Haig, Jacqueline L. Kogan, Cheryl L. Davis, and Travis Lane Maggard, are the five members of the petition committee. The committee seeks a writ of mandamus (1) ordering respondent Solon Director of Finance Matt Rubino (or in the alternative, respondent Solon city council) to certify the sufficiency and validity of the initiative petition to respondent Cuyahoga County Board of Elections and (2) ordering the board to place the proposed ordinance on the November 6, 2018 ballot. The committee asserts these claims as a taxpayer action under R.C. 733.59 and seeks costs and reasonable attorney fees under R.C. 733.61. With its complaint, the committee filed a motion to establish the amount of security for the costs of the proceeding under R.C. 733.59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 2}\n   </strong>\n   We grant a writ of mandamus ordering Rubino to certify the sufficiency and validity of the initiative petition to the board of elections for placement on the November 2018 ballot. We also grant the motion to establish the amount of the security for costs, waive the provision requiring relators to pay security for costs, and grant the committee its costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   The initiative petition seeks to submit to the voters of Solon a proposed ordinance amending the city's zoning map to create the Kerem Lake Mixed-Use District. The ordinance would change the zoning classification of a 102-acre tract that includes a 20-acre lake. The area is currently zoned for single-family houses on one-acre lots. If created, the mixed-use district would permit development of the property to include single- and multi-family dwellings, a winery, a spa, a boutique hotel, certain retail uses, a senior-living facility, and an underground parking garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   On June 29, 2018, prior to circulating the petition, the committee submitted a certified copy of the proposed ordinance to both Rubino and the city council. The committee filed the circulated petition with Rubino on July 12. R.C. 731.28 provides that when a municipal initiative petition is filed with a city auditor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the auditor shall \"after ten days, * * * transmit the petition to the board [of elections],\" which shall return it to the auditor within ten days after receiving it, along with a statement attesting to the number of electors who signed the petition. The board then submits the petition to the electors \"at the next general election occurring subsequent to ninety days after the auditor * * * certifies the sufficiency and validity of the initiative petition to the board of elections.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   Rubino held the petition for ten days in accordance with R.C. 731.28. On July 23, the petition was forwarded to the board of elections to examine the signatures. On July 30, the board certified that the petition contained 870 valid signatures, which the parties agree is more than the number necessary to qualify the petition for the ballot under R.C. 731.28. On July 31, the city retrieved the petition and certification from the board. The deadline to certify the validity and sufficiency of the petition to the board for inclusion on the\n   November 2018 ballot was August 8 at 4 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 6}\n   </strong>\n   Neither Rubino nor the city council met this deadline. Article XIV of the Solon City Charter provides that an ordinance proposed by initiative petition changing a zoning classification or permitted use \"shall not become effective after the passage thereof, until Council submits such ordinance * * * to the electorate at a regularly scheduled election, occurring more than 90 days after the passage\n   of the ordinance * * * and such ordinance * * * is approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, in this Municipality and in each ward in which the change is applicable to property in the ward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 7}\n   </strong>\n   Rubino and the city council took the position that under Article XIV of the charter, the city council-not Rubino-had the duty to certify the petition to the board, that it could do so only by passing an ordinance, and that the charter required that the ordinance be read by title at three separate council meetings. The city council prepared an ordinance for this purpose containing \"emergency\" language. That language, if adopted, would have waived the three-reading requirement and made the ordinance effective immediately on passage. The city council held a regular meeting on August 6, at which the ordinance was read by title for the first time. The council did not adopt the \"emergency\" language or pass the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Taxpayer Demand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 8}\n   </strong>\n   During the city council's July 2 meeting-prior to the committee's filing of the circulated petition-the councilman for the ward that includes the Kerem Lake project stated his desire that the eventual ordinance certifying the validity and sufficiency of the petition to the board be given three readings. On July 20, the committee's counsel sent a taxpayer-demand letter to the city's law director, arguing that three readings of a certification ordinance by the city council were not necessary and that Rubino, or in the alternative, the council, had a duty to certify the validity and sufficiency of the petition to the board by August 8. The committee requested, under R.C. 733.58 and 733.59, that the law director seek a writ of mandamus compelling the city council to certify the petition to the board if the council did not do so at its August 6 regular meeting. On July 30, the law director rejected this demand. The August 8 deadline passed with no action by the law director. On August 9, the committee filed this mandamus action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 9}\n   </strong>\n   To resolve this case, we must determine whether R.C. 731.28 or Article XIV of the Solon City Charter governs the procedure for certifying the initiative petition to the board of elections for placement on the ballot. The committee argues that R.C. 731.28 applies because the charter provision does not provide a procedure under which the city council must certify the petition by ordinance and because the charter provision violates the Ohio Constitution's reservation of the right of initiative to the people of each municipality in Article II, Section 1f. In the alternative, the committee argues that if the charter does apply, the city council cannot delay the certification of the initiative petition by insisting on\n   passing an ordinance after three readings at three separate meetings; instead, it must either pass an emergency ordinance or certify the petition by resolution or motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 10}\n   </strong>\n   We conclude that the charter provision does not apply and that R.C. 731.28 imposed a duty on Rubino to certify the initiative petition to the board. Accordingly, we do not reach the remaining substantive arguments regarding the constitutionality of the charter and the city council's duties under it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

The committee argues that the official performing the role of a city auditor must certify the petition to the board under R.C. 731.28. The city argues that the charter applies and that it requires city council to pass an ordinance certifying the petition to the board. To resolve this question, we must determine whether the charter clearly and expressly conflicts with the statute. As explained below, we find that it does not conflict and that the statute therefore applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1.

It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-26\">\n   Ordinances and other measures providing for the exercise of any powers of government granted by the constitution or delegated to any municipal\n   corporation by the general assembly may be proposed by initiative petition.

The auditor or clerk shall\n   <em>\n    transmit the petition to the board\n   </em>\n   together with the certified copy of the proposed ordinance or other measure. The board shall examine all signatures on the petition to determine the number of electors of the municipal corporation who signed the petition. The board\n   <em>\n    shall return the petition to the auditor or clerk within ten days after receiving it\n   </em>\n   , together with a statement attesting to the number of such electors who signed the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   The board shall submit such proposed ordinance or measure for the approval or rejection of the electors of the municipal corporation at the next general election occurring\n   subsequent to ninety days\n   <em>\n    after the auditor or clerk certifies the sufficiency and validity of the initiative petition to the board of elections\n   </em>\n   .

The Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the authority to \"exercise all powers of local self-government.\" Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3. The citizens of the city of Solon exercised this constitutional home-rule power and enacted a charter provision that controls the process for making zoning changes through initiative petition. Yet today, the majority disregards the home-rule rights of Solon and its citizens and insists that state law, rather than the city charter, controls its local zoning initiatives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 38}\n    </strong>\n    Solon's charter provides that most initiative petitions are to be governed by state law but makes an explicit exception to state-law procedures for zoning matters-specifically, it states, \"except that ordinances or resolutions proposed by initiative petition to affect [sic] a zoning district change or zoning use change shall be governed by Article XIV of this Charter.\" Solon Charter, Article IX, Section 1(d). This provision is a clear and unequivocal statement of the city's intention to exercise its home-rule power to regulate the initiative process for zoning changes. (Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the city\n    could have expressed its intention any more clearly.) Thus, I would conclude that the city's charter governs the manner in which a relator's initiative petition is advanced to the ballot. And I would further hold that Solon City Council did not violate a clear legal duty in failing to pass the initiative ordinance in time for its placement on the November 2018 ballot.\n    <strong>\n     The City Exercises its Home-Rule Authority over the Initiative Process\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 39}\n    </strong>\n    Under the Ohio Constitution's home-rule provisions, municipalities are authorized \"to exercise all powers of local self-government.\" Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3 ;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    , Section 7.

This principle is reflected in R.C. 731.41, which provides that the initiative procedures set forth in R.C. 731.28 to 731.41\"do not apply to any municipal corporation which adopts its own charter containing an initiative and referendum provision for its own ordinances and other legislative matters.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 40}\n    </strong>\n    Solon, for the most part, has acceded to following the initiative procedures provided in R.C. 731.28 et seq.

Oddly, in reaching its conclusion that the charter doesn't conflict with the statute, the majority focuses on ways the procedures in Article XIV of the charter are not like those set forth in the statute. Thus, the majority points out that the charter provisions \"do not set forth a procedure for submitting a zoning initiative petition to the city or for verifying the petition's signatures.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 22.

For the November 2018 ballot, that meant the ordinance had to be passed by August 8. The charter further provides that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    each ordinance * * * shall before its passage, be read by title only on three separate days unless the requirement for such reading be dispensed with by the concurrence of at least five Councilmen; provided, however, that any emergency measure may be passed after one reading and the legislative authority may require any reading to be in full by a majority vote of its members.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Solon Charter, Article IV, Section 5(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 48}\n    </strong>\n    After the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections certified the number of valid signatures on the petition (870), the city retrieved the petition and certification on July 31. The petition was then read by title for the first time at the council's next regular meeting on August 6. According to respondents, the council generally held meetings on the first and third Mondays of each month. If the city council held to this schedule, the next regular meeting during which the initiative could have been read was August 20, less than 90 days before the November 2018 general election.

I therefore would deny the writ of mandamus as to the city. Further, because the committee's claims were not well founded, I would deny costs and attorney fees under R.C. 733.61.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
