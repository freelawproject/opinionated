Because the challenged instruction here fell short of this objective, we disapprove of its use going forward. But because we find that the jury charge, as a whole, cured the instructional defect, and because the evidence clearly sustained the defendant's conviction, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On a rainy, mid-December evening, Clay County Deputy Sheriff James Switzer noticed Christapher Batchelor driving without a seatbelt. As the deputy approached him from behind at a four-way stop, Batchelor reached over to fasten his seatbelt before signaling and turning left. The deputy, driving in a marked police cruiser, then activated his emergency lights. But Batchelor failed to immediately stop. For the next minute and thirty-eight seconds, Batchelor passed a gas station and wound his way through a well-lit residential area at about thirty-five miles per hour, making complete stops at two intersections and passing several illuminated side streets along the way. Even as other vehicles came to a stop during this low-speed pursuit, and despite the piercing ring of the deputy's siren, Batchelor simply kept driving. When the deputy directed his LED spotlight onto the truck's side and rearview mirrors, Batchelor finally pulled over into a gravel parking spot on the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Batchelor exited his truck, the deputy ordered him to the ground. Batchelor initially complied. But as the deputy approached to arrest him, he resisted, and a struggle ensued. It took two more backup officers to finally subdue Batchelor. In the end, the deputy injured his ankle, one of the back-up officers jammed his finger, and another received a black eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State charged Batchelor with three crimes: Level-6 felony resisting law enforcement by fleeing, Level-6 felony battery on a police officer, and Class-A misdemeanor resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indiana Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-44.1-3-1(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2014) (felony resisting); I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 35-42-2-1(b)(1), (d)(2) (2014) (felony battery); I.C. \u00a7 35-44.1-3-1(a)(1) (2014) (misdemeanor resisting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the conclusion of evidence at trial, the State proposed several jury instructions,\n   including one which defined the act of fleeing, as that term applied to the felony-resisting charge. Under that instruction-Instruction 22-a person \"flees\" when he or she \"attempts to escape from law enforcement or attempts to unnecessarily prolong the time before the person must stop.\" App. Vol. III, p.71. Instruction 22 also required the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \"defendant acted with the intent to escape\" or, in the alternative, that a \"reasonable driver in the Defendant's position\" would have stopped sooner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902272\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/19/271/#p277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After summarizing all proposed final jury instructions, the trial court asked the parties, \"We good?\" Tr. Vol. III, p.98. Defense counsel responded \"Yeah\" while the prosecution replied with \"No objection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902272\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/19/271/#p277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his closing arguments, Batchelor claimed that he had not attempted to flee, as there was no high-speed chase, it was dark, it was raining, and the gravel parking spot where he stopped was \"a good and safe place to pull over.\" Tr. Vol. III, pp. 108-09. He also argued self-defense, claiming the deputy had used unlawful force in subduing him. But the State argued that Batchelor was fleeing, citing the numerous places he could have stopped, the well-lit streets, and the lack of evidence supporting a reasonable safety concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following deliberations, the jury found Batchelor guilty on all counts and the trial court entered judgment of conviction. Batchelor appealed, arguing that Instruction 22 expanded the definition of fleeing, which invaded the province of the jury and diminished the State's burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a unanimous opinion, our Court of Appeals reversed the felony-resisting conviction while affirming all other convictions.\n   <em>\n    Batchelor v.

App. 2018),\n   <em>\n    vacated\n   </em>\n   . The panel concluded that the jury instruction, by allowing a conviction based on what a \"reasonable driver\" would have done, permitted the State to convict Batchelor on a civil negligence standard, resulting in fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553053\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/297/#p305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553053\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/297/#p305\">\n    at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(bold emphases added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Batchelor argues that, by using a civil negligence standard to establish criminal culpability, Instruction 22 relieves the State of its burden to prove, under the felony-resisting statute, that he knowingly or intentionally fled. Permitting the jury to convict on a lesser\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , he insists, violates due process and conflicts with \"well-established precedent\" holding that similar instructional defects amount to fundamental error. Resp. to Pet. to Trans. at 6. Batchelor also contends that, by expanding the statutory definition of fleeing, Instruction 22 invades the province of the jury in violation of article 1, section 19 of the Indiana Constitution. He specifically faults the instruction for inviting the jury to focus on whether \"reasonable\" safety concerns justified his actions, thus minimizing other relevant factors, like the speed at which he drove or the complete stops he made at intersections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State counters that Batchelor invited the alleged instructional error, thus precluding appellate review. On the merits,\n   the State argues that the trial court committed no fundamental error because the instruction embodies an accurate statement of law approved by Court of Appeals precedent. What's more, the State insists, the trial court's general instructions properly informed the jury on all elements of the offense, thus curing any defect in the challenged instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. With no evidence of strategic maneuvering at trial, Batchelor did not invite the alleged instructional error.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We first address the State's argument that Batchelor invited the trial court's alleged instructional error. Initially, we observe that the State potentially waived this argument, having raised it for the first time in its petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The distinction in these two doctrines is an important one: whereas waiver generally leaves open an appellant's claim to fundamental-error review, invited error typically forecloses appellate review altogether.\n   <em>\n    Brewington v.

By insisting that Batchelor \"explicitly had no objection to the instruction when proposed\" and that he \"affirmatively accepted the jury instructions as a whole,\" State's Reply Br. on Trans. at 4, the State seeks to blur-if not collapse-the distinction between waiver and invited error, precluding review under either doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We recognize that our appellate courts have struggled in defining the doctrinal parameters of waiver and invited error, leading occasionally to inconsistent application.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gamble v.

But when a careful reading of the record fails to disclose enough information, courts should resolve any doubts\n   <strong>\n    against\n   </strong>\n   a finding of invited error rather than engage in speculation. Although this may seem contrary to principles of finality and judicial economy, we believe the opposite is often true. Defendants still carry a heavy burden in meeting the high standard of fundamental error, so there is little to no threat of multiple reversals. And when \"the procedural posture of the claim is caused by counsel's failure to object at trial,\" we can often preempt the defendant's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenge on post-conviction review by considering a claim of fundamental error on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Brewington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6967958\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/7/946/#p974\">\n    7 N.E.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (because \"fundamental error requires a showing of at least as much prejudice to the defendant as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\" a finding against the former claim establishes a finding against the latter claim) (citing\n   <em>\n    Culver v.
