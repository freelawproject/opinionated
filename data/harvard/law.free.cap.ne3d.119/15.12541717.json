They each purchased an insurance policy from defendant, Rockford Mutual Insurance Company. The building partially collapsed, and plaintiff submitted claims to defendant for the loss of the building and for lost business income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant made a few payments but notified plaintiff that the claims would be \"held in abeyance\" pending the completion of defendant's inspection. Plaintiff, on its own behalf and as assignee of Szechwan Garden, ultimately filed a third amended complaint for breach of contract and unreasonable and vexatious delay in settling the claims under section 155 of the Illinois Insurance Code ( 215 ILCS 5/155 (West 2012) ). A jury found that defendant had breached the insurance contracts, and the section 155 claims proceeded to a bench trial that resulted in a judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appeals, arguing that the latter judgment must be reversed because a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute existed as to the amount owed. We affirm and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 4 A. Defendant's Payments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 5 The building collapsed on August 8, 2011. Defendant stipulated that the policies covered the collapse, but the parties disagreed over the amount of liability. Plaintiff's policy provided building replacement\n   coverage of $1.64 million plus $10,000 for building code upgrades. Szechwan Garden's policy provided coverage to replace personal property in the amount of $127,000 plus $4000 for signage. On December 8, 2011, Szechwan Garden assigned its contractual rights to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 6 The parties stipulated that, at the time of the collapse, Szechwan Garden was renting the second floor for $1500 per week. The restaurant was closed for nearly 49 weeks, from August 8, 2011, through July 12, 2012, while the building was being replaced. As a result, plaintiff lost $72,643 in rental income. However, defendant paid only $54,000 for lost rental income: $36,000 on September 25, 2011, and $18,000 on March 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 7 Plaintiff asserted that it spent more than $1.76 million to rebuild. At the jury trial on the breach-of-contract claims, Joe Ariss, plaintiff's claims-adjusting expert, testified that the policy rendered defendant liable for $1,603,648 on the building repair claim. The unrebutted evidence shows that defendant paid plaintiff $1,046,964 on that claim: $40,000 on September 25, 2011; $100,000 on November 28, 2011; $531,263 on March 19, 2012; and two payments of $366,489 and $9212 on June 4, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 8 On December 15, 2016, 5 \u00bd years after the loss, a jury found that defendant had breached the insurance contracts. First, the jury found that defendant owed the remaining $18,643 that plaintiff had claimed for lost rental income. Second, the jury found defendant liable for an additional $118,006 for the building loss, but that award was much less than the amount claimed. Finally, the jury found that Szechwan Garden did not sustain damages under its policy, even though defendant had breached the contract. Defendant paid the judgments entered on the verdicts on December 23, 2016, and did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 9 B. Unreasonable and Vexatious Delay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 10 Over two years, defendant voluntarily paid plaintiff $1,100,964 on its policy, and the timing and amounts of defendant's payments are not disputed. Defendant's first payment, $76,000 for lost income and an advance on the rebuild, was made 48 days after the collapse. Defendant paid an additional $100,000 for the building loss about four months after the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 11 Tim Erickson, one of defendant's claims-adjusters, was responsible for inspecting the building to estimate the scope of damages for purposes of processing the claims. On December 16, 2011, plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to Erickson, stating, in part, \"[d]espite repeated requests, we have not received direction from you, in your capacity as the claims adjuster for [defendant], regarding the process or settlement of this claim. Furthermore, on several occasions you have cancelled appointments with the owner at the site of loss without any prior notice. While my client has received payments from [defendant], there was no detailed explanation as to the allocation of payments, as they relate to the various coverage's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], nor a determination of the overall claim amounts.\" Counsel informed defendant that plaintiff had retained an engineer. He also submitted a sworn statement of proof of loss to facilitate settlement of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 12 On January 12, 2012, Daniel Slouka, one of defendant's adjusters, responded in part that \"[a]t this time we are holding the submitted Proof of Loss in abeyance pending the completion of our investigation of the damages sustained to the building. However, please note that we are not in agreement with [the] claim as quantified in the Proof of Loss and accompanying estimates.\" Defendant requested copies of plaintiff's engineering report and architectural plans, but did not indicate when its\n   investigation would be complete or why it was \"not in agreement\" with the proof-of-loss statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 13 On February 14, 2012, plaintiff's counsel responded to Slouka, stating, in part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"I am writing in regards to an apparent lack of direction, follow-through, and communications from your company regarding this claim, which has put my client in a difficult financial position, and in our opinion may give rise to a claim of Bad Faith processing of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The property damage occurred on August 8, 2011. On August 23rd my client sent you a written request for direction on processing the claim and notice that he would start mitigating his damages by commencing demolition on August 26th. At the verbal request of your adjuster, my client did not start demolition, and an on-site meeting with my client and your adjuster was scheduled for September 9th. The adjuster failed to appear at the scheduled meeting. On September 16th I sent a letter demanding written acknowledgement of coverage and notice that my client would begin demolition on September 19th. We received no response to these requests, and your claims adjuster also failed to appear at the next scheduled on-site meeting on October 13th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   While receiving no direction regarding the processing of this claim, pursuant to the policy, on December 17th, we submitted to [defendant] our Sworn Statement on Proof of Loss along with copies of the quotes we received from contractors. On January 12, 2012, you provided a response to our letter of [December] 17th indicating that you were holding our Proof of Loss in abeyance pending your investigation, and requesting that we provide a copy of our engineer's report within fourteen days (which was provided in the time frame demanded).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   While we understand your duty to investigate the claim, we cannot understand the delay in your investigation. The loss occurred in early August, and it is now mid-February. There has been more than adequate time to complete your investigation. Pursuant to the policy conditions, we are requesting that you either accept or reject our proof of loss.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 On March 12, 2012, seven months after the loss, plaintiff filed a complaint with the Illinois Department of Insurance, alleging late payment by defendant. A week later, defendant paid an additional $18,000 for business loss and $531,263 for building loss. The building loss payment contained a notation of \"Balance ACV building,\" which the trial court interpreted to mean \"actual cash value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 On June 28, 2012, Slouka responded by letter that plaintiff's proof-of-loss statement was being returned as premature because plaintiff had not completed the repairs or ascertained the final cost. Defendant also objected to plaintiff's proof-of-loss statement as excessive and not reflecting the true amount of damages as defendant believed them to be at the time. Defendant directed plaintiff to give notice when the repairs were completed so defendant could conduct a final inspection and review the final expenses that plaintiff actually incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 Erickson admitted in a deposition that he stopped working on the matter in July 2012, without completing the inspection or estimate. Gerald Long, defendant's director of claims, confirmed in his deposition that Erickson's task was to inspect the property, determine the scope of the damage, and estimate the cost of repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 On November 9, 2012, plaintiff filed its original complaint, alleging improper\n   claims practice ( 215 ILCS 5/154.6, 155 (West 2012) ), violations of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act ( 815 ILCS 505/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2012) ), and unreasonable and vexatious delay in settling the claims ( 215 ILCS 5/155 (West 2012) ). The complaint alleged the causes of action on behalf of plaintiff and Szechwan Garden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 Defendant made its final pretrial payments of $366,489 and $9212 on June 4, 2013, which was 7 months after the original complaint, 1 year and 10 months after the loss, and 11 months after Szechwan Garden reopened for business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 On December 5, 2016, four years after the original complaint, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which substituted breach-of-contract claims for the consumer fraud claims. The jury found that defendant breached the contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 The third amended complaint also alleged that defendant engaged in unreasonable and vexatious conduct by (1) failing to promptly acknowledge plaintiff's pertinent communications with respect to the claims; (2) failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of the claims; (3) not attempting in good faith to effectuate the prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of the claims, on which liability had become reasonably clear; (4) compelling plaintiff to sue to recover amounts due under its policy, by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered; (5) failing to affirm or deny coverage of the claims within a reasonable time after the proof-of-loss statement was submitted; and (6) failing to pay undisputed amounts owed under the policy. Plaintiff requested a finding that defendant had committed unfair claims practices in an unreasonable and vexatious manner and a statutory penalty and attorney fees under section 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 At the bench trial on the section 155 claims, Jim Radecki, a claims-adjusting expert for plaintiff, testified that defendant did not properly process the claims. He opined that Erickson's job was to prepare a damage estimate for the building and personal property, but that he failed to do so. Without a complete estimate, defendant could not calculate its liability, which resulted in breach of the contracts. In other words, the policy placed the burden of determining liability on defendant, but defendant improperly tried to shift the burden to plaintiff. Defendant did not present any expert testimony to rebut Radecki's characterization of the policy. Instead, defendant simply argued that the proof-of-loss statement prepared by plaintiff was excessive, and therefore a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute precluded sanctions under section 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22 On March 24, 2017, the trial court entered judgment for plaintiff on its claims under section 155. The court found that plaintiff encountered unnecessary difficulties from defendant's withholding policy benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court cited the two letters from plaintiff's counsel on December 16, 2011, and February 14, 2012, asking defendant to complete its investigation for purposes of settling the building claims. The court also commented that plaintiff had to resort to filing a complaint with the Department of Insurance to compel defendant to either pay the amount requested or indicate an amount that was acceptable. The court concluded that the delay in settling the claims was vexatious because there was no\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute about coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24 The court also credited plaintiff's argument that defendant's correspondence on January 12, 2012, and June 28, 2012, was evidence of improper claims practice\n   under sections 154.6 and 155 of the Insurance Code ( 215 ILCS 5/154.6, 155 (West 2012) ) and section 919.50(a)(1) of title 50 of the Illinois Administrative Code ( 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.50(a)(1) (2004) ). In the letters, defendant (1) informed plaintiff that its claims would be \"held in abeyance\" pending completion of defendant's inspection and (2) rejected plaintiff's proof of loss without providing a lower offer to adjudicate the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 25 Based on this evidence, the trial court found that defendant had engaged in unreasonable and vexatious delay in settling the claims. The trial court awarded plaintiff $27,692 for \"other costs,\" $48,784 for attorney fees, and $30,697 in penalties under section 155 of the Insurance Code. The court also awarded $24,148 in prejudgment interest. See 815 ILCS 205/2 (West 2012). Defendant's timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 26 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 27 On appeal, defendant challenges the trial court's finding of unreasonable and vexatious delay under section 155 of the Insurance Code.

In contrast, defendant asks us to parse the judgment and use less deferential standards to review discrete findings. For example, the trial court found that no\n   <em>\n    bona\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fide\n   </em>\n   dispute precluded section 155 sanctions, and defendant advocates the manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard for reviewing that finding.

However, most of the facts are not in dispute, because defendant did not present expert testimony to rebut plaintiff's expert. Accordingly, we simply review the trial court's ultimate decision to award relief under section 155 for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 35 We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant's delay in settling the claims was unreasonable and vexatious and worthy of sanctions under section 155. When plaintiff submitted its statement of proof of loss, defendant held it in abeyance pending completion of its inspection, then rejected it as premature because the rebuild was not complete. Less than a month later, defendant pulled Erickson, the adjuster, off the project without completing a final estimate of loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 36 The trial court reasonably relied on the unrebutted testimony of plaintiff's expert, who opined that defendant should have completed the inspection and promptly adjusted the claims. Despite the parties' apparent disagreement over the cost of the project, the expert testified that it was incumbent on defendant to estimate the damages and propose a settlement amount, which is consistent with section 919.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 37 Section 919.50 requires an insurer to affirm or deny liability on a claim within\n   a reasonable time and to offer payment within 30 days after affirmation of liability, if the amount of the claim is determined and not in dispute. For those portions of the claim that are not in dispute and for which the payee is known, the insurer shall tender payment within said 30 days. On first-party claims, if a settlement offer is less than the amount claimed, or if the claim is denied, the insurer shall provide to the insured a reasonable written explanation of the basis of the lower offer or denial within 30 days after the investigation and determination of liability is completed. The explanation shall clearly set forth the policy definition, limitation, exclusion, or condition upon which the lower offer or denial was based. 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.50(a)(1) (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 38 Under section 919.50, the parties' disagreement over plaintiff's proof-of-loss statement required defendant to provide a reasonable written explanation within 30 days after the investigation and determination of liability was completed. 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.50(a)(1) (2004). Defendant neither offered a written explanation for a denial nor completed the investigation and determination of liability. As the trial court correctly observed, evidence of such improper claims practices is relevant and tends to support a section 155 claim.\n   <em>\n    Zagorski v.

The trial court disagreed. The long duration of the negotiations, and defendant's stalling tactics that plagued them, support the court's conclusion that the delay was unreasonable and vexatious. If insurance claims were commonly handled as defendant did this one, an insured would be compelled to repair the damage without knowing the extent to which the insurer would cover the cost. Plaintiff's expert's opinion comports with common sense that an insurer owes a duty of good faith and fair dealing to provide an estimate so the insured can proceed knowing the scope of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 40 Finally, we grant plaintiff's request, under section 155, for a remand for the trial court to assess and award reasonable attorney fees and costs that plaintiff incurred in defending the posttrial motion and this appeal. At oral argument, defendant objected to a remand for this purpose, but we conclude that plaintiff's request is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 41 The trial court heard the posttrial motion and therefore is in the best position to assess the reasonableness of the fees and costs incurred for that proceeding. Furthermore, when the appellate court determines that section 155 sanctions are appropriate, as in this case, a remand is appropriate for the trial court to determine and award litigation expenses associated with the appeal.

Of course, the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   rule \"applies with equal force to private litigants in civil cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 526,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Ill.%20Dec.%20636\">\n    249 Ill.Dec. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20N.E.2d%201074\">\n    736 N.E.2d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, I do not see the use of the \"manifestly erroneous\" standard in this case as inappropriate or prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 50 The majority notes that, where a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute concerning coverage exists, sanctions pursuant to section 155 are inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Thus, the inverse must also be true: where a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute concerning coverage\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   exist, sanctions pursuant to section 155 are\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   . The trial court found that defendant's delay in settling the claims was unreasonable, vexatious, and worthy of sanctions under section 155. This clearly fits within the definition of a mixed question of law and fact. As we have established, \"[A] mixed question of law and fact is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Eschbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20111179\">\n    2012 IL App (2d) 111179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20Ill.%20Dec.%20819\">\n    364 Ill.Dec. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20N.E.2d%20308\">\n    977 N.E.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court's finding was made after an evidentiary hearing involving fact-finding and credibility determinations; a decision following such a hearing will not be reversed unless it is manifestly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Beaman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614892\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/229/56/#p72\">\n    229 Ill. 2d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Ill.%20Dec.%20778\">\n    321 Ill.Dec. 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20N.E.2d%20500\">\n    890 N.E.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the \"manifestly erroneous\" standard, I submit that the court's finding with regard to the lack of a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute was not arbitrary or unreasonable and was based on the evidence; thus, it was not manifestly erroneous. I also submit that the nature and extent of the remedy provided, reviewed for an abuse of discretion, were not improper.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As does caselaw, I use the phrases \"manifestly erroneous\" and \"clearly erroneous\" interchangeably.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
