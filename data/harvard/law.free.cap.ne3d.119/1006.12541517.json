This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Kathleen Wyatt left a wedding reception at Roses Run Country Club (\"Roses Run\") at approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 1, 2015. The lights in the parking lot had not been turned on, and the area outside the reception location was illuminated only by ambient light from the nearby buildings. As Ms. Wyatt retraced\n   the path that she had followed from her car earlier in the day, she missed the curb at the end of a walkway and fell to the ground, landing on her left knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ms. Wyatt sued Roses Run and its corporate owner, Lockhart Development Company (\"Lockhart\"), alleging that she sustained injuries as a result of Roses Run's negligent failure to illuminate the parking lot. Specifically, she alleged that failure to turn on the parking lot light fixtures violated a municipal ordinance and established negligence per se or, in the alternative, that Roses Run had a duty to warn its patrons about the darkness in the parking lot because it amounted to a latent danger. Ms. Wyatt alleged that Lockhart Development was ultimately liable for the negligent acts of Roses Run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court granted summary judgment to Roses Run and Lockhart Development, concluding that both the darkness in the parking lot and the curb over which Ms. Wyatt tripped were open and obvious dangers. Ms. Wyatt appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} As an initial matter, this Court notes that Ms. Wyatt's brief does not comply with App.R. 16(A), App.R. 12(A)(2) and Loc.R. 7(B) and (F), which require that the appellant's brief contain a statement of the assignments of error. App.R. 16(A)(3) ; Loc.R. 7(B)(3). The appellant must then separately argue each assignment of error, including supporting authority and citations to the record. App.R. 16(A)(7) ; Loc.R. 7(B)(7).

Section 1182.04 describes the lighting standards for construction within the City of Stow, and it states its aim specifically: \"The intent of this section is to focus on the actual physical effects of lighting and its potential impact on the surrounding neighborhood.\" The Ordinance then addresses design standards and maximum lighting levels designed to minimize the adverse impacts of light fixtures on surrounding properties.

She did not base her claim in the trial\n   court on the premise that the curb from which she fell was negligently designed or maintained. With that as context, the material facts in this case are undisputed. Ms. Wyatt attended a wedding reception at Roses Run that started before the dinner hour, and she left around 10:00 p.m. When she arrived, it was daylight. Ms. Wyatt walked from her car across the parking lot to the sidewalk and followed the sidewalk to the reception area with nothing obstructing her view. The path that she took into the reception area included a curb. When she left the reception, the parking lot was dark; the ambient light from nearby buildings provided the only illumination in the area. Ms. Wyatt walked cautiously toward the parking lot into an area of complete darkness, following the same general route that she had used to enter the reception facility. Ms. Wyatt stepped off of the curb and fell to her knee, but she noted that her foot did not catch on anything before she fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Ms. Wyatt argues that the trial court erred by concluding that the curb was an open and obvious hazard in this case because, according to her reasoning, there is always a genuine issue of material fact when a curb is the same color as the pavement that surrounds it. This is not an accurate statement of the law. Some cases have concluded that when a plaintiff falls over an\n   <em>\n    object\n   </em>\n   that is the same color as the surrounding surface, a genuine issue of material fact exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lovejoy v.

Many other cases, however, consider the color of the object to be one aspect of the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Horner v.

Franklin No. 01AP-1054,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-2880\">\n    2002-Ohio-2880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201224969\">\n    2002 WL 1224969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22. The fact that the curb from which Ms. Wyatt fell was the same color as the surrounding asphalt, therefore, is not dispositive. There is nothing in the record that would indicate that the curb was concealed by its surroundings, in a state of disrepair, or in a location in which one would not expect to encounter a curb. Ms. Wyatt traversed the same path from the parking lot to the reception facility only hours before her fall and did not dispute the presence of the curb at the end of the sidewalk. Under these circumstances, the curb at the end of the sidewalk was observable to a reasonable person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Ms. Wyatt's central argument is that the darkness itself was a hidden danger and that Roses Run had a duty to warn its patrons accordingly. This Court has rejected this premise in the past, noting that \"darkness is an open and obvious condition and under Ohio law, one may not disregard darkness.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirksey v. Summit Cty.

Notably, Ms. Wyatt and her companion continued into the darkness without illuminating the area, although Ms. Wyatt noted that her friend eventually tried to shed\n   light on the path using her mobile phone, but did so just as Ms. Wyatt fell. In doing so, she continued in disregard of the open and obvious hazard of darkness.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20518373\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The darkness was also not, as Ms. Wyatt suggests, an attendant circumstance that creates a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the curb was an open and obvious hazard. \"[D]arkness due to lack of illumination at nighttime is not an attendant circumstance\" for purposes of the open-and-obvious doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler v.
