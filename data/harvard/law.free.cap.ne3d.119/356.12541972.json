When reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \"we consider the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oberle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462694\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/539/#p547\">\n    476 Mass. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (2017). \"The inferences that support a conviction 'need only be reasonable and possible; [they] need not be necessary or inescapable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461215\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/295/#p303\">\n    90 Mass.

When a police officer tried to effectuate a stop, the defendant backed up towards the police cruiser and had to be told several times to stop. The defendant's eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. The defendant said, \"Oh, God, you got me. I'm in trouble.\" When asked how much he had had to drink, he said, \"Oh man, I'm fucked.\" The defendant staggered when exiting the vehicle and staggered when attempting to perform field sobriety tests, as is shown by the surveillance video. These \"classic symptoms of alcohol intoxication\" provided sufficient evidence to convict the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20385\">\n    91 Mass.

The officer recovered four unopened nip bottles of flavored vodka from the defendant's car, which were admitted into evidence without objection. A judge may admit evidence \"where its prejudicial effect does not substantially outweigh its probative value,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Imbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553187\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/335/#p585\">\n    479 Mass. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 585 (2018), and we will not disturb the judge's ruling \"absent palpable error.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20487\">\n    92 Mass.

Because the defendant did not object, we review any error for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

App. Ct. 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (2016). A defendant's possession of nip bottles of alcohol, uniquely useful for quick and surreptitious alcohol consumption, is a recognized \"sign of alcohol use.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flanagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835954\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/456/\">\n    76 Mass.

Accordingly, there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Closing argument\n   </em>\n   . \"Closing argument must be limited to discussion of the evidence presented and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%2022\">\n    478 Mass. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (2017). \"Counsel may, however, zealously argue in favor of those inferences favorable to his or her case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor's closing argument at trial, we review [any error] for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%2067\">\n    94 Mass.

Nonetheless, in light of the strength of the Commonwealth's case and the permissibility of pointing out the implausibility of the defense in a proper manner, we discern no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.
