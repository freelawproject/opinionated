Linares sued both the food truck operator, El Tacarajo, LLC, and the salvage business, U-Pull-and-Pay, LLC doing business as Pic-A-Part (\"UPAP\"), for negligence. Linares appeals the entry of summary judgment for UPAP, raising one issue for our review: whether summary judgment was inappropriate because UPAP owed Linares a duty regarding dangerous activities on its property or, in the alternative, because UPAP was engaged in a joint venture with El Tacarajo and is vicariously liable for its negligent acts. Concluding UPAP did not owe Linares a duty and was not engaged in a joint venture with El Tacarajo, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment to UPAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] UPAP is an automobile salvage business in Indianapolis, Indiana. In the course of its business, flammable materials are sometimes brought onto UPAP's property when junk cars come into the salvage yard. Brian Brownstein, a UPAP assistant store manager on duty when this incident occurred, explained that when UPAP buys a car, it drains the fluids as part of preparing the car to \"be out in the yard area where customers can pull parts[.]\" Appendix of Appellant, Volume II at 135. In addition, UPAP sometimes comes across propane tanks or other flammable materials that have been left in cars: \"we go to the auto return auction which tends to have repossessions. People don't have time to take their belongings out of the car, or it was in a serious accident ... there might have been like a tank in the trunk that they didn't know about[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137. UPAP's employees have been trained in how to handle the flammable materials they come across and the company keeps flammables like aerosols, gasoline, and propane in a flame-retardant cabinet to promote safety at the salvage yard. UPAP also posts warnings and instructions for customers and checks customers' bags and tool boxes as they enter to ensure they have not brought any tools or other materials onto the lot that could lead to fires or explosions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] El Tacarajo operated a food truck that occasionally sold Mexican food from UPAP's parking lot in 2014 and 2015. Brownstein stated that this arrangement was \"a handshake deal\" that had been set up when El Tacarajo approached a previous manager and asked if it could come on site to sell food.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. UPAP's local store managers knew that El Tacarajo would sell food from the parking lot on busy days, usually Saturdays and Sundays, but UPAP had \"no expectation\" about when they would come; \"[i]t was just like whenever.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 154 (Dan Ulrich, general manager for UPAP's eastern stores, stating El Tacarajo would \"come in and sell some food and leave. Come and go as they please.\"). El Tacarajo paid UPAP $ 25.00 per day on at least some of the days they set up in UPAP's parking lot, but Brownstein was \"not sure\n   [the payments] were made every time[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] UPAP never asked if El Tacarajo was licensed to sell food. UPAP did not ask El Tacarajo whether it had fire safety procedures in place for using gasoline or propane to operate its truck. In fact, Brownstein stated at his deposition that he never had contact with anyone at the food truck. Ulrich noted that El Tacarajo was \"not one of our vendors to where we would be checking all of their identifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154. UPAP was not aware of any prior incidents involving an explosion, fire, or other dangerous condition created by a food truck, gas generator, or grill on its premises at any time prior to June 20, 2015. Neither UPAP nor El Tacarajo was aware of any dangerous condition of the food truck or its equipment that would have or could have caused an explosion at any time prior to June 20, 2015. Linares, who was a regular customer of UPAP and who had purchased food from El Tacarajo several times before, stated that he had no reason to believe the food truck was dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] On June 20, 2015, El Tacarajo was on UPAP's property selling food from its food truck. The food truck was positioned in the customer parking lot next to a concrete wall partitioning the parking lot from the salvage yard. Linares also visited UPAP on that date to purchase automobile glass. After making his purchase from UPAP, Linares ordered food from El Tacarajo. As he waited for his food, the food truck suddenly exploded and caught fire. Linares was injured and taken by ambulance to Eskenazi Hospital for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [6] The Indianapolis Fire Department determined the explosion was caused by the ignition of gas fumes from an open cooking flame. The Marion County Public Health Department made similar findings, concluding that an El Tacarajo employee caused the explosion when, in order to refill a generator, he opened a can of gasoline too close to a flattop grill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [7] On June 15, 2016, Linares filed his complaint against UPAP\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and El Tacarajo, alleging in Count One that El Tacarajo was negligent in its handling of combustible fuels, in failing to have a license from the Marion County Health Department, in failing to train its employees, and in failing to inspect its truck and equipment. Count Two alleged UPAP was negligent in failing to monitor or inspect El Tacarajo's operations, failing to determine whether El Tacarajo was properly licensed, and failing to study the food truck's safety procedures. Count Two also alleged UPAP was vicariously liable for El Tacarajo's negligent acts because it was engaged in a joint venture with El Tacarajo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [8] During discovery, UPAP served requests for admissions on El Tacarajo, asking El Tacarajo to admit: El Tacarajo did not share profits with UPAP; UPAP did not pay El Tacarajo to market or sell food to UPAP's customers; UPAP and El Tacarajo were not engaged in a joint venture; and UPAP did not control any aspect of El Tacarajo's business or operations. Despite participating in this litigation by, for instance, filing an appearance, filing an answer and jury demand, and attending depositions, El Tacarajo did not respond to the requests for admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [9] UPAP then filed a motion for summary judgment arguing first that UPAP had no duty to protect Linares from the unforeseeable actions of El Tacarajo and second that it was not vicariously liable for\n   the negligent acts of El Tacarajo. Following a hearing, the trial court granted UPAP's motion for summary judgment and finding no just reason for delay, entered final judgment in favor of UPAP. Linares timely filed a notice of appeal on February 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Linares first filed his complaint against El Tacarajo and Parts Landlord, LLC d/b/a Pic a Part but later amended his complaint to identify UPAP d/b/a Pic a Part as the proper defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Discussion and Decision\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    I.

On appeal, the parties disagreed over whether section 343 or the foreseeability analysis should be applied: the plaintiff argued she was injured because the lack of lighting which contributed to her attack is a condition of the land, whereas the promoter argued she was injured by an assailant not by, for instance, stepping in a hole and therefore she was injured because of activities occurring on the land.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12358546\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/81/688/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12358546\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/81/688/\">\n     at 694-95\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This situation is similar: although it was the stove in the food truck on UPAP's property igniting that caused the explosion, Linares's injuries resulted from the\n    <em>\n     activities\n    </em>\n    of El Tacarajo's employees in relation to that stove. Therefore, the foreseeability analysis must be applied to determine if a duty exists at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    [20] Despite claiming his injuries were caused by a condition of the land, and despite further claiming that the foreseeability analysis should not apply because this case does not involve a criminal or intentional act, Linares does address the foreseeability analysis. He advocates that in this case, the test requires considering whether \"a gasoline explosion or fire on UPAP's property that could harm its customers\" was foreseeable and concludes that it was. Appellant's Br. at 15. In support of his argument, Linares notes that flammable materials regularly come onto UPAP's property; that its employees are trained in safety hazards connected with collecting, storing, and handling those materials; and that it takes steps to prevent customers from using ignition sources in the yard; therefore, UPAP was at least theoretically aware of the hazards associated with flammable materials.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Linares's reliance on UPAP's policies and procedures related to its own business are irrelevant\n    for purposes of this analysis because it was not the activities surrounding\n    <em>\n     UPAP's\n    </em>\n    business that caused Linares's injuries. In other words, Linares was not injured by an explosion of flammable materials that belonged to or were the responsibility of UPAP. For this reason, we also disagree with Linares that the \"broad type of harm\" is\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    explosion on UPAP's premises.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    [21] Although the foreseeability analysis for determining duty is a consideration of the\n    <em>\n     broad\n    </em>\n    \"zone of danger\" that could be caused by activities on the land (as opposed to the more specific \"zone of danger\" addressed by proximate cause), we do not conduct the analysis in the\n    <em>\n     broadest\n    </em>\n    terms possible. For instance, in\n    <em>\n     Goodwin\n    </em>\n    , the court identified the broad type of harm as \"the probability of a criminal attack, namely: a shooting inside a bar.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137688\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/62/384/#p392\">\n     62 N.E.3d at 393\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, it is clear that we do not completely divorce this analysis from the circumstances; if we were to do so, the broad type of harm in\n    <em>\n     Goodwin\n    </em>\n    would have been described as simply the probability of an altercation between two bar patrons.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estate of Staggs ex rel.

True, UPAP was generally aware that flammable liquids and open flames can interact explosively and therefore had a duty to protect its invitees from explosions due to the materials that belonged to it. But for purposes of the foreseeability analysis, the type of plaintiff is a patron of a business and the broad type of harm is the probability or likelihood that an independently operated food truck on the premises of that business would explode or catch fire due to employee error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    [23] No one-not UPAP, not El Tacarajo, and not Linares himself-believed or had any reason to believe the food truck was defective or dangerous. Had UPAP inspected the food truck, as Linares believes it should have, first, it is unclear what UPAP, as a salvage business, would have been qualified to inspect for, and second, there\n    <em>\n     still\n    </em>\n    would not have been any reason to believe the food truck was defective, because it was not in fact a defect that caused the explosion but rather human error. As for UPAP's alleged failure to inquire about El Tacarajo's license, the record indicates as of August 2014, El Tacarajo had an expired certified food handler certificate and an unpaid licensing fee. It is not clear that remained true as of the date of this incident and further, the licensing requirement apparently had no bearing on safe operation of the food truck, only the safe handling of food. Finally, there was no designated evidence to suggest UPAP had knowledge of any food truck explosions anywhere in the past, let alone any of the same or similar nature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    [24] Should food trucks be inspected? Probably. Should UPAP have taken more interest in a mobile business it allowed to operate on its premises and sell to its customers? Possibly. But should a company in a completely unrelated private business which periodically provides a parking space be required to conduct that inspection and ensure the food truck is safely\n    maintained and its employees properly trained? Even if UPAP had asked the questions Linares and the dissent argue it should have, it still would not have been reasonably foreseeable to UPAP that the food truck would suddenly explode because of an employee's negligence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    [25] In a recent case, this court considered whether a lake owner had a duty to protect a swimmer from contracting a rare brain infection caused by an amoeba found naturally in fresh water.\n    <em>\n     Daviess-Martin Cty.

In that case, the landowner's obligation was to provide a safe lake and yet the court found there was no duty and reversed the trial court's denial of summary judgment in favor of the landowners. Here, we are reviewing the grant of summary judgment where the defendant is several steps removed from being directly responsible for the instrument causing damage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    [26] Focusing on the harm inflicted on Linares when an employee of a food truck UPAP occasionally allowed onto its property-an employee whose job it was to operate a mobile food truck that relies on a generator to power its operations-fueled the generator in too close proximity to an open flame, we conclude that such harm was not normally to be expected and thus was not reasonably foreseeable by UPAP. Linares' injury is unfortunate, but UPAP did not owe him a duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Vicarious Liability\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    [27] Linares also advanced a claim for vicarious liability alleging UPAP and El Tacarajo were engaged in a joint venture. \"As in a partnership, the parties to a joint venture are jointly and severally liable.\"\n    <em>\n     DLZ Indiana, LLC v.

Our\n    review of the designated materials reveals that to the extent there was an agreement between El Tacarajo and UPAP, and to the extent such agreement may have been mutually beneficial, it is undisputed that any such agreement did not provide for mutual control over the venture. El Tacarajo unilaterally decided when to go to UPAP's premises to sell its food, who to employ, what food it would offer, and how much it would charge. UPAP unilaterally decided where on its property El Tacarajo could park and it could have told El Tacarajo to leave on any given day or to leave and never return. No decisions were made jointly by UPAP and El Tacarajo in regard to the food truck operation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    [29] In addition, it is undisputed that even if El Tacarajo occasionally paid UPAP for use of its parking lot, it always paid $ 25.00 and that amount had no relationship to the profits El Tacarajo earned during a given sales day.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walker v.
