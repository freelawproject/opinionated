The State contends that the warrant was supported by probable cause developed in a series of controlled buys and that, even if probable cause was lacking, the officers acted in good faith and the exclusionary rule should not apply. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] During April of 2018, Investigator Tyler Parks of the Delaware County Sheriff's Office (\"Officer Parks\"), assisted by a confidential informant (\"CI\"), was involved in three state-sponsored buys of cocaine. On April 13, April 20, and April 23, 2018, CI was searched and provided with photocopied money. On each occasion, CI contacted an individual described by law enforcement as the \"Target.\" (Tr. at 17.) On the first occasion, Target went to a hotel before providing CI with cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the second occasion, Target went to a residence before providing CI with cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] On the third occasion, Target was picked up at a residence and driven to a street corner, where he exited the vehicle and began to walk north. Target was under police surveillance at that time, but the visual surveillance was interrupted for a\n   short time. When visual surveillance was restored, officers observed Target leaving Vance's residence. Target provided CI with 1.5 grams of cocaine. Target was then taken back to the residence where he had been picked up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] Officer Parks executed an affidavit of probable cause for a search warrant of an address on Turner Street. He stated that \"This house has an occupant of Dustin [sic] Vance aka (dustball).\" (App. Vol. II, pg. 44.) The affidavit represented that members of the Delaware County Narcotics Unit had conducted \"controlled cocaine purchases\" and these were \"from the same unnamed target.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.) The search warrant for Vance's residence was granted and, upon its execution, officers found cocaine and marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] The State charged Vance with Possession of Cocaine\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Maintaining a Common Nuisance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vance moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the execution of the search warrant, alleging that material facts had been omitted from the affidavit for a search warrant and the warrant was unsupported by probable cause. At the suppression hearing, conducted on July 5, 2018, Vance elicited evidence to show that he was not Target and Target had not been searched as part of the state-sponsored buys. Vance argued that the affidavit for the search warrant omitted this material information and that the State had, in fact, conducted what was \"really an uncontrolled buy.\" (Tr. at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    An undercover officer was providing transportation to Target on this occasion.

He contended that the remaining asserted facts (Target had exited Vance's residence before giving CI cocaine and the residence had previously been associated with illicit drugs) did not amount to probable cause to support the search of his residence. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and agreed with Vance that police had conducted inadequate controlled buys, in that Target had not been searched. Based upon this factual development, the trial court found a lack of probable cause and granted Vance's motion to suppress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    [8] We have recognized:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    If a defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that \"a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with a reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, ... and, with the affidavit's false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <em>\n     Stephenson v.

Target was transported to, or near, three different locations on three different occasions. Target then supplied cocaine to CI. It is not known whether Target had cocaine on his person prior to visiting any of those locations, because he, unlike the CI, was never searched. It is not known whether Target acquired cocaine near the Turner Street residence he was seen exiting, since visual surveillance was interrupted. Nevertheless, the State claimed that the third transaction was part of a series of \"controlled buys.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    [12] \"A properly conducted controlled buy will permit an inference the defendant had prior possession of a controlled substance.\"\n    <em>\n     Watson v.

A controlled buy occurs when an undercover police officer or a private citizen acting as an agent of the police under strict police\n    supervision and control purchases illegal drugs from a dealer. A controlled buy has been described as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    A controlled buy consists of searching the person who is to act as the buyer, removing all personal effects, giving him money with which to make the purchase, and then sending him into the residence in question.

But the instant circumstances were not those of a previously-searched buyer entering a residence. Police did not maintain strict control in this alleged tri-level (buyer-dealer-source) transaction where the alleged middle-man, who was not searched and did not act as an agent of police, moved about on his own volition and police surveillance was interrupted.

Then, outside the context of the drug buys, the affidavit stated that Vance was an occupant of the Turner Street residence. This permits an inference that Target and Vance were the same person.

The likelihood that evidence of a crime will be found at the home of a dealer is arguably greater than the likelihood that evidence of a crime will be found at a residence he visited. Had the affidavit herein been supplemented with the fact that there were two individuals as opposed to one, it would have been made evident to the issuing magistrate that the Target had no known connection with the Turner Street residence apart from having been seen exiting it before consummating a third drug sale with CI.

First, all three controlled buys followed a consistent pattern.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Target exited the vehicle and\n    entered either a hotel or residence. Upon exiting the structure, the Target returned to the vehicle and dealt the CI a controlled substance. The third controlled buy was no exception. The Target exited the CI's vehicle and entered the Residence. After exiting the Residence, the Target returned to the vehicle and delivered the controlled substance to the CI. Moreover, the affiant averred that through his training and experience he had learned that individuals involved in drug trafficking use residences in which they do not live to store the controlled substances that they sell. Finally, the affiant averred that the Residence is a well-known drug house and has been the subject of a search by the Muncie SWAT on a prior occasion. This evidence leads to the common-sense and logical inference that the Residence was used as a place to store controlled substances. Therefore, the trial court had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed before issuing the search warrant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    [4] Because I would reverse the trial court's order granting Vance's motion to suppress, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-54\">\n     The Majority uses a standard of review which was used by the Indiana Supreme Court to review a trial court's decision regarding a motion to suppress evidence obtained by a warrantless police search; however, this case regards whether the issued search warrant was supported by probable cause. Therefore, the correct standard should give deference to the issuing trial court's determination of probable cause rather than the reviewing trial court's decision on the motion to suppress.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Watkins\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327811\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/85/597/#p603\">\n      85 N.E.3d at 599\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"[W]e give great deference to the prior judge's initial, underlying probable cause finding-affirming if a substantial basis supported it and resolving doubtful cases in favor of upholding the warrant.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-55\">\n     The fact that the Target was never searched by the State before going into the Residence does not prevent these three drug deals from being classified as controlled buys. For a buy to be controlled, only one party,\n     <em>\n      i.e.\n     </em>\n     the CI, will be controlled by law enforcement. A useful if not universally-applicable definition of a controlled buy involves a procedure where \"law enforcement officers search the\n     <em>\n      informant\n     </em>\n     to make sure that she does not have any illegal narcotics before the purchase; officers provide the\n     <em>\n      informant\n     </em>\n     with marked bills with which to purchase the drugs; officers place a body wire on the\n     <em>\n      informant\n     </em>\n     and monitor all conversations during the purchase; the\n     <em>\n      informant\n     </em>\n     is placed under visual surveillance during the purchase; and the\n     <em>\n      informant\n     </em>\n     turns over the contraband to officers immediately after the purchase.\"\n     <em>\n      U.S. v.
