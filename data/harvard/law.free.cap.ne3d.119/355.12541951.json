They began a dating relationship and discovered, roughly one month later, that R.C. was pregnant. R.C. and J.K. moved to Massachusetts in July, 2017, and R.C. gave birth to a son in October, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Shortly after moving to Massachusetts, their relationship grew strained. After one argument in November, 2017, R.C. went to her parents' house with the baby. After R.C. and the baby returned, the baby awoke in the night and needed to be changed. R.C. began to change him, and J.K. insisted on helping. By that time J.K. had consumed between six and twelve beers and R.C. told him that she was not comfortable with him changing the baby after he had been drinking. J.K. pushed her aside and changed the baby. While this was the only instance of unwanted physical contact, R.C. testified that J.K. has \"really, really bad anger issues,\" and blames her for \"almost every bad thing that happens to him in his life.\" J.K. asked R.C. to move out several times, which he refused to do, even though she was the only named tenant on the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In January, 2018, the situation deteriorated rapidly. On Friday, January 5, J.K. and R.C. argued once again. J.K. slammed doors, threw pillows, and shouted that he \"fucking hated\" R.C. as she held their son. J.K. did, however, agree to move out on Sunday, January 7. On Sunday, J.K. picked up most of his things, but left behind several larger items because he didn't have a truck. The two made a plan for him to return the following day, but when R.C. asked J.K. to return his keys to her, he left with a key to her apartment. After leaving, he called her and angrily insisted on keeping the keys. R.C. sought and received permission from her landlord to change the locks, and promptly did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following day, Monday, January 8, J.K. informed R.C. that he was unable to rent a truck to get his things, but would rent one the next day. He visited R.C. and the baby later that day, with R.C.'s permission and her parents present, and told her again that he would not return the keys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The next day, Tuesday, January 9, J.K. again failed to secure a truck. They agreed that J.K. would return at 5 P.M. the following day, and R.C. called U-Haul to ensure that they would have a truck available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The next day, Wednesday, January 10, instead of meeting at the agreed-upon time in the evening, J.K. arrived in the morning while R.C. was at work. When J.K. realized that R.C. had changed her locks, he called R.C. eight times, texted her, and had the Wrentham police call her to gain entry to her apartment. The police accompanied J.K. to retrieve his possessions at 5 P.M. R.C. petitioned the court for a protective order the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"A person seeking an initial protective order under G. L. c. 209A must show that at the time of the application ... she 'suffers from abuse,' i.e., that ... she has a reasonable fear of imminent serious physical harm produced by the defendant's words or actions, viewed in light of the attendant circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834135\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/540/#p544\">\n    75 Mass.

See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The burden was on R.C. to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts justifying the issuance of the order.

She testified that she was in fear of J.K., and that his behavior escalated over time. He slammed doors, threw pillows, and slammed other objects during arguments. J.K. blamed R.C. for his unrelated misfortunes and had outbursts in which he said that he \"fucking hated\" her in front of the child.

J.K. initially refused to leave her apartment, and then refused to turn over his keys. After arranging a time to pick up his belongings, he arrived at her apartment unannounced, at a different time, and repeatedly texted and called her when he discovered that the locks were changed.

When judged by a preponderance of the evidence standard, we cannot say that the judge's factual finding that R.C. was in fear of imminent serious physical harm was unsupported by the evidence, nor can we say that, as a matter of law, her fears were unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Order entered January 25, 2018, affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    At the extension hearing, J.K. was represented by counsel, and R.C. was subject to cross-examination.
