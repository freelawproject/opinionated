We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was as follows. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979). The defendant drove a car in light traffic on a three-lane section of Route 495 on an early evening in June of 2016. In the span of approximately five to seven minutes, she swerved several times out of the right lane and into the breakdown lane. From the right lane, she signaled left, switched to the middle lane, then into the left lane, and back to the middle. Her speed dropped to approximately fifteen miles per hour below the posted speed limit, requiring the car behind her to slow down to avoid a rear-end collision. When a State police trooper activated her vehicle's lights, the defendant stopped in the right travel lane. The trooper approached the car and asked the defendant to move into the breakdown lane. The defendant moved the car farther right, but part of the car still remained in the travel lane. The trooper again asked the defendant to pull into the breakdown lane, which she accomplished on the third attempt. The trooper smelled alcohol on her breath and administered field sobriety tests. The defendant was unable to perform them in the manner requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The Legislature has defined negligent operation of a motor vehicle as the operation of a motor vehicle \"upon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access, or any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees, ... negligently so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered ....\" G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). \"[U]nder the statute, it is not the duration of negligent operation or the proximity of the public but 'the operation of the vehicle itself that is the crime.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ferreira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083995\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/70/32/#p35\">\n    70 Mass. App. Ct. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (2007), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Constantino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276643\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/521/#p526\">\n    443 Mass. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here the evidence of erratic driving was sufficient to prove the elements of the offense of negligent operation of a motor vehicle beyond a reasonable doubt. The car was drifting between lanes. At one point it inexplicably slowed to a speed of fifty miles per hour, a change of speed which required the car behind it to slow substantially to avoid a collision. When the defendant tried to pull into the breakdown lane, half the car remained in the roadway, presenting a danger to any oncoming motorist.

Tracking the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, Instruction 5.240 (2009), the judge instructed the jurors as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The [d]efendant acted negligently if she drove in a way that a reasonable person would not have and by doing so created an unnecessary danger to other people, a danger that she could have avoided by driving more carefully.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"A person can be found to have driven negligently if no accident resulted and even if there was no one else actually on the road to be put in danger.
