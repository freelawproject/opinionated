Marte, was convicted of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, following a bench trial. On appeal, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and claims that the judge committed prejudicial error by admitting in evidence a photograph of the victim's upper arm. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We recite the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676-677 (1979). On April 6, 2016, the defendant and the victim were arguing because the victim would not allow the defendant to use her car. They were standing in close proximity to the victim's car. Ultimately, the defendant slammed the car door on the victim's hand, causing injury to her hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The victim did not testify. The only witness to testify who was present during the incident was Theresa Daudelin, the victim's aunt. Daudelin testified that she was about twenty feet from the parties during the argument, which occurred in her driveway, and that \"[t]here was a lot of yelling.\" She testified that the victim was positioned at the driver's side door of the car, that the victim was \"going into the car\" so as to prevent the defendant from entering the car, and that the defendant was \"directly in front of [the victim's] face.\" Daudelin stated that the defendant \"slammed the door on [the victim,] ... he took the door and went boom, and she had her hand there.\" The victim \"started screaming,\" which prompted Daudelin to take the victim into Daudelin's home and wrap the injured hand. Daudelin then testified that she and the victim reported the incident to the police,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the police took photographs, which Daudelin identified at trial, of the victim's face, \"bruising\" of her upper right arm, and \"more markings\" of her right hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At trial, the defendant moved to exclude the photograph of the bruising of the victim's upper arm because no properly admitted testimony indicated that the bruising was caused by the defendant slamming the car door, and a police officer testified that the photograph was not consistent with an injury resulting from such an incident. The judge admitted the photograph as an exhibit, saying that it will be given \"whatever weight it deserves to get.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case, which was denied. After his motion was denied, the defendant introduced the victim's cellular telephone (cell phone) records showing calls between that telephone and the landline telephone at Daudelin's home on April 6, 2016, in an attempt to show that Daudelin may not have been with the victim on the date of the incident. The defendant then renewed his motion for a required finding at the close of all the evidence, which also was denied. The judge found the defendant guilty of assault and battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   . \"[W]e [first] consider the state of the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth's case to determine ... whether the Commonwealth [had] presented sufficient evidence of the defendant's guilt to submit the case to the jury\" (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536016\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/105/282/#p444\">\n    93 Mass.

App. Ct. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (1983). The victim's injury \"need not have been permanent, but it must have been more than transient and trifling.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898094\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/622/#p627\">\n    396 Mass. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, Daudelin testified that the parties were yelling in very close proximity to each other, that the victim was positioned in the open driver's side door, going into the car, and that the defendant then \"slammed the door on her.\" This testimony was sufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find that the defendant slammed the car door in disregard of the probability that it would make harmful contact with the victim. In addition, a rational trier of fact also could have found that the defendant's conduct caused more than a trifling physical injury based on Daudelin's testimony and the photographic evidence showing marks on the victim's hand days after the incident. Thus, the judge properly denied the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Deterioration\n   </em>\n   . We next consider the defendant's motion at the close of all the evidence, \"to determine whether the Commonwealth's position as to proof deteriorated after it closed its case.\"\n   <em>\n    Alden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536016\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/105/282/#p444\">\n    93 Mass. App. Ct. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918590\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/391/279/#p283\">\n    391 Mass. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (1984). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, deterioration occurs only where the defendant has presented \"contrary evidence ... so overwhelming that no rational [trier of fact] could conclude that the defendant was guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20377\">\n    92 Mass. App. Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381 (2017), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Laughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783438\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/188/#p204\">\n    446 Mass. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude the judge also properly denied the defendant's renewed motion for a required finding of not guilty because the defendant presented no deteriorating evidence. The only evidence that the defendant provided in support of his renewed motion was a set of telephone records showing multiple telephone calls between the landline telephone at Daudelin's home and the victim's cell phone on the date of the incident. The judge could have reasonably attributed the calls to be part of the family's practice of telephoning one another while in different rooms of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Denial of motion to exclude evidence\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also argues on appeal that the judge erred in admitting a photograph of the victim's upper arm in evidence. The defendant moved to exclude the photograph at trial, so we review for prejudicial error. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824091\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/589/#p591\">\n    445 Mass. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (2005). We must determine whether the judge erred and, if so, whether the error was prejudicial.
