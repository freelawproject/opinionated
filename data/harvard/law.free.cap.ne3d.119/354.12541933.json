The defendant claims that his two convictions and consecutive sentences are duplicative and violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution because both arose from the same criminal act. As a result, he asserts, he is entitled to a new trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We briefly summarize the facts of the case. In December, 2005, a van slowly approached the victim while he was on the sidewalk, walking home from the store. The defendant, who was driving the van, lowered his window and accused the victim of withholding information about an earlier attack on the defendant. After saying \"[f]ucking do it\" to the front passenger, the defendant \"slammed\" himself back in his seat. The front passenger then raised a gun and fired it across the defendant, hitting the victim several times. One of the individuals in the van then exited the vehicle and kicked the fallen victim between the legs. The van then drove off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Following a jury trial in 2007, the defendant was convicted as a joint venturer for armed assault with intent to murder under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ), and assault by means of a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant received a nineteen to twenty year sentence for the assault with intent to murder and a consecutive four to five year sentence for the assault by means of a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant's first motion for new trial, filed in February, 2010, raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and challenged the admission of certain evidence. The trial judge denied the motion on the papers. On June 15, 2011, this court affirmed the two convictions and the denial of the motion for new trial. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nieves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201125\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 14, 2017, the defendant filed his second motion for new trial, which is before this court on appeal. In that motion, the defendant claimed that his convictions and consecutive sentences ran afoul of double jeopardy principles because both charges arose from \"the same, single [criminal] act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reason, the defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed that they could only find him guilty of one, but not both, of the charges. The motion was denied by a different judge on December 4, 2017. In a detailed memorandum and order, the motion judge ruled that the defendant's claim of error had been waived by failing to raise the issue on direct appeal or in the first motion for new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the defendant's claims were unpreserved, the motion judge reviewed them \"only to determine if there was error and, if so, then [to] 'determine if a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823323\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/217/#p225\">\n    445 Mass. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (2005), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mamay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886514\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/412/#p418\">\n    407 Mass. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (1990). The motion judge then found that no error occurred and denied the motion. The defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The denial of a motion for new trial is reviewed \"only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiBenedetto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270550\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/657/#p664\">\n    458 Mass. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664 (2011), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wolinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/228/#p235\">\n    431 Mass. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2000).

The motion judge properly determined that the double jeopardy claims were waived, since the defendant failed to raise the issues at trial, in his first motion for new trial, or on direct appeal. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). The motion judge then applied the appropriate standard of review for unpreserved claims. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201298\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/290/#p294\">\n    438 Mass. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294-295 (2002) (in criminal cases unpreserved claims reviewed for error creating substantial risk of miscarriage of justice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion judge denied the second motion for new trial based on the understanding that the defendant had been convicted of the crimes of assault with intent to murder and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury, and cited to\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670114\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/418/#p430\">\n    454 Mass. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430-436 (2009). The defendant, however, was not convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing bodily injury, but was convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. See note 1,\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . We therefore review the defendant's convictions of and separate sentences for assault with intent to murder and assault by means of a dangerous weapon to determine whether they violate double jeopardy protections.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (\n    <em>\n     c\n    </em>\n    ) (i). However, as the Commonwealth notes, the trial transcripts, which were provided in the direct appeal, state that the defendant was tried and convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B. In addition, this court affirmed the conviction of assault by means of a dangerous weapon on direct appeal.
