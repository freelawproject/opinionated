County Court thereafter sentenced defendant \u2014 in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement \u2014 to two consecutive terms of 2 to 4 years in prison and imposed restitution in the amount of approximately $250,000. Defendant now appeals, and appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment upon the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Appellate counsel mistakenly argues that defendant\u2019s guilty plea forecloses any challenge to the severity of the sentence imposed; in fact, such a claim is precluded only where a defendant pleads guilty <em>and </em>validly waives his or her right to appeal <em>(see People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]) \u2014 the latter of which did not occur here. Therefore, we grant counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw and assign new counsel <em>(see People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633, 635-636, 639 [2001]; <em>see also Anders v California, </em>386 US 738, 744 [1967]; <em>Ellis v United States, </em>356 US 674, 675 [1958]).</p>\n<judges id=\"b740-9\">Peters, EJ., Stein, McCarthy, Egan Jr. and Lynch, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"AhBE\">Ordered that the decision is withheld, application to be relieved of assignment granted and new counsel to be assigned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
