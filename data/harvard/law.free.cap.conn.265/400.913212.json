In October, 1999, William Giel, a land surveyor licensed to practice land surveying in this state and a member of the board, filed a complaint with the defendant, the department of consumer protection (department), in which he alleged that the plaintiff was engaged in the unauthorized practice of land surveying in Connecticut. The department thereafter referred the matter to the board. In October, 2000, after investigating Giel\u2019s allegations, the board filed a two count administrative complaint against the plaintiff. In the first count of the complaint, the board alleged that the plaintiff \u201cdid not possess a [certificate of] corporate registration to practice land surveying\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but nevertheless had offered to practice land surveying in this state. In the second count, the board alleged that the plaintiff had \u201cused a title or description in [this state] tending to convey the impression that [it was] a land surveyor.\u201d The board further alleged that such conduct constituted a violation of \u00a7 20-302<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>quently, constituted \u201cgrounds for the issuance of an order of immediate discontinuance\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-307a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 2 la-7 (2), as amended by Public Acts 1999, No. 99-73, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The board held an administrative hearing on the complaint pursuant to \u00a7 20-307a. After that hearing, the board released its final decision and order, in which it found that the plaintiff, a corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, had not obtained a certificate of corporate registration<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that would have allowed it to practice or offer to practice land surveying in this state. The board found that, in March, 2000, the plaintiff had mailed postcards to entities doing business in this state and that those postcards contained the following lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>guage: (1) \u201cWe provide the real estate community a means to contact one source to obtain ALTA/ACSM<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Land Title Surveys anywhere in the United States\u201d; (2) \u201cNational Coordinator [s] of ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey[s]\u201d; (3) \u201cNational coverage using 14,000 licensed surveyors\u201d; and (4) \u201c1-800-SURVEYS.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board found the following additional facts: The plaintiff operates a national network of land surveyors who perform surveys of land located within the state in which the surveyors are licensed. The plaintiff coordinates land surveys in all fifty states. Land surveys are coordinated when a client in need of a commercial land survey contacts the plaintiff. The plaintiff then evaluates the client\u2019s land surveying needs, solicits bids from the land surveyors in its network and selects a surveyor to perform the survey. After the surveyor completes the survey, the plaintiff reviews it for compliance with certain industry standards and other survey standards established by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also reviews the performance of the land surveyor and compares the description and drawings in the completed survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On the basis of the foregoing findings, the board concluded: \u201cThrough its advertising, web site, contracts with Connecticut licensed land surveyors, the [plaintiff] offered to practice land surveying in th[is] state . . . in violation of ... \u00a7 20-302. Further, the [plaintiff] . . . used [a] title or description conveying the impression to Connecticut consumers that it was authorized to provide land surveying services in th[is] [s]tate . . . in violation of ... \u00a7 20-302.\u201d The board thereupon ordered the plaintiff to \u201cimmediately discontinue from offering to practice land surveying ... or using any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>title or description tending to convey the impression [that] it is a land surveyor in th[is] [s]tate . . . unless it has obtained a corporate registration to practice land surveying as provided in Chapter 391 of the General Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In its administrative appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the conduct in which it had engaged or had offered to engage did not, as a matter of law, (1) constitute land surveying, or (2) convey to consumers of this state that it was authorized to perform land surveying in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal, concluding that the board properly had applied the applicable law to the facts. Specifically, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he board could logically conclude that the plaintiffs actions in comparing the information in its file with the survey as provided by the local [land] surveyor was an evaluative function meeting the statutory definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">On appeal, the plaintiff renews its claims that the conduct in which it had engaged or had offered to engage did not, as a matter of law, (1) constitute land surveying, or (2) convey to Connecticut consumers that it was authorized to perform land surveying in this state. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">As a threshold matter, we note that the parties dispute the standard of review. The plaintiff claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>issue of whether its conduct falls within the purview of chapter 391 of the General Statutes is apure question of law and that, because neither this court nor the board previously has interpreted the definition of the term \u201cland surveyor\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 20-299 (2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> appellate review is plenary. The board maintains that administrative findings should be affirmed unless clearly erroneous and that, even if the board\u2019s legal conclusions are at issue, its conclusions should be afforded great deference under circumstances such as those in the present case, in which an agency has expertise in a particular area and has a histoiy of determining factual and legal questions similar to those at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We previously have stated that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . We have determined, [however], that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s [determination] ... is unwarranted when the construction of a statute [is at issue and that construction] has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hasselt </em>v. <em>Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>262 Conn. 416, 422, 815 A.2d 94 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In the present case, neither the plaintiff nor the board claims that the definition of the term \u201cland surveyor\u201d set forth in \u00a7 20-299 (2) has been subjected to judicial scrutiny or the board\u2019s time-tested interpretation. Additionally, our review of the record reveals no prior administrative interpretations or judicial decisions regarding the definition of \u201cland surveyor\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 20-299 (2). Accordingly, we do not accord any par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ticular deference to the board\u2019s conclusions of law and thus plenary review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We next review the board\u2019s legal conclusion that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 20-302, a conclusion with which the trial court agreed. We note that there are two distinct factual premises underlying the board\u2019s legal conclusion. First, the board determined that the plaintiff offered to practice land surveying in this state. Second, the board determined that the plaintiff conveyed the impression that it is authorized to perform land surveying services in this state. Thus, we must review the board\u2019s factual findings vis-\u00e1-vis the premises underlying its legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Certain of the board\u2019s factual findings are relevant to both premises, but the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from them is that the plaintiff <em>does not </em>offer to perform land surveying or convey the impression that it is authorized to perform land surveying services in this state. For example, the plaintiffs advertisement on its postcards that it provides consumers one source to obtain land title surveys and coordinates land surveys, and that it operates a national network of 14,000 licensed land surveyors would not lead a reasonable person to believe that the plaintiff is offering to perform or authorized to perform land surveying services in this state. The same is true for the board\u2019s findings that the plaintiff solicits bids from land surveyors and selects a surveyor to perform the survey. These findings indicate that the plaintiff merely coordinates land surveys by recruiting licensed land surveyors to perform those surveys for its clients. This determination is buttressed by the uncontested evidence adduced at the administrative hearing, which established that the plaintiffs clients are not individual purchasers of residential property but, rather, large corporations that continually engage in commercial real estate transactions throughout the country and that need land surveys performed in multi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>pie jurisdictions. Thus, the plaintiffs clients likely are sophisticated entities that understand the limited nature of the plaintiffs services.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The board\u2019s findings that the plaintiff evaluates the client\u2019s land surveying needs and reviews both the performance of the surveyor and the surveys themselves for internal consistency and compliance with certain standards are the only findings that reasonably could have provided a basis for the board\u2019s legal conclusion. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the board properly applied the law to the facts is based solely on its determination that the plaintiffs act of \u201ccomparing the information in its file with the survey as provided by the local [land] surveyor [constituted] an evaluative function meeting the statutory definition [of \u2018land surveyor\u2019 contained in \u00a7 20-299 (2)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We next review, therefore, the type of evaluative conduct encompassed by \u00a7 20-299 (2). Specifically, we must define \u201cevaluating,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2), and then determine the context in which that term is used. General Statutes \u00a7 20-299 (2) defines a \u201cland surveyor\u201d in relevant part as \u201ca person who is qualified by knowledge of mathematics, physical and applied sciences and the principles of land surveying, and who is licensed under this chapter to practice or offer to practice the profession of land surveying, including, but not limited to: (A) Measuring, evaluating or mapping elevations, topography, planimetric features or land areas of any portion of the earth\u2019s surface . . . (C) measuring, evaluating, mapping, monumenting or otherwise marking on the ground, property boundary lines, interior lot lines of subdivisions, easements, rights-of-way or street lines; (D) measuring, evaluating, mapping or marking on the ground, the horizontal location of existing or proposed buildings, structures or other improvements with respect to property boundary lines, building, setback, zoning or restriction lines, existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>or proposed interior lot lines, easements, rights-of-way or street lines; (E) measuring, evaluating, mapping or reporting the vertical location of existing or proposed buildings, structures or other improvements with respect to vertical reference surfaces, including base flood elevations; (F) measuring, evaluating, mapping or reporting the location of existing or proposed buildings, structures or other improvements or their surrounding topography with respect to flood insurance rate mapping or federal emergency management agency mapping . . . (J) evaluating or designing the horizontal or vertical alignment of roads in conjunction with the layout and mapping of a subdivision; (K) measuring, evaluating or mapping areas under the earth\u2019s surface and the beds of bodies of water . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The term \u201cevaluating\u201d is not defined in chapter 391 of the General Statutes. We therefore look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in the dictionary. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). The term \u201cevaluate\u201d means \u201cto determine or fix the value of\u2019 or \u201cto determine the significance, worth, or condition of ... by careful appraisal and study . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). The context in which the term \u201cevaluating\u201d is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2) indicates that the term \u201cland surveyor,\u201d as defined therein, means a person who has \u201cknowledge of mathematics, physical and applied sciences, and the principles of land surveying,\u201d and who uses such knowledge to evaluate <em>directly </em>the features of land and to report thereon. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-299 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The plaintiffs advertisements and literature, which formed the basis of the board\u2019s findings, do not suggest that the plaintiff uses knowledge of mathematics, science and principles of land surveying to evaluate the land <em>directly. </em>To the contrary, the plaintiff merely reviews the report generated by the land surveyor and compares the description and drawings in the completed survey. The plaintiff, in reviewing reports generated by licensed land surveyors and comparing the descriptions and drawings contained therein, does not engage in the practice of land surveying within the meaning of \u00a7 20-299 (2) inasmuch as the plaintiff is not \u201cevaluating\u201d land directly. Nor would a reasonable person construe the plaintiffs advertisements and literature to convey the impression that it is authorized to do so. Rather, the services that the plaintiff provides for its clients are merely incidental to the actual land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>survey performed by licensed land surveyors. We previously have concluded that conduct that was merely <em>incidental </em>to the performance of an actual environmental survey did not constitute the practice of professional engineering for which the plaintiff company needed a license. See <em>E.I.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Board of Registration for Professional Engineers &amp; Land Surveyors, </em>200 Conn. 145, 150, 509 A.2d 1056 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Moreover, in construing \u00a7 20-299 (2), we are mindful \u201cthat regulatory statutes such as [\u00a7 20-302] are founded upon the sound policy of the protection of public health and safety, as well as the protection of the public against incompetence and fraud.\u201d Id., 149. In the present case, the plaintiffs conduct does not jeopardize public health and safety or subject the public to incompetence and fraud because any land survey that the plaintiff obtains for its clients is performed by a licensed land surveyor and any changes to a survey that the plaintiff suggests must be approved by a licensed land surveyor.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the board improperly concluded that the plaintiff offered to perform land surveying or conveyed the impression that it was authorized to practice land surveying in this state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court improperly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> The board is a division of the defendant, the state department of consumer protection (department).

See Public Acts 2000, No. 00-192, \u00a7\u00a7 53, 102. Prior to July 1, 2000, \u00a7 20-299 (2) defined the term \u201cland surveyor\u201d as \u201ca person who engages in the practice of that branch of engineering commonly known as land surveying and includes surveying and measuring the area of any portion of the earth\u2019s surface, the lengths and directions of the bounding lines and the contour of the surface, for their correct determination and description and for conveyancing or for recording, or for the establishment or reestablishment of land boundaries and the plotting of land and subdivisions of land, and like measurements and operations involved in the surveying of mines . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 20-299 (2). Thus, prior to July 1,2000, the definition of \u201cland surveyor\u201d did not include the term \u201cevaluating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Although the board rendered its decision on June 12, 2001, slightly less than one year after the new definition became effective, its conclusion that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 20-302 was based on its assessment of conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the new definition. Thus, it would seem that the definition of \u201cland surveyor\u201d in effect prior to July 1, 2000, should be the applicable definition for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff violated \u00a7 20-302. We nevertheless apply the new definition for several reasons. First, the board applied the new definition in addressing the issue of whether the plaintiff violated \u00a7 20-302 and the trial court applied the new definition in reviewing the board\u2019s decision. Second, both parties relied on the new definition in their briefs and at oral argument. Third and most importantly, the board\u2019s final order was prospective only; the board ordered the plaintiff to <em>\u201cdiscontinue . . </em>. offering to practice land surveying ... or using any title or description tending to convey the impression that it is a land surveyor in th[is] state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the board\u2019s June 12, 2001 order restricted the plaintiffs future conduct, to which the new definition applies, but did not penalize the plaintiff for any conduct occurring prior to July 1, 2000, it would serve no useful puipose to analyze the issue under the old definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> We note that the board also claims that the reports that the plaintiff produces for its clients fall within the ambit of \u201creporting\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2) in the same manner that the plaintiffs acts of evaluating the client\u2019s surveying needs and reviewing the surveyor\u2019s performance and the survey itself fall within the ambit of \u201cevaluating,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2). We similarly reject this claim. The term \u201creporting\u201d contained in \u00a7 20-299 (2) is used in the same context as the term \u201cevaluating.\u201d Specifically, the term \u201creporting,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2), refers to the act of <em>directly </em>reporting on the location of buildings, structures or other improvements, or their surrounding topography. The plaintiffs act of compiling information previously reported by a licensed land surveyor clearly does not fall within the ambit of the term \u201creporting,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 20-299 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
