The defendant, New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, AFL-CIO, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court denying its application to confirm the arbitration award and granting the application of the plaintiff, the state of Connecticut, to vacate the award. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly granted the application to vacate the award because: (1) the trial court was required to limit its review of the arbitration award to a determination of whether the award conformed to the submission; (2) the trial court substituted its own judgment for the judgment of the arbitrator; (3) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>trial court had no authority to review evidence and find facts; and (4) the trial court improperly relied upon a prior arbitration award when vacating the arbitration award at issue in the present case. The plaintiff disputes these claims, and provides two alternate grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment: (1) the arbitrator exceeded her authority by extending the remedies to employees who voluntarily had left their jobs at the school; and (2) the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy. We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly exceeded its review of whether the arbitration award conformed to the submission. Further, we reject the plaintiffs alternate grounds for affirming the trial court. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to our resolution of the issues in this appeal. The arbitration in the present case arose out of a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between the parties that covers the period from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2005. The agreement contained provisions with respect to, among other things, hours of work, work schedules and overtime. The agreement also provided that the defendant had a right to submit disputes that arose over scheduling to arbitration. If a scheduling dispute was submitted to arbitration, the agreement required the arbitrator to \u201cgive weight to the following factors in the following order of priority: the impact on patient/client care and service to their families, the impact on the [department of children and families (department)], and the impact on the employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In 2001, despite lengthy negotiations on the need for a second shift for the clinical staff at the school, the parties were unable to reach a mutually agreed-upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>schedule. Therefore, on November 2, 2001, the plaintiff, through the department, unilaterally instituted a new second shift.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant timely submitted a grievance for arbitration, claiming that the second shift, as instituted, violated article two<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and/or article thirteen, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 29, 2002, after several days of hearings, the arbitrator sustained the defendant\u2019s grievance. Specifically, the arbitrator determined that the second shift, as instituted by the department, violated article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application in the trial court to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently filed a cross application to confirm the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On June 19, 2002, the trial court granted the plaintiffs application to vacate the award, and denied the defendant\u2019s application to confirm the award. The trial court further found that \u201c[the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>tor] has violated \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) by pointedly ignoring the language of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, which on its face leaves no question that she was to consider the needs of the client first, then the [department\u2019s] interests second, and finally the employees interests third.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly exceeded its standard of review of the arbitrator\u2019s award when granting the plaintiffs application to vacate the award. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court was limited to a determination of whether the award conformed to the parties\u2019 unrestricted submission. The plaintiff claims that the trial court properly granted the application to vacate the award because the arbitrator violated the terms of article thirteen, \u00a7 6. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Our analysis is guided by the well established standard of review of arbitration awards. \u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined.\u201d <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>248 Conn. 108, 114, 728 A.2d 1063 (1999). \u201cWhen the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 4, 612 A.2d 742 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>\u201cWhere the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 340-41, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985); see <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 116 (\u201cit is the arbitrator\u2019s judgment that was bargained for and contracted for by the parties, and we do not substitute our own judgment merely because our interpretation of the agreement or contract at issue might differ from that of the arbitrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In the present case, the dispute between the parties was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the terms of their agreement. At oral argument before this court, both parties acknowledged that the submission was unrestricted. Therefore, we conclude that the award in this case arose out of an unrestricted submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Because the submission was unrestricted, the trial court\u2019s review of the award was limited to a determination of whether the award conforms to the submission. <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, AFL-CIO, Council 4, Local 2663, </em>257 Conn. 80, 86, 777 A.2d 169 (2001). \u201cAn award conforming to an unrestricted submission should generally be confirmed by the court.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 12. The parties\u2019 unrestricted submission in the present case required the arbitrator to determine if the new second shift schedule violated article two and/or article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, and, if so, to determine the appropriate remedy. Ultimately, the arbitrator determined that the schedule implemented by \u201c[the department] violated [a]rticle [thirteen], \u00a7 6 (A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>of the contract . . . .\u201d By way of remedy, the arbitrator then provided that \u201c[o]n March 1, 2002, if no agreement has been reached nor new negotiations completed on any substitute schedule adjusted to meet the current needs of the clients, families, [department] and employees, the schedule existing prior to November 2, 2001 shall be reinstated . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the basis of the plain language of both the submission and the award, we conclude that the award clearly conformed to the parties\u2019 unrestricted submission, and that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs application to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The plaintiff claims, however, that the trial court correctly concluded that the arbitrator had misinterpreted the provisions of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, and therefore properly granted the application to vacate the award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As previously stated, article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement required that an arbitrator, when rendering a decision, \u201cgive weight to the following factors in the following order of priority: the impact on patient/client care and service to their families, the impact on the [department], and the impact on the employees.\u201d The arbitrator interpreted that language as requiring a \u201cbalancing] of the various factors, given their appropriate weight.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Conversely, the trial court interpreted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>section as \u201cus[ing] the language of priority . . . .\u201d More specifically, the trial court determined that if the arbitrator found that the new schedule had a positive impact on the first two factors, and a negative impact on the third factor, then the language of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement required the arbitrator to find in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s interpretation is one that the arbitrator considered, and ultimately rejected, when making her award: \u201cIt is not enough to conclude that if the impact on the clients and the [department] is largely positive and the impact on the employees is largely negative, the positives win. For me to conclude that the [department] would prevail merely by demonstrating that the schedule change is in its best interests and those of the clients and families would render superfluous the contractual requirement to weigh all three factors, including the impact on employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The parties\u2019 unrestricted submission required that the arbitrator determine whether the schedule violated article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement. Before making that determination, it was incumbent upon the arbitrator to interpret the relevant language. Although the plaintiff and the trial court may disagree with the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate interpretation of that section, as we have stated, \u201cit is the arbitrator\u2019s judgment that was bargained for . . . and we do not substitute our own judgment merely because our interpretation of the agreement or contract at issue might differ from that of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 116. \u201cWhere the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 340. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly substituted its own interpretation of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, for that of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">The plaintiff next claims that the interpretation of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, in a prior arbitration award, which the trial court cited approvingly in its memorandum of decision, demonstrates that the arbitrator in the present case improperly interpreted that section.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This claim is without merit because \u201cin the absence of a specific contract provision to the contrary, an arbitrator is not bound to follow prior arbitration decisions, even in cases in which the grievances at issue involve the same parties and interpretation of the same contract provisions.\u201d <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 125.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The plaintiff claims, as alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of the trial court, that its application to vacate the award properly was granted because: (1) the arbitrator\u2019s award was contrary to public policy; and (2) the arbitrator exceeded her powers in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The plaintiff first claims that its application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award properly was granted because the award violated a clear public policy. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated \u201ca clear public policy to clinically evaluate and assist residents at [the school].\u201d Conversely, the defendant contends that no public policy was violated by the arbitrator\u2019s award. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We begin by setting forth the law that guides our analysis of the plaintiffs public policy claim. Despite the general rule that challenges to an arbitrator\u2019s authority are limited to a comparison of the award to the submission, an additional challenge exists when the award rendered is claimed to be in contravention of clear public policy. <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>252 Conn. 467, 474, 747 A.2d 480 (2000); <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 6. \u201c[W]hen a challenge to a voluntary arbitration award rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>pursuant to an unrestricted submission raises a legitimate and colorable claim of violation of public policy, the question of whether the award violates public policy requires de novo judicial review. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P. C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 429, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000).\u201d <em>Groton v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>254 Conn. 35, 45, 757 A.2d 501 (2000). Accordingly, we undertake de novo review of whether the award in the present case violated public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">\u201cThe public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy. ... A challenge that an award is in contravention of public policy is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. . . . When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. . . . Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. . . . The party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated. . . . Therefore, given the narrow scope of the public policy limitation on arbitral authority, the plaintiff can prevail in the present case only if it demonstrates that the [arbitrator\u2019s] award clearly violates an established public policy mandate.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id., 45-46. The public policy exception \u201cmust not be interpreted so broadly as to swallow the rule.\u201d <em>South Windsor </em>v. <em>South Windsor Police Union Local 1480, Council 15, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>255 Conn. 800, 816, 770 A.2d 14 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Even if a party identifies a well defined and dominant public policy, an arbitrator\u2019s award will not automatically violate that public policy. For example, in <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 416, we concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s award did not violate the public policy asserted by the plaintiff. <em>Schoonmaker </em>involved a dispute over a law firm\u2019s decision not to pay certain postemployment benefits to an attorney, who had left the firm after thirty-five years of practice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 421-22. The dispute was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the agreement between the parties. The arbitrator ultimately determined that the plaintiff had forfeited his right to the postemployment benefits by practicing law within three years of his retirement from the firm in violation of the retirement plan\u2019s noncompetition provision. Id., 422. Subsequently, the trial court, giving \u201c \u2018great deference\u2019 to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and legal conclusions,\u201d rejected the plaintiffs public policy challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s award, and granted the defendants\u2019 application to confirm the award. Id., 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff in <em>Schoonmaker </em>claimed, among other things, that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated \u201cthe strong public policy underlying rule 5.6 [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Rules of Professional Conduct]<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in favor of clients\u2019 unfettered access to counsel of their choice . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 425. We concluded that, \u201c[although we agree with the plaintiff that rule 5.6 embodies, in part, a public policy favoring clients\u2019 access to an attorney of their choice, we reject the argument that application of a forfeiture provision violates that policy when applied to postemployment benefits that are not conditioned on the absolute cessation of practice.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id., 437-38. We find the reasoning of <em>Schoonmaker </em>persuasive in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The plaintiff in this case first claims that the arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cimplicates a clear public policy to clinically evaluate and assist residents at [the school].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>quently, however, the plaintiff expands the scope of its public policy challenge and claims that the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018conflicts with the clear public policy of protecting the children of our state.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, we interpret the plaintiffs public policy argument as asserting that improving the clinical offerings at the school was a necessary and vital component of the overall public policy objectives of the department. See <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 2663, AFL-CIO, </em>59 Conn. App. 793, 799, 758 A.2d 387 (\u201cconclud[ing] that the protection of children, with specific reference to the department, is a clear public policy of this state\u201d), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 905, 762 A.2d 910 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">While we agree with the plaintiff that there is a public policy implicated in the present case,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>that the plaintiff has not met its burden of demonstrating that the arbitrator\u2019s award clearly violated this public policy. The issue facing the arbitrator was whether the schedule implemented by the plaintiff violated article two and/or article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement between the parties. The arbitrator answered this question in the affirmative, and concluded that the schedule \u201cimplemented at the time and in the manner it was, [did] not strike a reasonable balance of the needs of the clients, the [department] and the staff, even giving greater weight to the clients and the [department\u2019s] needs.\u201d Contraiy to the claims of the plaintiff, this award does not deprive the department of the ability to implement a second shift for the clinical staff.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, the award was limited to determining the precise question of whether the <em>specific </em>second shift schedule implemented by the department violated the terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The award does not infringe on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>plaintiffs overall management of the school, nor does it depart from the essence of the agreement between the parties. That agreement provides for the arbitration of scheduling disputes. Implicit in this agreement is an understanding that an arbitrator may find that a scheduling change made by the plaintiff violated the terms of the agreement. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs claim that the arbitrator\u2019s award in this scheduling dispute violated the broad public policy objectives of the department. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 478 (arbitration award violated clearly defined public policy because award reinstated to department employee whose conduct \u201cblatantly violated\u201d both criminal statute and at least ten department employment regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Furthermore, acceptance of the plaintiffs public policy claim would be tantamount to holding that any time the department made a scheduling change that an arbitrator subsequently found to be in violation of the agreement, the arbitrator\u2019s award would be subject to a successful public policy challenge. It would be illogical to expect unions to enter into collective bargaining agreements with the state while fearing that any subsequent arbitration award in their favor would be in violation of public policy. Furthermore, this would conflict with our state\u2019s public policy favoring the ability of employees to bargain collectively for the terms of their employment; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-104 (right to bargain collectively); General Statutes \u00a7 31-105 (defining unfair labor practices); and public policy favoring arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. See <em>Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 612-13, 109 A.2d 240 (1954) (arbitration \u201ccommands much favor from the law ... as a means of promoting tranquility and the prompt and equitable settlement of disputes in the field of labor relations\u201d [cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tions omitted]), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L. Ed. 748 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the arbitrator exceeded her powers by extending the award to employees who had left their employment at the school because of the new schedule. The defendant disagrees with the plaintiffs claim, and asserts that the submission was unrestricted in this case, and therefore the arbitrator was empowered to decide the remedy without restriction. Again, we agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Despite the general rule that challenges to an arbitrator\u2019s award are limited to a comparison of the award to the submission; <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 474; an additional statutory challenge exists \u201cif the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). The question of whether an arbitrator exceeded her authority under \u00a7 52-418 (a) requires, in effect, de novo judicial review. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">When addressing a challenge of this type, \u201cwe have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>[208 Conn. 411, 415, 544 A.2d 186 (1988)]; <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Limited Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 153, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987); <em>Bic Pen Corporation </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>[183 Conn. 579, 584, 440 A.2d 774 (1981)].\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 7. The party challenging the award bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the arbitrator exceeded her powers. <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>258 Conn. 101, 115, 779 A.2d 737 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The plaintiff, in claiming that the arbitrator exceeded her power, asserts that \u201c[a]n arbitrator who rules on a work schedule grievance submission is empowered to do one of two things. She may deny the grievance and the work schedule remains in place. Or, conversely, she may sustain the grievance and the parties are left to attempt to negotiate shift coverage. The arbitrator may not, as here, order reinstatement of former employees who voluntarily left the [school].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The plain language of the submission, however, does not support the plaintiff\u2019s limited interpretation of the arbitrator\u2019s powers. The unrestricted submission in this case required the arbitrator to determine if the new second shift violated the agreement between the parties, \u201cand, if so, what shall be the remedy, consistent with the agreement.\u201d The submission contained no language limiting the arbitrator\u2019s powers to the two options outlined by the plaintiff. After concluding that the new schedule did violate the agreement, the arbitrator ordered that \u201cemployees who have left <em>because of the schedule at issue here </em>[be] given an opportunity to return to their previous positions, if available, if no other reason precluding reinstatement exists.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The broad language of the submission supports the arbitrator\u2019s decision that employees who left their employment due to the implementation of a new schedule, which was later found to be in violation of the agreement, should be given an opportunity to return to their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In addition, as long as the arbitrator\u2019s remedies were \u201cconsistent with the agreement,\u201d they were within the scope of the submission.

Once she had determined that the [department] had presented persuasive evidence that a clinical presence on the second shift was very important to patient care and to [department] objectives, she should have denied the grievance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><em> </em>On January 15, 2000, another arbitrator issued a prior decision on the issue of whether \u201cthe administration at the Veteran\u2019s Hospital violate[d] [a]rticle [thirteen], [\u00a7] 6 when changing the schedules for the grievants.\u201d The parties were the same as in the present case, although the union members in the prior decision were all full-time physicians.

We rejected a similar argument in <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 128-31, and we find it controlling of the present claim. In <em>Stratford, </em>we held that \u201can arbitrator\u2019s decision does not become a binding part of the parties\u2019 agreement unless the parties have included a provision in their agreement mandating such a result. We reiterate that even when the parties have included such a provision in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>agreement, however, the interpretation of such a provision is itself a proper subject of arbitration.\u201d Id., 131. That is no less true in the present case, as we see no principled distinction between the collateral effect owed to a prior arbitration award under the same agreement, and the collateral effect owed to a prior arbitration award under a previous version of the agreement. In either case, the party wishing to make a prior arbitrator\u2019s interpretation a binding part of the contract must seek to include language mandating such a result. The plaintiff did not include such language in the successor contract and, therefore, the arbitrator did not exceed her powers when deciding that the prior arbitration award was not binding on her interpretation of article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em> </em>The receipt of the retirement benefits was conditioned on the plaintiff\u2019s compliance with the retirement plan\u2019s noncompetition provision. <em>Schoonmaker v</em>. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 420.

See P.A. 99-26, \u00a7 1 (addressing proceeds from bonds); P.A. 99-26, \u00a7 3 (addressing contract negotiations); P.A. 99-26, \u00a7 4 (exempting school from low bid requirements). The only substantive measure cited by the plaintiff is P.A. 99-26, \u00a7 17, which the plaintiff asserts as charging the department with developing a \u201c \u2018comprehensive approach to juvenile rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d The language quoted by the plaintiff, however, was amending General Statutes \u00a7 17a-3, which outlines the basic powers and responsibilities of the department. Furthermore, that language was contained in subsection (n) of P.A. 99-26, \u00a7 17, directing the department to develop apian \u201cwhich . . . shall include provisions for development of a comprehensive approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to juvenile rehabilitation\u201d at the school. While clinically assisting and evaluating the school\u2019s residents is certainly an important policy of the department, the provisions of P.A. 99-26, standing alone, do not make it an \u201cexplicit public policy that is well defined and dominant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> In support of this broad public policy claim, the plaintiff quotes numerous passages from <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 2663, AFL-CIO, </em>59 Conn. App. 793, 758 A.2d 387, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 905, 762 A.2d 910 (2000). For example, one passage states: \u201cThat the protection and nurturing of children is an important public policy is almost too obvious for discussion. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a) provides without equivocation: \u2018The public policy of this state is: To protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect [and] ... to provide a temporary or permanent nurturing and safe environment for children when necessary . . . .\u2019 This policy has been extensively cited in our case law.\u201d Id., 798-99. That passage, as well as others cited by the plaintiff, demonstrates that the plaintiff, acting through the department, has a broad public policy regarding the protection of the children of our state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> We reemphasize, however, \u201cthat a party raising such a challenge to an arbitral award may not succeed in receiving de novo review merely by labeling its challenge as falling within the public policy exception to the normal rule of deference. The substance, not the form, of the challenge will govern. Thus, the court should not afford de novo review of the award without first determining that the challenge truly raises a legitimate and colorable claim of violation of public policy. If it does raise such a claim, de novo review should be afforded. If it does not, however, the normal deferential scope of review should apply.\u201d <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 429 n.7; see <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 2663, AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 59 Conn.

This assertion is without merit. While the department may have a right to implement a new schedule, pursuant to article thirteen, \u00a7 6, of the agreement, the defendant \u201cshall have the right to request arbitration following the schedule change implementations.\u201d Thus, both parties properly exercised their rights under the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\"> In her decision, the arbitrator emphasized the limited scope of her award: \u201c[T]he [defendant] has met its burden of proving that this particular shift, <em>implemented at the time and in the manner it was, </em>does not strike a reasonable balance of the needs of the clients, the [department] and the staff, even giving greater weight to the cliente and the [department\u2019s] needs. Rather, I find that the [department] had alternatives that would have met its client and [departmental] needs with a less severe impact on the lives of the employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">It should also be noted that the arbitrator stayed her award for one month to give the parties an opportunity to reach an agreement on a new schedule or complete new negotiations.
