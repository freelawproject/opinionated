We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims are without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the defendant\u2019s application for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history guide our resolution of this appeal. In 1991, the defendant was charged with manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for her involvement in the death of her infant daughter, Shawna March. The case was tried to the court, which reasonably could have found that the defendant had drowned the five and one-half month old child while in a dissociative psychotic state. Accordingly, the trial court found the defendant not guilty of manslaughter in the first degree by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to \u00a7 53a-13 (a). The trial court thereafter committed the defendant to the jurisdiction of the board for a period not to exceed twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">During her commitment, the defendant initially received inpatient treatment at Connecticut Valley Hospital (hospital). While undergoing that treatment, the defendant was allowed to make trips into the community under the supervision of her treatment professionals in order to work. In August, 1996, the board granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the defendant a conditional release to the supervision of the Capitol Region Mental Health Center (center). Throughout the period of her conditional release, the defendant had weekly home visits and therapy sessions with her treatment professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">While on conditional release, the defendant became romantically involved with James Harvey, a convicted felon, and requested the board\u2019s permission to live with Harvey. Although the defendant initially concealed Harvey\u2019s criminal history from her release supervisor, the board approved the living arrangement after receiving a positive recommendation from the center. Harvey moved into the defendant\u2019s apartment during the last week in December, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In August, 1999, after a three day absence, Harvey returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment and informed her that he had been having an affair with another woman over the course of several months. During the argument that ensued, Harvey grabbed the defendant and \u201cthrew\u201d her across the room. The defendant telephoned the police immediately and Harvey then left the apartment. The defendant thereafter agreed to a management plan with the center that required that she not have any further contact with Harvey, that the defendant contact the police if Harvey contacted her, and that if the defendant were inclined to seek further contact with Harvey, further evaluation by the center would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In May, 2000, the defendant applied for discharge from the jurisdiction of the board. As required under \u00a7 17a-593 (d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the board, after two separate hearings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>filed a report with the court setting forth its recommendation with regard to the defendant\u2019s application. The report indicated that six members of the board were divided equally in their recommendation as to whether the defendant should be discharged. The report stated that three members of the board felt that the defendant had \u201cdemonstrated clinical stability over the course of her conditional release since 1996\u201d and that she had \u201cnot exhibited any discemable symptoms of a mental illness for a significant number of years . . . .\u201d Those three board members supported the defendant\u2019s application for discharge, further stating that \u201calthough [the defendant] could clinically benefit from ongoing treatment to support and help her interact with her environment, which is difficult for her at times, due to her personality disorder; public safety, at this point in time, does not require involuntary supervision or treatment, and that without such mandatory treatment, she would not pose a risk to herself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Three other board members reached the opposite conclusion. While acknowledging the defendant\u2019s apparent success at remaining \u201cclinically stable,\u201d the three members who opposed the defendant\u2019s application for discharge stated that \u201c[the] conditional release program has not allowed for adequate assessment of whether [the defendant] can maintain the same level of clinical stability and compliance with societal norms at a lower level of treatment interventions, which would be available at the level one would receive as a voluntary client in the community without Board-ordered mandated oversight.\u201d These three board members further stated that \u201cthere is not adequate data to show that [the defendant] would not be a danger to herself or others if not under the jurisdiction of the [board].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The hearing on the defendant\u2019s application for discharge in the trial court began on February 14, 2001, and concluded on March 23, 2001. On February 21, the board ordered a modification of the defendant\u2019s conditional release because the board found that the defendant had violated the terms of her conditional release by having unauthorized contact with Harvey, who was then incarcerated under a five year sentence for drug-related charges. The board requested that the defendant voluntarily readmit herself to the hospital, and the defendant complied with that request. The board then held a hearing on the modification of the defendant\u2019s conditional release on March 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Initially, the defendant denied having had contact with Harvey. Evidence was presented to the board that the defendant had 126 telephone conversations with Harvey and had visited him nine times while he was being held at the Hartford Correctional Center. On the advice of counsel, the defendant refused to undergo a psychological evaluation at the hospital; as a result, the board did not have a current risk assessment for the defendant. The board found that the defendant \u201cbased on her mental disorder . . . would currently pose a danger to herself or others if treated and supervised in the community.\u201d The board therefore unanimously determined that the defendant was \u201ca person who should be confined in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities because she has a psychiatric disability that constitutes a danger to herself or others that cannot be adequately supervised and monitored in the community at this time.\u201d The board ordered that the defendant \u201cshall remain confined at [the hospital] for the purposes of care, custody and treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">When the trial court resumed its hearing on the defendant\u2019s application for discharge in March, 2001, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>board\u2019s unanimous decision revoking the defendant\u2019s conditional release and returning her to inpatient status at the hospital was admitted into evidence. The trial court thereafter concluded that the defendant had failed to meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she was \u201ca person who should be discharged\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (f) and (g). Relying largely on the board\u2019s revocation of the defendant\u2019s conditional release, and applying the definition of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d found in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-458 (a), the trial court found that the defendant had \u201cpsychiatric disabilities to the extent that discharge would constitute a danger to herself or others . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly employed the definition of \u201c \u2018[p]ersons with psychiatric disabilities\u2019 \u201d from \u00a7 17a-458 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in determining whether she was suffering from a psychiatric disability such that she constituted a danger to herself or others. More specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court should have used the more stringent definition of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d in \u00a7 17a-495 (c), which governs civil commitment and requires a mental or emotional condition that has \u201csubstantial adverse effects\u201d on functioning, and the definition of dangerousness set forth in \u00a7 17a-495 (a) and Ob),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which requires a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of physical harm. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>At the outset, we review briefly the statutory procedure applicable to an application for discharge from the jurisdiction of the board pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593. After an acquittee has applied for discharge from the board\u2019s jurisdiction and the board, in accordance with the requirement of \u00a7 17a-593 (d), has filed its report regarding whether the acquittee should be discharged, the trial court must hold a hearing on the application, at which the acquittee bears the burden of proving that he or she is \u201ca person who should be discharged.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (f).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the hearing, the court, \u201cconsidering that its primary concern is the protection of society,\u201d must make a finding as to whether the acquittee is a person who should be discharged. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (g).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The term \u201c \u2018[p]erson who should be discharged\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201can acquittee who does not have psychiatric disabilities ... to the extent that his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or others . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (11). The statutes governing the board; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 et seq.; do not, however, provide any definition of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The meaning of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d under \u00a7 17a-580 (11) is a question of statutory interpretation, over which our review is plenary. <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Zoning Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>of Appeals, </em>261 Conn. 263, 269, 802 A.2d 55 (2002). The defendant claims that the appropriate definition of psychiatric disabilities for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 17a-593 and 17a-580 (11) is the one found in \u00a7 17a-495 (c), which requires that the person have \u201ca mental or emotional condition which has substantial adverse effects on his or her ability to function . . . .\u201d This is the standard required before a person can be committed civilly through a proceeding in the Probate Court pursuant to \u00a7 17a-495 et seq. The state, by contrast, maintains that the appropriate definition is that found in \u00a7 17a-458 (a), on which the trial court relied. Although we conclude that neither \u00a7 17a-495 (c) nor \u00a7 17a-458 (a) applies to the present case, we further conclude that the trial court applied the correct standard in its interpretation of \u00a7 17a-593.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The statutes relevant to this appeal, General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 17a-580 to 17a-603, are contained in part Y of chapter 319i, which is entitled \u201cPsychiatric Security Review Board.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-581 (j)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> authorizes the board to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of chapter 319i. Section 17a-581-l of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201cThese rules and regulations will govern practice and procedures before the [board] as authorized by Sections 17a-580 through 17a-602 of the General Statutes.\u201d Section 17a-581-2 (a) (11) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies corresponds to \u00a7 17a-580 (11) of the General Statutes. As noted previously, the latter defines a person who should be discharged pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 as \u201can acquittee who does not have psychiatric disabilities ... to the extent that his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or others\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (11); whereas the former provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201c \u2018[p]erson who should be discharged\u2019 means an acquittee who is not mentally ill or mentally retarded to the extent that his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or others.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (11). Subsection (a) (5) of the same regulation defines \u201cmental illness\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Mental illness\u2019 means any mental illness or mental disease as defined by the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association and as may hereafter be amended. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-581-2 (a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The regulations governing the board have been in effect since 1992. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, such regulations must be submitted to the legislative regulation review committee for approval prior to adoption. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-170 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We have held consistently that when a regulation is approved by the legislative regulation review commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tee, such \u201cratification of a proposed regulation by the review committee is an important consideration in determining whether a regulation is consistent with a statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 623, 662 A.2d 762 (1995). \u201c[Moreover, if] a regulation has been in existence for a substantial period of time and the legislature has not sought to override the regulation, this fact, although not determinative, provides persuasive evidence of the continued validity of the regulation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Orkney </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>248 Conn. 195, 204, 727 A.2d 700 (1999). Section 17a-581-2 (5) of the regulations was approved by the legislative regulation review committee and has been in effect for more than eleven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Thus, it is apparent that the meaning of \u201cpsychiatric disability\u201d as used in part V of chapter 319i is governed by the statutes contained therein and the regulations promulgated pursuant to those statutes. The definitions found in \u00a7 17a-458 (a) do not apply to part V of chapter 319i because that statute specifically enumerates the sections to which it applies and does not refer to any of the sections in part V. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Section 17a-581-2 of the regulations, however, contains language very similar to that of \u00a7 17a-458 (a), and both impose the same standard for determining whether an individual has a psychiatric disability because both merely incorporate by reference those disorders defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. Therefore, although the trial court looked to the wrong statute for the proper definition of \u201cpsychiatric disability,\u201d it nonetheless applied the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Our rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim that the definition of psychiatric disabilities in \u00a7 17a-495 applies to criminal acquittees also disposes of her claim that the definition of dangerousness in \u00a7 17a-495 applies to her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Section 17a-581-2 (a) (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies defines \u201c \u2018[d]anger to self or to others,\u2019 \u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (5),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as \u201cthe risk of imminent physical injury to others or self,\u201d including \u201cthe risk of loss or destruction of the property of others.\u201d The defendant\u2019s claim that the court should have used the more stringent standard reflected in the definition of dangerousness contained in the civil commitment statute is, therefore, unpersuasive because the regulation approved by our legislature expressly states the manner in which the board must construe dangerousness when deciding whether to grant or deny an acquittee\u2019s application for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly found that she posed a danger to herself or others. She further asserts that the trial court\u2019s assessment of an acquittee\u2019s dangerousness is a mixed question of fact and law that this court should review de novo. In response, the state argues that the trial court properly determined that the defendant posed a danger to herself or to others, and that the trial court\u2019s determination resolved a question of fact. The state contends, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s determination is to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard applicable to findings of fact. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated the following: \u201cWhat leads this court to conclude that the [defendant] has psychiatric disabilities <em>to the extent that discharge would constitute a danger to herself or others </em>is that after more than four years of conditional release and during the pendency of this proceeding, on March 16, 2001, that conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>release was revoked and the [defendant] returned to confinement. It is the timing and nature of the underlying behavior that raise concerns of dangerousness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The trial court then quoted extensively from the board\u2019s decision revoking the defendant\u2019s conditional release, concluding with the board\u2019s factual finding that \u201c \u2018[the defendant], based on her mental disorder, which led her to violate her conditional release and to conceal her behavior from her treaters, demonstrating her lack of engagement in treatment, would currently pose a danger to herself or others if treated or supervised in the community.\u2019 \u201d The court then stated: \u201cThe board ultimately concluded that the [defendant] should be confined because \u2018she has a psychiatric disability that constitutes a danger to herself or others that cannot be adequately supervised and monitored in the community at this time.\u2019 . . . This conclusion was reached by the same board that six months ago could not agree that the [defendant] was either a person who should be discharged or a person who should be confined. . . . Because this court\u2019s primary concern is the protection of society and because the [defendant] has failed to meet her burden of proving that she is a person who should be discharged, the application [for discharge from the board\u2019s jurisdiction] is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We begin by addressing the dispute between the parties with regard to the applicable standard of review. In urging plenary review, the defendant relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Putnoki, </em>200 Conn. 208, 219, 510 A.2d 1329 (1986), in which the court stated that \u201c[although a trial court may choose to attach special weight to the testimony of medical experts at a hearing to determine mental status, the ultimate determination of mental illness and dangerousness <em>is a legal deci</em>sion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We disagree that this statement from <em>Putnoki </em>means that a trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>determination of an acquittee\u2019s dangerousness is <em>a question of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The statement on which the defendant relies must be understood in its proper context. In <em>Putnoki, </em>this court addressed, inter alia, the question of whether a trial court must defer to medical authorities when determining the dangerousness of an acquittee. We concluded in <em>Putnoki </em>that the trial court was not bound by the testimony or conclusions of psychiatrists partly because \u201cpsychiatric predictions of future dangerousness are tentative at best and are frequently conceded, even within the profession, to be unreliable.\u201d Id., 219-20. The court\u2019s statement in <em>Putnoki </em>that the determination of mental illness and dangerousness is a legal decision addressed this distinction between a purely medical decision and a legal decision based, in part, on medical testimony. The court did not address whether dangerousness is a question of fact or one of law. Indeed, this court previously had made such a determination in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 363, 456 A.2d 272 (1983), in which the court concluded that a determination of dangerousness is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\u201cTo the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 576, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blitz </em>v. <em>Subklew, </em>74 Conn. App. 183, 186, 810 A.2d 841 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s adoption of the board\u2019s finding that the defendant posed a danger to herself or others was not clearly erroneous. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the defendant presented the testimony of psychiatric experts who testified that she did not present a danger either to herself or to others, the trial court was free to reject that testimony in favor of the findings of the board. As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Putnoki, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 220-21, \u201cthe goals of a treating psychiatrist frequently conflict with the goals of the criminal justice system. . . . While the psychiatrist must be concerned primarily with therapeutic goals, the court must give priority to the public safety ramifications of releasing from confinement an individual who has already shown a propensity for violence. As a result, the determination of dangerousness in the context of a mental status hearing reflects a societal rather than a medical judgment, in which the rights and needs of the defendant must be balanced against the security interests of society. . . . The \u2018awesome task\u2019 of weighing these two interests and arriving at a decision concerning release rests finally with the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In its decision, the board clearly and unanimously determined that the defendant would pose a danger to herself or others if she were to be released into the community. In its role as fact finder, the trial court credited the board\u2019s opinion and relied on its findings, which the court properly could choose to do. The trial court\u2019s findings with regard to the defendant\u2019s dangerousness were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s diagnosis of a severe personality disorder constitutes a psychiatric disability justifying involuntary confinement was arbitrary, fundamentally unfair and in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to substantive due process. The defendant further contends that the trial court\u2019s determination that a severe personality disorder can justify further confinement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>contravenes the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 77, 112 S. Ct. 1780, 118 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1992), which, the defendant claims, requires a nexus between the acquittee\u2019s original diagnosis and the acquittee\u2019s current commitment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In addressing this issue, we first note that our Appellate Court recently addressed a similar claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>69 Conn. App. 666, 798 A.2d 974 (2002). As in the present case, the Appellate Court evaluated a criminal acquittee\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was both dangerous and mentally ill contravened the holding of <em>Foucha. </em>In <em>Jacob, </em>the acquittee argued that the trial court improperly had found that he was dangerous despite the fact that no testimony that he constituted a danger to himself or to others had been elicited during his discharge hearing. Id., 680-81. The acquittee further argued that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was mentally ill contravened the rule of <em>Foucha </em>in that his diagnosis at the time of the discharge hearing \u201c[bore] no reasonable relationship to his original acquittal and commitment because it [was] not the diagnosis that was the basis for that commitment.\u201d Id., 688. The Appellate Court concluded that the rule announced in <em>Foucha </em>was not applicable to the acquittee\u2019s case because of distinguishable facts, and, further, that <em>Foucha </em>does not require that a diagnosis that justifies continued confinement be the same diagnosis that led to the original acquittal. Id., 687-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">As the Appellate Court stated in <em>Jacob: </em>\u201cIn <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 71, the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Louisiana statute that allowed an insanity acquittee to be committed indefinitely to a mental institution until he was able to demonstrate that he was not dangerous to himself or others, despite the fact that he no longer suffered from any mental illness. Id., 75-85. The [Supreme Court] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>reiterated the principle it first announced in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[463 U.S. 354, 368, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983)] that, as a matter of due process, an acquittee is entitled to release when he either (1) recovered his sanity or (2) is no longer dangerous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 686. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 417-18, 645 A.2d 965 (1994), we stated that \u201c[w]ith respect to release from confinement, this court has adopted the principle enunciated in <em>Jones </em>and reiterated in <em>Foucha </em>that, as a matter of due process, an acquittee is entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no longer dangerous.\u201d The defendant in the present case contends that her severe personality disorder is not a mental illness for the purposes of continued confinement because it does not implicate her level of dangerousness and does not bear a sufficient relationship to the psychosis that led to her confinement. As did the Appellate Court in <em>Jacob, </em>we reject the contention that <em>Foucha </em>is applicable to the present case. We further adopt the analysis of the Appellate Court in <em>Jacob.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In <em>Jacob, </em>the court held that \u201cthe holding in <em>Foucha </em>is inapplicable here because the factual circumstances underlying that case are readily distinguishable from the facts in the present case. First, unlike the Louisiana statute at issue in <em>Foucha, </em>which indefinitely allocated the burden of proving nondangerousness to the insanity acquittee; <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 81-82; the Connecticut statute at issue here, \u00a7 17a-593, fixes a definite period of time during which the acquittee must carry the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not dangerous, namely, until the maximum period of his commitment has expired. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 425. After that point, if the state seeks to continue the acquittee\u2019s commitment, it must then carry the burden of proving by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>convincing evidence that the acquittee is mentally ill and dangerous. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\u201cSecond, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Foucha </em>that continued confinement was violative of due process turned on the fact that the state had conceded that the acquittee was not mentally ill and that it was seeking to perpetuate his confinement solely on the basis that he was dangerous. <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 77-79. The court explained that an acquittee may properly be committed only when he is both mentally ill and dangerous and that once the acquittee\u2019s mental illness had disappeared, the state\u2019s basis for holding him in a psychiatric facility had also disappeared. Id., 76-80. Here, the [trial] court did not dismiss the acquittee\u2019s application for discharge solely on the basis that the acquittee would pose a danger if discharged. In addition to finding that the acquittee was dangerous, the court in the present case also found that the acquittee remains mentally ill and that his potential dangerousness is due to that mental illness. Accordingly, we conclude that the holding in <em>Foucha, </em>that an acquittee who is dangerous but not mentally ill may not be confined in a psychiatric facility, is inapplicable to the facts of the present case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court violated the rule in <em>Foucha </em>by basing its findings, in part, on a mental health diagnosis that differed from the psychosis that led to her confinement. Again, we adopt the reasoning of the Appellate Court in <em>Jacob: </em>\u201cIn <em>Foucha, </em>the court explained that \u2018[d]ue process requires that <em>the nature </em>of commitment bear some reasonable relation to <em>the purpose </em>for which the individual is committed.\u2019 . . . <em>[Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 504 U.S.] 79. The purpose of the commitment \u2018is to treat the individual\u2019s mental illness and protect him and society from his potential dangerousness.\u2019 <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>Hills </em>Hospital, [215 Conn. 675, 683-84, 578 A.2d 1025 (1990)]. Thus, as long as an acquittee has a mental illness that requires confinement for purposes of treatment and protection, his confinement to a psychiatric facility is reasonably related to the purpose of commitment and is, therefore, constitutional. <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, [78-79].</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201cIt is true that the court should take into consideration the acquittee\u2019s past and present diagnoses in assessing dangerousness for purposes of a \u00a7 17a-593 discharge hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Putnoki, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 221. We conclude, however, that the reason for doing so is not to assess whether the acquittee\u2019s diagnosis has remained constant throughout the length of his commitment but, rather, to determine whether he still suffers from <em>a </em>mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\u201cIt is not important that the mental illness that the acquittee is currently diagnosed with is different from the mental illness that led to his acquittal and confinement. Section 17a-593 (g), which requires the court to consider the protection of society as its primary concern at a discharge hearing, would make little sense if the court had to discharge an acquittee because his diagnosis had changed but where his current mental illness is ... as dangerous to himself or others as was his previously diagnosed mental illness. What is important is that the mental illness that the acquittee is currently diagnosed with be of the type of mental illness that might cause the acquittee to be dangerous if discharged.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 688-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We concluded previously in this opinion that the trial court applied the proper standard for determining whether the defendant had a psychiatric disability and properly found that the defendant posed a danger if released. We now further conclude that the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>determination that the defendant is not a person who should be discharged was not arbitrary, fundamentally unfair or intended to facilitate her perpetual confinement, which would be violative of the principles articulated in <em>Foucha. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that she was a person who should be discharged did not violate her right to substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a) provides: \u201cIn any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> The defendant filed her appeal with the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (a) provides: \u201cThe board, pursuant to section 17a-584 or 17a-592, may recommend to the court the discharge of the acquittee from custody or the acquittee may apply directly to the court for discharge from custody.

That provision mandates substitution of the term \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d for the term \u201cmental illness\u201d in \u00a7 17a-593, the underlying statute concerning the discharge of acquittees from custody.

I concur with the result reached by the majority affirming the judgment of the trial court and with parts II and III of the majority opinion. I do not join, however, in part I of the opinion. While I agree with the majority that the trial court properly applied a definition of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d that requires a diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I believe the majority\u2019s efficient means of reaching this conclusion ignores the important history and legislative backdrop of definitions of \u201cpsychiatric disabilities\u201d as applied to criminal acquittees. I also believe that this approach simply does not respond adequately to the legitimate questions raised by the defendant, Dawn March, on appeal. Although it is true that the promulgated regulations of the psychiatric security review board (board) provide a proper definition of psychiatric disabilities, the majority\u2019s analysis fails, I believe, to provide the appropriate context for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">This court previously has acknowledged that criminal acquittees have a special status that differs irom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>status of those committed through the civil commitment process (civil committees). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 416-17, 645 A.2d 965 (1994), we stated that \u201cour statutes distinguish between those who are civilly committed and those who are insanity [criminal] acquittees. We have upheld the validity of such disparities in a number of cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>192 Conn. 532, 538, 472 A.2d 1272 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>192 Conn. 520, 529, 532, 473 A.2d 775 (1984). The use of a less demanding measure of the quantum of evidence for the initial confinement of [criminal] acquittees than that afforded civil committees . . . has been constitutionally justified because of the unique status of persons acquitted by reason of insanity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 538; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>632 F.2d 925, 931 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>169 Conn. 207, 215, 363 A.2d 91 (1975). We have acknowledged that [t]he obvious difference between insanity [criminal] acquittees and other persons facing commitment is the fact that the former have been found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>supra, 931; <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>supra, 215.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The United States Supreme Court also has recognized the special status of criminal acquittees. In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 354, 370, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983), the court held \u201cthat when a criminal defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity, the Constitution permits the Government, on the basis of the insanity judgment, to confine him to a mental institution until such time as he has regained his sanity or is no longer a danger to himself or society. This holding accords with the widely and reasonably held view that insanity [criminal] acquittees constitute a special class that should be treated differently from other candidates for commitment.\u201d See also <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>78 F.3d 1473, 1475-76 (10th Cir. 1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Accordingly, I would conclude that the well recognized special status of criminal acquittees does not warrant the application of the higher, civil commitment definition of psychiatric disabilities when determining whether criminal acquittees are persons who continue to suffer from \u201cpsychiatric disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Although the legislature did not adopt a definition of psychiatric disability for purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 (11), it did make clear that the principal concern in the decision whether to discharge an acquittee was public safety. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (g) provides that in deciding whether to discharge the acquittee, the court should consider \u201cthat its primary concern is the protection of society . . . .\u201d Applying the higher, civil commitment standard for psychiatric disabilities for criminal acquittees seeking discharge, as the defendant urges, would not be consistent with the clear legislative intention in \u00a7 17a-593 (g) of protecting society while at the same time discharging criminal acquittees who are not psychiatrically disabled to the extent that they are dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">I would also address, and reject, the defendant\u2019s contentions that at all times since the adoption of the statutes relating to the board, the legislature clearly intended that the civil commitment definition of psychiatric disabilities be applied by the trial court when evaluating a criminal acquittee\u2019s application for discharge. The defendant further contends that when the legislature amended General Statutes \u00a7 17a-495 in 1994 to delete from that section the reference to statutes relating to the board; see Public Acts 1994, No. 94-27, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 94-27); it did not intend to separate the standards associated with civil commitment from those governing criminal acquittees. Consequently, the defendant argues, the definition of psychiatric disability contained in \u00a7 17a-495 is still the correct definition to be applied to \u00a7 17a-593. I do not agree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The statutory scheme that created the board (board statutes) was adopted by the legislature in 1985 and became effective July 1 of that year. Public Acts 1985, No. 85-506. Prior to the enactment of that statutory scheme, General Statutes \u00a7 17-176 was the definition section for our civil commitment statutes and provided in relevant part: <em>\u201cFor the purposes of this chapter, </em>the following terms shall have the following meanings . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 17-176. In 1987, the board statutes enacted in 1985 were codified for the first time in the General Statutes in chapter 306. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-257a et seq. As a result, the previously existing definitions found in \u00a7 17-176 applied to the board simply because of the codification of the board statutes within chapter 306. In 1991, \u00a7 17-176 was transferred and recodified as \u00a7 17a-495, and for the first time, the statutes to which the definitions of \u00a7 17a-495 were to be applied were enumerated specifically. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17a-495 then provided in relevant part: \u201cFor the puiposes of sections 17a-75 to 17a-83, inclusive, 17a-450 to 17a-484, inclusive, 17a-495 to 17a-528, inclusive, 17a-540 to 17a-550, inclusive, 17a-560 to 17a-576, inclusive, <em>17a-580 to 17a-603, </em>inclusive, and 17a-615 to 17a-618, inclusive, the following terms shall have the following meanings . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The board statutes, then codified at General Statutes \u00a7 17a-580 et seq.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> therefore, specifically were referenced in \u00a7 17a-495. As a result of the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 17a-495, however, the specific reference to the board statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-580 through 17a-603, was deleted from \u00a7 17a-495. See P.A. 94-27, \u00a7 1. The definitions in \u00a7 17a-495, therefore, no longer specifically applied to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>A review of the legislative histoiy of P.A. 94-27 reveals that the legislature intended to sever any connection between the legal standards applicable to civil commitment and those applicable to criminal acquittees. In support of House Bill No. 5477, which became P.A. 94-27, Martha Lewis, the executive director of the board, presented written testimony that included the following statement: \u201cThis bill clarifies that commitment to the [board] is solely for a person acquitted by mental disease or mental defect of a criminal act. This bill removes all references to the statutes governing the [board] and commitment to the [b]oard by the Superior Court from the statutes governing civil commitment of the mentally ill or mentally retarded. The purpose of the statutes governing commitment to the [b]oard are different from a civil commitment. <em>The public safety purpose of the [board] and the fact that persons under its jurisdiction have been found to have committed a criminal offense allow for different procedures and legal standards rather than those which are dictated in the procedures of a civil </em>commitment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1994 Sess., p. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A review of the proceedings in the state Senate discloses a similar statement from Senator George C. Jepsen, who was a member of the judiciary committee: \u201cThis bill corrects an anomaly in the statutes which is that the [board] . . . was originally intended to deal exclusively with the issues surrounding the release of individuals who have been found guilty of crimes, but have been committed because of mental illness or have been committed because they present a danger. In short, they\u2019re kind of the criminal side of the equation.\u201d 37 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1994 Sess., p. 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Lewis and Jepsen both gave statements during hearings on the bill underlying P.A. 94-27 that indicate that the original inclusion of the board statutes within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>civil commitment statutes in the 1987 revision of the General Statutes was a codification error. Lewis stated that \u201cthe current statutory references that are deleted by [P.A. 94-27] were a result of a codification process and not a result of substantive intent.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 359. Senator Jepsen stated: <em>\u201cFor technical reasons, </em>this board has been brought . . . into statutory references that deal with the Probate issues before Probate Courts that deal with a judgment of individuals, whether they\u2019re competent to handle their own affairs, clearly, something radically different, [than] simply an individual, who for one reason or other, is no longer [able] to maintain their checking accounts or maintain lives .... That\u2019s very different from the criminal side of an individual who commits a crime . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 37 S. Proc., supra, pp. 1013-14. The deletions effected by P.A. 94-27 included the deletion of the board statutes, \u00a7 17a-580 et seq., from \u00a7 17a-495.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On the basis of this legislative history, I would conclude, first, that the original incorporation of the board statutes into the chapter of our statutes addressing civil commitment in 1987 was a codification error. Second, I would conclude that the adoption of P.A. 94-27 was a purposeful reversal of this error, designed to separate the procedures regarding criminal acquittees from those regarding civil committees. I would therefore reject the defendant\u2019s contention that P.A. 94-27 was not intended to reverse the inclusion of the board statutes as statutes to which civil commitment definitions were to be applied and that the 1994 amendment of \u00a7 17a-495 created inadvertent ambiguity in the definitions of psychiatric disability and dangerousness to be applied to criminal acquittees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\"> In 1991, the board statutes, then General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-257a through 17-257w, also had been transferred and recodified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-580 through 17a-603.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
