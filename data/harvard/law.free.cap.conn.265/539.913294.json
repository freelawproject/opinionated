Oakley,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a judgment of strict foreclosure rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Webster Bank. In this appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the plaintiff clearly and unequivocally had exercised its option, under the mortgage, to accelerate the defendant\u2019s loan; and (2) the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>et seq.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the state fair housing laws, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64b et seq., do not require a bank, which is foreclosing on a mortgage loan that it has serviced, to accommodate a disabled mortgagor\u2019s inability to make her loan payments. We disagree with the defendant, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In April, 1993, the defendant executed a thirty year mortgage deed and note on her condominium unit with a predecessor in interest of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The principal amount of the mortgage was $70,000, with a monthly payment of $495.46. The mortgage agreement contained an acceleration clause that delineated a procedure to be followed in the event of default by the borrower.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also contained a nonwaiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>clause, which provided that \u201c[a]ny forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The defendant had worked as a social worker for the Connecticut department of children and families until March, 1999. In March, 1999, she stopped working because she had suffered from significant psychiatric disabilities, including severe depression, which rendered her unable to perform her work duties. She then took unpaid medical leave from her employment. Consequently, in September, 1999, the defendant defaulted on her mortgage obligations. At that point in time, she owed the plaintiff $2885.32 for payments past due since June of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In September, 1999, the plaintiff sent to the defendant a default and cure letter dated September 13,1999. This letter informed her that she had until October 13, 1999, to pay the total past due amount. The letter warned the defendant that if she did not pay the total amount due by October 13, the entire mortgage balance would be accelerated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequently, on October 14, 1999, the plaintiff sent another letter to the defendant advising her that, because it had not received the requested payment, the plaintiff considered the debt accelerated, and referred the matter to its attorney for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs attorney sent to the defendant a letter dated October 19,1999, informing her that she had until October 27, 1999, to cure the default by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>paying the amount owed, which at that time was $3501.09. The letter warned that failure to cure the default by that time potentially would result in foreclosure. That letter contained a clause stating that \u201c[n]othing contained in this letter shall be deemed to be a waiver of any of the [plaintiff\u2019s] rights, remedies, or recourses available to it under the Note, the Mortgage, or any other documents executed with respect to this loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Subsequently, on November 17, 1999, the plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking foreclosure of the mortgage, immediate possession of the mortgaged premises, a deficiency judgment, and other equitable relief. As special defenses, the defendant asserted, inter aha, that the plaintiff was barred from foreclosure because: (1) the letters from the plaintiff and its attorney had failed to provide her with proper notice of the default and acceleration; and (2) the plaintiff, by not making a reasonable accommodation for the defendant\u2019s disabilities, had denied and interfered with her right to live in her dwelling under the FHAA, the ADA and \u00a7 46a-64b et seq. The defendant also sought recoupment and setoff, and she counterclaimed for damages on these, and other, grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The plaintiff thereafter moved for summary judgment of strict foreclosure, which the trial court granted, over the defendant\u2019s objection, as to liability only.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that none of the subsequent communications to the plaintiff from the defendant constituted a waiver of the default and cure notice that had been communicated to her in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the original September, 1999 letter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court also concluded that the reasonable accommodations provisions of the FHAA and \u00a7 46a-64b et seq., as well as the ADA, were not applicable to the enforcement of a mortgage. The trial court based its conclusion on the language of the statutes, and what it determined was the absence of any case law indicating that the various antidiscrimination statutes apply to mortgage servicing and enforcement. The court concluded that \u201cit does not appear that these statutes require any conduct on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Before we address the defendant\u2019s specific claims on appeal, we first set forth the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment, which is applicable to all of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaFlamme </em>v. <em>Dallessio, </em>261 Conn. 247, 250, 802 A.2d 63 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL EXERCISE OF ITS OPTION TO ACCELERATE THE MORTGAGE LOAN</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim presents a threshold issue in this appeal. The defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the series of three letters sent by the plaintiff and its attorney constituted the requisite clear and unequivocal exercise of the mortgage\u2019s acceleration option. Specifically, the defendant claims that these letters do not constitute a clear and unequivocal exercise of the plaintiffs right to accelerate because, after she had received a letter from the plaintiff informing her that the loan had been accelerated, she then received a subsequent communication from the plaintiffs attorney that was phrased as a default and cure letter. The defendant, accordingly, contends that the loan was not accelerated properly because she never had received any communication of acceleration following her receipt of the default and cure letter from the plaintiffs attorney, which she claims the trial court improperly ignored.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The plaintiff contends, in response, that the trial court concluded correctly that the plaintiff clearly and unequivocally had accelerated the loan because: (1) under the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Scherban, </em>47 Conn. App. 225, 227-28, 702 A.2d 659 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 907, 714 A.2d 2 (1998), so long as the plaintiff satisfied its notice obligations under the mortgage when it initially had accelerated the loan, the subsequent communications from its attorney were irrelevant; and (2) under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>court\u2019s decision in <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Culaia, </em>211 Conn. 613, 619-21, 560 A.2d 456 (1989), the mortgage\u2019s non-waiver clause precluded any subsequent inconsistent conduct by the plaintiff, or its attorney, from being construed as a waiver of its right to accelerate the loan. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the communications from the plaintiff and its attorney to the defendant constituted a clear and unequivocal exercise of the plaintiff\u2019s right to accelerate the defendant\u2019s mortgage loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u201cNotices of default and acceleration are controlled by the mortgage documents. Construction of a mortgage deed is governed by the same rales of interpretation that apply to written instruments or contracts generally, and to deeds particularly. The primary rale of construction is to ascertain the intention of the parties. This is done not only from the face of the instrument, but also from the situation of the parties and the nature and object of their transactions. ... A promissory note and a mortgage deed are deemed parts of one transaction and must be construed together as such.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Porto, </em>41 Conn. App. 598, 602, 677 A.2d 10 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We note that, under the terms of the mortgage in the present case, acceleration is an optional remedy in the event of default by the boirower. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Accordingly, the rale articulated by the Appellate Court in <em>City Savings Bank of Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Dessoff </em>3 Conn. App. 644, 649, 491 A.2d 424, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 811, 495 A.2d 279 (1985), is applicable. In <em>City Savings Bank of Bridgeport, </em>the court concluded that \u201c[t]he general rale is that where the acceleration of the maturity of a mortgage debt on default is made optional with the mortgagee, some affirmative action must be taken by him evidencing his election to take advantage of the accelerating provision, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>until such action has been taken the provision has no operation. <em>The exercise of the option should be made in a manner clear and unequivocal, so as to leave no doubt as to the mortgagee\u2019s intention. The option is effectively exercised by manifesting the fact in such manner as to apprise the mortgagor. . . . </em>Even a declaration may be a sufficient exercise of the option, but to be effective the declaration must be followed by an affirmative act toward enforcing the declared intention.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Scherban, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 225, is particularly instructive in resolving the defendant\u2019s claim. In <em>Northeast Savings, F.A., </em>a mortgage foreclosure case, the borrower contended that the lender had failed to provide sufficient notice of the acceleration of the debt. Id., 227. The lender in <em>Northeast Savings, F.A., </em>had sent the borrowers a default and cure letter on June 1, giving them thirty days to cure the deficiency and warning them that failure to cure <em>might </em>result in acceleration of the debt. Id. The June 1 default and cure letter was followed by a letter on July 2, informing the borrowers that they were still in default, and had thirty days to pay the amount in default. Id. On July 22, the lender sent yet another default and cure letter to the borrowers. This letter warned that unless the borrowers paid the full past due amount by August 2, foreclosure proceedings would commence. Id. The debt remained unpaid and the lender subsequently brought the foreclosure action on September 27. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The borrowers in <em>Northeast Savings, F.A., </em>contended that these letters did not satisfy the notice of acceleration provision under the mortgage and note, which provided that \u201cthe lender shall give notice to borrower prior to acceleration . . . which shall specify the default, the action required to cure the default, a date not less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>thirty days within which to cure the default and that failure to cure the default may result in acceleration.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 227-28. The Appellate Court rejected this claim, and concluded that the condition precedent of notice of acceleration had been satisfied because <em>the first </em>letter stated that acceleration might result from the borrower\u2019s continued failure to cure the default. Id., 228. The court also concluded that the note did not require that the acceleration notice be separate from the notice of default. Id. The court further concluded that \u201cthe notice of default satisfied the notice requirement contained in the note because it notified the defendants of the default and the possibility of acceleration.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Christensens. Cutaia, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 613, is also instructive. That case involved a series of twelve identical promissory notes in the aggregated principal amount of $70,788, with each note payable to the lender in the amount of $5899 plus interest. Id., 614-15. In <em>Christensen, </em>the borrower\u2019s payments were, from the outset, untimely. Id., 616. The notes contained an acceleration clause providing for acceleration of the entire aggregated principal amount in the event of default on any one note. Id., 615. The notes also provided no grace period, and contained nonwaiver clauses providing that \u201cthe [lender\u2019s] failure to assert a right would not amount to a waiver and requiring any waiver to be in writing.\u201d Id., 616. After the lender received a late payment on the fourth promissory note, he informed the borrower, both directly and through an employee, that he no longer would tolerate late payments. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Subsequently, the borrower failed to pay his loan on the fifth note on time. Id. The lender contacted the borrower and informed the borrower\u2019s secretary that he intended to exercise his rights to declare a default, and accelerate payment on all of the notes; the lender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>also sent the borrower notice of this intention via certified mail on that same day. Id. When the borrower received the certified letter, he sent the lender a check as payment for the fifth note, and the lender deposited this check. Id. Shortly thereafter, the lender brought an action for payment of the remaining unpaid balance on the remaining eight promissory notes, due in full, pursuant to the lender\u2019s right to accelerate. Id., 616-17. The trial court had determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact and granted the lender\u2019s summary judgment motion. Id., 617. The court awarded the entire remaining principal amount plus interest, concluding that \u201cupon the [borrower\u2019s] default, the [lender] had properly exercised his right to acceleration and that neither the [borrower\u2019s] subsequent tender nor the [lender\u2019s] acceptance of payment for [the fifth note] had cured the default.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On appeal, the borrower contended that there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether the lender\u2019s acceptance and cashing of earlier late payments amounted to a waiver of the right to accelerate. Id., 619. This court concluded that, \u201c[w]hile inconsistent conduct may, under certain circumstances, be deemed a waiver of a right to acceleration, the insertion of a nonwaiver clause is designed to avoid exactly such an inference.\u201d Id., 619-20. Accordingly, the court concluded that the lender had not waived his right to accelerate by his seemingly inconsistent conduct. Id., 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We conclude that, under the holdings in <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Cutaia, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 619-20, and <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Scherban, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 227-28, the plaintiff clearly and unequivocally exercised its option of accelerating the loan once the defendant had defaulted. The first letter provided ample warning to the defendant that, if she did not cure her default by October 13, the entire loan amount would be accelerated. After the defendant failed to cure her default, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>plaintiff sent prompt notice to the defendant that it considered the debt accelerated, and that the matter had been referred to its attorney for collection. The very next communication to the defendant came five days later from the plaintiffs attorney. Thus, in our view, the defendant had ample awareness of the plaintiffs intentions with respect to acceleration of the debt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, under this court\u2019s interpretation of nonwaiver clauses set forth in <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Cutaia, </em>supra, 620, the plaintiffs conduct in affording the defendant eight additional days to stave off the consequences of acceleration and foreclosure by curing the default cannot be construed as a waiver of its option to accelerate the mortgage loan. Indeed, a conclusion by this court that a lender, by giving a borrower one more opportunity to cure a default, has not clearly and unequivocally exercised its right to accelerate the debt, ultimately would militate against persons in the defendant\u2019s position; such a conclusion surely would eviscerate any inclination or incentive that a lender might have to extend any kind of generosity or flexibility to borrowers in default, on the eve of commencing litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Moreover, the letter from the plaintiffs attorney was not contradictory, as the defendant claims, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>beyond affording the defendant a few more days to cure her default, <em>it did not retract expressly the previous notice of acceleration. </em>Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs letters constituted a clear and unequivocal exercise of its option to accelerate the mortgage debt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING CLAIMS UNDER THE FHAA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 ET SEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the FHAA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq., does not require a lender foreclosing on a mortgage loan to provide reasonable accommodations for the disabilities of a borrower. Specifically, the defendant contends that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (2)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are applicable to a lender\u2019s attempt to foreclose upon the mortgage of a disabled borrower because the enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ment of mortgage loan agreements \u201cmake[s] unavailable or den[ies]\u201d a dwelling, and is a \u201c[service] ... in connection with such [a] dwelling . . . .\u201d The defendant further claims that, because \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (2) apply to the enforcement of mortgage loan agreements, the trial court improperly precluded her from receiving a hearing about whether the plaintiff could have provided her with \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for her disability pursuant to \u00a7 3604 (f) (3) (B).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In response, the plaintiff, relying principally on <em>Salute </em>v. <em>Stratford Greens Garden Apartments, </em>136 F.3d 293, 301-302 (2d Cir. 1998), contends that the FHAA does not afford the defendant relief because it only requires accommodations that directly ameliorate the effects of an individual\u2019s disability, rather than her economic status. The plaintiff further claims that applying the FHAA to the defendant in this context would constitute an impermissible economic preference for disabled individuals, which ultimately would fundamentally alter loan programs and have deleterious consequences for all lending institutions. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 does not apply to the enforcement of a mortgage, and therefore, properly refused to conduct a hearing about whether the plaintiff should have afforded the defendant a reasonable accommodation for her disability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by setting forth the appropriate standard of review and the process by which we inteipret federal statutes. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Joshua S., </em>260 Conn. 182, 213, 796 A.2d 1141 (2002). We ordinarily interpret Connecticut statutes in accordance with the purposive formulation set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). In the present case, however, we are required to interpret <em>federal </em>statutes, namely, provisions of the FHAA and the ADA. Thus, despite our express rejection of the plain meaning rule in <em>Courchesne, </em>principles of comity<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>and consistency<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> dictate that we follow it in the present case, because that is the rule of construction utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ripa, </em>323 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Accordingly, our analysis of the federal statutes in the present case \u201cbegins with the plain meaning of the statute. ... If the text of a statute is ambiguous, then we must construct an interpretation consistent with the primary purpose of the statute as a whole.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id.; see also <em>In re Caldor Corp., </em>303 F.3d 161, 167-68 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201c[a]s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent, there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under the plain meaning rule, \u201c[legislative history and other tools of interpretation may be relied upon only if the terms of the statute are ambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>omitted.) <em>In re Venture Mortgage Fund, L.P., </em>282 F.3d 185, 188 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, our interpretive process will begin by \u201cinquiring whether the plain language of [each] statute, when given \u2018its ordinary, common meaning\u2019 ... is ambiguous.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Caldor Corp., </em>supra, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Thus, our interpretive task begins with the relevant statutory language. The FHAA is a comprehensive array of statutes aimed at preventing discrimination in various housing and real estate related contexts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 3604 of the FHAA provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful . . . (f) (1) [t]o discriminate in the sale or rental, or to <em>otherwise make unavailable or deny, </em>a dwelling to any buyer or renter <em>because of a handicap </em>of . . . (A) that buyer or renter . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 3604 (f) (2) of the FHAA then provides that it shall be unlawful \u201c[t]o discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in <em>the provision of services </em>or facilities in connection with such dwelling, <em>because of a handicap </em>of . . . (A) that person . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, \u00a7 3604 (f) (3) of the FHAA provides that \u201c[f]or purposes of this subsection, discrimination includes . . . (B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such [handicapped] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling . . . .\u201d Thus, the defendant contends that, because the enforcement of mortgage loan agreements is a \u201c[service]\u201d or alternatively \u201cmakefs] unavailable or den[ies]\u201d a dwelling pursuant to \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (2), the plaintiff was required under \u00a7 3604 (f) (3) to afford the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>reasonable accommodations as to the plaintiffs rules, policies, practices, or services in light of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (2) are, at first blush, linguistically appealing, especially given the ambiguity of the operative statutory terms, namely, \u201cservices,\u201d or \u201cmake unavailable or deny.\u201d We conclude, however, that \u00a7 3604 of the FHAA, and its reasonable accommodations provision, afford the defendant no relief. Indeed, discrimination in mortgage foreclosures is addressed solely by a different section of the FHAA, namely, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Put differently, the defendant\u2019s proposed application of \u00a7 3604 is precluded by the existence of \u00a7 3605.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Section 3605 of the FHAA is entitled \u201c [discrimination in residential real estate-related transactions.\u201d Section 3605 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of . . . handicap . . . .\u201d Section 3605 (b) defines \u201c \u2018residential real estate-related transaction\u2019 \u201d as \u201c(1) [t]he making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance\u2014(A) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling; or (B) secured by residential real estate. ...\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 3605, unlike \u00a7 3604, does not include any provision stating that the failure to provide reasonable accommodations constitutes discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Having reviewed the various statutory sections that comprise the FHAA, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims of discrimination in the enforcement of mortgage loan agreements unambiguously fall within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605. See, e.g., <em>Gaona </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Credit, </em>324 F.3d 1050, 1056 n.7 (8th Cir. 2003) (noting that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 \u201cbars discrimination in sales and rentals, rather than loans\u201d); <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Union Savings Assn., </em>429 F. Sup. 1254, 1257-58, 1271 (N.D. Ohio 1977) (although court concluded posttrial that borrowers failed to prove racial discrimination, court stated that \u201cit is the intent of Congress that [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3605\u2019s prohibitions against discrimination on the part of lending institutions in connection with real estate loans proscribe discrimination in the manner in which a lending institution forecloses a delinquent or defaulted mortgage note since the right of foreclosure is one of the \u2018terms or conditions of such loan\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, we conclude further that the specific applicability of \u00a7 3605 to the context of enforcement of mortgage loan agreements precludes the application of \u00a7 3604 in that same arena. See, e.g., <em>Eva </em>v. <em>Midwest National Mort</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>gage Banc, Inc., </em>143 F. Sup. 2d 862, 886 (N.D.

Moreover, it is well established that \u201cunless [administrative regulations] are shown to be inconsistent with the authorizing statute, they have the force and effect of a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>222 Conn. 631, 649, 610 A.2d 1185 (1992). The organizational scheme of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the FHAA indicates that the secretary did not contemplate mortgage related matters arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604. Part 100 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides the regulations that address discriminatory conduct under the FHAA; it is further divided into subparts. Subpart B of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 100.50 through 100.90, \u201cprovides the [secretary\u2019s] interpretation of conduct that is unlawful housing discrimination under\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604, as well as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3606,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>which proscribes discrimination in the provision of brokerage services. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.50 (a).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Subpart B addresses the following areas of discrimination: (1) \u201c[u]nlawful refusal to sell or rent or to negotiate for the sale or rental\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.60; (2) \u201c[discrimination in terms, conditions and privileges and in services and facilities\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.65; (3) \u201c[ojther prohibited sale and rental conduct\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.70; (4) \u201c[discriminatory advertisements, statements and notices\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.75; (5) \u201c[discriminatory representations on the availability of dwellings\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.80; (6) \u201c[b]lockbusting\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.85; and (7) \u201c[discrimination in the provision of brokerage services.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.90. We note that loans and their enforcement are not mentioned anywhere within the comprehensive array of detailed regulations that comprise subpart B. Indeed, we also note that mortgage loans and their enforcement are not mentioned in subpart D of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 100.200 through 100.205, which effectuates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (3), the reasonable accommodations provision under the FHLAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In contrast to subparts B and D, subpart C of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 100.110 through 100.148, contains ample references to loans and mortgages, and \u201cprovides the [secretary\u2019s] interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the conduct that is unlawful housing discrimination under\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.110 (a).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Sub-part C contains a multitude of detailed regulations addressing discrimination in loan enforcement, which proscribe: (1) \u201c[discriminatory practices in residential real estate-related transactions\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.110; (2) \u201c[residential real estate-related transactions\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.115; (3) \u201c[discrimination in the making of loans and in the provision of other financial assistance\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.120; (4) \u201c[discrimination in the purchasing of loans\u201d; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.125; and (5) \u201c[discrimination in the terms and conditions for making available loans or other financial assistance.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.130. Thus, this inteipretive treatment by the secretary charged with the enforcement of the FHAA, in accordance with the statutory text and the otherwise silent legislative history, confirms that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605 is the sole FHAA provision applicable to mortgage servicing and enforcement. We, therefore, disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that mortgage servicing and enforcement \u201cotherwise make[s] unavailable or den[ies]\u201d a dwelling or is a \u201c[service]\u201d in connection with a dwelling for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Having held that relief for claims of discrimination in the enforcement of mortgage loan agreements lies solely under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that she was entitled to reasonable accommodations for her disability. As previously discussed, the predicate for the defendant\u2019s claim for accommodation is that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (3), failure to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities constitutes impermissible discrimination. As noted previously, however, unlike \u00a7 3604, \u00a7 3605 does not contain a similar reasonable accommo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>dations provision. Thus, \u201c[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983); accord <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 396, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993) (\u201c[w]e are not permitted to supply statutoiy language that the legislature may have chosen to omit\u201d). We, therefore, presume that Congress\u2019 exclusion of \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605 evinces clear legislative intent not to include the failure to provide reasonable accommodations as a form of impermissible discrimination under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Indeed, we find particularly persuasive the recent decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Gaona </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Credit, </em>supra, 324 F.3d 1050. In <em>Gaona, </em>the plaintiff mortgagors, a deaf married couple, had defaulted on their mortgage loan and the defendant bank sought to foreclose. Id., 1052. The plaintiffs brought an action and claimed that the defendant, inter alia, had violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605 by failing to provide them with a sign language interpreter during loan negotiations. Id., 1052-53. In support of their claim, the plaintiffs cited 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.204,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and claimed that the regulation was evidence of a general reasonable accommodations requirement under the FHAA. Id., 1056 n.7. The Eighth Circuit concluded that the regulation \u201cdoes not apply to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605, but rather to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (f) (2) . . . which bars discrimination in sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>and rentals, rather than loans . . . .\u201d Id. The court concluded that the trial court properly granted the defendant summary judgment because the lender \u201cdid not refuse to transact business with the [plaintiffs], [They] received all required disclosures and notices, and there was no evidence that they were given inaccurate or differing information from that provided to other borrowers. Because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605 does not define discrimination to include a lender\u2019s refusal to make reasonable accommodations, [the lender] was under no obligation under [\u00a7] 3605 of the FHAA to provide a sign language interpreter . . . .\u201d Id., 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We adopt the well reasoned decision in <em>Gaona, </em>and we conclude that the trial court properly refused to provide the defendant with a hearing about possible reasonable accommodations, because such accommodations are not required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, lenders such as the plaintiff in the present case need not alter their generally applicable terms or conditions in order to accommodate an individual\u2019s disability. In this case, the defendant has not claimed that her mortgage loan was subject to different terms and conditions than that of other individuals engaging in mortgage transactions with the plaintiff. Thus, the trial court correctly precluded a hearing about whether, in enforcing the mortgage, the plaintiff could afford the defendant reasonable accommodations for her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S STATE FAIR HOUSING CLAIMS UNDER \u00a7 46a-64b ET SEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the state fair housing laws, \u00a7 46a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>64b et seq., did not require the plaintiff to provide the defendant with reasonable accommodations for her disability in the servicing and enforcement of her mortgage loan. In response, the plaintiff claims that the state fair housing laws do not require lenders to make reasonable accommodations in the provision of lending services. We conclude that \u00a7 46a-64b et seq. do not require a lender to make reasonable accommodations for a borrower\u2019s disability in the mortgage servicing and enforcement context.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We note at the outset that the relevant language of the state fair housing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) and (7),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> is virtually identical to the language and structure of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604 (f) and 3605, which were discussed in part II of this opinion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604, the state statute also makes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate in the sale or rental, or <em>to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a learning disability or physical or mental disability </em>of: (i) [s]uch buyer or renter . . . (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) (A). Moreover, the state fair housing statute prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst any person in the <em>terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, </em>because of a learning disability or physical or mental disability of: (i) [s]uch person . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) (B). The state fair housing statute provides further that \u201cdiscrimination includes . . . (ii) <em>a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Structurally, the state fair housing statute also tracks the federal scheme by providing in \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (7) that a \u201cperson or other entity engaging in residential real-estate-related transactions\u201d is barred from discriminating against any person on the basis of \u201crace, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, familial status, learning disability or physical or mental disability\u201d in the making available of such transactions or in the terms or conditions of such transactions. We note that the language is, in all relevant aspects, identical to the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605. Moreover, just like within the federal scheme, \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (7) does not, as \u00a7 46a-64c (a) (6) does, define \u201cdiscrimination\u201d under the statute as a failure to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals in residential real estate-related transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>It is well established that \u201cin addressing claims brought under both federal and state housing laws, we are guided by the cases interpreting federal fair housing laws . . . despite differences between the state and federal statutes.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 591, 775 A.2d 284 (2001). Inasmuch as the relevant provisions of the state and federal fair housing statutes in the present case are virtually identical, we apply the analysis that we utilized in evaluating the defendant\u2019s FHAA claims.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See part II of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that, although the state fair housing act, \u00a7 46a-64b et seq., apphes to the servicing and enforcement of a mortgage, the particular statutory provision that governs discrimination in the context of enforcement of mortgage loan agreements does not require that a lender provide accommodations for a borrower\u2019s disability by varying the terms or condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tions of an otherwise generally applicable mortgage policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CLAIMS UNDER THE ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181 ET SEQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the ADA\u2019s reasonable modifications provisions apply only in the employment context and, therefore, do not require lenders to afford disabled persons any accommodations in the enforcement of mortgage loans. Specifically, the defendant and amici contend that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was improper because: (1) Title III of the ADA, and in particular 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12181<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and 12182 (a),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> applies to the enforcement of a mortgage because loan servicing and enforcement is a \u201c[service]\u201d offered by the plaintiff lender, which is aplace of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA; and (2) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (b) (2) (A) (ii),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the plaintiff was required to make reasonable modifications in its enforcement policies and procedures to accommodate the defendant\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ability. The plaintiff contends, in response, that: (1) the ADA regulates only access to, but not the content of, goods and services offered by aplace of public accommodation, such as a bank; and (2) modifications in the enforcement of the defendant\u2019s mortgage would not be alterations to accommodate her disability directly and, therefore, are not required by the ADA. We conclude that: (1) the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 are triggered because mortgage loan servicing and enforcement is a \u201c[service]\u201d provided by a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d; and (2) the plaintiff was not required to afford the defendant reasonable modifications in the content and enforcement of the mortgage because Title III of the ADA regulates access to mortgages, but does not govern the content of mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We begin with the relevant statutory language. Section 12182 (a) of the ADA provides the general rule that \u201c[n]o individual shall be discriminated against <em>on the basis of disability </em>in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, <em>services, </em>facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any <em>place of public accommodation </em>by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A bank expressly is among the \u201cprivate entities\u201d that are considered \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d for purposes of Title III of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181 (7) (F). Finally, \u201cdiscrimination includes ... a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (b) (2) (A) (ii). The United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe statute contemplates three inquiries: whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the requested modification is \u2018reasonable,\u2019 whether it is \u2018necessary\u2019 for the disabled individual, and whether it would \u2018fundamentally alter the nature of \u201d the policy, practice, or procedure. <em>PGA Tour, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>532 U.S. 661, 683 n.38, 121 S. Ct. 1879, 149 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2001). \u201cWhether one question should be decided before the others likely will vary from case to case, for in logic there seems to be no necessary priority among the three.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We next review the legislative purpose of the ADA, as summarized by the Supreme Court in <em>PGA Tour, Inc. </em>\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals. In studying the need for such legislation, Congress found that \u2018historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u2019 . . . Congress noted that the many forms such discrimination takes include \u2018outright intentional exclusion\u2019 as well as the \u2018failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices.\u2019 . . . After thoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded that there was a \u2018compelling need\u2019 for a \u2018clear and comprehensive national mandate\u2019 to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them \u2018into the economic and social mainstream of American life.\u2019 ... In the ADA, Congress provided that broad mandate. ... In fact, one of the [ADA\u2019s] \u2018most impressive strengths\u2019 has been identified as its \u2018comprehensive character\u2019 . . . and accordingly the [ADA] has been described as \u2018a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society\u2019 .... To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life, among them employment (Title I of the [ADA]), public services (Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>II), and public accommodations (Title III).\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 674-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Our first point of inquiry is to determine whether the provision and enforcement of a mortgage are \u201cservices\u201d that trigger the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (a) of the ADA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>Pallozzi </em>v. <em>Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 28 (2d Cir. 1999), as amended on denial of reh., 204 F.3d 392 (2d Cir. 2000), is especially instructive on this issue. In <em>Pallozzi, </em>the plaintiffs claimed that an insurance company violated Title III of the ADA by refusing to sell them life insurance because of their mental disabilities. Id., 30. The Second Circuit analyzed the statutory language of Title III and concluded that the ADA regulates insurance underwriting practices. Id., 31. Confining its inquiiy to the text of \u00a7 12182 (a), the court stated that the sales of insurance policies are the primary \u201cgoods and services\u201d offered in an \u201c \u2018insurance office,\u2019 \u201d which is included explicitly in the statute as a \u201c \u2018place of public accommodation.\u2019 \u201d Id., 31, 32-33; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181 (7) (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We similarly conclude that mortgage servicing and enforcement are \u201cservices\u201d provided by the plaintiff under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (a), and that Title III of the ADA, therefore, applies to the provision of such services. Just as the life insurance policy in <em>Pallozzi </em>v. <em>Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 198 F.3d 30-33, was a good or service offered by an insurance office, a mortgage loan certainly is a service offered by a bank. Indeed, like the Second Circuit, we are persuaded by the defendant\u2019s reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>on the broad language of \u00a7 12182 (a), especially in light of the express remedial purpose of the ADA. See, e.g., <em>PGA Tour, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 674-76; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 (b).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling that the ADA\u2019s reasonable modifications provisions apply only in the context of employment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Having determined that the ADA applies within the context of mortgages, we now turn to the question of whether the ADA requires the plaintiff to afford the disabled defendant a reasonable modification in its mortgage servicing and enforcement practices. The defendant and amici contend that she is entitled to a hearing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182 (b) (2) (A) (ii) to determine whether the plaintiff could have made \u201creasonable modifications\u201d to its foreclosure policies, practices and procedures, without \u201cfundamentally alter[ing]\u201d the nature of its mortgage services. In response, the plaintiff claims that: (1) modification of its foreclosure policies is a revision that alters the content of those services, and therefore is not required under <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>179 F.3d 557, 560 (7th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1106, 120 S. Ct. 845, 145 L. Ed. 2d 714 (2000); and (2) modifications to its default and foreclosure procedure are not required because they would not ameliorate directly the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>dant\u2019s disability as is required by the ADA, but rather would alleviate the hardships of her economic status. We conclude that the plaintiff is not required to modify its default and foreclosure policies and procedures pursuant to \u00a7 12182 (b) (2) (A) (ii), because the ADA operates to afford equal <em>access </em>to goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations, but does not regulate the <em>content </em>of such goods, services, facilities, privileges and advantages.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 12182 (b) (2) (A) (ii) provides that discrimination under the scheme shall include \u201ca failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary <em>to afford </em>such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications <em>would fundamentally alter the nature </em>of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute by its plain language, therefore, constructs a scheme wherein subject entities are required to provide reasonable modifications to afford disabled persons equal <em>access </em>to certain activities. Such modifications are not required, however, if the modification would be unreasonable or would work a fundamental alteration to the <em>nature </em>of the activity. Thus, the ADA demands that disabled persons be afforded reasonable modifications in accessing certain goods and services, unless the modification impacts the veiy nature of the activity itself. The ADA does not regulate the <em>content </em>of goods and services; it is only access to those goods and services that the ADA seeks to equalize for disabled persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We note that the great weight of judicial authority supports the conclusion that Title III of the ADA regulates access to goods and services provided by public accommodations, but does not regulate the content of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the goods or services provided. The decision in <em>PGA Tour, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 682-91, indicates that the United States Supreme Court has embraced this analytical distinction, albeit in a different context. In that case, the court concluded that a disabled golfer, in order to be afforded access to participate in tournaments, was entitled to a modification of the tournament rules that would allow him to employ a golf cart in order to traverse the course. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cTitle III of the ADA, by its plain terms, prohibits [the] petitioner from denying [the respondent] equal <em>access </em>to its tours on the basis of his disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 677. Indeed, the court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner was required under the ADA to permit a disabled golfer to use a golf cart during tournaments was predicated on its determination that such an accommodation merely provided access and did not fundamentally alter the nature or content of the game, which is \u201cshot-making.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Id., 682-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The various Circuit Courts of Appeals generally have embraced this distinction between access and content in the more analogous context of insurance policies. In addition to the decision of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Second, Third, Fifth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Sixth and Ninth Circuits have all supported the distinction between access and content-based modifications in interpreting the ADA\u2019s regulation of insurance policies. See <em>Pallozzi </em>v. <em>Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 198 F.3d 28;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Schering-Plough Corp., </em>145 F.3d 601, 612 (3d Cir. 1998) (\u201c[t]he fact that an insurance office is a public accommodation, however, does not mean that the insurance policies offered at that location are covered by Title III\u201d), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1093, 119 S. Ct. 850, 142 L. Ed. 2d 704 (1999); <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Time Ins. Co., </em>205 F.3d 179, 186 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWe believe that Title III prohibits the owner, operator, lessee, or lessor from denying the disabled access to, or interfering with their enjoyment of, the goods and services of a place of public accommodation. Title III does not, however, regulate the content of goods and services that are offered.\u201d), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1191, 121 S. Ct. 1189, 149 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2001); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>121 F.3d 1006, 1012 (6th Cir. 1997) (\u201cTitle III does not govern the content of a long-term disability policy offered by an employer\u201d), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1084, 118 S.

Thus, although a lender like the plaintiff may not refuse to provide equal access to its mortgage policies on the basis of the disabilities of potential mortgagors, it was not required to alter the otherwise universally applicable terms or conditions of its mortgage policies to accommodate the disabilities of borrowers such as the defendant. Thus, the reasonable modifications provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the ADA does not afford the defendant any relief in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In this opinion BORDEN and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> Although VI West Condominium Association, Inc., a subordinate lien-holder, also was named as a defendant in this case, it is not involved in this appeal.

The defendant claims that the issues of adequacy of notice and potential waiver, which were addressed in those cases, do not apply in the present case, wherein the issue is whether the plaintiff clearly and unequivocally exercised its option to accelerate. We disagree with the defendant because we deem these issues to be closely related. The degree and nature of the notice afforded the borrower, as well as any possibility of waiver by the lender, undoubtedly inform our assessment of whether the lender clearly and unequivocally exercised its option to accelerate.

In <em>Sealed </em>v. <em>Sealed, </em>332 F.3d 51, 59-60 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit certified to us two questions of law involving the construction of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c). The Second Circuit concluded that, although it \u201cmay ordinarily interpret ambiguous state statutes using the normal rules of statutory interpretation, even in the absence of controlling state authority,\u201d certification of these questions to us was appropriate because, inter alia, of the broader interpretive approach of <em>Courchesne. </em>Id., 59.

In <em>Eva, </em>the Ohio District Court acknowledged that it was bound by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s endorsement of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach to the split of authority, namely, that \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3605 overlap and \u201care not mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>Eva </em>v. <em>Midwest National Mortgage Banc, Inc., </em>supra, 884, <em>citing Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cisneros, </em>supra, 52 F.3d 1357. Nevertheless, recognizing the temporal distinction between \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3605, the court dismissed claims, brought pursuant to \u00a7 3604, of redlining and reverse redlining in home refinancing loans that were alleged to be predatory. <em>Eva </em>v. <em>Midwest National Mortgage Banc, Inc., </em>supra, 886. The Ohio District Court concluded that \u00a7 3604 was inapplicable because the plaintiffs in that case were refinancing previously acquired property. Id., 884. Accordingly, we follow the Ohio decision, and we conclude that \u00a7 3604 is inapplicable in the present case, wherein financing is at issue, but the defendant already has acquired the dwelling at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AJb\">Nevertheless, even if we were to conclude that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 applies in the present situation, the statute\u2019s reasonable accommodations provision is no defense for the defendant in this action. In <em>Salute </em>v. <em>Stratford Greens Garden Apartments, </em>supra, 136 F.3d 301, the Second Circuit stated that \u201c[w]e think it is fundamental that the law addresses the accommodation of handicaps, not the alleviation of economic disadvantages that may be correlated with having handicaps.\u201d The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt \u201cto use [the reasonable accommodations] statute to remedy economic discrimination of a kind that is practiced without regard to handicap . . . [noting that the] \u2018opportunity to use and enjoy\u2019 language of the FHAA reinforces the ability of people with handicaps to have the same opportunity as similarly situated persons who have no evident handicaps. What stands between these plaintiffs and the [defendant\u2019s] apartments ... is a shortage of money, and nothing else. <em>In this respect, impecunious people with disabilities stand on the same footing as everyone else. </em>Thus, the accommodation sought by [the] plaintiffs is not \u2018necessary\u2019 to afford handicapped persons \u2018equal opportunity\u2019 to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 302. Finally, the Second Circuit concluded by stating that \u201cCongress could not have intended the FHAA to require reasonable accommodations for those with handicaps every time a neutral policy imposes an adverse impact on individuals who are poor. <em>The FHAA does not elevate the rights of the handicapped poor over the rights of the non-handicapped poor. Economic discrimination\u2014such as the refusal to accept Section 8 tenants\u2014is not cognizable as a failure to make reasonable accommodations, </em>in violation of \u00a7 3604 (f) (3) (b).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Accordingly, we conclude that any accommodation, no matter how reasonable, that the plaintiff possibly could make in the present case would be economic, and not addressed directly toward the amelioration of the defendant\u2019s disability, and therefore, not cognizable under \u00a7 3604 (f) (3) (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> We note that the amici agree generally with the defendant that the FHAA does apply to the enforcement of mortgage agreements, but disagree about which particular provision of the FHAA is implicated in the mortgage context.

Had Congress purposed to impose so enormous a burden on the retail sector of the economy and so vast a supervisory responsibility on the federal courts, we think it would have made its intention clearer and would at least have imposed some standards. It is hardly a feasible judicial function to decide whether shoe stores should sell single shoes to one-legged persons and if so at what price, or how many Braille books the Borders or Barnes and Noble bookstore chains should stock in each of their stores.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>supra, 179 F.3d 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\"> We note that at least one observer has read <em>PaUozzi </em>as holding that the ADA regulates not just access to, but also the content of, a self-insured policy plan. See C. Olender, \u201cCapping AIDS Benefits: Does Title III of the ADA Regulate the Content of Insurance Policies?,\u201d 28 Am. J.L. &amp; Med. 107, 109 (2002). We do not read <em>Pallozzi </em>in a similar fashion. In <em>Pallozzi, </em>the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant insurance company had violated Title III of the ADA by refusing to sell them life insurance because of their mental disabilities. <em>Pallozzi </em>v. <em>Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 198 F.3d 29-30. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Id., 31. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed, and concluded that Title HI required the defendant \u201cto provide disabled persons with physical access [to the company\u2019s offices and] also prohibited [the defendant] from refusing to sell them its merchandise by reason of their disability.\u201d Id., 33. We read this conclusion from <em>Pallozzi </em>as relating entirely to the Title III mandated efforts of an entity to make its facilities and goods or services <em>accessible and available </em>to the disabled. Thus, we see nothing in the <em>Pallozzi </em>decision indicating that the Second Circuit interpreted the ADA as governing the <em>content </em>of such goods or services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\"> We note the existence of, but in light of the more recent United States Supreme Court decision in PGA <em>Tour, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 682-91, have our doubts about the continued validity of the analysis by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Carparts Distribution Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Automotive Wholesaler\u2019s Assn. of New England., Inc., </em>37 F.3d 12, 18-20 (1st Cir. 1994). In that case, the First Circuit declined to adopt the distinction, under the ADA, between access and content. The court stated that \u201c[a]s a matter of bare language, one could spend some time arguing about whether this [language of the ADA] is intended merely to provide access to whatever product or service the subject entity may offer, or is intended in addition to shape and control which products and services may be offered. . . . [T]here is nothing in [the legislative history of Title III] that explicitly precludes an extension of the statute to the substance of what is being offered. Suppose, for example, a company that makes and distributes tools provides easy access to its retail outlets for persons with every kind of disability, but declines to make even minor adjustments in the design of the tools to make them usable by persons with only quite limited disabilities.\u201d Id., 19-20. Thus, the First Circuit concluded that Title III of the ADA governs not only access to certain goods and services, but may also regulate the content of such goods and services. \u201cWe think that at this stage it is unwise to go beyond the <em>possibility </em>that the plaintiff may be able to develop some kind of claim under Title III [with regard to the content of the benefits plan at issue] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.)

I agree with the majority opinion but write separately to emphasize my agreement that principles of <em>comity, </em>i.e., the need to respect the legal principles of other jurisdictions, and <em>consistency, </em>i.e., the need for each jurisdiction to apply a uniform approach to the interpretation of a particular statute, dictate our adherence to the plain meaning rule in interpreting the federal statutes at issue in the present case. I also would emphasize that it does not violate principles of federalism or infringe on any prerogative of this court for this court to apply the plain meaning rule in interpreting federal statutes notwithstanding this court\u2019s rejection of the application of that rule in interpreting Connecticut statutes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 570, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">I also continue to maintain that it is regrettable that this court no longer follows the plain meaning rule in cases involving the interpretation of Connecticut statutes. See id., 597 <em>(Zarella, J., </em>dissenting). The present case highlights yet another problem created by the abandonment of that rule. Specifically, the majority acknowledges that, in construing a Connecticut statute modeled on federal law, we are guided by federal case law, even when the federal court utilizes the plain meaning rule in construing the federal statute. The majority also concludes, however, that affording the state fair housing statutes at issue the same construction as that afforded to their federal counterparts by federal courts utilizing the plain meaning rule \u201cis entirely compatible\u201d with Courchesne\u2014at least for purposes of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>case\u2014inasmuch as that construction is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the construction that would be derived from gleaning the legislative history of the state fair housing statutes. Footnote 29 of the majority opinion. A case may well arise, however, in which the interpretation accorded a federal statute by federal courts will be inconsistent with the legislative history of an identical Connecticut statute. Under such circumstances, will this court continue to rely on federal case law applying the plain meaning rule in construing Connecticut statutes modeled on federal statutes, or will it revert to the purposive approach of Courchesne? In my view, either approach is problematic.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
