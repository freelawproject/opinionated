The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants had failed to post the current prevailing wage rates as required by General Statutes \u00a7 31-55.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The plaintiffs also brought actions against the defendants for wrongful termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ment. These wrongful discharge actions alleged that the defendants violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 31-51q<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>and 31-69b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The defendants interposed the following special defenses: (1) that some or all of the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-596;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) that the claims arising out of the UCONN project for three of the plaintiffs, William Berlepsch, Miro Tanski and Michael Gianelli, were barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, and that those plaintiffs released the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>dants from any liability for labor claims arising out of that project; and (3) that all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred because each plaintiff, prior to instituting the action, already had assigned his claim to the state department of labor (department). Lawrence Brunoli, Jr., and Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., also filed counterclaims against William Schoonmaker alleging malicious prosecution, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A jury returned verdicts in favor of the six plaintiffs on their prevailing wage claims, and awarded them damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury also concluded that the defendants\u2019 failure to pay the plaintiffs the proper prevailing wages was a result of the defendants\u2019 bad faith, arbitrariness and unreasonableness. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims. Finally, the jury returned verdicts for the plaintiffs on the defendants\u2019 counterclaims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Numerous postverdict motions followed. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. The trial court also concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of the Wolcott School project had been assigned by them to the department. Accordingly, the court substantially reduced the plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts by the amounts awarded for the Wolcott School claims. The court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motions, pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, to double the verdicts and awarded them attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $39,750. Finally, the court partially granted the defendants\u2019 motions for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims. The court awarded the defendants $12,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>assigned their claims arising out of the Wolcott School project to the department, thereby extinguishing their rights and interest in those claims; (2) determined when the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action had accrued under, and the tolling of, the applicable statute of limitations, thereby resulting in an insufficient jury award; (3) refused to instruct the jury that, upon a finding that the defendants had violated \u00a7 31-53 (f) by failing to keep proper employee work and wage records, the burden of proof shifted to the defendants to disprove the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of lost wages; (4) concluded that there was no evidence to support the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims and, therefore, that the defendants were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for the defense of those claims; (5) determined the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that were to be awarded to the defendants for defense of the wrongful discharge claims; (6) refused to award interest to the plaintiffs on the jury awards for their lost wages; and (7) reduced the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees that the plaintiffs were awarded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In their cross appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly deviated from the plaintiffs\u2019 contingency fee agreement in its award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly refused to set aside, pursuant to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, the verdicts for Berlepsch, Tanski and Gianelli for claims arising out of the UCONN project.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Our resolution of the parties\u2019 various claims on appeal is set forth in far greater detail in the remainder of this opinion. To summarize, however, we conclude that with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on appeal: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>assigned their claims arising out of the Wolcott School project to the department, because the language on the claim forms merely created an assignment for collection; (2) the record is inadequate to permit meaningful appellate review of the plaintiffs\u2019 statute of limitations claims; (3) although the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the applicable burden of proof upon a finding of a record keeping violation, that improper instruction was harmless error; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the defendants $12,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for the defense of four of the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims that the court deemed were frivolous; and (5) the plaintiffs failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether the trial court improperly refused to award them interest on their jury awards for their unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 claims on their cross appeal, we conclude that the trial court: (1) abused its discretion and improperly deviated from the contingency fee agreement between the plaintiffs and their attorneys in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs; and (2) correctly refused to set aside, pursuant to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, the verdict for Berlepsch, Tanski and Gianelli for claims arising out of the UCONN project.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">By way of background, we note that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., is a construction company licensed to do business in this state. Lawrence Brunoli, Jr., and Lawrence Brunoli, Sr., are directors and officers of the corporation, with the latter serving as vice president. The plaintiffs were employees of Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., and worked for the defendants on various public works construction projects, which included work at the Wolcott School, UCONN and the Cedarcrest Hospital. At these projects, the plaintiffs engaged in various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>construction-related tasks, including, but not limited to, heavy equipment operation, masonry and tinsmithing. During the course of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment in the mid-1990s, complaints surfaced that the defendants were not properly compensating their workers, including the plaintiffs, in accordance with the prevailing wage requirements of \u00a7 31-53 (b). These complaints were investigated by both the Foundation for Fair Contracting in Connecticut (foundation), a private organization, and the department, eventually giving rise to the present action. Additional relevant facts and procedural history will be set forth, with specificity, in the context of the appropriate claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CLAIMS TO THE DEPARTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The first issue in this appeal is whether the trial court improperly concluded that certain language on the department complaint forms constituted a valid and complete assignment of the Wolcott School claims to the department, thereby extinguishing the plaintiffs\u2019 right, title and interest in those claims, in the absence of a reassignment of those claims to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claim that the language on the forms was merely an assignment for collection that did not completely extinguish their interest in those claims. The defendants claim that the trial court properly concluded that the language on the forms was a complete assignment of the Wolcott School claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history necessary for the resolution of this claim. The plaintiffs,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in December, 1995, and January, 1996, filed with the department standard complaint forms entitled \u201cstatement of claim for wages.\u201d These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>complaint forms, which were admitted into evidence at trial, alleged nonpayment of prevailing wages and overtime pay at the Wolcott School project. The language at issue is located on the reverse side of the forms, above the claimant\u2019s signature, and provides: \u201cI hereby assign all wages and all penalties accruing because of their non-payment, and all liens securing them to the Labor Commissioner of the State of Connecticut <em>to collect </em>in accordance with the law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Gary Pechie, director of the department\u2019s wage and workplace standards division, testified about the contents of the form. He testified that the form submitted by the plaintiffs had been last revised in 1994. Pechie testified that the language at issue authorized the department to pursue unpaid wages on behalf of the signatory claimants.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Daniel Jackson, a wage enforcement agent for the department, testified that the department terminates its investigative and collection efforts when the employee who filed the complaint form subsequently initiates a separate civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The defendants moved to set aside or reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts by the amount awarded for the Wolcott School claims. In response to this motion, the trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that \u201cthe effect of the assignments of the plaintiffs to their rights under the [Wolcott School] job to the [department] had the effect, as with all assignments, of transferring to the assignee exclusive ownership of all the assignor\u2019s rights, actually to the subject assigned and extinguished all of these rights in the assignor.\u201d The court discounted Jackson\u2019s testimony that collection efforts stop when a private action is begun, and noted that the plaintiffs never pursued a reassignment of those claims from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>department.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and substantially reduced the verdicts by the amounts that the jury had awarded for the Wolcott School claims.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the assignment language is merely an assignment for collection that does not deprive them of the right to bring a civil action against their employer. The plaintiffs also claim that the assignment language on the form is superfluous and, therefore, legally meaningless because they brought this action pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, which expressly allows the department to act on behalf of an employee without a formal assignment of claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendants contend that in the absence of a formal reassignment of claims from the department to the plaintiffs, the assignment language completely extinguished the plaintiffs\u2019 interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>in their Wolcott School claims. The defendants also claim that not requiring a formal reassignment of claims potentially could result in duplicate liability for employers. We agree with the plaintiffs and conclude that the language on the form merely creates an assignment for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We first set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cAn assignment is a contract between the assignor and the assignee, and is interpreted or construed according to rules of contract construction.\u201d 6 Am. Jur. 2d 153, Assignments \u00a7 1 (1999). The parties do not dispute that interpretation of the form\u2019s language presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. \u201c [W]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . [B]ecause the trial court relied solely upon the written agreements in ascertaining the intent of the parties, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the documents are questions of law, rather than fact.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gateway Co. </em>v. <em>DiNoia, </em>232 Conn. 223, 229-30, 654 A.2d 342 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u201cGenerally, to constitute an assignment there must be a purpose to assign or transfer the whole or a part of some particular thing, debt, or chose in action, and the subject matter of the assignment must be described with such particularity as to render it capable of identification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dysart Corp. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>240 Conn. 10, 17, 688 A.2d 306 (1997). The right to bring an action to collect a debt, such as unpaid wages, is a chose in action. See <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>219 Conn. 465, 472, 594 A.2d 1 (1991) (\u201c[s]ince the commonest type of right subject to assignment is one for the payment of money . . . the plaintiff sued the defendant on a validly assignable chose in action\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>1999) (chose in action is \u201c[t]he right to bring an action to recover a debt, money, or thing\u201d). Under the horn-book law of assignments, \u201c[t]he assignee of a chose in action stands in the shoes of the assignor.\u201d <em>Mall </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>33 Conn. App. 359, 362, 635 A.2d 871 (1993), cert. denied, 229 Conn. 912, 642 A.2d 1208 (1994). Indeed, \u201c[s]uccession by an assignee to exclusive ownership of all or part of the assignor\u2019s rights respecting the subject matter of the assignment, and a corresponding extinguishment of those rights in the assignor, is precisely the effect of a valid assignment.\u201d <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>supra, 473. We note, however, that, under the doctrine of assignment for collection, the assignor <em>does </em>in fact retain an equitable ownership, and therefore, substantial rights, in the action assigned. See, e.g., 6 Am. Jur. 2d 259, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 177 through 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In <em>DeBenedictis </em>v. <em>Hagen, </em>77 Wash. App. 284, 289-90, 890 P.2d 529 (1995), the Washington Court of Appeals articulated a particularly iUuminating analysis of the distinction between an assignment for collection and a complete assignment: \u201cTo analyze this claim, we distinguish between two kinds of assignments. On the one hand, a creditor/assignor can assign his or her claim against a debtor in such a way as to effect a complete sale of the claim. An example is the business that sells a group of accounts receivable; frequently, it will convey its entire ownership interest in exchange for a cash payment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, a creditor/assignor can assign his or her claim against a debtor for purposes of collection. Such an assignment transfers legal title to the claim, so the assignee can sue in his or her own name. . . . [T]his leaves equitable ownership with the creditor/ assignor. . . . The resultant split in ownership gives rise to a fiduciary relationship between the assignor and assignee . . . and the relationship generally is one of principal-agent. . . . Subject to exceptions not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tinent here, the principal can revoke the agent\u2019s authority at any time . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Accord <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Kamens, </em>664 F. Sup. 118, 120 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); <em>Robertson </em>v. Robertson, 231 Ark. 573, 575, 331 S.W.2d 102 (1960); <em>Eagle </em>v. <em>Mien, </em>Hawaii Court of Appeals, Docket No. 22950 (August 21, 2001), aff'd, 96 Haw. 386, 31 P.3d 243 (2001); <em>Garren </em>v. <em>Saccomanno, </em>86 Idaho 268, 275, 385 P.2d 396 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We conclude that the assignment language at issue in the present case created an assignment for collection, rather than a complete assignment. The plaintiffs, therefore, retained equitable ownership of those claims, and may bring an action to collect the wages owed them. We rest our conclusion on the plain language of the relevant provision of the department\u2019s complaint form, which stated specifically that the claimant\u2019s wages and penalties are being assigned for the department \u201cto <em>collect </em>in accordance with the law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our conclusion finds further support in surrounding provisions of the complaint form, which expressly \u201cauthorize\u201d the department to settle the claims, or transfer or assign them as necessary for settlement. The assignor retains express authority to object to, or disapprove, any proposed settlement. We note that this language of assignment creates, under well established Connecticut law, what is essentially an agency relationship<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> between the complainant and the department, a legal status that is a hallmark of the assignment for collection. See <em>DeBenedictis </em>v. <em>Hagen, </em>supra, 77 Wash. App. 290. Furthermore, to construe this assignment other than as an assignment for collection, would make little practical sense. It necessarily would mean that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>state, in the form of the department, would be entitled to collect, and <em>keep, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 wages due. It is difficult to conceive why the plaintiffs would assign, and the state would be entitled to, unpaid wages that were the result of the plaintiffs\u2019 labor, not of any agent of the state. We conclude, therefore, that the language of assignment merely created an assignment for collection, and that the plaintiffs retained equitable ownership of the Wolcott School claims, a status that permitted them to maintain the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The defendants contend that a reassignment from the department to the plaintiffs remained necessary because of the risk of duplicate liability, should both an employee and the department pursue claims simultaneously. We disagree with this claim for several reasons.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> First, under res judicata principles, when an \u201cassignment is for collection only, the assignor and assignee are in privity\u201d with each other. <em>Gwynn </em>v. <em>Wilhelm, </em>226 Ore. 606, 609, 360 P.2d 312 (1961). Accordingly, the department cannot litigate the same claim against the same defendant employer if an employee already has recovered a final judgment on that particular claim, and vice versa. See <em>Personnel One </em>v. <em>Som</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>merer &amp; Co., </em>564 So. 2d 1217, 1218 (Fla. App. 1990) (subsequent action by assignor barred by res judicata when assignee of accounts receivable brought unsuccessful action in first instance); see also <em>Gribben </em>v. <em>Lucky Star Ranch Corp., </em>623 F. Sup. 952, 960 (W.D. Mo. 1985) (\u201c[a] privity relationship for res judicata purposes exists when the interests of a non-party are represented by a party in the former action\u201d); <em>Gwynn </em>v. <em>Wilhelm, </em>supra, 610 (default judgment against patient in physician\u2019s action to collect fees does not bar patient\u2019s malpractice action against physician). Second, the department\u2019s policy is to discontinue its collection efforts upon the filing of a private action by the employee. It is, therefore, unlikely that, as a practical matter, there would be two actions; indeed, no such thing occurred here.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that, as a result of the assignment language on the department\u2019s claim form, the plaintiffs had extinguished their interest in the Wolcott School claims. Accordingly, the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside or reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts by the amount the jury had awarded for the Wolcott School claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly determined the date when certain causes of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>had accrued under \u00a7 52-596, the applicable statute of limitations. See footnote 12 of this opinion. The plaintiffs also claim that because the trial court improperly concluded that an anonymous letter filed with the department would not toll the statute of limitations, the court excluded from the evidence an anonymous handwritten note to the department. The defendants contend, in response, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not properly before this court because the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs fail to relate the claims to a particular trial court ruling on the statute of limitations issue. We conclude that the record is inadequate to allow for proper appellate review of the plaintiffs\u2019 statute of limitations claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">It is well established that \u201c[i]t is the appellant\u2019s burden to provide an adequate record for review. ... It is, therefore, the responsibility of the appellant to move for an articulation or rectification of the record where the trial court has failed to state the basis of a decision ... to clarify the legal basis of a ruling ... or to ask the trial judge to rule on an overlooked matter. . . . In the absence of any such attempts, we decline to review this issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 674-75, 757 A.2d 1 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1148, 121 S. Ct. 1089, 148 L. Ed. 2d 963 (2001); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 66-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In the present case, the trial court record is inadequate to permit any meaningful review of the plaintiffs\u2019 statute of limitations claims. The plaintiffs raised various statute of limitations claims, in their motions for additur and to set aside the verdict, and they repeated them at oral argument before the trial court. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the trial court improperly determined the dates on which the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action had accrued, as well as the dates on which the statute of limitations was tolled. We note, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that the record is silent with respect to the trial court\u2019s treatment of these specific claims. The draft judgment file contains only a general denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motions, and the trial court did not discuss the statute of limitations issues in rendering its oral decision. This leaves us with the inappropriate task of speculating about the trial court\u2019s reasoning, and the effect of its decision on the claims of each individual plaintiff. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal and reply briefs confirm our analysis; while they are replete with legal arguments pertaining to the statute of limitations, neither brief directs our attention to a definitive trial court ruling with respect to any of the particular claims in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Furthermore, the record indicates that the plaintiffs never remedied this defect in the record by moving for articulation or rectification of the trial court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we decline to engage in a speculative review of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE AMOUNT OF LOST WAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The plaintiffs, relying on <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 687-88, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515 (1946), claim that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that, upon a finding that the defendants had failed to keep records required by \u00a7 31-53 (f),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the burden of proof shifted to the defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>requiring them to disprove the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for wages. The defendants, in addition to claiming that the burden shifting scheme of <em>Anderson </em>is factually and legally inappropriate for the present case, contend that the trial court\u2019s charge accurately reflected the safe harbor that Connecticut law provides for litigants who are, because of the circumstances of their case, unable to prove their damages with precision and certainty. We agree with the plaintiffs, and we conclude that the trial court should have charged the jury in accordance with the burden shifting scheme articulated in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>supra, 687-88. We also conclude, however, that this instructional impropriety was harmless because it was not likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history relevant to the disposition of this claim. Sandra Barrachina, the department field supervisor, testified that when she had investigated complaints against the defendants arising from the Wolcott School project, the defendants had submitted incomplete records to her. These records included log books kept by both the defendants and the department of public works. Barrachina testified that, in the opinion of the department, the certified payroll statement that the defendants had submitted did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 31-53 (f) because it was submitted with inconsistencies, in the incorrect form, and without the required statement of compliance. She also testified that the defendants had failed to comply with her request for a correct certified payroll, which was made after an audit of the defendants by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Each of the plaintiffs testified regarding the amount of money that he was owed by the defendants for each project in question. Tanski testified that he was owed $6352 for his work at the UCONN project, and $19,800 for the Wolcott School project. Tanski testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>had derived those figures by examining his paycheck stubs for the UCONN project, and the Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., and department of public works log books for the Wolcott School project, as well as personal notes that he had kept of his duties at work. He then compar ed those documents and his notes to the prevailing wage schedule, classifying himself as a carpenter or laborer to complete any classification gaps.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The remaining plaintiffs used substantially similar methodology to arrive at their individual damage figures. Gerry Blejewski testified that he was owed $25,380.18 for his work at the Wolcott School project. Gianelli testified that he was owed $3781 for his work at the Cedarcrest Hospital and the UCONN projects. Richard M. Scheller, Jr., testified that he was owed $2200 for his work at the Cedarcrest Hospital project, and $13,500 for his work at the UCONN project. Schoonmaker testified with great specificity about his hours and tasks, ultimately concluding that he was owed $300 for his work at the UCONN project, and $19,891.78 for his work at the Wolcott School project. Finally, Berlepsch testified that he was owed $5960 for his work at the UCONN project, and approximately $32,800 for his work at the Wolcott School project. The documents that the plaintiffs used to calculate their unpaid wages were all admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Subsequently, the defendants cross-examined the plaintiffs about the calculations and methodology that they had used in arriving at their claims of unpaid wages.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The defendants also presented affirmative doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>umentary and testimonial evidence. For example,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Tama Brunoli, the defendants\u2019 treasurer, testified on their behalf. She was responsible for the defendants\u2019 payroll in 1994 and 1995. During her testimony, the defendants introduced into evidence a computer generated report used for job classification (payroll report), which contained entries describing the number of horns worked by the defendants\u2019 employees, including the plaintiffs, and the cost of each hour of work.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The defendants also introduced into evidence the W-2 forms describing the plaintiffs\u2019 base pay, and the 1099 forms that described the plaintiffs\u2019 fringe benefits packages. This information also was contained in the payroll report.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The payroll report, as described by Tama Brunoli, contained the total amount of hours worked by each plaintiff on each specific job, including the amount of straight time and overtime hours worked in each specific job classification of laborer, machine operator and carpenter, and the compensation for that labor.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>payroll report also included information on bonuses paid to the plaintiffs for hours not actually worked, such as during the holiday season. The information in the payroll report was compiled by Tama Brunoli with information gleaned from Lawrence Brunoli, Jr.,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> who reported the applicable prevailing wages, and reports by the defendants\u2019 field supervisor about the plaintiffs\u2019 work hours in each job classification. The plaintiffs then cross-examined Tama Brunoli at length about the methodology that she had used in creating the payroll report, and omissions or discrepancies contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The plaintiffs submitted to the trial court a written request to charge that incoiporated language from <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>supra, 328 U.S. 687-88, stating that upon proof of improper record keeping by an employer, coupled with \u201csufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of [the employee\u2019s] work as a matter of just and reasonable inference . . . the burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negat[e] the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employees\u2019 evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The trial court declined to adopt the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tiffs\u2019 proffered burden shifting language, and instead instructed the jury as follows: \u201cSo if you do find that the records kept by the employer, the . . . defendants, if you find those records were inadequate and the employee does produce sufficient evidence to show the amount or type of work for which an employee was not properly compensated as a matter of logical and reasonable inferences, then you can consider [that] in deciding whether the employee has convinced you by a preponderance of the evidence of the amount of damages sustained by him. The situation with respect to the records\u2014you still, of course, have to be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence as to the amount of damage proximately caused by the failure to pay wages, if you find that there was a failure to pay wages.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then took a postcharge exception to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the burden shifting language. The plaintiffs also relied on their objections to the charge in their motions for additur and to set aside the verdict, both of which the trial court denied after oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . We do not critically dissect a jury instruction.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ancheff v. Hartford Hospital, </em>260 Conn. 785, 811, 799 A.2d 1067 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury was improper because it did not incorporate the burden shifting principles of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>supra, 328 U.S. 687-88. We begin our analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim by parsing the decision in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>supra, 687, wherein the United States Supreme Court addressed the \u201cproper and fair standard . . . for the employee to meet in carrying out his burden of proof,\u201d when the employer has failed to comply with the record keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The court concluded: \u201cWhen the employer has kept proper and accurate records, the employee may easily discharge his burden by securing the production of those records. But where the employer\u2019s records are inaccurate or inadequate and the employee cannot offer convincing substitutes, a more difficult problem arises. ... In such a situation we hold that an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference. The burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee\u2019s evidence. If the employer fails to produce such evidence, the court may then award damages to the employee, even though the result be only approximate.\u201d Id., 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In articulating this burden shifting standard, the court recognized that employees bringing an action under Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid wages, overtime compensation and liquidated damages bear the burden of proving that they \u201cperformed work for which [they were] not properly compensated. The remedial nature of this statute and the great public policy which it embodies, however, militate against making that burden an impossible hurdle for the employee. Due regard must be given to the fact that it is the employer who has the duty under . . . the [Fair Labor Standards] Act to keep proper records of wages, hours and other conditions and practices of employment and who is in position to know and to produce the most probative facts concerning the nature and amount of work performed. Employees seldom keep such records themselves; even if they do, the records may be and frequently are untrustworthy.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Id., 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We note that \u00a7 31-72, the state wage collection statute, is like the Fair Labor Standards Act, a remedial statute that is entitled to liberal construction. <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 696, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995); see also <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford, Tech</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>nical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 463, 704 A.2d 222 (1997). Accordingly, we find persuasive the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, when an employer has failed to comply with statutory record keeping provisions, the failure to implement the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift has the potential to interfere with the remedial purpose of \u00a7 31-72, because any uncertainty in the damages amount is the fault of the employer. We do note, however, <em>that Anderson </em>merely imposes a shift in the burden of production, and not the burden of persuasion;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact remains with the employee. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>supra, 328 U.S. 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s jury charge reflects the well established proposition that Connecticut law does not require a party claiming damages to prove them with exactitude or precision. Indeed, a party seeking damages must only \u201cafford a basis for a reasonable estimate by the trier, court or jury, of the amount of that [party\u2019s] loss. From the very nature of the situation, the amount of loss cannot be proved with exactitude and all that can be required is that the evidence, with such certainty as the nature of the particular case may permit, lay a foundation which will enable the trier to make a fair and reasonable estimate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stern &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>146 Conn. 42, 45-46, 147 A.2d 490 (1958) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>(compensation for damages to business good will).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We agree that this existing Connecticut law governing litigants\u2019 proof of damages is consistent with the language and underlying policy of the <em>Anderson </em>burden shifting formulation. That consistency, however, does not render the instruction substantively correct, but is a factor that supports the improper charge\u2019s harmlessness, as further discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We also note the defendants\u2019 claim, based on the plaintiffs\u2019 detailed computations and testimony about the wages owed to them, that the factual predicate of nonexistent records, which is required to trigger the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift, does not exist in the present case. The defendants contend that the <em>Anderson </em>formulation is intended to protect plaintiffs who, through no fault of their own, cannot testify with certainty about their alleged damages; accordingly, the plaintiffs in the present case were not \u201cburdened by the handicap\u201d that would trigger the application of <em>Anderson. </em>While the defendants identify correctly the policy that underlies <em>Anderson, </em>we note, however, that the record keeping requirements focus on the accuracy of records, as well as their completeness, because \u201cwithout accurate records, there can be no assurance that the employees are receiving proper payment under \u00a7 31-53.\u201d <em>Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tianti, </em>223 Conn. 573, 593, 613 A.2d 281 (1992). Accordingly, under our reading of <em>Anderson, </em>the burden shift is triggered by the <em>defendants\u2019 </em>conduct with respect to the required record keeping; the plaintiffs\u2019 detailed testimony assisted them in establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>their prima facie cases, but does not deprive them of the benefit of the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court\u2019s refusal to incorporate the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift into the jury instructions was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Having concluded that the trial court improperly refused to incorporate the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift into its jury instructions, we next must determine whether this omission constituted harmful error. The plaintiffs contend that they were harmed by the improper instruction and, therefore, that they are entitled to a new trial because \u201c[i]f the jury had been made aware of the shifting of the burden of proof to [the] [defendants, its determination of damages would have been based on a legal standard more favorable to the [p]laintiffs and their claims.\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and we conclude that the improper instruction was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic [however] that not every error is harmful. . . . [W]e have often stated that before a party is entitled to a new trial ... he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. ... An instructional impropriety is harmful if it is likely that it affected the verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Scanlon </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>258 Conn. 436, 448, 782 A.2d 87 (2001); accord <em>Godwin </em>v. <em>Danbury Eye Physicians &amp; Surgeons, P.C., </em>254 Conn. 131, 145, 757 A.2d 516 (2000); <em>Remington v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>240 Conn. 309, 316, 692 A.2d 399 (1997). In determining whether the improper instruction in the present case was likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, we consider the factors set forth in the California Supreme Court\u2019s opinion <em>in Rutherford </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>16 Cal. 4th 953, 983, 941 P.2d 1203, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16 (1997). In <em>Rutherford, </em>the California court considered several factors in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ing whether the giving of an improper burden shifting instruction was harmful error in that case, noting that \u201c[t]he reviewing court should consider not only the nature of the error, including its natural and probable effect on a party\u2019s ability to place his full case before the jury, but the likelihood of actual prejudice as reflected in the individual trial record, taking into account (1) the state of the evidence, (2) the effect of other instructions, (3) the effect of counsel\u2019s arguments, and (4) any indications by the jury itself that it was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We also find especially instructive the Appellate Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hebrew Home &amp; Hospital, Inc., </em>73 Conn. App. 327, 337, 807 A.2d 1075 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In <em>Barrett, </em>the plaintiff brought an action alleging that she was discharged from her employment in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a because she had exercised her rights to workers\u2019 compensation benefits prior to her discharge. Id., 328-29. The trial court had rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict for her employer, and the plaintiff appealed claiming certain instructional improprieties. Id., 329. The plaintiff contended that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury about the three step, burden shifting analysis that this court had adopted in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 53-54, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990), which is applicable in actions brought under \u00a7 31-290a.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hebrew Home &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 331. She specifically claimed that the trial court improperly directed an affirmative answer as to the second step of the analysis, which is whether the defendant had <em>produced </em>any non-retaliatory reason for discharging the plaintiff. Id., 336. The Appellate Court concluded that this was harmless error because \u201c [p]ursuant to the <em>Ford </em>test, if the plaintiff presents evidence that gives rise to a reasonable inference that her discharge was in retaliation for exercising workers\u2019 compensation rights, the burden of <em>production, 'not proof, </em>shifts to the defendant to rebut that presumption by providing evidence of a legitimate reason for terminating the plaintiffs employment. It is clear from the record that the defendant offered evidence of nonretaliatory reasons for the plaintiffs discharge. Consequently, the defendant met and satisfied its burden of production and, therefore, the court\u2019s direction to the jury regarding the second interrogatory was harmless under the facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We view the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hebrew Home &amp; Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 337, as a paradigmatic example of how an improper instruction on a party\u2019s burden of production generally is less likely to affect the jury\u2019s verdict. The court in <em>Barrett </em>recognized that, in the scheme of the overall burden of proof, the burden of production has a lesser impact on the fact-finding process than the burden of persuasion. See footnote 36 of this opinion. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Appellate Court emphasized in <em>Barrett </em>that the defendant\u2019s only responsibility was to produce evidence; accordingly, the plaintiff in that case was not harmed by the trial court\u2019s direction of an affirmative answer to that question because the defendant had introduced <em>some </em>evidence. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hebrew Home &amp; Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Having reviewed the record in the present case, we conclude that in light of <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hebrew Home &amp; Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 337, and the factors delineated in <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Owens-Elinois, Inc., </em>supra, 16 Cal. 4th 983, the improper instruction was not likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict here. Although the trial court did not expressly charge that a shift to the defendants of the burden of production was required, the record indicates that the <em>Anderson </em>sequence of proofs was in fact followed in the present case. First, the plaintiffs testified and presented certain documentary evidence in support of each of their claims. This was the plaintiffs\u2019 prima facie case under <em>Anderson. </em>Next, the defendants introduced evidence to rebut the plaintiffs\u2019 case, specifically the cross-examinations of the plaintiffs, the payroll charts, the calculations from the department\u2019s investigation and the testimony of Tama Brunoli and Lawrence Brunoli, Jr. The jury then evaluated the individual plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of each of the three projects during its deliberations,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> ultimately awarding damages to the plaintiffs for most of their claims.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The adversary system, therefore, per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>formed the function of the <em>Anderson </em>burden shift in the present case. Put differently, once the plaintiffs had introduced sufficient evidence to justify a fair and reasonable inference of their damages, the defendants\u2019 common sense and instinct for self-preservation compelled them to introduce admissible evidence in their possession that tended to refute or negate the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of unpaid wages. We also note that the trial court\u2019s charge as given emphasized that the plaintiffs did not need to prove the amounts of their unpaid wages with precision and exactitude. The policy expressed in <em>Anderson </em>of protecting employees, therefore, was realized. Accordingly, we conclude that the improper instruction was not likely to have affected the verdict and, therefore, was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES TO THE DEFENDANTS ON THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering four of the plaintiffs to pay attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants, after the defendants had prevailed on five of the statutory wrongful discharge claims brought by the plaintiffs. To best analyze this claim on appeal, we first discuss the plaintiffs\u2019 separate claims, which have different factual and legal predicates. We then analyze, in the context of each claim, whether the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants was justified. Finally, we will consider whether the trial court determined a proper fee amount. We ultimately conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>award of attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants for the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Wrongful Discharge Claims of Schoonmaker and Scheller</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of this claim. Schoonmaker worked for the defendants from April, 1994, until September, 1995. He and Scheller<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> brought claims of wrongful discharge against the defendants alleging that they were terminated, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> 31-51q<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and 31-73,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> for informing the foundation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>defendants\u2019 alleged failure to pay prevailing wages for public works projects and alleged record keeping failures.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The foundation is a private, nonprofit organization that investigates anonymous complaints of prevailing wage violations by contractors. It documents complaints before reporting them, on behalf of the employees, to the department. Schoonmaker complained to the foundation in the early summer of 1995. Schoonmaker testified that after he had complained to the foundation, personnel from the foundation physically investigated the job site at the Wolcott School project, and obtained documentation, including certified payrolls.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Schoonmaker testified that the presence of the foundation investigators at the Wolcott School site was not always obvious. The defendants terminated Schoonmaker\u2019s employment in September, 1995. Ultimately, questionnaires from the department inquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>about the defendants\u2019 wage practices circulated around the job sites in November, 1995; subsequent testimony revealed that the defendants became aware, at that time, of these questionnaires and the ongoing department investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the defendants moved for a directed verdict, claiming that Schoonmaker had not introduced any evidence in his case-in-chief suggesting that the defendants were aware, prior to terminating him, that he had complained to the foundation. In response, Schoonmaker contended that there was sufficient evidence, in the form of the circulated questionnaires, to support his claim. He did acknowledge, however, that he was terminated before the questionnaires were circulated, and that he had not introduced any evidence tending to prove that the defendants were aware that it was he who had filed the complaint with the foundation. Accordingly, the trial court ultimately did not submit Schoonmaker\u2019s wrongful discharge claims to the jury, a ruling that the plaintiffs took exception to.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Wrongful Discharge Claims of Berlepsch, Blejewski and Tanski</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Berlepsch, Blejewski and Tanski alleged they were terminated by the defendants, also in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m, 31-51q and 31-73, in retaliation for filing complaints with the department. Berlepsch<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and Tanski<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that they were laid off in November, 1995. Blejewski testified that he was laid off in December, 1995. Blejewski also testified that after he had received the questionnaire from the department in November, he was confronted by Lawrence Brunoli, Sr.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> He then testified that subsequent to this confrontation, he was laid off in December, 1995. All three of these plaintiffs filed complaint forms, to recover unpaid wages, with the department on January 30, 1996. Ultimately, the jury returned defendants\u2019 verdicts on the wrongful discharge claims of Berlepsch, Blejewski and Tanski.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Defendants\u2019 Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">After trial, the defendants moved, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 31-51m (c)<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and 31-51q,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> for a total of approximately $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the five wrongful discharge claims. The defendants contended that the claims of Schoonmaker and Scheller were frivolous because the complaint pleaded discharge as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>result of a complaint to the foundation, a private agency that does not fit the definition of a \u201c \u2018[p]ublic body\u2019 \u201d contained in \u00a7 31-51m (a). See footnote 9 of this opinion. The trial court ordered all of the plaintiffs, except for Blejewski, to pay attorney\u2019s fees. The court concluded that it \u201ccould not find ... a scintilla of evidence justifying the continuing, indeed the bringing of the claims for wrongful discharge by Scheller, Schoonmaker, Berlepsch and Tanski.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> It ordered these four plaintiffs to pay $3000 each, for a total award to the defendants of $12,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The Trial Court\u2019s Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees to the Defendants Was Justified and Not an Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Before delving into the specifics of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly awarded the defendants attorney\u2019s fees for the defense of the wrongful discharge claims, we first set forth the applicable standard of review. It is well established that we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Sorrentino </em>v. <em>All Seasons Services, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 756, 777, 717 A.2d 150 (1998). This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded; id.; and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. Cf. <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>240 Conn. 141, 154 and n.17, 691 A.2d 586 (1997) (under General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a [b], which \u201cprovides that the \u2018court may, in its discretion,\u2019 award reasonable fees to the prevailing party if the court determines that the agency acted \u2018without any substantial justification,\u2019 \u201d abuse of discretion standard applies to both award and \u201cpredicate determination\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that \u201cagency acted \u2018without any substantial justification\u2019 \u201d).

The plaintiffs further contend that mere failure of proof is not, by itself, grounds for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the employer. They state that this construction of \u00a7 31-51m (c) accords with the long standing \u201cAmerican rule\u201d that, \u201cexcept as provided by statute or in certain defined exceptional circumstances, the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee from the loser. ...

Though the trial court acknowledged that the frivolity of the claims was a \u201cclose question,\u201d there is ample support in the record for the court\u2019s ruling on this issue. Indeed, the complaint of Sehoonmaker and Scheller speaks for itself; it affirmatively pleaded that the plaintiffs complained to a private agency, while the statute providing the basis for their complaint expressly required a complaint to a defined \u201c \u2018[pjublic body\u2019 . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 31-51m (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Moreover, the claims of Berlepsch and Tanski were premised on retaliation for complaints to the department; they were terminated, however, <em>before </em>they had complained.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Indeed, Berlepsch was invited to return to work even <em>after </em>he had filed a complaint with the department. Moreover, we note the trial court\u2019s emphasis on the fact that the plaintiffs never afforded the jury the opportunity to link, without speculation, the department questionnaires with the termination of Berlepsch and Tanski.

Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the court improperly used different standards in determining the fee awards for the attorneys of each party. Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to defendants who came before it with \u201c \u2018unclean hands.\u2019 \u201d The defendants contend in response that the trial court properly exercised its discretion, and made an \u201c \u2018informed and logical decision\u2019 \u201d based on its personal observations, and the supporting materials. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the defendants a total of $12,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for their defense of these wrongful discharge claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The defendants, in their attorney\u2019s affidavit in support of their motion, requested $3000 per claimant in attorney\u2019s fees. The defendants\u2019 attorney claimed that of the total of $114,000 in fees incurred in defending all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this matter, approximately $15,000 arose from the defense of the five wrongful discharge claims. After setting forth the extensive civil litigation experience of defense counsel,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the affidavit stated that counsel billed the defendants for defense of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>matter at an hourly rate. The hourly rate was $190 for the defendants\u2019 primary counsel, and $130 to $150, depending on experience, for the work of counsel\u2019s associates. Counsel stated in the affidavit that, although he kept daily time records, with entry descriptions, he was unable to \u201cdetermine with any precision which portion of an entry was devoted to the defense of the wrongful discharge counts.\u201d Counsel did state, however, that with respect to the wrongful discharge claims, he needed to engage in discovery,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> preparation of opening and closing arguments, preparation of jury instructions, questioning of both parties\u2019 witnesses on direct and cross-examination, and participation in court-ordered mediation. At oral argument before the trial court, defense counsel stated that he used a \u201cgood faith allocation,\u201d based on his performance of these enumerated tasks, to arrive at his final estimate, and request, of $15,000 in fees. After determining that the plaintiffs, except for Blejewski, had \u201cno evidence and no justification for maintaining\u201d the wrongful discharge claims, the trial court granted the defendants $3000 in attorney\u2019s fees for each of the remaining four plaintiffs, arriving at a total award of $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We are mindful that \u201c[t]he amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion: A court has few duties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing counsel fees. The degree of delicacy increases when the matter becomes one of review on appeal. The principle of law, which is easy to state but difficult at times to apply, is that only in case of a clear abuse of discretion by the trier may we interfere. . . .

The defendants claim, in response, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was not raised in the trial court and, therefore, is not preserved for appellate review.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that the matter was preserved, and request, in the alternative, plain error review. We conclude that the plaintiffs failed to preserve this issue properly for appellate review, and also that plain error review is not warranted in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant for the disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The interest issue first arose when the jury, during deliberations, requested instructions on whether to consider interest on the wages due to the plaintiffs. At that time, the parties and the court briefly addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 31-72,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> by incorporating the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 31-265,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> would provide for an award of inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>est in the present case. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel initially had contended that \u00a7 31-72 provides for an award of interest, to be awarded by the court postverdict. After some discussion on the matter, the trial court concluded, and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel expressly agreed, that \u201c[t]he interest in the statute [\u00a7\u00a7 31-72 and 31-265] is on [a] failed contribution for a fund, which you indicated . . . you did not claim.\u201d The trial court subsequently instructed the jury to confine its inquiry solely to the amount of wages due the plaintiffs and the questions on the interrogatories, and not to consider extra matters such as calculations of attorney\u2019s fees or interest. Neither party excepted to this supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The issue of interest arose again after the jury returned its verdict. In addition to filing a motion pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 to double the verdict, the plaintiffs individually submitted motions for additur. These motions for additur, however, as the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged before the trial court, did not request the addition of interest to the verdicts awarded by the jury. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did state, however, that the request for interest was included in the postverdict memorandum of law, but not in the motion. Despite conceding that interest was not available by incorporating \u00a7 31-265 into \u00a7 31-72, the plaintiffs orally argued before the trial court that interest was, nevertheless, available because \u201cif there is recovery under a private lawsuit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>there is a right to interest on the back due wages.\u201d The trial court expressed its concern that both it, and the defendants, were unfairly deprived of notice of this claim because the plaintiffs failed to include it in a motion. The court then engaged in further discussion with the parties to confirm that the colloquy, prior to the supplemental jury instruction, solely was confined to the effect of \u00a7 31-265 on \u00a7 31-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">After this discussion, the plaintiffs then conceded, in response to questions from the trial court, that they had not made a motion for interest, and that the time for making such a motion had passed.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, moreover, acknowledged that \u201csince [the interest claim was not] raised in a motion, I can\u2019t pursue it.\u201d The plaintiffs then asked the court for a finding of wrongful detention of money under General Statutes \u00a7 31-73.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The court rejected this request, concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that this was a claim that was appropriate to raise earlier, for submission to the jury. The court noted that the plaintiffs neither requested nor excepted to its failure to submit this issue to the jury for a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The trial court then attempted to clarify whether the plaintiffs were abandoning their interest claims. At this point, the plaintiffs reiterated their position that interest, calculated in accordance with \u00a7 31-265, is to be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs under \u00a7 31-72. Finally, in response to questioning from the trial court, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that he could not recall if he had raised that argument during the trial. The trial court then stated its \u201cvery clear recollection\u201d that the issue had not been raised during the trial. The plaintiffs then again admitted that they had not appropriately raised the issue by a postverdict motion. Finally, the court asked: \u201c[I]f I were to grant interest, how would I do that without trampling on the [defendants\u2019] rights, since there is no motion, you abandoned the claim during trial, and there was no request to submit to the jury the wrongful detention of money under [\u00a7] 31-73 (a)?\u201d The plaintiffs counsel concluded this discussion by answering the court\u2019s question: \u201cBecause it\u2019s provided for in [\u00a7] 31-72, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We conclude that this issue is not preserved for appellate review because, by not filing the appropriate motion for an award of interest, the plaintiffs denied the trial court the opportunity to act and correct any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>potential error. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that \u201c [t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. ...\u201d Indeed, it is the appellant\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to present such a claim clearly to the trial court so that the trial court may consider it and, if it is meritorious, take appropriate action. That is the basis for the requirement that ordinarily [the appellant] must raise in the trial court the issues that he intends to raise on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jonathan S., </em>260 Conn. 494, 505, 798 A.2d 963 (2002). For us \u201c[t]o review [a] claim, which has been articulated for the first time on appeal and not before the trial court, would result in a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge. . . . We have repeatedly indicated our disfavor with the failure, whether because of a mistake of law, inattention or design, to object to errors occurring in the course of a trial until it is too late for them to be corrected, and thereafter, if the outcome of the trial proves unsatisfactory, with the assignment of such errors as grounds of appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simmons </em>v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the interest issue was not properly preserved for appellate review, and we decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cappeal by ambuscade\u201d by considering the merits of this issue.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <em>In re Jonathan S., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">CROSS APPEAL: DEPARTURE FROM CONTINGENCY FEE AGREEMENT IN DETERMINING ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The defendants\u2019 first claim in their cross appeal is that, in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 31-72,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the trial court abused its discretion by deviating from the plaintiffs\u2019 contingency fee agreement. Specifically, the defendants contend that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sorrentino </em>v. <em>All Seasons Services, Inc., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 773-77, a trial court calculating an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees abuses its discretion by departing from a contingency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>fee agreement, without first finding that agreement unreasonable by its terms. The plaintiffs claim, in response, that the application of the <em>Sorrentino </em>reasonableness inquiry is limited to the ultimate fee calculation, and not to the terms of the agreement itself. They also contend that the defendants\u2019 application of <em>Sorrentino </em>frustrates the legislative purposes of \u00a7 31-72, which are to punish the employer and make the injured employee whole. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in its attorney\u2019s fee determination by improperly departing from the contingency fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant for the disposition of this claim. Following the trial, the plaintiffs submitted a motion pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 requesting attorney\u2019s fees in a total amount in excess of $222,000. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion was accompanied by a supporting affidavit, memorandum of law, time records and a contingency fee and retainer contract. In their affidavit, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys stated an hourly rate of $200 per hour for out-of-court work, and $250 per hour for in-court argument, jury selection and trial. The affidavit stated that, under those rates, they had incurred $83,689 in fees from March, 1995, through November, 2000; $42,183 in fees from December, 2000, through January 3, 2001; and more than $100,000 between January 3,2001, and January 29,2001, a period that included the trial of the case. The contingency fee agreement provided for payment to the attorneys of one third (33.3 percent) of any gross recovery.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> After the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to double the jury awards, as reduced by the court for the amounts that had been awarded for the Wolcott School claims, the gross recovery was $14,436.28. One third of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that amount would have yielded a contingency fee of approximately $4812.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The trial court granted, over the defendants\u2019 objection, attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs in the amount of $39,750. In so ruling, the trial court heard arguments from the parties regarding the application of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sorrentino. </em>The trial court also considered the individual entries on the billing records of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Ultimately, the court arrived at the award of $39,750, concluding that many of the pretrial hours were overbilled,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> and devaluing them accordingly.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The trial court also stated that \u201c[t]he allocation of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is not really complicated by the existence of the contingency fee agreement. . . . [I]t would be unreasonable to impose a contingency fee limitation on the reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In reviewing the defendants\u2019 claim, we are mindful of the \u201cdelicate nature\u201d of the trial court\u2019s duty in calculating reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and that \u201c[t]he amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion. . . .

The trial court, however, awarded only $30,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, concluding that the billing records submitted by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>did not justify the higher fee. Id., 774. The plaintiff appealed from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On appeal, this court, after considering the factors for reasonableness of a fee as set forth by rule 1.5 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> held that \u201c[a] trial court should not depart from a reasonable fee agreement in the absence of a persuasive demonstration that enforcing the agreement would result in substantial unfairness to the defendant.\u201d Id., 776. The court stated that the agreement itself was reasonable, and concluded that the billing practices that the trial court found objectionable, which included billing for the services of non-lawyers and two attorneys billing separately for their services, were not \u201csustainable grounds\u201d for departing from the fee agreement; accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in doing so. Id., 776-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We conclude that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sorrentino, </em>when a contingency fee agreement exists, a two step analysis is required to determine whether a trial court permissibly may depart from it in awarding a reasonable fee pursuant to statute or contract. The trial court first must analyze the terms of the agreement itself.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Id., 774. If the agreement is, by its terms, reasonable,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the trial court may depart from its terms only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>when necessary to prevent \u201csubstantial unfairness\u201d to the party, typically a defendant, who bears the ultimate responsibility for payment of the fee.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Id., 776. By con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trast, if the trial court concludes that the agreement is, by its terms, unreasonable, it may exercise its discretion and award a reasonable fee in accordance with the factors enumerated in rule 1.5 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. See footnote 60 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly departed from the terms of the contingency fee agreement in awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. In rendering its decision, the court did not first consider the reasonableness of the underlying contingency fee agreement, stating instead that \u201c[i]t would be unreasonable to impose a contingency fee limitation on the reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d This ruling, therefore, violated both the letter and spirit of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sorrentino </em>by not giving the existing contingency fee agreement its due regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The plaintiffs, citing the legislative purpose of \u00a7 31-72, claim that limiting the attorney\u2019s fees to the amount set forth by the contingency fee agreement interferes with the legislative purpose of punishing employers and making employees whole under \u00a7 31-72. We disagree with this contention because, although we previously have acknowledged the punitive and remedial purposes of \u00a7 31-72; <em>Shortt v. New Milford Police Dept., </em>212 Conn. 294, 309 n.13, 562 A.2d 7 (1989); the plaintiffs\u2019 argument incorrectly confuses adequate compensation for unpaid employees with windfall compensation for those employees\u2019 attorneys. We do not disagree that the double damages provision of \u00a7 31-72 was intended to punish employers and make employees whole. The double damages provision, however, is a monetary award sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>rate and apart from that of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 31-72. As long as the court awards attorney\u2019s fees that are sufficient to cover a plaintiffs financial obligations to his or her attorney, such as an existing contingency fee agreement, the employee still will be made whole by the award of double damages. We, therefore, deem disingenuous the notion that a fee award that is disappointing to the plaintiffs attorney has any relation to the act of compensating the plaintiff himself or herself.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that, in awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court abused its discretion by improperly departing from the terms of the contingency fee agreement that existed between the plaintiffs and their counsel.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">CROSS APPEAL: ACCORD AND SATISFACTION OF UCONN PROJECT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendants\u2019 second claim in their cross appeal is that the trial court improperly failed to grant their motion to set aside the verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the claims of Berlepsch, Gianelli and Tanski that arose out of the UCONN project. Specifically, the defendants contend that, under the evidence presented at trial, the only reasonable conclusion the jury could have arrived at is that those claims were settled, and therefore, barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. The plaintiffs contend, in response, that sufficient evidence was introduced at trial to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. We conclude that the trial court properly refused to grant the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict on the claims of Berlepsch, Gianelli and Tanski arising out of the UCONN project.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for the resolution of the defendants\u2019 claim. The defendants pleaded as a special defense that the claims of Berlepsch, Gianelli and Tanski arising out of the UCONN project were barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. Pechie, the department\u2019s director of wage enforcement, and Barrachina, a department supervisor, testified that after an employee submits a wage claim to the department by completing a complaint form, the department investigates and attempts, when appropriate, to collect the unpaid wage claims. They testified that if the department\u2019s collection efforts were unsuccessful, the department would refer the claims to the attorney general\u2019s office. Barrachina testified that, in the present case, the department investigated the UCONN project claims of Berlepsch, Gianelli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and Tanski, and concluded that the defendants owed them $1812.45, $622.45 and $947.43, respectively. The department subsequently referred those claims to the attorney general\u2019s office for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Thereafter, Assistant Attorney General Glenn Woods, who routinely represented the department in its collection efforts, sent a letter, dated July 23, 1996, to the defendants\u2019 attorneys. In this letter, Woods advised the defendants\u2019 counsel that on June 14, 1996, he had received payments, from the defendants to the three plaintiffs, in the previously mentioned amounts. Specifically, the letter stated that Woods \u201cconfirmfed] that the Attorney General and the [department] have been assigned the claims of the aforementioned three claimants. Further, the payments for these individuals are accepted in full satisfaction of all outstanding wage claims, with regard to these three claimants, pertaining to the [UCONN project].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The plaintiffs testified, however, that they did not agree with the settlement negotiated by the attorney general\u2019s office; they, therefore, did not accept or cash the checks sent to that office by the defendants.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Berlepsch testified that he had received a check from the defendants in the amount of $1812.45, the amount that the department concluded he was owed. Berlepsch testified that he turned the check over to his attorney and, subsequently, initiated the present action. Tanski was more elusive in his testimony; he testified that there was a \u201cpossibility,\u201d that he had received, and given to his attorney, two checks from the defendants, in the total amount of $947.43.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The plaintiffs initiated this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>action in March, 1996, and filed a revised complaint in August, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on these claims on the ground that the claims were barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. The trial court denied this motion and, subsequently, submitted these claims and the accord and satisfaction defense to the jury. The jury concluded that the defendants had failed to pay these plaintiffs the proper prevailing wages for work performed at the UCONN project, and also found that the defendants had failed to prove that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were settled or released. The jury then awarded damages to each of the plaintiffs in the amounts that they had found the plaintiffs were underpaid. Thereafter, the defendants moved to set aside these verdicts. In ruling on this motion, the trial court concluded that this was a factual issue and deferred to the jury\u2019s findings, stating that it was not convinced there was no reasonable basis for the verdict. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u201cWe begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs the review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside the verdict. Such review involves a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion, according great weight to the action of the trial court and indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of its correctness ... . since the trial judge has had the same opportunity as the jury to view the witnesses, to assess their credibility and to determine the weight that should be given to their evidence. . . . [A trial court may] set aside a verdict where it finds it has made, in its instructions, rulings on evidence, or otherwise in the course of the trial, a palpable error which was harmful to the proper disposition of the case and probably brought about a different result in the verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>omitted.) <em>Bovat </em>v. Waterbury, 258 Conn. 574, 583, 783 A.2d 1001 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The hornbook Connecticut law governing the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, as recently set forth by this court in <em>B &amp; B Bail Bonds Agency of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>256 Conn. 209, 212-13, 770 A.2d 960 (2001), provides an appropriate background for resolving the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion to set aside the verdict. \u201cWhen there is a good faith dispute about the existence of a debt or about the amount that is owed, the common law authorizes the debtor and the creditor to negotiate a contract of accord to settle the outstanding claim. ... An accord is a contract under which an obligee promises to accept a stated performance in satisfaction of the obligor\u2019s existing duty. . . . <em>Upon acceptance of the offer of accord, the creditor\u2019s receipt of the promised, payment discharges the underlying debt and bars any further claim relating thereto, </em>if the contract is supported by consideration. . . . Although the case law presents the more usual use of accord and satisfaction as a defense by the debtor against the creditor, it is evident that accord and satisfaction equally applies to both parties. Accord and satisfaction is a method of discharging a claim whereby the parties agree to give and accept something other than that which is due in settlement of the claim and to perform the agreement.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Indeed, a validly executed accord and satisfaction precludes a party from \u201cpursuing any action involving the original, underlying claim.\u201d Id., 213. The defendant bears the burden of proving accord and satisfaction when it is pleaded as a special defense. <em>Prishwalko </em>v. <em>Bob Thomas Ford, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 575, 589, 636 A.2d 1383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Under this basic framework, the dispositive issue thus becomes whether the plaintiffs\u2019 retention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>checks, without cashing them, constituted acceptance of the defendants\u2019 offer of accord, <em>la. Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>186 Conn. 618, 622, 442 A.2d 1355 (1982),<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> this court concluded that \u201cthe mere retention of a conditional check\u201d does not, by itself, constitute acceptance of an offer of accord.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201c[w]hen a creditor immediately and fully explains the grounds for his retention of a conditional check, and when a debtor acquiesces in that retention, there is no reason of policy to find that the creditor has agreed to accept an offer of accord which he expressly has rejected.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of the UCONN project, particularly in light of the conflicting evidence presented to the jury, and the relevant law of accord and satisfaction as articulated in <em>B &amp; B Bail Bonds Agency of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 212-13, <em>and Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 622. The trial court properly deferred to the jury\u2019s factual determination. Inasmuch as there is a reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s verdict on this issue, particularly that the tendered checks were never cashed, and the close temporal proximity between the settlement efforts and subsequent action, we abide by our well established \u201cdisinclin[ation] to disturb jury verdicts, and . . . accord great deference to the vantage of the trial judge, who possesses a unique opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses. . . . The concurrence of the judgments of the [trial] judge and the jury . . . is apowerful argument for upholding the verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Griffin Health Services Corp., </em>249 Conn. 523, 534, 733 A.2d 197 (1999). We conclude that the trial court properly determined that there was a reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the claims arising out of the UCONN project and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiffs on the claims arising out of the Wolcott School project, and for further proceedings as to the determination of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\"> The plaintiffs appealed, and the defendants cross appealed, from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court.

In <em>Fabri </em>v. <em>United Technologies, International, Inc., </em>193 F. Sup. 2d 480, 484-85 (D. Conn. 2002), the jury had awarded, under a Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) claim, the plaintiffs $500,000 in punitive damages, and $1 in nominal damages. The plaintiffs then moved for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,583,002.26, pursuant to CUTPA, General Statutes \u00a7 42-llOg (d). Id., 482. The plaintiffs had a contingency fee agreement providing for a fee of 35 percent of the plaintiffs\u2019 total recovery. Id., 483. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs\u2019 award should be capped by the agreement. Id. The District Court rejected that contention, relying on the plain language of \u00a7 42-110g (d), which provides that \u201c \u2018[t]he court, may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable <em>attorneys\u2019fees based on the work reasonably performed, by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">In its analysis, the District Court considered the defendants\u2019 claim that, under <em>Sorrentino, </em>the court should not depart from the contingency fee agreements. The court distinguished <em>Sorrentino, </em>based on the differences in statutory language providing for attorney\u2019s fees, between the two cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Id., 484. The court, however, also stated that \u201c[e]ven construing <em>Sorrentino </em>to apply to all state fee statutes, it holds at best that contingent fee agreements are a floor to a reasonable award.\u201d It stated that application of the <em>Sorrentino </em>rule in this manner protects the plaintiffs jury award by ensuring that the fees ordered are sufficient to cover the plaintiffs financial obligation, under the contingency fee agreement, to its attorney. Id., 484-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> Indeed, when the double damages provision was added in 1978 to \u00a7 31-72 as Public Acts 1978, No. 78-358, \u00a7 2, the attorney\u2019s fee provision already had been part of the statute for more than twenty-five years. See Public Acts 1951, No. 70. Neither the language of the 1951 enactment, nor its legislative history, indicate a legislative purpose beyond that of authorizing employees, or the labor commissioner acting on their behalf, to institute civil actions for the collection of unpaid wages.

Proc., Pt. 2,1951 Sess., p. 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> This conclusion is consistent with the element of measured risk that underlies the use of contingency fees. Indeed, as Professor Lester Brickman notes: \u201cThe most commonly cited historic justification for the contingent fee is its function as a financing device that enables a client to assert and prosecute an otherwise unaffordable claim. Today, however, even a client who can afford an hourly fee may prefer a contingent fee if the client is sufficiently risk-averse. The contingent fee functions as a hedge: the client\u2019s exposure to loss is limited by the attorney\u2019s assumption of the fee risk, while the client\u2019s potential gain is also limited by the \u2018sale\u2019 of a percentage of the claim to the attorney. Thus, risk sharing has emerged as a complementary justification for contingent fees.\u201d L.

The debtors\u2019 acquiescence is demonstrated by the uncontradicted evidence that the defendants\u2019 attorney, upon inquiry whether the plaintiffs should hold the disputed checks, replied that the plaintiffs should do what they wanted. Furthermore, the defendants, fully on notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 intentions, never requested the return of their checks. Finally, the defendants chose not to avail themselves of their right to stop payment on the checks . . . which would have allowed them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>full access to the funds covered by the disputed checks.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 622-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
