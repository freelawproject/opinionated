(defendant), filed a writ of error with this court claiming that the trial court improperly refused to enjoin an execution of ejectment against her. We conclude that a tenant must be joined as a party to the foreclosure action in order to be ejected pursuant to \u00a7 49-22 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. In July, 1999, the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title brought a mortgage foreclosure action against Enid Mullings, the owner of property located at 762 Woodin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Street in Hamden (property).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In conjunction with the foreclosure, the defendant\u2019s predecessor filed a lis pen-dens against the property in the Hamden land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">A judgment of strict foreclosure was rendered on October 15, 2001, and the initial law date was scheduled for December 17, 2001. On November 1, 2001, after the foreclosure action had gone to judgment but prior to the expiration of the law days, Muilings entered into a written lease with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff and her six children took occupancy of the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff was unaware of the foreclosure action when she signed the lease and moved into the property. The plaintiff was never added as a party to the foreclosure action, and the defendant did not foreclose the plaintiffs interest as an omitted party pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-30.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Thereafter, an execution of ejectment was issued against Mullings and was served on the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The execution of ejectment was scheduled to be enforced on February 15, 2002, nine days after the plaintiff received notice of the ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On February 11, 2002, the plaintiff moved to enjoin the execution of ejectment. After a hearing, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to enjoin but stayed the execution of ejectment until May 1, 2002. The trial court further ordered payment of use and occupancy in accordance with the lease as a condition of the stay. The plaintiff then filed this writ of error with this court on February 28, 2002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After oral argument on the writ of error, this court was notified in a letter from the plaintiffs attorney that the plaintiff had vacated the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In her writ of error, the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 49-22 (a) prohibits her ejectment because she was not made a party to the foreclosure action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the present case for multiple reasons. It further claims that the plaintiff has failed to provide an adequate record for this writ of error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>vacated the property, we must consider the threshold jurisdictional issue of mootness before addressing the parties\u2019 remaining claims. We conclude that the writ of error is moot but that it nonetheless comes within the exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are capable of repetition yet evading review. We further conclude that we properly have jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims. We therefore reach the merits of the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 49-22 (a) prohibits her ejectment because she was not made a party to the foreclosure. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that the present writ of error is moot as a result of the plaintiff having vacated the property. Both parties agree that, although the plaintiffs claim is moot because this court can render no practical relief, we should nevertheless consider the merits of the issue raised by the plaintiff in the present writ because it is capable of repetition yet evading review. We agree with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\u201cWhen, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the merits, a case has become moot. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cWe note that an otherwise moot question may qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception. To do so, however, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, [the writ of error] must be dismissed as moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Steven M., </em>264 Conn. 747, 754-55, 826 A.2d 156 (2003); accord <em>Conetta </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>246 Conn. 281, 295-96, 715 A.2d 756 (1998). We conclude that the present case meets all three requirements for review under the capable of repetition yet evading review exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">First, we determine that most cases addressing the issue of the ejectment of a tenant who took possession after the filing of a lis pendens without making the tenant a party to the foreclosure would become moot before appellate litigation could be resolved. \u201cIf an action or its effects is not of inherently limited duration, the action can be reviewed the next time it arises, when it will present an ongoing live controversy. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>if the question presented is not strongly likely to become moot in the substantial majority of cases in which it arises, the urgency of deciding the pending case is significantly reduced.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 383-84, 660 A.2d 323 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The issue raised in the present writ is necessarily limited in its duration because there is a strong likelihood that the foreclosing lender will obtain possession of the property through actions that are more expeditious than the appeal or writ of error routes. The lender can obtain possession from the tenant by bringing a summary process action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and successfully obtaining judgment while a writ of error is pending concerning the execution of ejectment. A summary process action is expeditious because the pleadings must advance every three days.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Alternatively, the lender can bring a foreclosure action against the tenant as an omitted party pursuant to \u00a7 49-30.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because it is unlikely that a tenant will have a defense to the summary process action or the foreclosure, these proceedings are likely to be resolved more quickly than an appeal or writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The present writ of error also satisfies the second requirement for the capable of repetition yet evading review exception. \u201cA requirement of the likelihood that a question will recur is an integral component of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>capable of repetition, yet evading review doctrine. In the absence of the possibility of such repetition, there would be no justification for reaching the issue, as a decision would neither provide relief in the present case nor prospectively resolve cases anticipated in the future.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The issue raised by the plaintiff in the present writ already is recurring in other cases. Several ejectment cases raising issues similar to that in the present writ currently are pending in the Superior Court. See <em>Washington Mutual </em>v. <em>Greengas, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV02-0459598S; <em>Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV01-0455341S. The existence of these similar cases demonstrates that a decision in the present writ of error prospectively will resolve other pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Finally, the issue raised in the present writ also meets the public importance requirement. \u201cSince judicial resources are scarce, and typically reserved for cases that continue to be contested between the litigants, this court does not review every issue that satisfies the criteria of limited duration and likelihood of recurrence. Consideration of the importance of the issue represents a sound means for distinguishing those cases that should be reviewed and those that should not.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 387. The present writ of error calls for us to determine the respective rights of a foreclosing lender and a tenant in possession of the foreclosed property, an issue of obvious public importance given the number of foreclosure cases brought in the courts of this state each year. We, therefore, conclude that, although moot, the claim raised by the plaintiff in the present writ is capable of repetition yet evading review.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We next must consider the remaining jurisdictional claims raised by the defendant, however, we find no merit to any of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The defendant first asserts that this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the present writ of error because the ruling at issue in the writ is not a final judgment. Specifically, the defendant claims that the plaintiffs motion to enjoin the ejectment was an application for a temporary injunction, and the denial of such a motion is not an appealable final judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our examination of this issue. The lack of a final judgment implicates the authority of this court to hear the writ of error because it is a jurisdictional defect. See <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985); <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 284, 355 A.2d 255 (1974). \u201cA determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>263 Conn. 74, 81, 818 A.2d 758 (2003); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>262 Conn. 276, 286, 811 A.2d 705 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">\u201cThe statutory right to [a writ of error] is limited to appeals by aggrieved parties from final judgments. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-263, 51-197a; see Practice Book \u00a7 [72-1]. Because our jurisdiction over appeals, both criminal and civil, is prescribed by statute, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>always determine the threshold question of whether the [writ of error] is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 455 A.2d 852 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 454 A.2d 720 (1983) ....</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cIn both criminal and civil cases, however, we have determined certain interlocutory orders and rulings of the Superior Court to be final judgments for purposes of appeal. An otherwise interlocutory order is appeal-able in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 99, 425 A.2d 574 (1979).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30-31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion to enjoin the ejectment is a final judgment within the meaning of \u00a7 52-263<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because the order so concluded the rights of the plaintiff that further proceedings could not affect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The second prong of the two part test for finality under <em>Curdo </em>focuses on the nature of the right at issue. \u201cIt requires the parties seeking to appeal to establish that the trial court\u2019s order threatens the preservation of a right already secured to them and that that right will be irretrievably lost and the [party] irreparably harmed unless they may immediately appeal. . . . Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the [appellant] must do more than show that the trial court\u2019s decision threatens him with irreparable harm. The [appellant] must show that that decision threatens to abrogate a right that he or she <em>then </em>holds.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Veterans Memorial Medical Center, </em>262 Conn. 730, 734-35, 818 A.2d 731 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">At the time of the hearing on her motion to enjoin the ejectment, the plaintiff had \u00e1 right to possession of the property with her family pursuant to a valid lease. The trial court determined that the plaintiff could be ejected, and would thereby lose her right to possession. After the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion, and the expiration of the stay ordered by the court, no further hearing or proceeding could affect or change her right to possession, which was fully determined by the trial court. The trial court\u2019s action therefore was appealable under the second prong of <em>Curdo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Next, the defendant claims that the plaintiffs requested injunctive relief was an improper attempt to open a judgment of foreclosure after title to the property had vested in the defendant, and thus, that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our examination of this issue. As we previously set forth in part IIA of this opinion, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Accordingly, our review is plenary. See <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>261 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>585, 595, 804 A.2d 170 (2002); <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 594, 726 A.2d 502 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The defendant bases its claim that the plaintiffs request for an injunction was an improper attempt to open a judgment of foreclosure on General Statutes \u00a7 49-15 (a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which precludes opening a judgment of strict foreclosure once title has vested in an encumbrancer. This court has elucidated in the past, however, that title to property and possession of that property are separate questions. <em>First Federal Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Whitney Development Corp., </em>237 Conn. 679, 690, 677 A.2d 1363 (1996). \u201cIndeed, courts have recognized that, in equity, title and possession of premises may not automatically be linked.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 690-91. A party can obtain title through a foreclosure action without also obtaining the right to possession. Id., 690. Thus, in the present writ, we can consider the defendant\u2019s right to possession of the property without opening the judgment of foreclosure or jeopardizing the defendant\u2019s title to the property. The defendant, therefore, has failed to establish that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">We now turn to the principal issue raised in this writ of error. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 49-22 (a) prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the issuance of an execution of ejectment against a tenant who was not named as a party to the foreclosure action. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Resolution of this issue requires that we construe the meaning of \u00a7 49-22 (a). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201chi performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201c[T]he plaintiffs claim presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>W &amp; D Acquisition, LLC </em>v. <em>First Union National Bank, </em>262 Conn. 704, 709, 817 A.2d 91 (2003); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 589, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We begin our analysis with the text of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 49-22 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action brought for the foreclosure of a mortgage or lien upon land, or for any equitable relief in relation to land, the plaintiff may, in his complaint, demand possession of the land, and the court may, if it renders judgment in his favor and finds that he is entitled to the possession of the land, issue execution of ejectment, commanding the officer to eject the person or persons in possession of the land and to put in possession thereof the plaintiff or the party to the foreclosure entitled to the possession by the provisions of the decree of said court, <em>provided no execution shall issue against any person in possession who is not a party to the action except a transferee or lienor who is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens. . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The language of \u00a7 49-22 (a) therefore prohibits the ejectment of any person not a party to the foreclosure unless such person is a \u201ctransferee\u201d or \u201clienor.\u201d The terms \u201ctransferee\u201d and \u201clienor\u201d are not defined in the statute. The defendant contends that the plaintiff is a transferee of a possessory interest in the property who can be ejected under \u00a7 49-22 (a) despite not having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>been made a party to the foreclosure action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The key to understanding the portion of \u00a7 49-22 (a) that is at issue before us is found in the legislative history of an amendment to the statute enacted in 1984. Number 84-539 of the 1984 Public Acts (P.A. 84-539) was adopted in response to <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 70, 462 A.2d 393 (1982), a Superior Court decision concerning the rights of tenants in a mortgage foreclosure action. In <em>Hite, </em>the court enjoined an execution of ejectment against tenants under an oral, month-to-month lease who had not been named as parties to the foreclosure action, finding that the lis pendens filed in the land records did not give adequate notice of the foreclosure to the tenants. Id., 77-78. The court ruled that the tenants\u2019 constitutional due process rights were violated because they were deprived of notice and an opportunity to be heard during the foreclosure action. Id., 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cIn 1984, the law revision commission proposed four alternate amendments to \u00a7 49-22 to the judiciary committee. These proposals were intended <em>to strengthen the due process rights of a mortgagor\u2019s tenant upon foreclosure </em>in response to a Superior Court decision; [id.] 79; declaring the [then] existing provision unconstitutional. See Law Revision Commission, Ninth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly (1983) pp. H-2 to H-28.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>First Federal Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Whitney Development Corp., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 692.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Prior to the 1984 amendment, \u00a7 49-22 (a) provided in part that \u201cno execution shall issue against any person in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>who is not a party to the action unless the person is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens. . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 49-22 (a). Public Act 84-539 deleted the phrase \u201cunless the person\u201d and inserted \u201cexcept a transferee or lienor who,\u201d thus bringing that subsection of the statute to its current form, which limits the availability of an execution of ejectment to persons in possession who are parties to the action, or to a party not in possession who is \u201ca transferee or lienor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The comments of proponents of P.A. 84-539 during the legislative floor debate made clear that the amendment, which was set forth in Substitute House Bill No. 5826, was intended to prohibit the ejectment of tenants in a foreclosure action unless the tenant was made a party to that action. See 27 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1984 Sess., p. 2767, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.; 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1984 Sess., p. 3131, remarks of Representative Martin M. Looney. During the introduction of the bill, Senator Owens stated: \u201cOn the bill itself . . . it would prohibit ejectment of any person who is in possession of real estate such as a tenant unless such person is named as a party to the foreclosure lawsuit.\u201d 27 S. Proc., supra, p. 2767. Similarly, Representative Looney stated: \u201cUnder existing law ... in any action to foreclosure a mortgage or lien against land, the court may if the foreclosing party is entitled to gain possession of the land . . . order tha[t] an officer, normally a sheriff, may eject any person in possession of the land. This bill would prohibit the ejectment of any person who is in possession of the real estate, such as a tenant, unless such person is named as a party to the foreclosure lawsuit. Under existing law, a person in possession who\u2019s not a party to the foreclosure, such as a tenant, may be ejected if the foreclosing party had filed a notice ... on the land records.\u201d 27 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 3131.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The provision excepting \u201ca transferee or lienor\u201d was added to Substitute House Bill No. 5826 during floor debate in the Senate. The purpose of this amendment was to make clear that despite the fact that \u00a7 49-22 would now provide that no one would be subject to ejectment unless made a party to the foreclosure action, this provision would not protect transferees or lienors who were bound by the judgment because of the filing of a lis pendens. The amendment was taken up first and at that time, Senator Owens stated that \u201c[i]t just simply provides ... an exception for the transferee or lienor with respect to this ftiatter.\u201d 27 S. Proc., supra, p. 2767. When the bill <em>as amended </em>was taken up immediately thereafter, Senator Owens made the remarks that we cited previously, stating that tenants would need to be made parties to the foreclosure in order to be ejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">When Substitute House Bill No. 5826, as amended, was discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives thereafter, Representative Richard D. Tulisano described the purpose of the bill\u2019s amendment. \u201cObviously this amendment will change the file copy to some extent to make sure that someone who is a party to the action, say an owner, cannot then transfer to another in order to evade being evicted or ejected from the property.\u201d 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1984 Sess., p. 6624. We conclude, on the basis of these clear statements of legislative purpose, that the provision in \u00a7 49-22 (a) excepting transferees or lienors was not intended to apply to tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Moreover, we note that the construction of the statute urged by the defendant is illogical. To construe transferees or lienors as including tenants would render P.A. 84-539 wholly meaningless, in that the protection for tenants specifically intended by the legislation would then be vitiated by the amendment regarding transferees or lienors. We will not construe a statute so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>effect an absurd result. See <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 177, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We further note that our Appellate Court has interpreted \u00a7 49-22 in the same manner as we do. In <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Van Sickle, </em>52 Conn. App. 37, 42, 726 A.2d 600 (1999), the Appellate Court stated: \u201c[A] foreclosing mortgagee . . . has two options for obtaining possession of premises from a tenant. The mortgagee can name the tenant as a party in the foreclosure action and obtain a judgment of ejectment pursuant to ... \u00a7 49-22, or after obtaining title, the mortgagee can proceed with a summary process action pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 47a-23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. First, the defendant contends that General Statutes \u00a7 52-325,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which provides for the filing of a lis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>pendens in conjunction with a foreclosure action, contradicts \u00a7 49-22 (a). We do not agree. Section 52-325 addresses the proper procedure for the filing of a lis pendens; it does not address the ejectment of tenants. \u201c[I]t is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling. . . . The provisions of one statute which specifically focus on a particular problem will always, in the absence of express contrary legislative intent, be held to prevail over provisions of a different statute more general in its coverage.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 133-34, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); accord <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Second, the defendant suggests that \u00a7 49-22 (a) makes a distinction between tenants whose lease began before the lis pendens was filed and tenants whose lease began after the lis pendens was filed, and contends that a mortgagee should not be responsible for naming a tenant as a party after the lis pendens was filed. It is apparent, however, that the text of \u00a7 49-22 (a) makes no distinction between a tenant who takes possession before the filing of a lis pendens and one who takes possession after the filing of a lis pendens.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Additionally, the legislative history of \u00a7 52-325 establishes that the legislature chose not to recognize such a distinction. The initial proposal raised by the judiciary committee made the distinction that the defendant urges; however, the committee subsequently rejected that language. The initial proposal suggested amending \u00a7 52-325 to provide that, \u201c[a]ny person who, <em>prior to the recording of a lis </em>pendens, is in possession of the property . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Raised Committee Bill No. 5826,1984 Sess. The judiciary committee affirmatively chose not to report this language out to the General Assembly.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The defendant\u2019s third contention is that if the mortgagee is required to name a tenant as a party to the foreclosure action, it imposes an unfair burden on the mortgagee, requiring it to verily repeatedly who is occupying the property. We disagree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is not unduly burdensome to require foreclosing lenders to verify the occupancy of the property. As the court in <em>Hite </em>recognized, tenants have a property right in possessing the premises that is subject to constitutional protection. <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 74. A foreclosing mortgagee must, during the foreclosure, be cognizant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>of the constitutional right of tenants in possession of the property. Alternatively, the mortgagee may proceed with a summary process action against the tenant after acquiring title to the property. General Statutes \u00a7 47 a-26h (a)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> provides the finality that lenders seek by making the summary process judgment binding on any tenant taking occupancy after service of a valid notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Although we have addressed the issue raised by the plaintiff in the present writ of error under the exception to the mootness doctrine for issues capable of repetition yet evading review, this matter is nevertheless moot because the plaintiff has vacated the property. Accordingly, we must dismiss the writ of error as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-22 (a) provides: \u201cIn any action brought for the foreclosure of a mortgage or lien upon land, or for any equitable relief in relation to land, the plaintiff may, in his complaint, demand possession of the land, and the court may, if it renders judgment in his favor and finds that he is entitled to the possession of the land, issue execution of ejectment, commanding the officer to eject the person or persons in possession of the land and to put in possession thereof the plaintiff or the party to the foreclosure entitled to the possession by the provisions of the decree of said court, provided no execution shall issue against any person in possession who is not a party to the action except a transferee or lienor who is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens.

In that regard, it should be noted that most residential leases require only [thirty] days notice to terminate or in the alternative, [five] days upon service of a notice to quit to vacate the premises. . . . Simply put, no evidence was offered if [the plaintiff] would be irreparably harmed by being ejected on May 1, 2002, after having over [two] months to find alternative housing.\u201d The harm to the plaintiff, however, is that she improperly would be ejected from the premises, contrary to the provisions of her leasehold interest; the harm is not eliminated by the possibility of her receiving alternate housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf, at the expiration of the three days prescribed in section 47a-23, the lessee or occupant neglects or refuses to quit possession or occupancy of the premises, any commissioner of the Superior Court may issue a writ, summons and complaint which shall be in the form and nature of an ordinary writ, summons and complaint in a civil process, but which shall set forth facts justifying a judgment for immediate possession or occupancy of the premises and make a claim for possession or occupancy of the premises. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 47a-26c provides: \u201cAll pleadings, including motions, shall advance at least one step within each successive period of three days from the preceding pleading or motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> The plaintiffs motion for an order to enjoin the ejectment does not state whether the injunctive relief sought was temporary or permanent.

The plaintiff could not appeal from the foreclosure judgment because she was not a party to the foreclosure action.

In part I of its opinion, the majority concludes that although the doctrine of mootness is implicated by virtue of the plaintiffs act of voluntarily vacating the premises, the facts of the present case fall within the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to that doctrine. I disagree with this conclusion because this case is not in the category of cases in which the challenged action or resulting injury is of an inherently limited duration, a prerequisite that this court heretofore has recognized for purposes of invoking this exception to the mootness doctrine. See, e.g., <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 383-84, 660 A.2d 323 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">A situation involving the ejectment of a tenant in possession of property by a foreclosing mortgagee is not of an inherently limited duration as the majority concludes. Indeed, the facts of the present case plainly contradict the majority\u2019s conclusion. In the present case, the plaintiff remained in possession of the leased property throughout the duration of the lower court proceedings notwithstanding the mortgagee\u2019s attempts to eject her, and would have been in possession at the time of this decision had she not voluntarily vacated the premises. Thus, I would dismiss this appeal as moot on the basis of the plaintiffs act of vacating the premises and would allow \u201cthe action [to] be reviewed the next time [the challenged action] arises, when it will present an ongoing live controversy.\u201d Id., 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The majority further concludes in part III of its opinion that a tenant who enters into a lease after a lis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>pendens has been filed in the land records in connection with the foreclosure of the property that is being leased, is not a \u201ctransferee of a possessory interest in the property who can be ejected under \u00a7 49-22 (a) despite not having been made a party to the foreclosure action.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-22 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action brought for the foreclosure of a mortgage or lien upon land, or for any equitable relief in relation to land, the plaintiff may, in his complaint, demand possession of the land, and the court may, if it renders judgment in his favor and finds that he is entitled to the possession of the land, issue execution of ejectment, commanding the officer to eject the person or persons in possession of the land and to put in possession thereof the plaintiff or the party to the foreclosure entitled to the possession by the provisions of the decree of said court, provided no execution shall issue against any person in possession who is not a party to the action except a transferee or lienor who is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The majority cogently notes that \u201c[t]he language of \u00a7 49-22 (a) . . . prohibits the ejectment of any person not a party to the foreclosure unless such person is a \u2018transferee\u2019 or \u2018lienor\u2019 [who is bound by the lis pen-dens].\u201d I would conclude that the language of \u00a7 49-22 (a), when read in light of our precedent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> aptly demonstrates that a tenant who enters into a lease subsequent to the filing of a lis pendens is a \u201ctransferee\u201d who is bound by the lis pendens and, therefore, can be ejected pursuant to \u00a7 49-22 (a) regardless of whether that tenant is joined as a party in the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The execution of a lease of real property clearly qualifies the lessee as a transferee of the interests in such property. E.g., <em>Monarch Accounting Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Prezioso, </em>170 Conn. 659, 663-64, 368 A.2d 6 (1976); see also <em>Jo-Mark Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Pantanella, </em>139 Conn. 598, 601, 96 A.2d 217 (1953) (\u201cA lease transfers an estate in real property to a tenant for a stated period .... Its distinguishing characteristic is the surrender of possession by the landlord to the tenant so that he may occupy the land or tenement leased to the exclusion of the landlord himself.\u201d). Accordingly, if a tenant enters into a lease after a lis pendens has been filed in the land records, that tenant can be ejected from the property without having been made a party to the foreclosure action. Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, we must refer to General Statutes \u00a7 52-325 (a) to determine who is bound by the filing of a lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-325 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action in a court of this state or in a court of the United States (1) the plaintiff or his attorney, at the time the action is commenced or afterwards . . . if the action is intended to affect real property, may cause to be recorded in the office of the town clerk of each town in which the property is situated a notice of lis pendens, containing the names of the parties, the nature and object of the action, the court to which it is returnable and the term, session or return day thereof, the date of the process and the description of the property .... Such notice shall, from the time of the recording only, be notice to <em>any person thereafter acquiring any interest in such property </em>of the pendency of the action; and each person whose conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently recorded or whose interest is thereafter obtained, by descent or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and <em>shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>be bound by all proceedings taken after the recording of such notice, </em>to the same extent as if he were made a party to the action. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear that, because the plaintiff in the present case obtained her interest in the property subsequent to the mortgagee\u2019s filing of the lis pendens, she was bound by the foreclosure action to the same extent as if she were made a party thereto. Thus, I would not look, as the majority does, beyond the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 49-22 (a) and 52-325 (a) in addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Although I do not believe it is appropriate to refer to legislative history in resolving the primary issue in this case, the majority\u2019s use of it is noteworthy as it demonstrates the dangers inherent in the approach to statutory interpretation adopted by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). The majority correctly notes that, in 1984, the legislature amended \u00a7 49-22 specifically in response to the Superior Court decision in <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 70, 462 A.2d 393 (1982). See Public Acts 1984, No. 84-539 (P.A. 84-539). The majority fails to note, however, a key factual distinction between <em>Hite </em>and the present case, namely, that the tenants in <em>Hite </em>already had entered into the lease and had taken possession of the property prior to the filing of the lis pendens. See <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>supra, 70-71. The court in <em>Hite </em>concluded, inter alia, that the procedure for filing a notice of lis pendens prescribed by Public Acts 1981, No. 81-8 (P.A. 81-8), violated the tenants\u2019 federal and state due process rights; id., 78; and that, consequently, the defendants were enjoined from ejecting the tenants pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 49-22. Id., 79. The court in <em>Hite </em>emphasized that the tenants \u201chad occupied the premises continuously for many years prior to the initiation of the foreclosure proceedings .... As month-to-month tenants, [they] would have [had] to search the land records continuously in order to learn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>of foreclosure actions that could [have] resulted] in their summary ejectment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 77-78. It is clear, therefore, that the court in <em>Hite </em>simply was concerned with whether month-to-month tenants in possession of property <em>prior </em>to the filing of a notice of lis pendens were afforded constitutionally adequate notice pursuant to P.A. 81-8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See id., 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The legislature responded to the decision in <em>Hite </em>by enacting P.A. 84-539. Public Act 84-539 deleted from General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 49-22 (a) the phrase \u201cunless the person is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens,\u201d which includes a tenant like the tenants in <em>Hite, </em>and inserted in its place, \u201cexcept a transferee or lienor who is bound by the judgment by virtue of a lis pendens,\u201d which does not include such a tenant. As the court in <em>Hite </em>noted, a month-to-month tenant technically is bound by a lis pendens that is filed after the tenancy initially is established because \u201cthe interest of such tenants in the premises expires at the end of each month and, if they remain, their interest is newly obtained at the beginning of the next month.\u201d <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 73. Month-to-month tenants are not transferees, however, because, although a month-to-month tenancy creates a new tenancy each month, it does not effectuate a new transfer of the property each month; indeed, the tenant continues in his possession of the property. Thus, the legislature, in substituting the term \u201ctransferee\u201d for the original language, rather than eliminating the original language altogether, clearly sought to protect tenants, such as the tenants in <em>Hite, </em>who acquire their interests prior to the filing of the lis pendens. The legislature apparently did not deem it necessary to shield from the ejectment process transferees who obtain their interests in property after the filing of the lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Moreover, to require a potential lessee to check the land records just once prior to entering into a lease is a far cry from the situation presented in <em>Hite. </em>In <em>Hite, </em>the court noted that because the leasehold interest of month-to-month tenants expires at the end of every month and is reacquired at the beginning of the next month; id.; month-to-month tenants would have no choice but to check the land records every month in order to learn of the filing of a lis pendens.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 78. Indeed, if the lis pendens had not been filed when the plaintiff in the present case had entered into the lease, \u00a7 49-22, as I understand it, would have shielded her from ejectment. As the court in <em>Hite </em>stated, \u201c[t]he ejectment procedure is available only against tenants whose interests arise subsequent to the [filing of the] lis pendens.\u201d Id., 79. Thus, I would maintain that \u00a7 49-22 (a), on its face, seeks to distinguish between the type of tenant in <em>Hite </em>and the plaintiff in the present case, especially in view of the inequities that inhere in the ejection of the former type of tenant, as the decision in <em>Hite </em>demonstrated. Such inequities were of paramount concern to the legislature when it amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 49-22 (a) in 1984. See P.A. 84-539.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Nevertheless, even if \u00a7 49-22 (a) is interpreted in accordance with <em>Courchesne, </em>the comments of legislators made during the floor debates on P.A. 84-539 are inconclusive on the issue of whether the legislature sought to extend protection to tenants other than those that enter into the lease and take possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>property before the filing of the lis pendens, such as the tenants in <em>Hite. </em>On the basis of several of these comments, the majority concludes that the legislative history establishes that the legislature chose not to recognize a distinction between tenants whose property interests arise before and after the filing of the lis pen-dens. Throughout these debates, however, there never was any mention of tenants whose interests arise after the filing of the lis pendens. Rather, as the majority notes, the changes to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 49-22 (a) \u201c \u2018were intended to strengthen the due process rights of a mortgagor\u2019s tenant upon foreclosure in response to [the] Superior Court decision [in <em>Hite],\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d which, as I have discussed, involved the unique situation of month-to-month tenants whose property interests arose prior to the filing of the lis pendens. The legislative history cited by the majority is, at best, ambiguous as to whether P.A. 84-539 was enacted with the intention of insulating from the ejectment process a tenant whose interest arises after the filing of the lis pendens, or whether P.A. 84-539 was limited to addressing the factual scenario presented in <em>Hite. </em>Thus, the legislative history on which the majority relies is insufficient to overcome the plain language of \u00a7 49-22 (a). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 574 (\u201c[t]here are cases ... in which the extratextual sources will indicate a different meaning strongly enough to lead the court to conclude that the legislature intended the language to have that different meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Additionally, an interpretation of the term \u201ctransferee\u201d in \u00a7 49-22 (a) as including a post lis pendens tenant does not render P.A. 84-539 wholly meaningless as the majority contends. The protection that the legislature sought to afford tenants when it enacted P.A. 84-539 would still exist under the foregoing interpretation as \u00a7 49-22 (a) prohibits the ejection of a tenant who enters into the lease before the filing of the lis pendens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>which was the factual scenario presented in <em>Hite. </em>Indeed, the interpretation I propose would accomplish the specific goal of the legislation, which is to prevent the party named in the foreclosure action from transferring the property to a third party in order to avoid eviction or ejectment. I am unable to fathom why the majority believes that shielding a post lis pendens lessee from ejectment under \u00a7 49-22 (a) is not in direct conflict with the legislature\u2019s effort to prevent a dilatory transfer of the property while the foreclosure action is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Finally, I take particular issue with the majority\u2019s use of proposals that were made, and rejected, during the legislative drafting process. See text accompanying footnote 20 of the majority opinion. The legislature\u2019s rejection of certain language during the drafting process cannot be construed as evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent to reject the concept that the language was intended to convey. In fact, it is just as fair to presume that the legislature, in rejecting the language, \u201c[a]ny person who, prior to the recording of a lis pendens, is in possession of the property,\u201d contained in Raised Committee Bill No. 5826, 1984 Sess., merely chose different language\u2014the language that currently appears in \u00a7 49-22 (a)\u2014to convey the same concept that it intended to convey in the rejected bill. According to the majority\u2019s logic, the absence of any change in the lis pendens statute, \u00a7 52-325 (a), would imply that post lis pendens tenancies remain \u201cbound by all proceedings taken after the recording of such [lis pendens] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-325 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, I would conclude that there is no need for the majority to search any further than \u00a7\u00a7 49-22 (a) and 52-325 (a) to understand that, under the facts of the present case, the plaintiff is a transferee who is bound by the judgment of foreclosure by virtue of the mortgagee\u2019s filing of the lis pendens before the plaintiff had entered into the lease. Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>\u00a7 49-22 (a) were interpreted in accordance with the principles of statutory interpretation announced in <em>Courchesne, </em>this is not a case \u201cin which the extratextual sources . . . indicate a different meaning [from the plain language] strongly enough to lead the court to conclude that the legislature intended the language to have that different meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\"> All references to \u00a7 49-22 (a) throughout this opinion are to the current revision unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\"> One of the underpinnings of the plain meaning rule is that litigants, among others, should be able to rely on the clearly stated language of any statute. The plain meaning rule, as well as the mode of statutory analysis adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), also charges people with knowledge of the holdings in prior decisions in which this court has interpreted a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\"> It is worth noting that \u00a7 52-325, which the majority concludes is inapplicable in the present case, is entitled \u201cNotice of lis pendens.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\"> I find it shortsighted for the majority to contend that it is not unduly burdensome to require a mortgagee who files a lis pendens to verify the occupancy of the property continuously after the filing. For example, what if a mortgagee is foreclosing on property occupied by numerous individuals, such as property on which a multiunit apartment complex is situated? The majority would place the burden on the mortgagee to check on a continuous basis possibly hundreds of individual apartment units. I believe that the burden instead should rest with the tenants to check the land records only one time prior to entering into the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
