The defendants asserted several special defenses, including that the ground lease could not be enforced because the \u201chybrid\u201d condominium form of the Oaks, in which the building units are owned and the underlying land is leased, violated the Condominium Act of 1976 (condominium act), General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a et seq. The defendants also filed a counterclaim, seeking to invalidate the ground lease, to obtain title to the land and to recover certain rental payments made to the plaintiffs. The trial court rendered partial judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding damages for, inter alia, rents and interest due under the terms of the ground lease and the cost of the accounting to determine the amount due. The trial court also awarded the defendants damages based on its determination that the plaintiffs had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants appeal and the plaintiffs cross appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The record reflects the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs owned two parcels of real property, located at 79 and 80 Claudia Drive in West Haven, on which two apartment buildings were situated. In 1982, the plaintiffs sold the buildings to Melrose Apartments, Inc. (Melrose). The plaintiffs concurrently executed a ground lease whereby they conveyed to Melrose a leasehold interest in the underlying land for a term of ninety-nine years, with an escalating rent schedule, plus an option to purchase. In November, 1982, Melrose thereafter, as set forth under the terms of the ground lease, declared a condominium, named the Oaks, in the two properties, consisting of 108 units in total. Pursuant to a \u201cDeed of Condominium Unit and Assignment of Leasehold Interest\u201d (deed), purchasers of the individual condominium units received afee simple absolute inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>est in their unit and an assignment of a fractional interest in the underlying ground lease. The purchasers also received, in accordance with the deed and the ground lease, a purchase option for their leasehold interest that could be exercised collectively by the unit owners in the eleventh year of the lease. Unit owners individually were responsible for the rent payments to the plaintiffs, although the unit owners actually made these payments to the association, which in turn remitted the payments to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In the early 1990s, the defendants began inquiring about exercising the pinchase option. In a January, 1993 letter, the defendants asked the plaintiffs to indicate a purchase price and the time frame within which the purchase option could be exercised. The plaintiffs responded by letter that they would not \u201cpresume to advise [the defendants] as to what is \u2018the period within which to exercise said options.\u2019 \u201d On April 2, 1993, the defendants sent a letter to the plaintiffs stating that they wanted to exercise the purchase option and identifying the purchase price as $416,000. On April 7, 1993, the plaintiffs responded to the defendants\u2019 April 2 letter, noting the defendants\u2019 intention to exercise the purchase option, but indicating that the price offered was too low.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On June 16, 1993, the defendants filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, seeking a \u201cvaluation of an option to purchase a land lease for premises commonly known as 79 and 80 Claudia Drive, West Haven . . . and issues ancillary thereto,\u201d including the issue of whether the option had been exercised timely. In response, the plaintiffs filed an action in Superior Court seeking to enjoin the arbitration. In October, 1994, the trial court, <em>Booth, J., </em>rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the ground that the Value of the land was the only issue that could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>arbitrated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-408,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as it was the only issue that the parties had agreed in writing to arbitrate. The issue of whether the option had been exercised timely was not subject to arbitration under the ground lease; therefore the court enjoined the defendants from pursuing arbitration on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">While the action to enjoin the arbitration was pending before the trial court, the defendants sent two more letters to the plaintiffs, dated December 16, 1993, and May 4, 1994, again indicating that they wanted to exercise the purchase option. The plaintiffs did not respond to either letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In 1995, the defendants began withholding the rents due under the terms of the ground lease and depositing them in an escrow account. This action stemmed from the determination by the property manager of the Oaks that the association had been overpaying ground rents to the plaintiffs, because the association had been paying the full amount due under the ground lease and not deducting amounts not collected from unit owners who were delinquent in making rent payments. Some of the ground rents withheld were used by the defendants to pay back property taxes due and to make capital improvements to the common elements of the Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">As a result of the association\u2019s refusal to remit all the rent payments due, the plaintiffs brought this action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>In their third amended revised complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants: (1) wrongfully had withheld ground rent and taxes due under the terms of the ground lease; (2) had been negligent in the manner in which they undertook their duties to collect rents from the unit owners; (3) should be ordered to furnish an accounting of the rent payments held in escrow; (4) had converted the rents collected to their own use; and (5) had violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The defendants asserted several special defenses, including, inter alia, that the condominium had not been created legally in accordance with the condominium act. The defendants also filed a counterclaim, alleging that: (1) title to the land underlying the Oaks should be quieted by declaring the association the owner of the property; (2) the plaintiffs had been unjustly enriched by ground lease payments they had received after a certain date; (3) the defendants were entitled to specific performance on the purchase option in the lease; (4) the lease was presumptively unconscionable pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-210; (5) the plaintiffs had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) the plaintiffs had violated CUTPA; and (7) the plaintiffs\u2019 actions had constituted conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on their special defense that the Oaks was an illegally formed condominium, which motion was denied by the trial court. After a bench trial, the court rendered partial judgment for the plaintiffs. Specifically, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the ground lease was unconscionable and, accordingly, awarded the plaintiffs past and future rents due under the lease and ordered the defendants to provide an accounting for rents they had collected but had not remitted to the plaintiffs. The trial court also concluded that the defendants were time barred from enforcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>their purchase option through specific performance, but awarded the defendants damages based on its finding that the plaintiffs had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing in their conduct toward the defendants when they had attempted to exercise the purchase option. The trial court rejected the parties\u2019 remaining claims. This appeal and cross appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The parties each raise several claims for our consideration on appeal. In their appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the Oaks was a legally created condominium pursuant to the condominium act; (2) the ground lease was not presumptively unconscionable pursuant to \u00a7 47-210; and (3) the defendants were not entitled to specific performance on the purchase option because the applicable limitations period under General Statutes \u00a7 47-33a was not tolled by the doctrine of equitable estoppel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, in their cross appeal, claim that the trial court improperly refused to award them attorney\u2019s fees, as provided for in the ground lease, and improperly awarded the defendants damages for the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the absence of sufficient evidence to support such a finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject all the claims, on both the appeal and the cross appeal and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The defendants\u2019 claims turn on our construction of various provisions of the condominium act and \u00a7 47-210. Issues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>262 Conn. 257, 272, 811 A.2d 693 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 27-28, 818 A.2d 37 (2003). With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We first address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the Oaks is a legally formed condominium under the condominium act. This claim is premised on the defendants\u2019 contention that, although the condominium act permits the creation of <em>either </em>a pure fee simple condominium <em>or </em>a pure leasehold condominium, it prohibits the creation of a hybrid of a fee simple interest in the units and a leasehold interest in the land. On the basis of that premise, the defendants proffer several arguments as to why the Oaks fails to conform to either of the two permissible forms of condominiums, from which we discern two basic contentions: (1) the trial court improperly con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>eluded that the Oaks was a validly formed leasehold condominium, because certain procedural and substantive requirements necessary to establish a leasehold condominium under General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had not been satisfied; and (2) the property was not submitted properly to the condominium form of ownership because Melrose, the declarant of the condominium, was not the fee owner of both the buildings and the land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reject the defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendants\u2019 claims. In a motion dated August 14, 2000, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the condominium declaration creating the Oaks was unlawful, and, therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims failed as a matter of law. Specifically, the defendants contended that the hybrid condominium form of the Oaks, a fee interest in the units and a leasehold interest in the land, was not authorized by the condominium act.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found the following undisputed material facts relevant to the defendants\u2019 motion. \u201c[0]n November 30, 1982, Melrose declared a condominium consisting of its leasehold interest in the land and its ownership of the building[s]. Melrose issued a Declaration of Condominium dated November 30, 1982, that defines the property being declared to be a condominium as \u2018[t]he leasehold interest of the Declarant in and to that piece or parcel of land situated at 79 Claudia Drive, West Haven . . . and more particularly described in Schedule A attached hereto, the buildings, all improvements and structures thereon, and rights and appurtenances belonging thereto.\u2019 The declaration defines a \u2018unit owner\u2019 as \u2018the person or persons owning a Unit in fee simple absolute, or leasing a unit as hereinafter provided, and an undivided interest in the fee simple or leased estate of the common areas and facilities in the percentage specified in this Declaration.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cMelrose sold units in the building at 79 Claudia Drive to purchasers by way of a document titled \u2018Deed of Condominium Unit and Assignment of Leasehold Interest.\u2019 The property conveyed in the deed to each unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>owner was \u2018[t]he following described Leasehold Estate and Real Property with appurtenances thereto located in the Town of West Haven . . . kno wn as Unit [number] of The [Oaks], An Expandable Condominium, together with an undivided 1.76 (%) percent interest in the common elements and appurtenant thereto, and all of the right, title and interest of the Grantor in and to a 1.76 (%) percent and fractional interest in and to a certain leasehold estate created pursuant to the terms and conditions of a certain Ground Lease by and between [the plaintiffs] and [Melrose] dated the 30th day of November, 1982 . . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201cThe lease referred to in the deeds issued to unit owners provided for a lease term of ninety-nine years. The lease further provided that the unit owners collectively could purchase the land to which the lease applied at a juncture eleven years after the execution of the lease, for the lesser of the current appraised market value of the land or [13] percent of the then current appraised market value of the land and improvements, with an arbitration procedure to resolve disagreements as to value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On the basis of these facts, the trial court considered the defendants\u2019 legal claim and denied their motion for summary judgment. The trial court examined the definitional and substantive provisions of the condominium act, as well as its legislative history, and concluded that, when read in its entirety, the condominium act permitted the creation of the \u201chybrid\u201d condominium, meaning one that combines a fee simple interest in a unit with an undivided leasehold interest in the land on which the condominium is situated. Specifically, the trial court noted that the condominium act preserved the differentiation between leasehold condominiums and fee simple condominiums and that the act would not have provided for the conveyance of leasehold interests if such interests were prohibited. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>trial court noted that the condominium act as originally enacted authorized such transactions and that the act\u2019s subsequent history evinced no intention to preclude them. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We first consider whether the condominium act precludes the creation of a hybrid condominium, in which a unit owner receives a fee simple interest in his or her unit and an undivided leasehold interest in the underlying land. The defendants contend that the condominium act permits only pure fee simple condominiums <em>or </em>pure leasehold condominiums. Specifically, the defendants contend that \u00a7 47-70 (d) prohibits the conveyance of a property interest less than fee simple absolute and, therefore, a condominium lawfully cannot be created whereby a unit owner receives a fee interest and a leasehold interest. We disagree that the condominium act evinces an intention to preclude such hybrid condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We begin with certain basic principles in mind. It is well settled that compliance with the requirements of the condominium act is \u201ca condition precedent to attaining condominium legal status . . . .\u201d <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 153, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989). A condominium, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (a), is \u201creal property and any incidents thereto and interests therein, lawfully submitted to this chapter by the recordation of condominium instruments pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d The condominium act sets forth requirements that the declaration contain particular information; General Statutes \u00a7 47-70; and that it must be recorded in accordance with certain procedures. General Statutes \u00a7 47-71. Neither of these provisions contain an express prohi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>bition on the type of hybrid condominium created by the Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">We recognize, however, that \u00a7 47-70 (d), on which the defendants rely, appears to suggest, at first blush and when read in isolation, that such a hybrid condominium may not be permitted. That subsection provides in relevant part that \u201c[tjhe property submitted to a condominium declaration pursuant to this chapter, other than a nonresidential condominium, shall be conveyed by the declarant to purchasers <em>in fee simple absolute, </em>subject only to covenants, easements and liens, limited as follows ... (3) Mutually beneficial property restrictions which would be enforceable by other owners in the subdivision or project of which the condominium is a part for more than five years after the first declaration in a planned project. Such restrictions shall not give declarant or any other person more power per unit owned than that which is proportionately equal to his fraction of the number of similar units planned or constructed in such subdivision or project, <em>and the property shall not be subject to leasehold or reversionary interest. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-70 (d). The condominium act further provides that \u201c \u2018[pjroperty\u2019 means and includes the land, all buildings, all improvements and structures thereon, and all easements, rights and appurtenances belonging thereto, which have been or are intended to be submitted to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a <em>(V). </em>In the defendants\u2019 view, these provisions indicate that condominiums must be conveyed entirely in fee simple and cannot include a conveyance of a leasehold interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">A closer review of \u00a7 47-70 (d), particularly in the context of the condominium act in its entirety, evinces no such restriction. Section 47-70 (d) simply provides that, when a conveyance is made of afee simple interest, <em>that </em>fee simple interest cannot be subject to a leasehold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>or reversionary interest. In the present case, a fee simple interest in the building units was conveyed by deed, <em>unencumbered by any leasehold interest. </em>A separate leasehold interest was assigned in the underlying land.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The limitation in \u00a7 47-70 (d) is consistent with, and maybe explained by reference to, General Statutes \u00a7 47-88b, which addresses situations in which an apartment building is converted to condominiums, a not uncommon occurrence. Under this section, tenants of such buildings are given the right to purchase the unit that they currently are renting. General Statutes \u00a7 47-88b (b) and (c). Any tenants who choose not to exercise that option, \u201cshall be entitled to remain in the premises under their existing leases . . . except that upon the filing of the declaration said lease shall be considered assigned to the declarant.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-88b (c). Thus, a declarant of a condominium may have fee simple title to such units, upon the conversion from apartments to condominiums, but the declarant may not convey fee simple title to new owners for units that are subject to leases still in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Moreover, it is clear that \u00a7 47-70 is not intended to prescribe the types of condominiums that are permitted under the condominium act. There is no reference in that section to condominiums that are subject to any leasehold interest. Section 47-68a (cc), however, expressly provides for a \u201cleasehold condominium,\u201d which is defined as \u201cproperty submitted to the provisions of this chapter by the fee owner, whereby unit leases are issued for a period not less than fifty years and provided, in a residential leasehold condominium, such lease provides that the lessee shall have the option to purchase the fee simple title to the demised property during the term of the lease at a price stated or by a method stated for subsequent determination of the total price.\u201d Indeed, the terms leasehold interest and lease are referenced throughout the condominium act. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-68a (m), 47-71 (h), 47-71b, 47-72 and 47-79. Accordingly, it is clear that \u00a7 47-70 was not intended to prescribe the types of condominiums that may be created.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Reference to other provisions reveal that hybrid condominiums are not inconsistent with the condominium act. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 47-79 (a), which addresses tax liability, provides in part that \u201c[i]n the event the land <em>or </em>the building, including common areas and facilities, <em>is separately owned, and leased to the unit owner </em>for a period of not less than fifty years and such lease, duly recorded, provides that the lessee shall pay all such taxes, such unit and its percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities shall be deemed to be a parcel and shall be separately assessed and taxed in the name of the lessee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By using the disjunctive in referring to the land \u201cor\u201d the building, this subsection indicates that either may be leased independently to the unit owner, regardless of the status of the concomitant interest. Indeed, because a unit owner is defined as one who has either a leasehold interest or a fee interest in his unit; General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (c);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u00a7 47-79 further provides that the building or the land may be \u201cseparately owned, and leased to the unit owner,\u201d this language encompasses three possible arrangements: (1) a unit owner may lease both his unit and an interest in the underlying land from two different parties who separately own the land and the building; (2) a unit owner may purchase a leasehold interest in his unit from one party and a fee interest in the land from another party; or (3) a unit owner may purchase a fee interest in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>unit from one party and a leasehold interest in the underlying land from another party, as is provided for in the Oaks condominium. Therefore, hybrid forms of condominiums are consistent with \u00a7 47-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We also find support in General Statutes \u00a7 47-74c,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which prohibits the declarant of the condominium from retaining an ownership interest in any recreational facilities<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and leasing the right to use such facilities back to the unit owners. The condominium act contains no comparable prohibition on a declarant retaining an ownership interest in the land underlying the recreational facilities and leasing such land back to unit owners. \u201c[W]here a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 861, 675 A.2d 835 (1996). Accordingly, we presume that, had the legislature intended to prohibit a declarant from retaining ownership of land underlying the recreational common area and leasing it back to the unit owners, it would have indicated such intent, as it did with regard to the recreational facilities themselves. Furthermore, we have found nothing in the legislative history of the condominium act to indicate that the legislature intended to preclude the creation of hybrid leasehold/fee simple condominiums, in which the land is leased to unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In sum, we recognize that the condominium act is not a model of clarity; it contains neither an express prohibition of <em>nor </em>authorization for hybrid condominiums of a leasehold and fee simple interest. We conclude, however, that such hybrids are not inconsistent with the provisions of the condominium act. Accordingly, the act does not reflect clearly the legislature\u2019s intent in this regard. In light of this uncertainty as to legislative intent, subsequent legislative action expressly directed toward this type of condominium informs our resolution of this issue. See <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985) (noting that, although Workers\u2019 Compensation Act postdated statute at issue, \u201ca subsequent legislative act \u2018may throw light on the legislative intent of a former related act\u2019 \u201d); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 312, 317, 206 A.2d 428 (1965) (\u201csubsequent legislative act may throw light on the legislative intent of an earlier related act\u201d); see also <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 518 n.19, 613 A.2d 748 (1992) (noting our reluctance to rely on subsequent legislative action as indicative of earlier intent, but concluding that, under facts of case, it was \u201csufficient foundation for an inference regarding legislative intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In 1995, the legislature amended the Common Interest Ownership Act; General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., which originally was enacted in 1983 and most of which was effective January 1, 1984; specifically to remedy problems arising from unconscionable lease agreements in condominiums and other residential common interest communities created prior to 1984. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-187, \u00a7 27. The legislative debates on the Common Interest Ownership Act reflect concerns expressly addressing problems attendant to the Oaks type of hybrid condominium. Senator Martin Looney stated that \u201cthe issue of unconscionable ground leases ... is something that has become a problem in a number of communities in the state . . . where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the situation has arisen whereby a long-term ground lease with an escalating clause has created a very difficult and punitive situation for the people who own the units but not the ground under them and has rendered those units unmarketable.\u201d 38 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1995 Sess., pp. 4733-34. Indeed, Senator Looney expressly referred to West Haven, where the Oaks is located, as one such community. Id. The concern with respect to this type of hybrid condominium is evinced in the Common Interest Ownership Act, particularly in \u00a7 47-210 (a). That subsection provides in relevant part: \u201cThe General Assembly expressly finds that <em>many leases involving the use of land or recreational or other common facilities </em>by residents of a residential common interest community were entered into by parties wholly representative of the interests of a residential common interest developer at a time when the residential common interest community unit owners not only did not control the administration of their residential common interest community, but also had little or no voice in such administration. Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a residential common interest community association and residential common interest community unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such lease may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-210 (a). This language, consistent with \u00a7 47-79 (a), underscores the legislature\u2019s understanding that, under the law existing at the time, either the land or the building could be leased to unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">It is noteworthy that, despite its recognition of the existence of problems associated with this form of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dominium, the legislature did not preclude the formation of such hybrids. Rather, it chose to address the problem when it amended \u00a7 47-210, setting forth certain factors that establish a presumption of unconscionability and precluding time-related affirmative defenses for claims relating to pre-1984 leases. See Public Act 95-187, \u00a7 27, and footnote 14 of this opinion. It is evident that, in keeping with the concerns that motivated the legislature to provide for such protections, a unit owner with a leasehold/fee simple interest would be an intended beneficiary. Indeed, a unit owner who leases both his unit and an interest in the underlying land simply could walk away from the oppressive lease, subject to minimal financial risk. The same cannot be said for a unit owner who has a fee interest in his unit and is subject to an oppressive ground lease. Accordingly, in view of our conclusion that hybrid condominiums are not inconsistent with the condominium act and in light of the legislature\u2019s amendment of the Common Interest Ownership Act to provide a remedy for problems arising under such arrangements, we conclude that hybrid leasehold/fee simple condominiums are permitted under the condominium act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the Oaks was a validly formed leasehold condominium. Specifically, they contend that procedural and substantive requirements of a leasehold condominium, as set forth in \u00a7 47-68a (cc), were not satisfied because: (1) no unit leases were issued; and (2) unit owners do not have individually exercisable purchase options for their interest in the underlying land. This claim is predicated on the defendants\u2019 assertion that the Oaks, if not a <em>pure </em>fee simple, must be a leasehold condominium. In light of our conclusion in part I A 1 of this opinion that the condominium act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>does not preclude hybrid condominiums, we need not address these claims at great length.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We first note that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the trial court did not base its denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on a conclusion that the Oaks is a leasehold condominium, as that term is defined under \u00a7 47-68a (cc). See footnote 8 of this opinion. Although the court used the term \u201cleasehold condominium\u201d with some frequency in its memorandum of decision, our review of the decision in its entirety reflects that the court merely looked to \u00a7 47-68a (cc) and various other provisions addressing leases and leasehold interests to support its conclusion that the condominium act did not prohibit the creation of such interests and, therefore, did not preclude the creation of a condominium comprised of both a fee and leasehold interest. Indeed, the court repeatedly referred to \u201cleasehold interests\u201d and \u201ccondominiums on leased land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">More important, as we previously have noted, a leasehold condominium is defined as \u201cproperty submitted to the provisions of this chapter by the fee owner, <em>whereby unit leases are issued </em>for a period not less than fifty years and provided, in a residential leasehold condominium, such lease provides that the lessee shall have the option to purchase the fee simple title to the demised property . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc). Although the term \u201cunit lease\u201d is not defined under the condominium act, reference to the definition of \u201cunit\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (b);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> makes evident what a commonsense construction of the statute would dictate\u2014that a \u201cunit lease\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>required only when the unit owner has a leasehold interest, not a fee simple interest, in his unit. In the present case, because the Oaks condominium units were conveyed in fee simple pursuant to a deed of sale, the Oaks is not a leasehold condominium. The defendants\u2019 related claim\u2014that the Oaks is an unlawful condominium because the unit owners may not exercise their purchase option individually, as required for leasehold condominiums under \u00a7 47-68a (cc)\u2014also fails. Applying the same commonsense construction to this claim, it would be absurd even to contemplate individually exercisable purchase options in the underlying ground for each of the 108 unit owners. Indeed, it makes sense to have individually exercisable purchase options <em>only </em>when individual unit leases are involved. Accordingly, we reject the defendants\u2019 claim that the Oaks improperly failed to conform to the requirements for a leasehold condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Finally, the defendants contend that the Oaks was not submitted to the condominium form of ownership in accordance with the condominium act. Specifically, the defendants contend that the act requires that both the units and the common elements be submitted by the fee owner, and that this requirement was not satisfied because the plaintiffs did not submit their fee interest in the land. Instead, the defendants note that Melrose submitted a fee interest in the building and a leasehold interest in the land. We conclude that the Oaks properly was submitted in accordance with the condominium act.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Once again, the defendants\u2019 claim is predicated on their assumption that the Oaks must comply with the requirements of a leasehold condominium under \u00a7 47-68a (cc). That term is defined in relevant part as \u201cproperty submitted to the provisions of this chapter <em>by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>fee owner </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc). We assume, without deciding, that the property creating this hybrid condominium was required to be submitted by the fee owners and nevertheless conclude that this requirement was satisfied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 conduct clearly evinced their intention to submit their fee interest\u2014a reversionary interest in the ground lease subject to the unit owners\u2019 option to purchase\u2014to the condominium form of ownership. Article fourteen of the condominium declaration, entitled \u201cJoinder By Lessor,\u201d provides that \u201c[the plaintiffs], owners in fee simple of the property, do hereby consent to this Declaration.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 signatures on the declaration provide further evidence of their acquiescence to the interests submitted. The ground lease between Melrose and the plaintiffs is incoiporated by reference into the declaration and the unit owners\u2019 deeds. That lease provides, inter alia, that the leasehold interest for a ninety-nine year term is \u201csubject to the option granted [by the plaintiffs] to [Melrose] and the Condominium Unit Owners to purchase the Land as hereinafter set forth.\u201d The lease thereafter provides: \u201cIn the event that the option to purchase is exercised . . . the [plaintiffs] shall execute and deliver to the Condominium Unit Owners ... a warranty deed to the Land showing the same to be free and clear of all encumbrances . . . .\u201d In sum, the condominium documents clearly reflect that the plaintiffs consented to the submission of their reversionary interest in the land, so that unit owners lawfully could exercise their purchase option. Accordingly, we conclude that the Oaks was submitted to the condominium form of ownership by the fee owners in accordance with the condominium act.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The defendants next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the ground lease was not presumptively unconscionable pursuant to \u00a7 47-210.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Specifically, the defendants contend that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>improperly construed \u00a7 47-210 contrary to its plain meaning, so as to not derogate the common-law doctrine of unconscionability, by requiring unconscionability claims to be evaluated based on the conditions existing in the year following the execution of the contract. Although we agree with the defendants that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 47-210, we conclude that the defendants have not shown that the lease was presumptively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. At trial, the defendants presented Willis Graham, the Oaks\u2019 property manager, to testify as to ground lease payments and other expenses incurred by the association. He testified that in 1995, the annual rent for the Oaks, if all 108 unit owners paid the rent due, was approximately $106,000. He also testified that, in 2000, other expenses, such as taxes, maintenance and insurance amounted to approximately $33,000. The association\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1995, which was entered into evidence, indicated that from June 1,1994, to May 31,1995, the Oaks had paid $94,854 in lease payments to the plaintiffs. There was no evidence indicating the amount of the monthly payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>for the prior year. The budget also indicated that the Oaks had paid $15,289 in insurance, $18,065 in real estate taxes and $4852 in capital improvements during the 1995 fiscal period. The budget did not allocate these costs between those expended for the buildings and the land, nor did it provide a monthly breakdown of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Both the plaintiffs and the defendants offered testimony relating to the value of the land underlying the Oaks, a factor used in determining unconscionability pursuant to \u00a7 47-210. The plaintiffs offered the testimony of Louis Pellegrino, a commercial real estate appraiser, who stated that the land underlying the Oaks, with improvements, was worth $750,000 as of June 1, 1995. The defendants presented Christopher Buckley, also a real estate appraiser, who testified that the same land, with improvements, was worth $576,000 as of October 1, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the ground lease was unconscionable. It first noted that \u00a7 47-210 imposes a presumption that a ground lease is unconscionable if lease payments and other expenses exceed 15 percent of the value of the land in the twelve months prior to the filing of a claim. The court concluded, however, that, because the legislature never expressed its intent to abrogate the common-law doctrine of unconscionability, \u00a7 47-210 must be construed in a manner consistent with the common law, which evaluates unconscionability based on the conditions existing at the time the contract was executed. Therefore, the trial court construed the twelve month limitation to mean that a claim asserting unconscionability of a condominium lease must be evaluated based on the conditions existing during the twelve months following the execution of the lease. Accordingly, the trial court considered the value of the land and lease payments and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>expenses in 1982, the time at which the lease was executed. It found that the value of the land was $432,000 in 1982,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that the lease payments were $34,400 per year, which was less than 15 percent of the land\u2019s value ($64,800). Additionally, the trial court considered the fact that the unit owners were not jointly and severally liable for the lease payments, but, rather, were responsible only for their individual payment. Therefore, the court concluded that, in order to prove unconscionability, each unit owner would have to show that his or her lease payments and expenses were excessive when compared with the value of the owner\u2019s interest in the condominium. Because the defendants had alleged only that the lease payments were unconscionable as to the land as a whole, and not as to the individual unit owners, the trial court concluded that they had not shown that the lease was presumptively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As with any issue of statutory construction, we begin with the text of the statute. Section 47-210 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain the required number of specified elements shall not preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease. . . .\u2019\u2019As specified in subsection (d): \u201cA lease entered into prior to January 1,1984, pertaining to use of land or facilities by unit owners in a residential common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>interest community, is presumed to be unconscionable if: (1) The lease by its terms requires the lessee to pay an annual rental and other expenses that exceed fifteen per cent of the appraised value of the leased property as improved, provided for the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018annual rental and other expenses\u2019 means the amount paid by the lessee during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section as rent and for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvements and other expenses required to maintain the property under the lease terms, and \u2018appraised value\u2019 means the appraised value placed upon the leased property by a licensed or certified real estate appraiser on a date during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-210 (d) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The legislature\u2019s express statement in \u00a7 47-210 (a) \u201cthat a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the <em>establishment </em>of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases\u201d; (emphasis added); indicates that the legislature intended to deviate from the common law and to establish a new statutory presumption for unconscionability claims with respect to condominium leases executed before January 1,1984. Cf. <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 29 (concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n abrogates common-law doctrine of municipal immunity). Moreover, the statute sets forth the method of calculating the two relevant criteria for determining whether this presumption applies\u2014\u201c \u2018annual rental and other expenses\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018appraised value\u2019 \u201d\u2014based on \u201cthe twelve months immediately preceding <em>the filing of an action </em>under this section . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-210 (d) (1). Therefore, a determination of unconscionability is to be made based on a certain time frame after the claim is filed, not after the contract is formed. The legislature\u2019s express creation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>of a statutory presumption of unconscionability, based on certain criteria calculated by the twelve months prior to the filing of the action, clearly indicates its intention to abrogate the common-law doctrine of unconscionability for leases executed <em>before </em>January 1, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Indeed, this construction is supported by reference to other subsections of \u00a7 47-210 that address unconscionability claims for condominium leases executed <em>after </em>January 1, 1984. For leases executed after that date, the legislature codified the common-law doctrine, instructing the courts to determine whether the lease \u201cwas unconscionable <em>at the lime the contract was made </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-210 (b) and (h). It is a \u201cfundamental tenet of statutory construction that [t]he use of . . . different terms . . . within the same statute suggests that the legislature acted with complete awareness of their different meanings . . . and that it intended the terms to have different meanings . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hasselt </em>v. <em>Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>262 Conn. 416, 426, 815 A.2d 94 (2003). The legislature\u2019s decision not to incorporate the same language of subsections (b) and (h) of \u00a7 47-210 into subsection (d), and the reference in (d) (1) to the twelve month period preceding the filing of the action, clearly indicates the legislature\u2019s intent not to apply the common-law rule to pre-1984 leases. Accordingly, the trial court improperly applied the common-law doctrine of unconscionability to the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We also conclude, however, that this impropriety was harmless because the d\u00e9fendants introduced insufficient evidence to support their contention that the ground lease was presumptively unconscionable under \u00a7 47-210. Specifically, the defendants did not satisfy the requirements under subsection (d), because they failed to show that the annual rental and other expenses exceeded 15 percent of the appraised value of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>for the twelve months <em>immediately preceding the filing of their claim. </em>The defendants filed their counterclaim alleging unconseionability on June 27, 1995. Therefore, under \u00a7 47-210 (d) (1), they needed to prove that the Oaks\u2019 annual rental and other expenses from June 28, 1994, to June 27, 1995, exceeded 15 percent of the appraised value of the land. The defendants offered into evidence a budget for their 1995 fiscal year, which set forth payments and other expenses from June 1, 1994, to May 31, 1995. This budget, however, did not itemize relevant expenses, such as insurance and property taxes, to indicate whether they apply solely to the land or the buildings, or to what extent they apply to both. Therefore, the record does not reflect the critical figure, namely, the expenses incurred with respect to the land during the statutorily prescribed period of the twelve months preceding the claim. Without this information, the record does not demonstrate that those costs exceeded 15 percent of the appraised value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Nonetheless, the defendants point to the undisputed testimony of Graham, the property manager of the Oaks, as proof that the relevant rents and expenses amounted to $139,276 for 1994, which the defendants claim is in excess of 24 percent of the land\u2019s appraised value, as ascertained by the defendants\u2019 appraiser, Buckley. Examination of Graham\u2019s testimony, however, reveals no such proof. Graham testified that the rent due for the Oaks in 1994 was approximately $106,000.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u00a7 47-210 (d) (1), rent due is not the relevant figure for determining unconscionability, but, rather, the <em>actual </em>rents paid during the preceding twelve months. See footnote 14 of this opinion. The fact that $106,000 was due does not mean that it actually was paid. Moreover, Graham\u2019s testimony concerning the remaining expenses, which were approximately $33,000, pertained to those incurred in 2000,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> not for the twelve months prior to June 27, 1995, as required by \u00a7 47-210 (d) (1). Accordingly, we conclude that Graham\u2019s testimony does not support the defendants\u2019 claim that the Oaks\u2019 ground lease was presumptively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The defendants next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendants were barred from enforcing their purchase option, because they had failed to bring an action for specific performance within the time prescribed by \u00a7 47-33a.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>dants claim that the time limitation was tolled by the doctrine of equitable estoppel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the defendants\u2019 claims were not tolled by the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. The ground lease for the Oaks contains a purchase option that the unit owners collectively may exercise \u201cwithin a twelve (12) month period which shall commence upon the ELEVENTH anniversary year of this lease . . . .\u201d The trial court found that the defendants validly had exercised the purchase option twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>by sending a letter indicating their intention to do so\u2014 once on April 2,1993, and again on December 16,1993. The court further found that the plaintiffs had been evasive in their responses to the defendants\u2019 letters by refusing to express their opinion as to the timeliness of the option and indicating their view that the option could not be exercised because the rents under the ground lease were in arrears. The defendants originally, however, did not file an action thereafter seeking specific performance of the purchase option. Rather, in June of 1995, they sought, in a counterclaim to the plaintiffs\u2019 action, a declaratory judgment that they validly had exercised the option. The defendants did not seek specific performance of the purchase option until April 25, 2000, when they filed an amended counterclaim seeking such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The trial court concluded that the defendants were time barred from pursuing specific performance under \u00a7 47-33a, because they had failed to file a claim within eighteen months of their exercise of the purchase option. See footnote 19 of this opinion. Specifically, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the limitation period was tolled under the doctrine of equitable estoppel due to the actions of the plaintiffs\u2014namely, their refusal to indicate whether the option was timely and their statement that the option could not be exercised due to rents in arrears. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 actions did not induce the defendants to delay their enforcement action and did not create an impression that the matter could be resolved without such action. The trial court did conclude, however, that the plaintiffs had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to render an opinion to the defendants as to the timeliness of the option. Accordingly, the trial court awarded the defendants damages in the amount of $3450, reflecting the additional attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>fees they had incurred as a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The defendants contend that the eighteen month limitation period under \u00a7 47-33a (a) was tolled by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Specifically, they point to the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs had breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing for support that the limitation period should be tolled.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We first set forth the standard of review and applicable legal principles that guide our resolution of this claim. \u201cThe party claiming estoppel . . . has the burden of proof. . . . Whether that burden has been met is a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. ... A court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there is evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . The legal conclusions of the trial court will stand, however, only if they are legally and logically correct and are consistent with the facts of the case. . . . Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding estoppel only if they involve an erroneous application of the law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) W. v. <em>W., </em>256 Conn. 657, 660-61, 779 A.2d 716 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\u201c[I]n Connecticut, the doctrine of equitable estoppel . . . requires proof of two essential elements: [First] the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that belief; and [second] the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual, Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 527, 547-48, 791 A.2d 489 (2002). \u201cIt is fundamental that a person who claims an estoppel must show that he has exercised due diligence to know the truth, and that he not only did not know the true state of things but also lacked any reasonably available means of acquiring knowledge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Voog, </em>233 Conn. 352, 367, 659 A.2d 172 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing as a basis for invoking equitable estoppel is misplaced. Although the actions of the plaintiffs caused the defendants to incur additional legal fees, equitable estoppel is concerned with actions by one party that induce a faulty reliance by the other party. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the plaintiffs misled the defendants or behaved in a manner that would have encouraged the defendants to rely to their detriment on the plaintiffs\u2019 actions or words. Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to indicate their opinion as to the timeliness of the option does not suffice as a basis to invoke equitable estoppel as \u201csilence will not operate as [an] estoppel absent a duty to speak.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 375, 387, 673 A.2d 77 (1996). We agree with the trial court that the actions of the plaintiffs \u201cput the defendants on notice that an enforcement action was indeed necessary . . . .\u201d The defendants cannot seek the safe harbor of equitable estoppel due to their own failure to recognize that they were required to pursue their action. \u201cWe cannot apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel in a case in which the party requesting the relief claims ignorance of the laws . . . when such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ignorance of the law is the primary cause of his need for such relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>224 Conn. 240, 252 n.7, 618 A.2d 506 (1992). Accordingly, we conclude that the eighteen month limitation period under \u00a7 47-33a (a) was not tolled by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and, therefore the trial court properly concluded that the defendants\u2019 action for specific performance was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We next turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal, in which they assert two claims. They contend that the trial court improperly awarded damages to the defendants and that it improperly refused to award attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding by the trial court that the plaintiffs had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and, therefore, the trial court improperly awarded damages to the defendants on that basis. Furthermore, the plaintiffs contend that, pursuant to \u00a7 10 (b) of the ground lease, they are entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees, and that the trial court improperly refused to award them fees under this provision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In their counterclaim, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs had breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing by: (1) failing to convey their opinion on the purchase option period so that the defendants could exercise that option; (2) failing to obtain an appraisal to aid in negotiations over the exercise of the option; (3) failing to submit to arbitration; and (4) refusing to renegotiate the terms of the ground lease. The trial court rejected all of these claims except the first, finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct had caused the defendants to incur additional legal fees. Specifically, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>looked to the correspondence between the parties and found that \u201c [t]he plaintiffs certainly had a position about when the option could be exercised, and one of the offers from the defendants was within that period. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs indicated that if the association proceeded to arbitration to fix the price, they would take the position that the exercise had not occurred during the twelve month period specified in the lease [for exercising the option], creating the prospect that the association would undergo the expense of arbitration only to find out that their exercise was either premature or late.\u201d The court concluded that this conduct had caused the defendants to incur damages, specifically, $3450 in additional legal expenses and, accordingly, awarded that sum to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We first set forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles that guide our decision. \u201c[WJhere the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 Conn. 296, 322, 796 A.2d 516 (2002). \u201cIn making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maharishi School of Vedic Sciences, Inc.

The covenant of good faith and fair dealing presupposes that the terms and purpose of the contract are agreed upon by the parties and that what is in dispute is a party\u2019s discretionary application or interpretation of a contract term.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Titan Value Equities Group, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 789, 793, 749 A.2d 1144 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">After reviewing the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs had breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing was not clearly erroneous. Although the plaintiffs point to several reasons why they believed that they did not have to cooperate with the defendants\u2014the defendants were in breach of the lease due to late rent payments, the defendants never provided an accounting and the defendants did not present appropriate notice indicating that unit owners had voted on exercising the purchase option\u2014there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding. Specifically, the plaintiffs\u2019 letters stating their refusal to render an opinion on the timeliness of the option and indicating that, if the matter went to arbitration, they would assert that the options were not exercised timely, provided a sufficient basis from which the trial court could find a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly failed to award them attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 10 (b) of the ground lease. Section 10 of the lease provides in relevant part: \u201c[Melrose] does for itself and its successors and assigns covenant and agree with [the plaintiffs] . . . (b) That in the event the [plaintiffs] are required to employ an attorney in order to enforce a provision of this lease to pay [the plaintiffs\u2019] reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in connection therewith. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The trial court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on that section, construing it to mean that a \u201cunit owner whose fractional interest in the lease is terminated because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>default of the obligation to pay his or her fractional share of rent shall pay the lessors\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The court found that \u201c[t]he association is not ... a party to the lease. Rather, the lease is a contract between the [plaintiffs] and Melrose, which assigned fractions of its rights and obligations to unit members. The individual defendants are sued in their capacity as members of the board of directors of the association, and the [plaintiffs] have not alleged that any of them is in default of any obligations as assignees of fractional interests in the lease.\u201d Accordingly, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nagy </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>249 Conn. 693, 708, 735 A.2d 297 (1999). \u201cThere are numerous contexts in which attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded, including . . . actions on notes or other contracts with attorney\u2019s fees clauses . . . .\u201d <em>Benvenuto </em>v. <em>Mahajan, </em>245 Conn. 495, 502, 715 A.2d 743 (1998). \u201cWhere a contract expressly provides for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, an award under such a clause requires an evidentiary showing of reasonableness. ... A trial court may rely on its own general knowledge of the trial itself to supply evidence in support of an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 77, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Applying these principles, and after reviewing the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the lease. We agree with the trial court that \u00a7 10 (b) of the ground lease applies to actions by lessors against individual unit owners to enforce obligations under the lease. We further agree that the plaintiffs brought the present action against the members of the association\u2019s board of directors in their official capacities, not as individual unit owners. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>fact is evidenced by the nature of the claims alleged, such as the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendants had been negligent in the collection of amounts due from unit owners. Under the terms of the lease, the association is not liable for the rents due the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants owe any back rent. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> The defendants appealed and the plaintiffs cross appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> The original plaintiffs to this action were Vincent Celentano, Lawrence I.

Specifically, the defendants contend that the reversion will create conflicting ownership interests between the plaintiffs and the unit owners. We first note that the defendants assert as support for this claim certain principles of statutory construction without referencing <em>any </em>statute that supposedly would be violated were we to find the lease agreement reasonable.

The first time the defendants addressed this statute was in their reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.

Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a residential common interest community association and residential common interest, community unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such lease may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional fads and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain the required number of specified elements shall not preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease.

The condominium form of ownership is a creature of statute, and, therefore, \u201cthe law mandates strict compliance with the authorizing statute.\u201d <em>William Beazley Co. </em>v. <em>Business Park Associates, Inc., </em>34 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>App. 801, 803, 643 A.2d 1298 (1994). Thus, the test to be applied in determining whether a declaration complies with the act is not whether it is <em>inconsistent </em>with the act but, rather, whether it is <em>authorized </em>by the act. While I disagree with much of the majority\u2019s analysis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I believe that the issue of whether the declaration in the present case complied with the act can be resolved by applying the foregoing principle of law with regard to the type of condominium ownership created by the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The term \u201cproperty\u201d is defined in \u00a7 47-68a <em>(l) </em>as \u201cthe land, all buildings, all improvements and structures thereon, and all easements, rights and appurtenances belonging thereto, which have been or are intended to be submitted to the provisions of [the act].\u201d Therefore, the definition of property encompasses both land and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\u201cLeasehold condominium\u201d is defined in \u00a7 47-68a (cc). In substituting the definition of property, i.e., land and buildings, for the term \u201cproperty\u201d where it appears in the definition of \u201cleasehold condominium,\u201d we derive the following definition: \u201c \u2018Leasehold condominium\u2019 means <em>[the land and all buildings] </em>submitted to the provisions of th[e] [act] by the fee owner, whereby unit leases are issued for a period not less than fifty years and provided, in a residential leasehold condominium, such lease provides that the lessee shall have the option to purchase the fee simple title to the demised <em>[land and buildings] </em>during the term of the lease at a price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>stated or by a method stated for subsequent determination of the total price.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc). This definition, I submit, clearly does not authorize the type of hybrid condominium at issue in the present case for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">First, the definition of \u201cleasehold condominium\u201d requires that \u201cunit\u201d leases be issued for a period of not less than fifty years. In the present case, the units<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are owned in fee simple rather than leased. The definition of \u201cleasehold condominium,\u201d however, requires, at a minimum, that the <em>unit </em>is leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Second, the definition of \u201cleasehold condominium\u201d requires that the lease contain an \u201coption to purchase the fee simple title to the demised <em>[land and buildings] </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc). That provision, if not dispositive, strongly suggests that the land and buildings both must be subject to a leasehold. The lease at issue in the present case, however, provides an option to purchase the land only. Therefore, if we apply the principle that the form of ownership established by the declaration must be authorized by statute, as we should, then I conclude that the present form of ownership, under which the purchaser acquires a fee simple interest in the unit but a leasehold interest in the underlying land, does not fall within the purview of the definition of \u201cleasehold condominium\u201d contained in the act. Consequently, such form of ownership is not authorized by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">I also would conclude that the lease itself does not comply with the statutory requirements for establishing a leasehold condominium. The lease provides for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>exercise of an option to purchase the land during the eleventh year of the lease. It is my view that this provision conflicts with the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (cc) that requires \u201cthat the lessee shall have the option to purchase the fee simple title to the demised property <em>during </em>the term of the lease at a price stated or by a method stated for subsequent determination of the total price.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the term \u201cduring\u201d as \u201cthroughout the continuance or course of\u201d and \u201cat some point in the course of . . . .\u201d The application of those two meanings would lead to different results and, therefore, the term \u201cduring\u201d in \u00a7 47-68a (cc) is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On the basis of this ambiguity, I would look to the statutory scheme to determine whether there is support for one meaning of the term \u201cduring\u201d rather than the other, apply any applicable rules of statutoiy construction and review the legislative history. I also would apply common sense. I can find no statutory provision or legislative history that would provide support for either meaning. If \u201cduring,\u201d as used in \u00a7 47-68a (cc), means a single point in time, however, the failure to exercise the option to purchase would mean that no subsequent lessee would have an option to purchase the demised property as required by the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I thus would conclude that \u201cduring,\u201d as used in \u00a7 47-68a (cc), means \u201cthroughout the course of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">I also believe that the statutory requirement of an option to purchase during the term of the lease highlights the implausibility of the claim made by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tiff lessors that hybrid condominiums are authorized under the act. The plaintiffs claim that they can convey a leasehold interest in the land and the common elements while conveying fee simple title to the individual units. The plaintiffs further claim that the lease complies with the act as long as the lease: (1) offers the lessee an option to purchase <em>at a single point in time </em>during the course of the lease; and (2) has a minimum term of fifty years. If the lessee declines to exercise the purchase option for any reason, however, title to the unit and the land forever must remain divided, thereby making the property unmarketable\u2014at least toward the end of the lease\u2014and most certainly devaluing the owner\u2019s interest. This is an untenable proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">According to the condominium ground lease in the present case, the leased property includes not only all of the land but \u201call improvements lying upon or under the surface of the land and not contained in the [bjuilding, including without limitation sewers and sewer connections and paving lying upon the land . . . .\u201d When the leasehold expires, the land and all improvements revert to the declarant unencumbered by the obligations of the lease. Title to the buildings remains with the unit purchaser without the enjoyment of any of the rights under the lease. The lease in the present case, quite remarkably, does not explain or otherwise describe what happens upon its expiration, another fact that serves to confirm its unconscionability, as I discuss later in this opinion. Accordingly, if hybrid condominiums are authorized under the act, as the majority so concludes, then the term \u201cduring\u201d in \u00a7 47-68a (cc) can only reasonably mean \u201cthroughout the continuance or course of\u2019 the lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The attribution of this meaning to the term \u201cduring,\u201d in turn, would render the lease nonconforming with respect to the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>act. If hybrid condominiums are not permitted under the act, however, then the declaration would contravene the provisions of the act. Either way, it appears that the plaintiffs should not prevail on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">A determination that a hybrid condominium is not authorized under the act or that the lease contravenes the provisions of the act also implicates the issue of unconscionability. With respect to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the lease was not unconscionable, I first note that that court properly recognized that the determination of whether a lease is unconscionable must be made with due consideration of common-law principles of unconscionability. Furthermore, this court long has stated that the policy of this state is not to uphold restraints on the alienation of real property. E.g., <em>Peiter </em>v. <em>Degenring, </em>136 Conn. 331, 336, 71 A.2d 87 (1949). \u201cIt is undisputable that [i]t is the policy of the law not to uphold restrictions upon the free and unrestricted alienation of property unless they serve a legal and useful purpose. [Id.] It also is undisputable that this policy is strong and deeply rooted. J. Dukeminier &amp; J. Krier, Property (3d Ed. 1993) p. 223 ([t]he rule against direct restraints on alienation is an old one, going back to the fifteenth century or perhaps even earlier). Moreover, it is undisputable that the right of property owners to rent their real estate is one of the bundle of rights that . . . constitute [s] the essence of ownership of property. See, e.g., id., p. 86 ([property] consists of a number of disparate rights, a bundle of them: the right to possess, the right to use, the right to exclude, the right to transfer). The question . . . therefore, is whether . . . the continued maintenance of [a restriction on the alienation of property] serves a legal and useful purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>255 Conn. 143, 151, 763 A.2d 1011 (2001). Because the termination of the leasehold in this case directly affects the unit own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ers\u2019 ability to possess and use the building, this fact certainly should be a consideration in determining the unconscionability of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Additionally, when the lease terminates without the exercise of the option to purchase the land, a question arises about whether the lack of terms in the lease regarding the relationship of the parties with respect to the use of the building would lead to economic waste. We also have recognized a public policy against such waste. E.g., id., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Finally, I do not agree with the majority that \u00a7 47-68a (cc) authorizes the collective exercise by all of the unit owners of the option to purchase as the lease in the present case requires. Rather, I interpret the statute to require lessors to give each lessee a separate and individual right to exercise an option to purchase. I again would consider this factor in determining whether the lease is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">I therefore would determine that hybrid leasehold condominiums are not authorized under the act and that the declaration at issue in the present case did not create a valid condominium. Furthermore, I would conclude that the purchase option in the lease, as written, is invalid because it fails to comply with the provision of \u00a7 47-68a (cc) that requires that the lessee\u2019s option to pin-chase be exercisable at all times during the term of the lease. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial on all unresolved issues, including the issue of the unconscionability of the lease. Furthermore, a determination of whether the lease is unconscionable should be made with due consideration of the fact that hybrid condominiums are not authorized under the act, the fact that the lease does not conform to the dictates of \u00a7 47-68a (cc), and public policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"> For example, I find that a more reasonable reading of the statutory scheme requires that the declarant be the owner of the fee simple interest. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-70 (d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 47-71 (a) (\u201c[t]he <em>owner </em>or <em>owners </em>of any property in the state may submit such property to the provisions of [the act]\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 47-72 (prohibiting declarant from conveying fee simple interest or leasehold interest to purchaser with any encumbrances other than those enumerated in \u00a7 47-70, which does not include ground leases, thereby implying that declarant must be owner of fee simple interest).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> The term \u201cunit\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 47-68a (b) as \u201ca part of the property including one or more rooms or designated spaces located on one or more floors or a part or parts thereof in a building, intended for any type of independent use, and with a direct exit to a public street or highway or to common elements leading to such street or highway.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\"> Section 47-68a (cc) requires that the lease provide that \u201cthe lessee\u201d shall have the option to purchase the fee simple title to the demised property during the term of the lease.
