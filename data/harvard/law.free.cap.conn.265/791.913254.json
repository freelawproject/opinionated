The named plaintiff, Joseph Dugan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an employee of the city of Yonkers, New York, brought an action against the defendants, Mobile Medical Testing Services, Inc. (Mobile Medical),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its president and chief operating officer, Richard B. Weltman, alleging, inter alia, that the defendants were negligent in failing to notify the plaintiff of the results of an abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Mobile Medical had generated in connection with its physical examination of the plaintiff. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that, under New York law, the defendants owed no duty of care to the plaintiff. We conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In December, 1994, Mobile Medical entered into a contract with the city of Yonkers to provide physical examinations to firefighters employed by the Yonkers fire department (fire department) and, on the basis of those examinations, to determine whether the firefighters were fit for duty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The physical examinations consisted of an EKG,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a pulmonary function test and a fitness test, each of which was to be administered in accordance with standards established by the state of New York and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">On September 11, 1995, Mobile Medical personnel performed a physical examination of the plaintiff to evaluate his ability to continue working as an interior attack firefighter with the fire department. The examination occurred inside a specially equipped mobile van, which, at that time, was located in Yonkers. The examination was performed under the supervision of Gretchen Keefe, a physician.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the examination, but following the administration of the EKG, the plaintiff asked Keefe about the results of his EKG and received the following response: \u201cEverything looks fine. We only found one irregular heartbeat.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Allegedly as a result of this response, the plaintiff did not seek any subsequent medical treatment or additional testing. Thereafter, on November 4, 1995, the plaintiff suffered a heart attack at his home in Connecticut. On or about November 12, 1995, the plaintiff received a summary of his examination results from Mobile Medical, which informed the plaintiff that his EKG was abnormal and suggested that he should seek a follow-up consultation with his own physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendants, alleging that they negligently had failed to exercise reasonable care in notifying the plaintiff of his abnormal EKG. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they did not owe a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>to the plaintiff inasmuch as no physician-patient relationship existed between the parties. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">As part of its analysis, the trial court addressed the threshold issue of whether to apply New York or Connecticut law. The court noted that, before it could determine which law to apply, it first was required to determine if a conflict existed, that is, if the relevant substantive law in each state was different.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The trial court then reviewed New York and Connecticut law regarding ordinary negligence and medical malpractice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that no conflict existed between New York and Connecticut law with respect to the negligence and medical malpractice issues arising in the present case. Specifically, with regard to medical malpractice claims, the trial court concluded that Connecticut courts have adopted the standards set forth in the decision of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>New York, </em>162 App. Div. 2d 34, 36-38, 560 N.Y.S.2d 700 (1990), in which the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court held that a physician owes no duty to a plaintiff in the absence of a physician-patient relationship and that such a relationship does not arise within the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>text of a fitness for duty examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court ultimately concluded that, based on the allegations in the complaint, the plaintiffs cause of action sounded solely in medical malpractice. Having determined that a conflict of laws analysis was unnecessary, the trial court applied the principles set forth in <em>Lee, </em>effectively rendering its decision on the basis of an application of New York medical malpractice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The trial court concluded that a physician-patient relationship did not exist between the plaintiff and Mobile Medical. In so concluding, the trial court explained that \u201cno physician-patient relationship exist[s] when a physician is retained to examine a patient solely on behalf of an employer . . . .\u201d The court recognized, however, that, in accordance with <em>Lee, </em>\u201c \u2018[a]n exception applies . . . where the physician affirmatively treats or affirmatively advises the employee as to treatment and the treatment actually causes further injury.\u2019 \u201d The trial court then concluded that the exception did not apply in the present case because the statement of Keefe, the attending physician, to the plaintiff \u201c[did] not rise to the level of affirmative treatment or advisement as to treatment as a matter of law.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201c[Keefe\u2019s] statement [did] not contain any direction as to any medical treatment [that the plaintiff] should seek or forgo. . . . Indeed, the statement indicated to [the plaintiff] that he had one irregular heartbeat, but that everything else looked fine.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]t would not have been reasonably foreseeable, based on this statement alone, that [the plaintiff] would have forgone seeking medical care from his normal physicians.\u201d Accordingly, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>court concluded that, in the absence of a physician-patient relationship, the defendants did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care and, consequently, the plaintiffs claim failed as a matter of law. The trial court thereupon granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s decision on two grounds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, the plaintiff claims that, under the facts of this case and notwithstanding the holding in <em>Lee, </em>Mobile Medical had a duty to inform the plaintiff of his abnormal EKG. The plaintiff requests that we adopt a more expansive rule regarding the concept of \u201cduty\u201d than that announced in <em>Lee </em>and, accordingly, conclude that there existed a duty to notify the plaintiff about his abnormal EKG. Additionally, the plaintiff contends that, inasmuch as he brought his action against the defendants under a theory of negligence rather than medical malpractice, the decision in <em>Lee </em>should not control the outcome of this case because the holding in <em>Lee </em>was predicated on principles of medical malpractice rather than principles of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Second, the plaintiff claims that, even if we apply <em>Lee, </em>the trial court improperly concluded that Keefe\u2019s statement to the plaintiff concerning his EKG did not give rise to a duty of care as a matter of law. We conclude that, under New York law, Mobile Medical did not have a duty to inform the plaintiff of his abnormal EKG. We also conclude, however, that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>improperly determined that, as a matter of law, Keefe\u2019s statement to the plaintiff did not fall within the exception for affirmative treatment or advice, and, therefore, did not give rise to a duty of care. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We begin by noting that, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, this case does not present a \u201cfalse conflict\u201d whereby the controlling law of each jurisdiction is the same. The trial court concluded that Connecticut law is the same as New York law on the issue of whether a physical examination of an employee by a physician hired by an employer creates a physician-patient relationship that can serve as the basis for the recognition of a duty of care. The trial court reached this conclusion even though no appellate court in Connecticut ever has addressed this issue under these circumstances. Although we recognize the Superior Court cases on which the trial court relied, those cases cannot support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Connecticut law is the same as New York law with respect to this issue. Consequently, because there is no controlling appellate court precedent in Connecticut, the trial court should have addressed the conflict of laws issue to determine which state\u2019s law to apply. See R. Le\u00f1ar et a!., American Conflicts Law (4th Ed. 1986) \u00a7 92, p. 272 (only determination of \u201cfalse conflict,\u201d whereby application of law of either jurisdiction would produce same results, eliminates need for conflict of laws analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We conclude, nonetheless, that we are constrained in this appeal to apply New York law. We reach this conclusion for the following reasons. First, the plaintiff has not presented this court with an adequate challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision effectively to apply New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>York law, that is, the principles announced in <em>Lee.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court applied these principles throughout its analysis on the basis of its determination that Connecticut has adopted the principles of <em>Lee </em>with respect to medical malpractice claims. Although the plaintiff contends that <em>Lee </em>is not controlling, he does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there is no conflict between New York and Connecticut law, nor does he address whether a conflict of laws analysis would favor application of Connecticut law should we conclude that a conflict exists between New York and Connecticut law. At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff argued that it was unnecessary to challenge the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the conflict of laws issue in light of the fact that the plaintiff agreed with the trial court\u2019s decision to apply Connecticut law. This statement, however, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court decided to apply Connecticut law, not on the basis of a conflict of laws analysis, but, rather, on the basis of its conclusion that Connecticut has adopted the decision in <em>Lee </em>and, therefore, that no conflict exists between New York and Connecticut law. Thus, the trial court applied \u201c \u2018the law of the forum state, to the extent it is common to both [states],\u2019 \u201d or, in other words, the decision in <em>Lee </em>in light of the fact that <em>Lee </em>has been adopted in Connecticut. Inasmuch as the plaintiff does not raise a conflict of laws issue on appeal, he is foreclosed from arguing that this court should apply a more expansive rule than that announced in <em>Lee. </em>In order for us to review such a claim, the plaintiff not only needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>argue that there exists a conflict between New York and Connecticut law, but also that Connecticut law should apply under a conflict of laws analysis. Because the plaintiff has not raised either argument, we decline to consider whether Connecticut law in this area favors a more expansive rule than that announced in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We nevertheless address the conflict of laws issue in this case because this issue is a question of law that likely will recur upon remand, and we have sufficient information upon which to base such a determination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Schroeder v. Triangulum Associates, </em>259 Conn. 325, 327, 789 A.2d 459 (2002) (after ordering new trial on basis of dispositive issue, addressing additional issues likely to arise at retrial). Our analysis leads to the conclusion that New York law should apply under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In deciding conflict of laws issues, we are guided by the principles set forth in our previous decision in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>201 Conn. 632, 519 A.2d 13 (1986). In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]his court has traditionally adhered to the doctrine that the substantive rights and obligations arising out of a tort controversy are determined by the law of the place of injury, or lex loci delicti.\u201d Id., 637. Under the facts of <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>however, \u201cwe expressly abandoned categorical allegiance to the doctrine of lex loci delicti in tort actions. <em>O\u2019Connor . . . </em>involved an action by the passenger of an automobile against the driver for injuries arising out of an automobile accident. Both parties were Connecticut domiciliaries but the accident occurred in Quebec, Canada. The principal issue was whether to apply the law of Quebec, which barred the plaintiffs action, or the law of Connecticut, which permitted it. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>court [in <em>O\u2019Connor] </em>applied the doctrine of lex loci delicti and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint. On appeal, we substituted the most significant relationship analysis of \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 145 of the Restatement [(Second) of Conflict of Laws] . . . for the doctrine of lex loci delicti. . . . After considering the Restatement [Second] factors, we concluded that Connecticut had the closest relationship and the greatest interest in the disposition of the case. We therefore applied the law of Connecticut.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>229 Conn. 359, 371-72, 641 A.2d 783 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Subsection (1) of \u00a7 145 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws provides that \u201c [t]he rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145 (1), p. 414 (1971). Subsection (2) of \u00a7 6 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, in turn, provides: \u201cWhen there is no [statutory] directive, the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include (a) the needs of the interstate and international systems, (b) the relevant policies of the forum, (c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue, (d) the protection of justified expectations, (e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, (f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and (g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.\u201d Id., \u00a7 6 (2), p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\u201cFor assistance in our evaluation of the policy choices set out in \u00a7\u00a7 145 (1) and 6 (2) [of the Restatement (Second)], we turn ... to \u00a7 145 (2) .. . which establishes black-letter rules of priority to facilitate the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>cation of the principles of \u00a7 6 to tort cases.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 652. Subsection (2) of \u00a7 145 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws provides: \u201cContacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include: (a) the place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered. These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 145 (2), p. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In support of his contention in the trial court that Connecticut law should apply, the plaintiff offered the following reasons: (1) the plaintiff is a domiciliary of Connecticut; (2) Mobile Medical is incorporated in Connecticut; (3) Mobile Medical analyzed the test results in Connecticut; (4) the plaintiff suffered his heart attack at his home in Connecticut; and (5) the plaintiff incurred medical expenses in Connecticut and has and will continue to seek medical treatment in Connecticut. The defendants offered the following reasons for the application of New York law: (1) the plaintiff was employed in New York; (2) the physical examination of the plaintiff was administered in New York; (3) the contract pursuant to which Mobile Medical administered the physical examination of the plaintiff was negotiated, entered into and substantially performed in New York; (4) the employees examined pursuant to the contract were all employees of a fire department located in New York; (5) New York had expressed an interest in this area of law on the basis of its case law, whereas Connecticut has yet to address this particular issue; and (6) inasmuch as a New York appellate court has addressed this particular issue, it would be substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>easier to determine and apply its law. We agree with the defendants that New York law should apply in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 145 (2) of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We now analyze the relevant Restatement (Second) factors in the context of the facts of the present case. We begin by considering the specific contacts of each jurisdiction to the present controversy, which, under \u00a7 145 (2), are factors to be considered in determining the applicable law under \u00a7 6. Inasmuch as the plaintiff in the present case is a domiciliary of Connecticut and suffered his injury in Connecticut, and Mobile Medical is incorporated in Connecticut, factors (a) and (c) of \u00a7 145 (2) weigh in favor of applying Connecticut law. Factors (b) and (d), however, favor application of New York law. Specifically, it was the statement made by Keefe, the attending physician, that allegedly led the plaintiff to forgo further medical treatment, which, in turn, allegedly led to his heart attack. Thus, the primary injury causing conduct occurred in New York. See id., \u00a7 145 (2) (b), p. 414. Moreover, the relationship between the parties, which was based solely on Mobile Medical\u2019s administration of the plaintiffs fitness for duty examination, was centered in New York. See id., \u00a7 145 (2) (d), p. 414. Therefore, because the injury causing conduct occurred in New York, and because the relationship between the parties was centered in New York, \u00a7 145 (2) (b) and (d) favors application of New York law. As <em>O\u2019Connor </em>informs us, \u201cit is the significance, and not the number, of \u00a7 145 (2) contacts that determines the outcome of the choice of law inquiry under the Restatement [Second] approach. As the concluding sentence of \u00a7 145 (2) provides, \u2018[t]hese contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 652-53, quoting 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 145 (2), p. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Upon evaluating the relative importance of each factor, we conclude that New York has the greater contact with the parties in this case. In our view, the most significant factor is that Mobile Medical administered fitness for duty examinations to the plaintiff and other employees of a New York fire department. Any duty of care that Mobile Medical may have owed to the plaintiff derived from Mobile Medical\u2019s examination of the plaintiff to determine whether he could meet the physical demands associated with his position as an interior attack firefighter with a New York fire department. Moreover, the primary issue in this case is whether a medical services provider owes a duty of care to an employee whose employer contracts with that provider to perform fitness for duty examinations of its employees. Thus, although the plaintiffs domicile is a relevant factor, we believe that his status as a New York firefighter is more significant under the circumstances. More importantly, there is a strong and direct relationship between any duty of care that we may recognize in this case and Mobile Medical\u2019s performance of the fitness for duty examination of the plaintiff, which occurred in New York. Although we acknowledge that Connecticut\u2019s relationship to the present controversy might not be as fortuitous as Quebec\u2019s relationship to the controversy in <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>see <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 645-46 (\u201capplication of the lex loci delicti doctrine [in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>would have made] determination of the governing law turn upon a purely fortuitous circumstance: the geographical location of the parties\u2019 automobile [when] the accident occurred\u201d); the fact that the plaintiff is a Connecticut domiciliary and that he suffered his heart attack in Connecticut are circumstances that are merely incidental to the present controversy. Indeed, the plaintiffs status as an employee of a New York fire department and the fact that the fitness for duty examination occurred in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>York are the more significant and relevant considerations in determining whether to apply Connecticut law or New York law. Furthermore, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs employer had given the plaintiff the option of having his examination administered by a health care provider of his choosing, but that he had opted to have it administered by Mobile Medical.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In applying the factors enumerated in subsection (2) of \u00a7 6 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, we cannot discern any compelling reason to apply Connecticut law rather than New York law. In determining which state\u2019s law to apply under \u00a7 6 (2) of the Restatement (Second), we must review, inter alia, the respective policies and interests of both New York and Connecticut as to whether medical service providers that are hired by an employer to perform fitness for duty examinations of the employer\u2019s employees owe a duty to those employees. First, we recognize that no Connecticut appellate court has addressed the issue of whether a medical services provider owes a duty of care to an employee under these circumstances. Thus, neither this court nor the Appellate Court has yet to express our state\u2019s policy interest regarding this issue of law. Even if we assume, arguendo, that this court would be inclined to follow a more expansive rule than that announced in <em>Lee, </em>and to ascribe to a policy that differs from New York\u2019s policy with respect to a medical service provider\u2019s duty of care under these circumstances, that inclination would not tip the scales in favor of applying Connecticut law in this case. With respect to this point, we note that New York has expressed an interest, by virtue of its decision in <em>Lee, </em>in placing reasonable and practical limitations on legally cognizable duties owed by medical service providers under circumstances such as those presented in this case. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 162 App. Div. 2d 36-38; see also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>160 App. Div. 2d 914, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>915, 554 N.Y.S.2d 640 (1990) (physician hired to perform fitness for duty examination of employee owed no duty of care to employee). Thus, even if we assume that Connecticut has an interest in recognizing a duty of care under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that such an interest outweighs New York\u2019s interest in having its law applied. Moreover, New York has established a bright-line rule that specifically addresses the precise issue in this case, thereby facilitating the application of its law. See 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 6 (2) (g), p. 10. Although we previously have not afforded this consideration substantial weight; see <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 651-52, citing 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 6, comment (j), p. 16 (factor in \u00a7 6 [2] [g] \u201cshould not be overemphasized, since it is obviously of greater importance that choice-of-law rules lead to desirable results\u201d); it nonetheless is a factor that, in a close case such as the one before us, should be considered. Finally, \u00a7 6 (2) (d) instructs us to consider whether the parties have any justified expectations that warrant protection through the application of a certain state\u2019s law. In this regard, we have stated that the protection of the parties\u2019 justified expectations is of particular importance when dealing with contracts. See <em>Interface Flooring Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>261 Conn. 601, 612, 804 A.2d 201 (2002), citing 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 188, comment (b), p. 576. As Mobile Medical notes, it negotiated and executed the contract to provide fitness for duty examinations in New York. Additionally, Mobile Medical examined the plaintiff in New York and, therefore, the contract was performed in New York. Thus, the expectation factor heavily favors application of New York law. See <em>Interface Flooring Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 610 (when contract was entered into and performed in Georgia, presumption arises that Georgia law applies). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Therefore, on the basis of the foregoing, including our determination that New York has greater contacts with the parties to this controversy and our determination that neither state\u2019s interests or policy considerations outweigh each other, we conclude that New York law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We now analyze the issues raised on appeal under New York law.

When the challenged conduct forms an integral part of the medical treatment process, however, the claim properly is characterized as one sounding in medical malpractice rather than ordinary negligence. E.g., <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Uljanov, </em>74 N.Y.2d 673, 675, 541 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>398, 543 N.Y.S.2d 369 (1989); <em>Twitchell </em>v. <em>MacKay, 78 </em>App. Div. 2d 125, 128-29, 434 N.Y.S.2d 516 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The New York Court of Appeals clarified the distinction between the two causes of action in <em>Bleiler </em>v. Bodnar, 65 N.Y.2d 65, 479 N.E.2d 230, 489 N.Y.S.2d 885 (1985). <em>In Bleiler, </em>the plaintiff, James Bleiler, arrived at the emergency room of the defendant hospital seeking treatment for an eye injury. Id., 66. Upon arrival, a nurse obtained Bleiler\u2019s medical history, after which a physician examined and treated Bleiler. Id. Ultimately, however, the physician failed to detect a foreign object that was lodged in Bleiler\u2019s right eye. Id. Consequently, Bleiler suffered a permanent loss of vision in that eye. Id., 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Bleiler filed an action in which he asserted several claims. Id. Specifically, Bleiler alleged that the hospital, physician and nurse were negligent in administering medical care to him, and that the hospital was negligent in failing to provide competent personnel and in promulgating certain emergency care protocol. Id. On appeal, the New York Court of Appeals was called upon to determine whether Bleiler\u2019s claims sounded in ordinary negligence or in medical malpractice in order to identify the appropriate statute of limitations to apply to those claims. Id. The court explained that Bleiler\u2019s claims that the physician and nurse each were negligent in failing to take proper medical histories and that the physician was negligent in performing his examination of Bleiler could only be characterized as medical malpractice claims in light of the fact that the challenged conduct was \u201ca crucial element of diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Id., 72. The court also noted that claims of negligent medical care are not limited to physicians, and can be asserted against other health care providers, such as nurses, who provide similar treatment, or even against a hospital, either directly or on the basis of vicarious liability for the acts of its employees. Id., 69, 71-72. On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>hand, the court recognized that when a claim is based on a hospital\u2019s negligent selection of staff or a failure to adopt and prescribe proper procedures and regulations, \u201cthe requisite elements [are] markedly different from a malpractice cause of action.\u201d Id., 73. Thus, these types of claims sound in ordinary negligence; \u201c[i]n both instances, the gravamen of the complaint is not negligence in furnishing medical treatment to a patient, but the hospital\u2019s failure in fulfilling a different duty.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Additionally, the New York Court of Appeals held in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Uljanov, </em>supra, 74 N.Y.2d 673, that a claim \u201cchalleng[ing] [a] hospital\u2019s assessment of the supervisory and treatment needs of [a] highly intoxicated patient during his initial emergency room care\u201d; id., 675; sounded in medical malpractice. Id. In <em>Scott, </em>the plaintiff, Thomas Scott, arrived at the hospital in a highly intoxicated state and was placed in a hospital bed with the side rails placed in the upright position for his safety. Id., 674. Subsequently, Scott climbed out of the end of the bed, fell and suffered a head injury. Id. Scott brought an action against the hospital for negligent supervision. Id. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations governing medical malpractice claims. Id. On appeal, the New York Court of Appeals restricted its analysis to whether the claim sounded in negligence or medical malpractice. See id., 674-75. The court concluded that, on the basis on its decision in <em>Bleiler, </em>the claim must be characterized as one for medical malpractice in light of the fact that \u201cthe conduct at issue constituted an integral part of the process of rendering medical treatment to [Scott].\u201d Id., 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff contends that his claim sounds in ordinary negligence inasmuch as the defendants were not sued as treating physicians but, rather, as a corporation and its president. The plaintiff further contends that he did not allege negligence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>the rendering of medical treatment but, rather, negligence in Mobile Medical\u2019s failure to inform him of his abnormal EKG.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We are unpersuaded, however, that the plaintiffs allegations do not constitute a medical malpractice claim. Even if we were to accept the plaintiffs contention that the defendants were sued in their capacities as a medical services company and its president, rather than as physicians, this, in and of itself, does not preclude the plaintiffs claim from being characterized as one sounding strictly in medical malpractice. See <em>Bleiler </em>v. <em>Bodnar, </em>supra, 65 N.Y.2d 69, 70 (recognizing that medical malpractice claims may be brought against hospital, either directly or indirectly through actions of its employees). The plaintiff offers no support for his contention that medical malpractice claims can be asserted only against physicians, and it is clear that Mobile Medical was acting as a medical service provider in rendering the type of services involved in this case. Moreover, the crux of the complaint concerns Mobile Medical\u2019s medical diagnosis of a life threatening condition and its subsequent failure to notify. In view of the fact that such diagnosis is substantially related to medical treatment and, therefore, \u201cconstitute [s] an integral part of the process of rendering medical treatment\u201d; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Uljanov, </em>supra, 74 N.Y.2d 675; and, because the disclosure of a medical condition, or failure thereof, involves the exercise of medical judgment, the plaintiffs claim properly is characterized as one sounding in medical malpractice. Accordingly, because the plaintiffs complaint sounds solely in medical malpractice and involves facts bringing it directly within the holding of <em>Lee, </em>we analyze the facts of the present case under the principles announced in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In <em>Lee, </em>Henry Young, a physician hired by the fire department of the city of New York, performed a fitness for duty examination on the decedent, Joseph J. Lee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>a fireman, as part of the department\u2019s preemployment screening process. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 162 App. Div. 2d 35. On the basis of this examination, which included an EKG, Young determined that Lee was qualified for duty. Id. Soon thereafter, Lee died as a result of arteriosclerosis of his right coronary artery and enlargement of his heart. Id. The plaintiff, the administrator of Lee\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death action against the city of New York (city) and Young, alleging medical malpractice as a result of Young\u2019s failure to diagnose Lee\u2019s medical ailments. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The city and Young filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that, because there was no physician-patient relationship between Young and Lee, the plaintiff could not successfully maintain a medical malpractice action. Id. The trial court denied that motion; id.; but was reversed on appeal. Id., 39. In reversing the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion for summary judgment, the Appellate Division explained: \u201cGenerally, recovery for a physician\u2019s malpractice is predicated upon the existence of a physician-patient relationship .... The physician-patient relationship does not exist if the physician is retained solely to examine an employee on behalf of an employer .... An exception applies, however, when the physician affirmatively treats or affirmatively advises the employee as to treatment and the treatment actually causes further injury.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The Appellate Division then made the following conclusions: (1) Lee had submitted to the fitness for duty examination as part of the New York fire department\u2019s eligibility criteria; (2) Young had performed the examination solely for the purpose of determining Lee\u2019s fitness for duty as a firefighter; and (3) Young did not affirmatively treat or advise Lee as to a course of treatment. Id., 37-38. On the basis of these conclusions, the Appellate Division held that no physician-patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>relationship existed between Young and Lee. Id., 38. Accordingly, the Appellate Division reversed the trial court\u2019s order and granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Young and the city. Id., 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We agree with the trial court in the present case that, under the principles announced in <em>Lee, </em>Mobile Medical does not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff in the absence of any treatment or advice on the part of Mobile Medical personnel. In <em>Lee, </em>the Appellate Division concluded that when a \u201cphysician is employed or retained by a third party to conduct an examination for the benefit of the third party, there must be something more than a mere examination in order to find a physician-patient relationship .... There must be some showing that the physician affirmatively treated the patient or affirmatively advised him to be treated.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 37. When a physician or other medical services provider performs a fitness for duty examination, but otherwise remains silent, there is no affirmative action upon which to base a finding of a duty. Id. Thus, in the absence of any treatment or advice on the part of Mobile Medical or its personnel, a physician-patient relationship could not have existed between the plaintiff and Mobile Medical such that Mobile Medical would have owed the plaintiff a duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We next consider the exception that the Appellate Division recognized in <em>Lee </em>for affirmative treatment or advice. On the basis of this exception, we reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, as a matter of law, Keefe\u2019s statement to the plaintiff in this case did not constitute treatment or advice and, therefore, did not give rise to a duty of care. In the present case, Mobile Medical personnel administered a physical examination of the plaintiff for the purpose of determining his fitness for duty as an interior attack firefighter. The examination consisted of several tests, including an EKG, which were performed at a local testing site, under the supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>sion of Keefe, the attending physician employed by Mobile Medical. Keefe allegedly was aware of the physical and emotional demands associated with the plaintiffs particular job. As we previously have noted, during the course of the plaintiffs examination, following administration of the EKG, the plaintiff asked Keefe about his EKG. Keefe told the plaintiff: \u201cEverything looks fine. We only found one irregular heartbeat.\u201d The plaintiff allegedly relied on Keefe\u2019s statement in deciding to forgo further treatment or consultation and subsequently suffered a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The trial court concluded that Keefe\u2019s statement \u201cindicated to [the plaintiff] that he had one irregular heartbeat, but that everything else looked fine.\u201d The court concluded further that, as a matter of law, it was not \u201creasonably foresee [able]\u201d that \u201c[the plaintiff] would rely on [this] statement . . . and otherwise not seek treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The defendants argue that there is no appreciable difference between Keefe\u2019s actual statement and the trial court\u2019s characterization of that statement, and that they are two different ways of saying the same thing. On the other hand, the plaintiff argues that Keefe\u2019s actual statement \u201cimplies that one irregular heartbeat is not an indication of there being anything clinically wrong or abnormal,\u201d whereas, the trial court\u2019s characterization of Keefe\u2019s statement \u201cwould indicate that the irregular heartbeat was not fine . . . [but] that everything else was fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we are required to do in determining the propriety of a ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we cannot reject the plaintiffs interpretation of Keefe\u2019s actual statement. We conclude that, in light of the nature of the services performed, as well as the totality of the circumstances of this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the plaintiffs interpretation of Keefe\u2019s statement certainly is a fair and reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the proper standards governing rulings on motions for summary judgment. We have held that summary judgment \u201cis appropriate only if a fair and reasonable person could conclude only one way.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 751, 660 A.2d 810 (1995); see also <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 216-17, 640 A.2d 89 (1994). To succeed on a motion for summary judgment, \u201c[t]he movant must show that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. ... [A] summary disposition . . . should be on evidence which a jury would not be at liberty to disbelieve and which would require a directed verdict for the moving party. ... [A] directed verdict may be rendered only where, on the evidence <em>viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, </em>the trier of fact could not reasonably reach any other conclusion than that embodied in the verdict as directed.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 751-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court necessarily concluded that a fair and reasonable person, under the present facts, could not have concluded that Keefe\u2019s statement to the plaintiff constituted treatment or advice. We disagree. Accordingly, because there exists an issue of material fact as to whether Keefe\u2019s statement concerning the plaintiffs EKG constituted treatment or advice, the resolution of which may lead to a finding of a duty of care, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\"> Patricia Dugan, Joseph Dugan\u2019s wife, also is a plaintiff who seeks to recover from the defendants for loss of consortium. Both Patricia Dugan and Joseph Dugan are domiciliaries of Connecticut.

According to the plaintiff, this claim sounds solely in negligence rather than in medical malpractice. We also note that, although the plaintiff asserted only one cause of action, both the plaintiff, in his opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,, and the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, addressed the issue of whether anyone employed by Mobile Medical, i.e., the attending physician or medical technicians, ever had treated or advised the plaintiff during the course of his examination. Accordingly, we address this issue on appeal even though the plaintiff did not raise such a claim in his complaint. The plaintiff contends, however, that, unlike the ordinary negligence claim that he raises in his complaint, any claim based on the alleged advice of an attending physician sounds solely in medical malpractice. We discuss the proper characterization of the plaintiffs claims later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> The trial court cited to <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-93-0528375 (February 28,1994) (11 Conn.
