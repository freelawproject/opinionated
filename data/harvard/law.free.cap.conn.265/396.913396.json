The state appeals from the Appellate Court\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s order involuntarily to medicate the defendant, Earl Jacobs, who is incompetent. The state challenges the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s first and sixth amendment rights were implicated by the trial court\u2019s order. We vacate the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The record reveals the following procedural history. The defendant was charged with simple trespass in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-110a, breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-181, assault of a peace officer in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-167c, interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a and carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-206 (a). <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>70 Conn. App. 488, 492, 802 A.2d 857 (2002). The trial court found the defendant incompetent to stand trial and, in an attempt to restore the defendant to competency, remanded him to the custody of the department of mental health and addiction services for inpatient services. The defendant, however, refused to cooperate with his attorney and health care personnel. The trial court, in conformance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>(k) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>233 Conn. 44, 658 A.2d 947 (1995), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 671, 669 A.2d 573 (1996), held a hearing to determine whether the defendant should be medicated involuntarily to restore his competence to stand trial. On January 27, 2000, the trial court ruled that the state had met its burden of proof pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) and ordered the defendant to be involuntarily medicated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 493-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court\u2019s decision should be reversed \u201cbecause forced medication in this case would violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the first, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution . . . .\u201d Id., 490. The state claimed that review of the trial court\u2019s order was limited to whether involuntary medication would violate the defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment rights. Id., 505. The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s first and sixth amendment rights were implicated by the order involuntarily to medicate him. Id. Applying the standard adopted by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 84-86, and codified as \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2), the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>further concluded, however, that \u201cinvoluntary medication will serve the government\u2019s interest in rendering the defendant competent, while at the same time protecting the defendant to the extent possible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 515. On that basis, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Both parties sought certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. The defendant\u2019s petition for certification was denied. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>261 Conn. 929, 806 A.2d 1068 (2002). The state\u2019s petition for certification was granted, limited to the following certified question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant had first and sixth amendment rights that the trial court must consider during a hearing pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>[supra, 233 Conn. 44]?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>261 Conn. 929, 930, 806 A.2d 1068 (2002). Oral arguments on this matter were heard on May 20, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">On June 16, 2003, the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in the case of <em>Sell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 123 S. Ct. 2174, 156 L. Ed. 2d 197 (2003). The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe [federal] [constitution permits the [gjovemment involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial, but only if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests.\u201d Id., 179. This standard differs from the standard adopted by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 84-86, in several respects. Relevant to the limited certified question before this court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Sell </em>requires that the trial court consider a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>dant\u2019s fair trial rights, which are encompassed by the sixth amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Garcia </em>was superseded by <em>Sell. </em>Because the trial court applied the <em>Garcia </em>standard, and because we conclude that the standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sell </em>applies to the circumstances of the present case, the judgment of the Appellate Court must be vacated and the case must be remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a new hearing on all issues in conformance with the United States Supreme Court opinion in <em>Sell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is vacated and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the trial court order for involuntary medication and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the court finds that the defendant will not attain competency . . . absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held ... [to consider the report submitted to the court by the defendant\u2019s health care guardian], it may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant\u2019s liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regime will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant\u2019s health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence overrides the defendant\u2019s interest in self-determination. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\"> We also note that <em>Sell </em>differs from <em>Garcia </em>in other respects, not raised by the certified question in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\"> We note that the petitioner in <em>Sell </em>claimed that he had a \u201cfundamental, [f]irst [ajmendment right to avoid forced medication aimed at changing the way he thinks. \u201d The standard articulated in <em>Sell </em>did not, however, require that the trial court consider a defendant\u2019s first amendment rights in determining whether involuntary medication is proper. The United States Supreme Court, thus, implicitly rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that an incompetent defendant has a first amendment right to avoid involuntary medication.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
