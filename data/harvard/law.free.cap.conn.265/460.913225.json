We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim of trial court impropriety and therefore do not address his remaining claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts and procedural history regarding the two cases underlying this appeal. See footnote 5 of this opinion. In the first case, the state alleged that, on September 2, 1997, in the vicinity of 500 Lindley Street in Bridgeport, the defendant had attempted to murder Rudolph Snead, Jr., his partner in a crack cocaine operation, by shooting at Snead while in his car and that the defendant thereby had committed risk of injury to the two minor children, Leroy Brown, Jr., and Tyree Snead, both seven years of age, who were in the backseat of Snead\u2019s car during the shooting. All three of the victims were identified by name in the police arrest warrant affidavit dated September 11,1997, and in the second substitute information filed January 20, 1998. In the second case, the state alleged that on May 29, 1998, while he was free on bond following his arrest for the drive-by shooting in the first case, the defendant, who had covered his face to conceal his identity, murdered Snead at the Boston Avenue Barbershop in Bridgeport. The defendant was represented initially by Frank Riccio in connection with the first case and, thereafter, by Gary Mastronardi, who filed his appearance on July 23,1998, in connection with both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Following the consolidation of the two cases, on August 11,1998, the state filed a motion for a protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>order to preclude disclosure to the defense of the identity of certain witnesses, including the two minor victims, Brown and Tyree Snead. At the hearing on that motion, held on October 6,1998, the trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>provided Mastronardi with two alternatives: (1) the court would order disclosure of the names and addresses of the state\u2019s witnesses to Mastronardi, but would prohibit him from disclosing that information to the defendant; or (2) the court would grant the defendant\u2019s discovery motion with the names and addresses redacted. The court assured Mastronardi that, prior to trial, he would be able to share the information with the defendant to prepare his defense. Mastronardi advised the court that he knew that there were two minors involved in the drive-by shooting and that he and the defendant already knew their names. On December 9, 1998, the court nevertheless issued an order precluding Mastronardi from disclosing to the defendant the names and addresses of any witnesses who had given statements to the police. Pursuant to that court order, on or about December 23,1998, senior assistant state\u2019s attorney C. Robert Satti, Jr., provided Mastronardi with the statement by Brown regarding the drive-by shooting and filed with the clerk of the court notice of service of disclosure with an attached supplemental disclosure listing, inter alia, the statement given by Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Tragically, on January 7,1999, Brown and his mother, Karen Clarke, were brutally murdered in their apartment on Earl Avenue in Bridgeport, where they recently had moved. The state thereafter charged the defendant and his brother, Adrian Peeler, in a third case with those murders, and John Walkley filed an appearance as a special public defender for the defendant in connection with the Brown and Clarke murders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>On June 9,1999, the state moved to disqualify Mastronardi from representing the defendant in the two cases involving Snead on the ground that the state intended to call Mastronardi as a witness in the defendant\u2019s capital felony case for the murder of Brown and Clarke. Specifically, the motion provided that \u201c[i]t is expected that Attorney Mastronardi will be called as a witness in the [capital felony case] regarding any knowledge on his part regarding the address and location of Karen Clarke and Leroy Brown, Jr. Attorney Mastronardi has spoken to the press and to Judge Ronan regarding a [s]tate\u2019s [objection to disclosure of the above [witnesses\u2019] address and statements claiming that he or his client had knowledge of their address before the [s]tate\u2019s [m]otion [for a protective order].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On June 30, 1999, the trial court, <em>Thim, J., </em>held a hearing regarding the state\u2019s motion to disqualify Mastronardi. Responding to the motion, Mastronardi contended that the state lacked any ground on which to disqualify him. He advised the court that \u201cMr. Satti, who is the prosecutor who\u2019s handling [the capital felony] case, knows full well that I never had the Earl Avenue address. And I assume that he\u2019s told this to [state\u2019s attorney Jonathan Benedict]. I\u2019ve said it ad nauseam since the day this happened. I never had the Earl Avenue address. I never knew where these two people lived. And Mr. Satti\u2019s words to me in court one day were: In light of all this, aren\u2019t you glad that the state never gave you the Earl Avenue address? Now I don\u2019t understand why Mr. Benedict would get up and even suggest something like that in open court on the record when he knows that that\u2019s not true. His office never gave the Earl Avenue address to me and I never had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>it. I never knew that these people lived on Earl Avenue until I read it in the newspaper and that is an established fact. That\u2019s not\u2014Mr. Satti could be called as a witness to establish that. Do we disqualify the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office in this case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Rather than pursue the claim in its motion that Mastronardi had given the defendant the victims\u2019 Earl Avenue address, at the hearing the state contended: \u201cSo it\u2019s not so much evidence that the state would seek to offer as to the defendant\u2019s knowing where they live, but rather what is necessary and most relevant in the double homicide trial is the confirmation that Leroy Brown would indeed be a witness. That in fact is the focal point of the state\u2019s evidence as to motive in the double homicide. I\u2019d submit that the argument that the December [1998] disclosure triggered the January [1999] murders is most compelling and that therefore Mr. Mastronardi\u2019s testimony in the trial of the double homicide will be most necessary and will not be uncontested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Mastronardi made several points in response. First, in light of the fact that the state was seeking to deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to counsel of his choice, Mastronardi contended that the state was required to provide him with specific questions it intended to ask and then to establish that it could not get the information it sought from any other source. Second, Mastronardi disputed the claim that the state needed his testimony to establish the fact that Brown\u2019s statement had been disclosed to him pursuant to the December 9,1998 discovery order. Indeed, Mastronardi pointed out that it was undisputed and a matter of public record that a copy of Brown\u2019s statement had been turned over to him on December 22,1998, pursuant to the discovery order. Finally, Mastronardi cautioned that when and how the defendant had gained certain information would, in all likelihood, be privileged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>therefore outside the reach of the state\u2019s questions in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Finally, in response the state contended that Mastronardi \u201csuggests that . . . perhaps the state can develop the information it wants to develop through some other avenue. That may well be. I don\u2019t know that it is in fact true at this time. But that does not mean the state would then be restricted and deprived of giving Mr. Mastronardi\u2019s evidence as well. I think [what] the state seeks to produce with Mr. Mastronardi is already fairly clear from my opening remarks and they all relate, essentially, to what happened in December [of 1998] with notification that . . . Brown was in fact to be a witness.\u201d The trial court then granted the state\u2019s motion to disqualify Mastronardi, concluding that \u201cone of the core issues in the case is . . . [what] knowledge [the defendant] had about Brown\u2019s potential testimony and when and how he obtained that knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant, through his newly appointed special public defender, Robert Sullivan, filed an opposition to the state\u2019s request for a protective order to contest the state\u2019s further attempts to withhold witness identities and statements. In support of his motion, the defendant referenced statements made by Mastronardi at the hearing on the protective order held on October 6, 1998, specifically, that Mastronardi had informed the court that the defense already was aware of the identities of the minors and that at least one, if not both, had given the state sworn statements. The defendant also cited an article from the Hartford Courant\u2019s Sunday Northeast magazine, dated June 13, 1999, in which Benedict conceded that the court order of December 9,1998, allowing the defendant\u2019s attorney to share with the defendant the contents of the statements, did not result in the identity of the witnesses being revealed to the defense. Specifically, Benedict was quoted in that interview as stating: \u201cOne thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>you\u2019ve got to understand . . . everybody knew everybody. . . . [T]he defense knew their identities even before coming to court.\u201d The state presented no evidence at the hearing to contradict that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On August 6, 1999, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to continue the protective orders and ordered that the state did not have to disclose the subject material until after jury selection had commenced. Additionally, the court, pursuant to a motion by the state, consolidated all of the cases against the defendant with the case against his brother, Adrian Peeler, in connection with the Brown and Clarke homicides. Later, the trial court, <em>Ford, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to sever the cases against him involving Snead from the capital felony cases against the defendant and his brother involving Brown and Clarke.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of all four charges in connection with the Snead cases and sentenced to a total effective sentence of 105 years incarceration after the sentence enhancement pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k was imposed. Thereafter, the defendant was tried for the Brown and Clarke homicides. See footnote 6 of this opinion. During that capital felony trial, the state presented Satti as a witness to testify as to the specifics of the December 9, 1998 discovery order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Satti testified that, pursuant to that order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>he was to turn over witness statements to Mastronardi, who then was permitted to discuss with the defendant the contents of those statements but not to disclose the names of the witnesses who had provided the statements. Mastronardi also related the terms of the trial court\u2019s discovery order, confirming that he was permitted to discuss the contents of the statements with the defendant, but not to disclose the identity of the authors of two of the statements. The state never questioned Mastronardi about what, if anything, he in fact had done in connection with the statements pursuant to the court order. Rather, the state questioned Mastronardi about whether, in his career of practicing law, he ever had violated a court order, to which he responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that, in the absence of a compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony at the trial involving the Brown and Clarke homicides, the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to disqualify Mastronardi in the Snead cases. The defendant contends that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel of choice under the state and federal constitutions because the state did not demonstrate a compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The state contends in response that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary to help prove the identity of the defendant and the intent needed to establish the defendant\u2019s role in the murders, specifically, \u201cthat the December 22, 1998 disclosure was a catalyst in the double homicide [of Brown and Clarke].\u201d The state reasons that the defendant did not consider Brown to be a witness until he learned that Brown had given a statement against him. Therefore, the state contends that Mastronardi \u201cwas prohibited from revealing to the defendant the names of any witnesses . . . [and that] [o]nly Mastronardi could testify that he scrupulously complied with that [discovery] order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We agree with the defendant that the record did not demonstrate that the state had met its burden of proving that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly disqualified Mastronardi in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel of his choice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We begin with a discussion of the pertinent legal principles that guide our resolution of this issue. It is well settled that the guarantee of assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution encompasses the right to select one\u2019s own attorney. \u201cIt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932). Statements on this subject stem largely from an appreciation that a primary purpose of the sixth amendment is to grant a criminal defendant effective control over the conduct of his defense. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>841 F.2d 1485, 1502 (10th Cir. 1988); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mintzes, </em>761 F.2d 275, 279 n.5 (6th Cir. 1985). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, the sixth amendment \u201cgrants to the accused personally the right to make his defense . . . [because] it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense fails.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819-20, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">A critical aspect of making a defense is choosing the person who serves as one\u2019s assistant and representative. \u201cThe right to retain private counsel serves to foster the trust between attorney and client that is necessary for the attorney to be a truly effective advocate. . . . Not only are decisions crucial to the defendant\u2019s liberty placed in counsel\u2019s hands . . . but the defendant\u2019s perception of the fairness of the process, and his willingness to acquiesce in its results, depend upon his confidence in his counsel\u2019s dedication, loyalty, and ability. .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u201cThe right to retain private counsel also serves to assure some modicum of equality between the Government and those it chooses to prosecute. . . . The right to privately chosen and compensated counsel also serves broader institutional interests. The virtual socialization of criminal defense work in this country that would be the result of a widespread abandonment of the right to retain chosen counsel . . . too readily would standardize the provision of criminal-defense services and diminish defense counsel\u2019s independence. There is a place in our system of criminal justice for the maverick and the risk taker and for approaches that might not fit into the structured environment of a public defender\u2019s office, or that might displease a judge whose preference for nonconfrontationai styles of advocacy might influence the judge\u2019s appointment decisions. . . . There is also a place for the employment of specialized defense counsel for technical and complex cases .... The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>choice of counsel is the primary means for the defendant to establish the kind of defense he will put forward. . . . Only a healthy, independent defense bar can be expected to meet the demands of the varied circumstances faced by criminal defendants, and assure that the interests of the individual defendant are not unduly subordinat[ed] ... to the needs of the system. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201cIn sum, our chosen system of criminal justice is built upon a truly equal and adversarial presentation of the case, and upon the trust that can exist only when counsel is independent of the Government. Without the right, reasonably exercised, to counsel of choice, the effectiveness of that system is imperiled.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered </em>v. <em>United States, 491 U.S. 617, </em>645-48, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201cIndeed, it has been said that the most important decision a defendant makes in shaping his defense is his selection of an attorney. ... A defendant learns about the charges against him, the weaknesses of the government\u2019s case, and possible strategies through an attorney. ... A defendant also allocates authority to make important decisions, some affecting constitutional rights, to an attorney. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cA defendant, then, must have confidence in the attorney who will represent him or her. For the basic trust between counsel and client ... is a cornerstone of the adversary system. ... If all attorneys were the same, the choice of an attorney would be of no moment. However, [ajttomeys are not fungible. . . . Attorneys are different, and their differences can influence the defense presented by a defendant. Therefore, a defendant is afforded an opportunity to select an attorney.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>supra, 841 F.2d 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>We recognize, however, that the right to counsel of choice is not absolute. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>894 F.2d 492, 496 (1st Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>849 F.2d 1488, 1490 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <em>Burger &amp; Burger, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murren, </em>202 Conn. 660, 668, 522 A.2d 812 (1987). When a defendant\u2019s selection of counsel seriously endangers the prospect of a fair trial, a trial court justifiably may refuse to agree to the choice. Thus, a trial court may, in certain situations, reject a defendant\u2019s choice of counsel on the ground of a potential conflict of interest, because a serious conflict may indeed destroy the integrity of the trial process. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>supra, 841 F.2d 1503. Although not absolute, the constitutional right to counsel of one\u2019s choice does nevertheless mandate a presumption in favor of accepting a criminal defendant\u2019s choice of counsel. <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 164, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>10 F.3d 1374, 1399 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 934, 115 S. Ct. 330, 130 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1994), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir. 2000). This presumption means that a trial court may not reject a defendant\u2019s chosen counsel on the ground of a potential conflict of interest without a showing that both the likelihood and the dimensions of the feared conflict are substantial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 696-97, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Moreover, mere speculation as to a conflict will not suffice. The trial court must examine whether the concern is substantiated and whether that concern outweighs the defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choosing. <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486 U.S. 164 (actual conflict or showing of serious potential for conflict required). Indeed, \u201c[i]f by merely announcing his intention to call opposing counsel as a witness an adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>could thereby orchestrate that counsel\u2019s disqualification under the Disciplinary Rules, such a device might often be employed as a purely tactical maneuver. Clearly, however, these Rules were not designed to be used as tools of litigation strategy. Therefore, whenever an adversary declares his intent to call opposing counsel as a witness, prior to ordering disqualification of counsel, the court should determine whether counsel\u2019s testimony is, in fact, genuinely needed. <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Clairol, Inc., </em>440 F. Sup. 17, 18 n.1 (N.D. Ga. 1977).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>202 Conn. 234, 248-49, 520 A.2d 1008 (1987), overruled on other grounds, <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 213, 682 A.2d 106 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">When either side in a criminal case seeks to call as a witness either a prosecutor or a defense attorney who is or has been professionally involved in the case, that party must demonstrate that the testimony is \u201cnecessary and not merely relevant, and that all other available sources of comparably probative evidence have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Conn. 698, 717, 647 A.2d 324 (1994). This \u201ccompelling need\u201d test strikes the appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the need for information and, on the other hand, the potential adverse effects on the attorney-client relationship and the judicial process in general. Id., 717-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Furthermore, we note that the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether a serious potential conflict justifies the disqualification of a defendant\u2019s chosen counsel is entitled to deference on appeal. In <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486 U.S. 163, the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe [trial] court must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest . . . .\u201d The court also noted that the \u201c[trial] court must pass on the issue whether or not to allow a waiver of a conflict of interest by a criminal defendant not with the wisdom of hindsight after the trial has taken place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>but in the murkier pretrial context when relationships between parties are seen through a glass, darkly.\u201d Id., 162. In his dissent, in which he reiterated a point made by the <em>Wheat </em>majority, Justice Marshall cautioned, however, that \u201cthe trial court must recognize a presumption in favor of a defendant\u2019s counsel of choice. This presumption means that a trial court may not reject a defendant\u2019s chosen counsel on the ground of a potential conflict of interest absent a showing that both the likelihood and the dimensions of the feared conflict are substantial. Unsupported or dubious speculation as to a conflict will not suffice. The Government must show a substantial potential for the kind of conflict that would undermine the fairness of the trial process. In these respects, I do not believe my position differs significantly, if at all, from that expressed in the opinion of the Court.\u201d Id., 166 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">To overcome the presumption in favor of a defendant\u2019s choice of counsel, a disqualification decision by the trial court must, therefore, be based upon \u201ca reasoned determination on the basis of a fully prepared record . . . .\u201d <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Diesslin, </em>868 F.2d 604, 609 n.4 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Perretti </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>493 U.S. 873, 110 S. Ct. 203, 107 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1989). Because the interest at stake is nothing less than a criminal defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel of his choice, the trial court cannot vitiate this right without first scrutinizing closely the basis for the claim. Only in this way can a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice be appropriately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Finally, it is well settled that if the decision by a trial court deprived a defendant of his constitutional right to counsel of choice, prejudice will be presumed. <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U.S. 259, 268, 104 S. Ct. 1051, 79 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1984) (\u201c[obtaining reversal for violation of [right to counsel of one\u2019s choice] does not require a showing of prejudice to the defense, since the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>reflects constitutional protection of the defendant\u2019s free choice independent of concern for the objective fairness of the proceeding\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>797 F.2d 1461, 1465 (9th Cir. 1986) (\u201cdenial of a criminal defendant\u2019s qualified right to retain counsel of his choice is reversible error regardless [of] whether prejudice is shown\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mebane, </em>204 Conn. 585, 595, 529 A.2d 680 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1046, 108 S. Ct. 784, 98 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1988) (\u201ca per se rule of automatic reversal . . . properly vindicates the denial of the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment\u201d). Therefore, if the trial court in the present case improperly disqualified Mastronardi, the appropriate remedy is to reverse the judgment of conviction and grant the defendant a new trial \"with his counsel of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On the basis of the trial court record before us, we conclude that the state failed to demonstrate a compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony. First, because Brown was mentioned by name in both the arrest warrant affidavit and the second substitute information filed in court on January 20, 1998, it is undisputed that his identity as a potential witness and as a victim was known nearly one year before his murder. Second, the notice of service of disclosure of December 23, 1998, filed by the state, constituted a public record that memorialized the release of all of the witnesses\u2019 statements to Mastronardi pursuant to the trial court\u2019s December 9, 1998 discovery order. Indeed, as Satti\u2019s testimony demonstrated, Mastronardi was not the exclusive source of the fact that statements had been disclosed to him. Accordingly, the state never provided the court with specific information that <em>only </em>Mastronardi could provide.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>To the contrary, the state\u2019s attorney acknowledged that, \u201cperhaps the state can develop the information it wants to develop through some other avenue. That may well be. I don\u2019t know that it is in fact true at this time. But that does not mean the state would then be restricted and deprived of giving Mr. Mastronardi\u2019s evidence as well.\u201d Necessity, not mere relevance, however, is the touchstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">At oral argument before this court, however, the state advanced a new theory in support of the trial court\u2019s order disqualifying Mastronardi. In specific, the state contended that, prior to December 23, 1998, the defendant did not know that Brown would be an actual witness against him because he believed that a witness was someone who had given a statement to the police and the defendant did not know that Brown had done so until on or about December 23, 1998. In the warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, the police officer\u2019s affidavit recited that, after the drive-by shooting involving Snead, \u201c[b]oth children were traumatized and were unwilling to talk about the incident.\u201d Therefore, according to the state, Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was needed to establish that the defendant learned of Brown\u2019s statement on or about December 23, 1998, thereby allowing the jury to infer that the defendant was responsible for the deaths of Brown arid Clarke on January 7, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">As we previously noted, however, the state never argued to the trial court that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary because only he could testify that he had given the defendant any witness statements or that he had shared their contents with the defendant. Moreover, even when given the opportunity to question Mastronardi, the state never asked him about what, if anything, he did in connection with any of the statements he had been given pursuant to the court order. See footnote 7 of this opinion. As a result, like Satti, Mastronardi merely related the terms of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>discovery order, confirming that he was permitted to discuss the contents of any statements with the defendant, but not to disclose the identity of the authors of two of the statements. In fact, the only questions the state asked Mastronardi pertained to the unusual nature of the court order and whether he ever had violated an order of the court, to which he responded in the negative.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the particular circumstances of this case, because the state did not demonstrate the compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony; see <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 717; the appropriate remedy for this court is to order a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mebane, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

The state contends that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 413-14 n.23, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), this court rejected the contention that the state constitution affords more extensive rights to counsel than does the federal constitution in the context of conflict free representation. The court in <em>Webb, </em>however, limited its review to the federal constitutional claim because the defendant did not present an independent and separate state constitutional analysis.

See, e.g., <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988); see also 3 W.

Because the right to counsel of choice is a <em>qualified </em>constitutional right, the trial court \u201cmust recognize a presumption in favor of [the defendant\u2019s] counsel of choice, but that presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but [also] by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.\u201d Id., 164; accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Register, </em>182 F.3d 820, 829 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1250, 120 S.

Ullman, however, did not involve a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel of choice. Rather, the issue in <em>Ullman </em>was whether the trial court had abused its discretion in ordering a public defender to testify for the state in a criminal trial against his former client. Id., 699-700, 715. My research has not revealed a single case in which a court has held that a party moving to disqualify counsel on the basis of an actual or potential conflict of interest must establish a compelling need.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I believe, however, that, qualified or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>not, a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel of his choice deserves due deference. Moreover, I believe that, in the present case, the state has demonstrated \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>all other available sources of comparably probative evidence have been exhausted.\u201d Id., 717. Therefore, I will not quibble with the majority\u2019s assertion that the state must establish a compelling need for defense counsel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the present case, there were three sets of criminal charges filed against the defendant, one for the attempted murder of Rudolph Snead, Jr., another for the murder of Snead and a third for the murders of Leroy Brown, Jr., whom the state had planned to call as a witness in the prosecution of the defendant for attempting to murder Snead, and Brown\u2019s mother, Karen Clarke. Mastronardi, whom the defendant privately retained as counsel, appeared on behalf of the defendant in connection with the attempted murder and murder charges in the \u201cSnead\u201d cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state moved to consolidate the murder and attempted murder charges on July 27, 1998. That motion was granted on August 12,1998. On June 3,1999, the state filed a motion to disqualify Mastronardi. In its motion to disqualify, the state indicated that it had filed a motion to consolidate the two previously consolidated charges with the charges filed in connection with the double murder of Brown and Clarke. The state\u2019s motion to disqualify was granted on June 30, 1999. The motion to consolidate the double murder charges filed in the \u201cBrown and Clarke\u201d case and the attempted murder and murder charges filed in the \u201cSnead\u201d cases was granted on August 6, 1999.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>At the hearing on the motion to disqualify, the state\u2019s attorney offered two reasons why Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was \u201cnecessary and not merely relevant\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; to the prosecution of the double murder charges. The first reason was that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary to demonstrate that, at some point before Brown had been murdered, the defendant discovered that Brown was going to be called as a witness in connection with the state\u2019s prosecution of the defendant for the attempted murder of Snead. The second reason was that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary to show how the defendant obtained that information. The trial court thus was confronted with the possibility that Mastronardi would be called as a witness at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The record in this case reveals that the arrest warrant affidavit in the case involving the attempted murder of Snead contained the names, but not the addresses, of two children, namely, Brown and Tyree Snead, both of whom purportedly witnessed the defendant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to kill Snead. The record further reveals that Mastronardi was in possession of this information prior to the filing of any discovery requests. It is unknown whether the defendant learned of the names of these child eyewitnesses from the affidavit. The affidavit did state that \u201c[b]oth children appeared traumatized and were <em>unwilling to talk about the </em>incident.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear that the word \u201cchildren\u201d referred to Brown and Tyree Snead. Therefore, the only relevant information that the defendant could have possessed prior to the state\u2019s December 23,1998 disclosure of a witness list, Brown\u2019s address and Brown\u2019s June 7, 1998 statement to the police, was Brown\u2019s name and the fact that he was unwilling to talk about the incident. It is also clear that, prior to December 23, 1998, the state had provided neither the defendant nor defense counsel with any information regarding the addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of witnesses, the actual list of state witnesses or Brown\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On December 23,1998, the state disclosed to Mastronardi its witness list, Brown\u2019s address and Brown\u2019s statement to the police. On December 9, 1998, two weeks prior to the state\u2019s disclosure of this information, the trial court had issued a protective order prohibiting Mastronardi from disclosing the names or addresses of witnesses, including Brown. Thus, it was at this point, for the first time, that the defendant had potential access to Brown\u2019s address, the fact that Brown had given a statement to the police, and the fact that the state would be calling Brown to testify against the defendant in connection with the attempted murder charge. Whether the defendant actually had learned of these facts depended <em>solely </em>upon whether Mastronardi had adhered to the dictates of the protective order. The state argued that this was a critical fact because, on January 7, 1999, approximately two weeks after the information was disclosed to Mastronardi, Brown and Clarke were murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At the hearing on the motion to disqualify, Mastronardi confirmed that neither he nor his client knew the address of Brown. It can reasonably be assumed that, in so stating, Mastronardi meant that he did not know Brown\u2019s address until the state had disclosed that address to him on December 23, 1998, especially in view of the fact that the court\u2019s protective order clearly prohibited Mastronardi from disclosing the addresses of the state\u2019s witnesses, including Brown. Mastronardi also confirmed that he did not receive Brown\u2019s statement or the witness list until they were disclosed, under protective order, on December 23, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The majority concludes that \u201cthe state never provided the court with specific information that <em>only </em>Mastronardi could provide.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tion, the majority declares that \u201cthe state never argued to the trial court that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was necessary because only he could testify that he had given the defendant any witness statements or that he had shared their contents with the defendant. Moreover, even when given the opportunity to question Mastronardi, the state never asked him about what, if anything, he did in connection with any of the statements he had been given pursuant to the court order.\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Regardless of whether Mastronardi disclosed Brown\u2019s address to the defendant, <em>the fact </em>that Brown had given a statement to the police and that Brown would be testifying for the state was information that <em>only </em>Mastronardi could have provided to the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, while the defendant knew who Brown was and knew that he was riding in Snead\u2019s car when the defendant first attempted to murder Snead, only the state had knowledge of Brown\u2019s address and the fact that Brown had given a statement to police<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> prior to the state\u2019s disclosure of that information to Mastro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>nardi on December 23, 1998. There was no evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to disqualify or otherwise to suggest that the source from which the defendant obtained this information was anyone other than Mastronardi or Brown himself, and the state clearly was unable to call Brown as a witness. Thus, it was necessary, if not critical, that the state inquire of Mastronardi whether he had violated the court\u2019s protective order in order to establish the source of the defendant\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The state\u2019s attorney brought this matter to the attention of the trial court at the hearing on the motion to disqualify. At that hearing, the state\u2019s attorney informed the court that \u201c[t]he testimony that [the defendant] was aware of where the victims lived ... is extremely relevant and I\u2019d submit that, therefore, whatever . . . Mastronardi had testified to or [will] be called to testify [to] on the homicides that he had passed on the information of the Earl Avenue address or, on the other hand, that he didn\u2019t. ... I think what\u2019s more extremely important here and what the state certainly intends to pursue at length [at] trial is did [the defendant] know that . . . Brown was, in fact, to be a witness in the cases that were pending against him up to the date of January 7th of [1999, the date on which Brown was murdered]. And, secondly, how did [the defendant] know that . . . Brown was to be a witness, not merely the fact that [the defendant] may or may not have known that . . . Brown was present in an automobile at the time of the initial case here, which is one of the cases we\u2019re dealing with, which is the drive-by shooting [of] . . . Snead that did not result in a homicide. But the fact that the state indeed contemplated, planned and listed . . . Brown as an actual witness in the Snead shooting and homicide trials, the fact is the statement of . . . Brown and his listing as a witness in those cases w[ere] never disclosed or made know[n] to any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>body until December 22nd or thereabouts when [C. Robert Satti, Jr., senior assistant state\u2019s attorney] filed a response to the [defendant\u2019s] discovery demand.\u201d The foregoing statements demonstrate that the state\u2019s attorney planned to call Mastronardi as a witness in the consolidated criminal trials to determine whether he had violated the court\u2019s December 9, 1998 protective order, a fact of which only Mastronardi and the defendant had knowledge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">At trial, the state\u2019s attorney questioned Mastronardi at length about the protective order issued in connection with state\u2019s disclosure of the witness list and Brown\u2019s statement. The state asked Mastronardi: \u201cHave you ever, in your career, ever violated any court order that was placed on you?\u201d The reference to \u201ccourt order\u201d clearly included the protective order at issue in this case. Mastronardi replied: \u201cI would never violate an order of the court.\u201d While it may be true that the state\u2019s case would have been aided by an affirmative response to that question, the test is not whether Mastronardi\u2019s testimony ultimately bolsters the state\u2019s case, a determination that cannot be made without the benefit of hindsight, but, rather, whether there is a compelling need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>for that testimony. If Mastronardi had answered the question in the affirmative, that answer would have supported an inference that the defendant knew for the first time, on or after December 23, 1998, and shortly before Brown was murdered, that Brown lived on Earl Avenue and had given a statement to the police, and that the state was planning to call Brown to testify against the defendant at the defendant\u2019s trial. The fact that Mastronardi\u2019s answer ultimately was not helpful to the state is irrelevant to the issue of whether there existed a serious potential for a conflict of interest that would have warranted Mastronardi\u2019s disqualification. Indeed, whether defense counsel <em>ultimately </em>testifies at trial is irrelevant because \u201cwe do not review the [trial court\u2019s] decision with the advantage of hindsight.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Defazio, </em>899 F.2d 626, 631 (7th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Based on the foregoing, I would conclude that the state adequately had established that Mastronardi\u2019s testimony was \u201cnecessary and not merely relevant\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ullman </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 717; and, consequently, there was a compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial. This compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony demonstrated a \u201cserious potential for conflict\u201d; <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486 U.S. 164; sufficient to overcome the \u201cpresumption in favor of [the defendant\u2019s right to] counsel of choice . . . .\u201d. Id. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion to disqualify Mastronardi and, therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> Because I conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion to disqualify Mastronardi, I need not reach the issue of whether the violation of a defendant\u2019s qualified right to counsel of choice is per se prejudicial, thereby requiring automatic reversal of that defendant\u2019s conviction. I feel compelled to note, however, that, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the issue of whether the violation of a defendant\u2019s qualified right to counsel of choice requires automatic reversal is not well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>settled. Rather, as a federal appellate court has noted in a case that the majority cites in support of its assertion that prejudice is to be presumed when a defendant is deprived of his constitutional right to retained counsel, the United States Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether the denial of this qualified constitutional right is \u201cstructural\u201d and, thus, impervious to harmless error analysis. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>797 F.2d 1461, 1467 n.7 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"AvX\">Moreover, at least one federal circuit court of appeals has rejected this rule of automatic reversal; that court has concluded that, in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant who improperly has been denied the right to counsel of choice must demonstrate prejudice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turk, </em>870 F.2d 1304, 1308 (7th Cir. 1989); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Voigt, </em>89 F.3d 1050, 1074 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1047, 117 S. Ct. 623, 136 L. Ed. 2d 546 (1996) (\u201cnonarbitrary, but erroneous, denial\u201d of right to counsel of choice may be subject to harmless error analysis [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"A7A\">Although I need not reach this issue, I do maintain that, contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the issue of whether the denial of a defendant\u2019s right to retained counsel is per se prejudicial or subject to harmless error analysis is far from clear and deserves a more comprehensive appraisal than that which the majority has provided. As Richard A. Posner, former chief judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently has noted: \u201cThat denying the counsel of one\u2019s choice falls into either category [namely, a structural error requiring automatic reversal or a nonstructural error lending itself to harmless error analysis] is not an easy position to maintain . . . after . . . <em>Turk . . . </em>which says that proof of prejudice is required in a case in which the defendant is complaining of such a denial. . . . Most cases hold [to] the contrary, however, such as <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rankin, </em>779 F.2d 956, 960-61 (3d Cir. 1986), which relies on <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U.S. 259, 267-68, 104 S. Ct. 1051, 79 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1984)\u2014not cited in Turk\u2014[in which] the [United States] Supreme Court intimated that obtaining a reversal of a conviction because of the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a lawyer of his choice does not require a showing of prejudice to the defense, since the right reflects constitutional protection of the defendant\u2019s free choice independent of concern for the objective fairness of the proceeding. A number of cases line up with <em>Rankin. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">\u201cThe language . . . from <em>Flanagan </em>suggests that the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice falls into the . . . subcategory of structural errors that we have identified. Subsequent cases, however, of which the most recent is <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[527 U.S. 1, 8-9, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999)], contain language that, consistent with the limited and qualified nature of the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice . . . seems to confine the rule of automatic reversal of denials of the right to assistance of counsel to cases of complete denial. . . . That a district [court] has . . . broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>discretion to extinguish the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice for reasons of calendar control suggests that this right, which in any event no indigent criminal defendant has ... is, like the right to effective assistance of counsel (a right whose vindication requires proof of prejudice . . . ), not so fundamental as the rights protected by the rule of automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">\u201cThe strongest argument for bringing the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice under that [automatic reversal] rule is practical, and also resembles a part at least of the rationale for the first class of structural errors. Prejudice will not be provable unless the replacement counsel failed to render effective assistance, an independent constitutional violation, and so the right to the lawyer of one\u2019s choice will be empty because unenforceable\u2014had the district [court] disqualified [defense counsel] because [defense counsel] parts his hair on the right side [the defendant] would have no remedy. But this argument is overstated in at least two respects. First, it will sometimes be possible to prove prejudice even though the replacement lawyer didn\u2019t render ineffective assistance. If he is inexperienced, or lacks some specialized knowledge that the defendant\u2019s original choice of lawyer had, it may be possible to show that even though his representation of the defendant was not ineffective it was substantially less likely to achieve acquittal. Second, and more important, mandamus is an available remedy when an abuse of discretion by the trial judge cannot effectively be remedied by appealing the final decision . . . for example an abuse of discretion in disqualifying a party\u2019s lawyer.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>201 F.3d 953, 960-61 (7th Cir. 2000). Thus, in light of the unsettled nature of this issue and the shifting perspective of United States Supreme Court precedent, I believe that this issue deserves more attention than it has been given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>[supra, 186 Conn. 555], this court overruled the implicit conclusion of the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 443, that the denial of a motion to disqualify is a final judgment subject to immediate appeal.

In that case, this court was called upon to determine whether the record presented facts sufficient to conclude that the trial court <em>should have known, </em>in the absence of an objection by either the state or the defendant, that a potential conflict existed, which would have given rise to a duty to inquire. See id., 694. In the present case, the issue is whether the trial court, <em>which was presented with information regarding a potential conflict, </em>properly concluded that such a potential conflict existed. As I indicate elsewhere in my dissenting opinion, I believe that the proper standard for determining whether the presumption favoring a defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice is overcome is that articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486 U.S. 164, namely, whether there is an actual conflict or \u201ca serious potential for conflict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> In the present case, the fact that the state\u2019s attorney intended to call Mastronardi to testify about his compliance or <em>noncompliance </em>with a court order\u2014the latter of which possibly resulted in the murder of two witnesses\u2014 was relevant to the court\u2019s determination of a serious potential for conflict. Therefore, it is important to note that \u201c[t]he conflict here is not the more usual one of multiple representation. . . . Rather, counsel has been placed in the position of having to worry about allegations of his own misconduct. . . . [W]hat could be more of a conflict than a concern over getting oneself into trouble with criminal law enforcement authorities?\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>867 F.2d 122, 129 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 817, 110 S. Ct. 70, 107 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Moreover, as the state\u2019s attorney correctly pointed out at the hearing on the state\u2019s motion to disqualify, the decision to disqualify Mastronardi was not one that could wait until trial had commenced. The state\u2019s attorney argued: 'Td submit this is not a conflict that can be resolved later on in the middle of a trial involving a death qualifying capital case. It\u2019s really something that has to be done up front right now. I submit that the risk that . . . Mastronardi will testify is great. In fact, it\u2019s almost a definite thing. . . . I\u2019m representing the state of Connecticut as the state\u2019s attorney here in a serious case, a capital case. As an opposing] . . . party, I think it would be completely inappropriate, unfair for me to be confronting as a witness and as an attorney in both categories one individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Inasmuch as the defendant was charged with multiple felony offenses, and, therefore, any disqualification of his attorney close to the commencement of or during trial would have prejudiced him in a correspondingly serious manner, it was critical that the decision to disqualify Mastronardi be made earlier rather than later. Moreover, I believe that the foregoing argument of the state\u2019s attorney indicates that there was no reason for the trial court to be concerned that the state\u2019s attorney was attempting to manufacture a conflict. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> At least one federal circuit court of appeals has indicated, in the context of determining whether certain defendants were denied a fair trial when one of their defense counsel was called by the prosecutor as a witness, that the prosecutor must show that the information sought to be obtained from defense counsel\u2019s testimony \u201cis both necessary and unobtainable from other sources.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crockett, </em>506 F.2d 759, 760 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 824, 96 S. Ct. 37, 46 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1975). Another circuit court of appeals has noted, however, that that statement in <em>Crockett </em>is dictum. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortellesso, </em>663 F.2d 361, 363 (1st Cir. 1981). I believe that the approach taken by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is the more sensible approach and properly balances the competing interests of the state, in its endeavor to put on its best case, and the defendant, who clearly has an interest in retaining counsel of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortellesso, </em>supra, 663 F.2d 361, the First Circuit was presented with a situation in which the prosecutor planned to call defense counsel as a witness to testify about a conversation in which he had engaged with government agents. Id., 362. The defendant claimed that the prosecutor should have been required to call the other participants in the conversation rather than defense counsel himself, citing <em>Crockett </em>for the proposition that if the information can be obtained from other sources, then the prosecutor cannot call defense counsel to testify. Id., 363. The court in <em>CorteUesso </em>disagreed, stating that \u201c[t]he government was not required to accede to this truncation of its evidence. We do not accept the dictum in . . . <em>Crockett . . </em>. that the government must show that the evidence is unobtainable from other sources, if it means that the government must settle for less than its best evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court in <em>CorteUesso </em>seemed particularly concerned with the prospect of requiring the prosecutor to rely on sources other than defense counsel\u2019s testimony inasmuch as such reliance, under the circumstances, likely would have undermined the strength of the government\u2019s case. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The First Circuit fleshed out this \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule and its application in subsequent cases in which defense counsel had offered to stipulate to the information sought by the government. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diozzi, </em>807 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1986), the court concluded that if defense counsel or a defendant offers to stipulate to the information sought by the government, and such information is independently verifiable and already in evidence\u2014 in that case, written statements made by the defendants through their attorneys\u2014then such stipulation is equivalent to the government\u2019s best evidence. See id., 13. It is important to note that the court in <em>Diozzi </em>may have been troubled by the fact that the prosecutor in that case did not seek to disqualify defense counsel until six days before trial, which raises the specter of an attempt on the part of the prosecutor to manufacture a conflict. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Defazio, </em>899 F.2d 626, 682 (1st Cir. 1990); see also 3 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 11.9 (c), p. 677 n.103 (\u201cAppellate courts have noted . . . that to ensure against what <em>Wheat </em>described as government attempts to manufacture a conflict, the trial court should seek to determine whether the testimony of counsel is truly needed (in particular, whether the prosecution could establish the same facts through other means). ... At the same time . . . the government should not be forced to settle for less than its best evidence.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"AlH\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Defazio, </em>supra, 899 F.2d 632, the First Circuit again addressed the issue of whether a stipulation would amount to less than the government\u2019s best evidence. In that case, that court concluded that when the information sought by the government is not independently verifiable and is \u201conly in the ken of [defense counsel] and the defendant\u201d; id.; a stipulation amounts to less than the government\u2019s best evidence. Thus, it was properfor the district court to have disqualified defense counsel because he potentially could have been called to testify for the government. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"AbY\">I would suggest that the foregoing cases set forth a more sensible approach than the \u201ccompelling need\u201d test. In situations in which a stipulation is feasible, namely, when the information sought is independently verifiable, or when resort to other sources will not unduly undermine the strength of the government\u2019s case, the government should be required to use means other than defense counsel\u2019s testimony to bring the information it seeks before the fact finder. When the information sought, however, is within the knowledge of only defense counsel or defense counsel and the defendant, or when resort to other sources of the information will unduly undermine the strength of the government\u2019s case, the government should be allowed to call defense counsel as a witness. In any event, regardless of whether this court adopts the well reasoned \u201cbest evidence\u201d approach or the more rigorous \u201ccompelling need\u201d test, I believe that, in the present case, the state has sustained its burden of showing that Mastronardi was the only source available for the information that it had sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> Frank Riccio, whom the defendant also retained as counsel, initially appeared on behalf of the defendant in the case involving the attempted murder of Snead.

Irrespective of the fact that the presiding judge would have been unlikely to allow the state to call into question the ethics of defense counsel at the defendant\u2019s trial, a requirement that the state prove its case by inference simply is not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that there did not exist a compelling need for Mastronardi\u2019s testimony. The state was entitled to call Mastronardi as a witness and ask him if he was, in fact, the source of the defendant\u2019s knowledge\u2014a question that only Mastronardi and the defendant knew the answer to\u2014and let his credibility be judged. Moreover, I would conclude that the state was entitled to put on its best evidence. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> Of course, Brown, himself, and Clarke, Brown\u2019s mother, had knowledge of this information, but there is no indication that they did provide or had any incentive to provide this information to the defendant or any persons associated with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> The majority makes much of the fact that the state\u2019s attorney informed the court at the hearing on the state\u2019s motion to disqualify that, \u201cperhaps the state can develop the information it wants to develop through some other avenue. That may well be. I don\u2019t know that it is in fact true at this time.\u201d What the majority fails to mention, however, is that this statement was made in direct response to Mastronardi\u2019s incorrect assertion that the information sought by the state constituted uncontested matters, namely, that Mastronardi \u201cnever had [Brown\u2019s] address\u201d and that Brown\u2019s statement was not disclosed to Mastronardi until December 23,1998. The fact remains, however, that the knowledge of what Mastronardi did with the information when it was disclosed to him is knowledge that resided exclusively with Mastronardi. Indeed, the trial court fully appreciated that Mastronardi was the only source of this information. The court stated that \u201cone of the core issues in the case is [what] knowledge [the defendant] had about . . . Brown\u2019s potential testimony and when and how he obtained that knowledge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
