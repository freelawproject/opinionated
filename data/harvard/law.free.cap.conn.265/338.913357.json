The dispositive issue in this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether the trial court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, concluding that sovereign immunity does not bar an action for monetary damages where the plaintiffs have alleged that state officers acted in excess of their statutory authority. The defendants, Kristine Ragaglia, the commissioner of children and families, Kelly McVey, a program supervisor with the department of children and families (department), Gloria Tardif, a social worker with the department, Sherry Rautenberg, a social worker supervisor for the department, and Beverly Bosse, an investigator for the department, all of whom have been sued both in their official and individual capacities, claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion to dismiss on the ground that sovereign immunity barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the plaintiffs, Chad Prigge and Sara Prigge, from seeking monetary damages against the defendants in their official capacities. We agree with the defendants, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The plaintiffs brought this action, seeking monetary damages against the defendants both in their official and individual capacities, and also seeking injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had discriminated against them in certain underlying child custody proceedings. The defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them in their official capacities seeking monetary damages on the ground that the claims were barred by sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that, in light of our decisions in <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>253 Conn. 134, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000), and <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 642 A.2d 699 (1994), sovereign immunity does not bar actions for monetary damages where the plaintiffs have alleged that state officers acted in excess of statutory authority. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">As we must in reviewing a motion to dismiss, we \u201ctake the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 611, 793 A.2d 215 (2002). The plaintiffs\u2019 claim arises from the defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct in handling the temporary and final placement of a child, Joshua S., with a family other than that of the plaintiffs. In their very detailed complaint, the plaintiffs alleged the following facts: Chad Prigge was the husband of Sara Prigge, and they both were mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>bers of the Truth Baptist Church (church). In the summer of 1996, the plaintiffs moved from Minnesota to East Hartford, where Chad Prigge was the assistant pastor at the church. Kelly S. and her husband, Charles S., both members of the church, were the plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors and friends. Kelly S. and Charles S. had four children, Jessica M.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jennifer S., Jonah S. and Joshua S. In July, 1998, Charles S. asked Chad Prigge if the plaintiffs would agree to be named as testamentary guardians of their children. After considering the matter, the plaintiffs agreed and Kelly S. and Charles S. drew their wills accordingly, naming the plaintiffs as testamentary guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The plaintiffs additionally alleged that on June 10, 1999, Kelly S. stabbed Charles S. to death in the bedroom of their home. After also stabbing Jessica M. and pouring gasoline over Jessica M. and herself, and throughout another bedroom, Kelly S. set the house on fire. Jessica M. escaped the fire and ran across the street to the plaintiffs\u2019 home, where Chad Prigge called 911. Emergency personnel rescued Joshua S. from the fire, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him and revived him. Jessica M. and Joshua S. were brought to the Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center (medical center).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 11, 1999, the department obtained an ex parte order for temporary custody of Joshua S. Joshua S. was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he remained until June 14, 1999, when he was transferred back to the medical center, where he stayed until he was placed temporarily with a foster family by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The plaintiffs alleged that several actions undertaken by the defendants constituted misconduct and that the defendants\u2019 decision not to place Joshua S. with the plaintiffs was based on the plaintiffs\u2019 religion. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants altered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and destroyed certain telephone records,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> intentionally ignored the wills of Charles S. and Kelly S. naming the plaintiffs as testamentary guardians, denied the plaintiffs visitation with Joshua S.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> denied them access to a preliminary hearing on the order of temporary custody,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> failed to conduct a thorough investigation of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tiffs before making the placement decision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and made unfounded allegations against the plaintiffs during a probate proceeding<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on the contested wills of Charles S. and Kelly S.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The plaintiffs claimed that, in engaging in this alleged misconduct, the defendants acted in excess of the statutory authority granted to them as department officials under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-596, 17a-3, 17a-15 and 17a-96,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the authority granted to them under article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>first, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 8 and 20,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and article seventh of the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tion of Connecticut,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They alleged wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct on the part of the defendants in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 (3) and 1986, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 20, and article seventh of tne constitution of Connecticut, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, seeking both monetary damages<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for monetary damages against the defendants in their official capacities. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion, concluding that <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 134, and <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 479, stand for the proposition that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not applicable to a claim for money damages when the plaintiffs have alleged that state officers acted in excess of statutory authority. The defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s ruling was improper because it is inconsistent with the well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>lished rale that sovereign immunity bars an action seeking monetary damages, even when the plaintiffs have alleged that state officers acted in excess of statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for money damages, this issue is controlled by our decision today in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 329, 828 A.2d 549 (2003), in which we held that the exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity for actions by state officers in excess of their statutory authority applies only to actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, not to actions for money damages. When a plaintiff brings an action for money damages against the state, he must proceed through the office of the claims commissioner pursuant to chapter 53 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4-141 through 4-165. Otherwise, the action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In the present case, the plaintiffs have not received permission from the office of the claims commissioner to bring their claims for money damages against the state. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The judgment of the trial court denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to grant the motion and to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants in their official capacities seeking monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, PALMER and VERTEFEU-ILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> The defendants did not seek dismissal of either the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for injunctive relief against the defendants in their official capacities, or the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants in their individual capacities. Therefore, those claims are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> Charles S. was not the biological father of Jessica M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> Neither Jennifer S. nor Jonah S. survived the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> The plaintiffs point to two instances in which the defendants destroyed or altered telephone records. First, on June 16, 1999, Bosse informed Chad Prigge during a telephone conversation that the plaintiffs had been named the testamentary guardians of Joshua S. The plaintiffs alleged that Bosse recorded this telephone call in her log book, but that she later altered the log book entry to reflect that the conversation had taken place on a different date. Second, on June 21,1999, Chad Prigge spoke to McVey on the telephone and informed her that the plaintiffs intended to pursue custody of Joshua S. McVey took handwritten notes of their conversation. On July 28, 1999, Tardif filed a social study with the court stating that the \u201c[department] learned on 6/22/99 that the [plaintiffs] have changed their minds and stated their intentions to pursue custody of Joshua and not Jessica.\u201d The study was signed and approved by Tardif, Rautenberg and McVey. The plaintiffs further alleged that McVey destroyed her handwritten notes of the June 21, 1999 telephone call and produced, in response to a subpoena, typewritten notes that indicated that during their conversation, Chad Prigge had indicated that he was not certain whether he wanted to pursue custody of Joshua S.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> The plaintiffs alleged that they had attempted to visit Joshua S. at the medical center on June 16, 1999, and again on the weekend of June 19 and 20,1999, but were denied visitation both times. Subsequently, the plaintiffs were allowed to have visitation with Joshua S. in the presence of and under the supervision of department personnel and his temporary foster parents twice a month. When they had requested more visitation, the defendants refused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> The plaintiffs alleged that they were not notified of the June 18, 1999 preliminary hearing on the order of temporary custody. Chad Prigge nevertheless went to the hearing, but was not allowed to enter the hearing room. At that hearing, assistant attorney general Mary Ann Mulholland, representing the department and Ragaglia, informed the court that the department was aware that the wills had named the plaintiffs as guardians of Joshua S., but she told the court that the plaintiffs had indicated that they did not want custody of him. Following the hearing, Mulholland gathered a group of people together to inform them of the results of the hearing, but asked Chad Prigge to leave before she did so. The temporary foster parents of Joshua S. were allowed to stay. No one informed the court that Chad Prigge had appeared that day for the purpose of asserting his rights as testamentary guardian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> The plaintiffs alleged that, on June 22,1999, based on Bosse\u2019s investigation, McVey placed Joshua S. with a family other than that, of the plaintiffs. None of the defendants conducted an inspection of the plaintiffs\u2019 home or interviewed them prior to making this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> The plaintiffs alleged (hat, during the proceedings, (he defendants characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 church as a cult and represented that the plaintiffs improperly used corporal punishment, were not \u201cpsychologically-minded,\u201d were opposed to medical treatment for themselves and their children, and were unable to maintain contact between Joshua S. and Jessica M. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants made these representations despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary and despite the defendants\u2019 failure to interview the plaintiffs, conduct a home visit with the plaintiffs or inspect the medical records of the plaintiffs or those of the plaintiffs\u2019 children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-596 provides: \u201c(a) The parent of an unmarried minor, except a parent who has been removed as guardian of the person of the minor, may by will or other writing signed by the parent and attested by at least two witnesses appoint a person or persons as guardian or coguardians of the person of such minor, as guardian or coguardians of die estate, or both, to serve if the parents who are guardians of the minor are dead. If two or more instruments, whether by will or other writing, contain an appointment, the latest effective appointment made by the last surviving parent has priority. Such appointment shall not supersede Hie previous appointment of a guardian made by the court of probate having jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u201c(b) The ward of such a guardian may, when he or she is over the age of twelve, apply to the court of probate in which such ward resides, for the substitution of a guardian or coguardians of the person to supersede the appointed guardian. The court of probate may, upon such application and hearing, substitute the guardian or coguardians chosen by the ward to be the guardian or coguardians of the person of the ward after consideration of the standards set forth in section 45a-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">\u201c(c) A parental appointment becomes effective when the guardian\u2019s written acceptance is filed in the court in which the nominating instrument is probated, or, in (he case of a nontestamentary nominating instrument, in the court for the probate district where the minor resides. Any guardian or coguardians appointed pursuant to this section shall receive the appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>subject to the control of the court of probate and subject to the provisions and restrictions to which the last surviving parent, as guardian, was subject at the time of such parent\u2019s decease. If the court deems it necessary for the protection of the minor, a guardian or coguardians of the person shall furnish a probate bond. A guardian or coguardians of the estate shall furnish a probate bond. Upon such acceptance of guardianship or furnishing such bond, the guardian or coguardians shall have the same power over the person and estate of such minor as guardians appointed by the court of probate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">Although \u00a7 45a-596 was amended since 1999, the date of the alleged misconduct here, those changes are not relevant to this appeal.
