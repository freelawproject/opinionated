Kuehl, was precluded from obtaining survivor\u2019s benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because she had failed to file a notice of claim for compensation either with her deceased husband\u2019s employer, the named defendant, ZLoda Systems Engineering, Inc. (Z-Loda Systems),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner, as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner) concluded that the plaintiffs failure to comply with \u00a7 31-294c (a) precluded her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits. The compensation review board (board) affirmed the decision of the commissioner, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff is the widow and sole presumptive dependent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Guenther Kuehl (decedent). The decedent was the president and sole shareholder of Z-Loda Systems, and the plaintiff was its secretary and treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On June 26, 1991, the decedent suffered personal injuries in an automobile accident that, according to the decedent, had occurred in the course of his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ment. As a result of the decedent\u2019s injuries, the plaintiff assumed the day-to-day management of Z-Loda Systems in October, 1991. On December 16, 1991, the decedent filed a notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On January 21,1992, Z-Loda Systems and the defendant Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), Z-Loda Systems\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, filed a notice contesting the decedent\u2019s claim in accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Z-Loda Systems and Travelers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>contested the decedent\u2019s claim on two primary grounds: (1) that the decedent\u2019s accident was not work-related; and (2) even if the accident were work-related, the claimed injuries were unrelated to the accident. To date, the decedent\u2019s claim has not been resolved and no benefits have been paid in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On November 1, 1992, the decedent and the plaintiff initiated a third party action against the driver and owner of the other vehicle involved in the June 26,1991 accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 14, 1992, the decedent died as a result of an aortic aneurysm. Thereafter, the plaintiff, in her capacity as executrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, was substituted for the decedent in the third party action. Subsequently, the plaintiff amended the complaint (amended complaint) in the third party action to allege that the decedent\u2019s aortic aneuiysm was a consequence of the injuries that the decedent had sustained in the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The plaintiff sent a copy of the amended complaint to Z-Loda Systems in May, 1993. After receiving the amended complaint, Z-Loda Systems moved to intervene in the third party action. In its motion to intervene, Z-Loda Systems asserted, inter aha, that, \u201c[b]y virtue of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . [Z-Loda Systems] may become obligated to pay large sums to the estate of [the decedent] and/or to the plaintiff . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>On July 22,1998, the plaintiff requested a hearing on her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits notwithstanding her failure to file a timely notice of claim for compensation in accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs claim on August 31, 1998. In connection with that hearing, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of facts and exhibits. The parties also submitted a joint issue for consideration, namely, \u201c[wjhether, based upon the facts, the [plaintiff] . . . should be precluded from pursuing a [survivor\u2019s] benefits claim under ... \u00a7 31-306 due to the fact that she did not file a formal notice of claim within the statute of limitations period established under . . . \u00a7 31-294c (a), which would have been one year from the date of [the decedent\u2019s] death\u2014November 14,1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The plaintiff proffered three reasons why her failure to file a notice of claim for compensation in accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (a) was not fatal to her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits. First, the plaintiff maintained that the amended complaint, a copy of which the plaintiff sent to Z-Loda Systems in May, 1993, constituted sufficient notice of the plaintiffs claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-294c (a). In support of this claim, the plaintiff underscored the fact that Z-Loda Systems expressly noted in its motion to intervene that it \u201cmay become obligated to pay large sums to the estate of [the decedent] <em>and/or to the plaintiff </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the basis of this allegation by Z-Loda Systems, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>plaintiff maintained that Z-Loda Systems had actual notice that she was seeking survivor\u2019s benefits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> thereby rendering technical compliance with \u00a7 31-294c (a) unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Second, the plaintiff asserted that the notice requirements contained in \u00a7 31-294c (a) were satisfied under the particular circumstances of this case because knowledge of her intent to seek survivor\u2019s benefits should be imputed to Z-Loda Systems in light of the fact that she was managing Z-Loda Systems at the time of the decedent\u2019s death. Finally, the plaintiff argued that her failure to file a notice of claim for compensation did not preclude her from obtaining survivor\u2019s benefits in light of \u00a7 31-294c (c),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which enumerates certain circumstances under which the failure to file a notice of claim for compensation or under which the filing of a defective or inaccurate notice of claim for compensation will not bar a claimant from obtaining benefits under \u00a7 31-306 (a). The commissioner disagreed with the plaintiff, however, and concluded that the plaintiffs failure to file a notice of claim for compensation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (a) precluded her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal followed. On appeal, the plaintiff renews the claims that she raised before the commissioner and the board. We reject those claims and, therefore, affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Whe[n] ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>256 Conn. 456, 479-80, 774 A.2d 113 (2001); accord <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 596, 603-604, 748 A.2d 278 (2000). Because this issue is one of first impression for our courts, we review the board\u2019s decision de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The issue of whether the plaintiffs failure to comply with \u00a7 31-294c (a) renders her ineligible to obtain survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-306 (a) presents a question of statutory construction, the fundamental objective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>which is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. E.g., <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>243 Conn. 709, 715, 707 A.2d 713 (1998). \u201cAs with all issues of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>257 Conn. 632, 639, 778 A.2d 121 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a), a dependent of a deceased employee is entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits when that employee has died \u201cfrom an accident arising out of and in the course of employment . . . .\u201d Eligibility for those benefits, however, is conditioned upon compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o proceedings for [workers\u2019] compensation . . . shall be maintained unless a <em>written notice of claim for compensation </em>is given within one year from the date of the accident . . . provided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident ... a dependent . . . may make claim for compensation within the two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]otice of a claim for compensation may be given to the employer or any commissioner and shall state, in simple language, the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting from the accident . . . and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed. . . .\u201d On the basis of this statutory language, we have concluded \u201cthat the legislature intended to . . . require claimants to file notices of claim, written in simple language, in order to maintain proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] [A]ct . . . .\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 607. Although we repeatedly have observed that our workers\u2019 compensation \u201clegislation is remedial in nature . . . and . . . should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose\u201d; (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992); the written notice required under \u00a7 31-294c (a) nevertheless must \u201creasonably inform the employer that the employee [or dependent] is claiming or proposes to claim compensation under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act . . . .\u201d <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corp., </em>118 Conn. 315, 317, 172 A. 353 (1934); accord <em>Pearce </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>76 Conn. App. 441, 449, 819 A.2d 878, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 913, 826 A.2d 1155 (2003). It is well established, moreover, that \u201ca notice of claim or the satisfaction of one of the . . . exceptions [contained in \u00a7 31-294c (c)] is <em>a prerequisite that conditions whether the </em>commissioner] <em>has subject matter jurisdiction under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] [A]ct.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 5-6, 675 A.2d 845 (1996).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We now turn to the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The plaintiff first contends that service on Z-Loda Systems of the amended complaint in the third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>action satisfied the notice requirements of \u00a7 31-294c (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">There is no dispute that Z-Loda Systems\u2019 receipt of the amended complaint placed Z-Loda Systems on notice of the decedent\u2019s death within the limitation period prescribed by \u00a7 31-294c (a). The amended complaint, however, contained no indication that the plaintiff was seeking or intended to seek survivor\u2019s benefits as a result of the decedent\u2019s death. Indeed, the plaintiff did not provide Z-Loda Systems with a copy of the amended complaint as a substitute for a notice of claim for compensation but, rather, in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-293 (a)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> so that Z-Loda Systems could protect any interest <em>it </em>might have had in any recovery resulting from the third party action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, although Z-Loda Systems did assert in its motion to intervene in the third party action that it \u201cmay become obligated to pay\u201d benefits to the plaintiff, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>assertion\u2014merely a recognition of the fact that the plaintiff <em>might </em>seek benefits as a consequence of the decedent\u2019s death\u2014was necessary to explain Z-Loda Systems\u2019 interest in that action. Thus, neither that assertion by Z-Loda Systems nor its receipt of the amended complaint constituted notice that the plaintiff was claiming or proposing to claim survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-306 (a). Contrary to the plaintiffs claim, therefore, Z-Loda Systems\u2019 receipt of the amended complaint and its acknowledgement that it \u201cmay\u201d become obligated to pay benefits to the plaintiff are insufficient to establish that Z-Loda Systems had actual notice of the plaintiffs intent to seek survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We also reject the plaintiffs contention that, because she was managing Z-Loda Systems at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, her purported intent to seek survivor\u2019s benefits should be imputed to Z-Loda Systems. The fact that the plaintiff was managing Z-Loda Systems at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, does not make the plaintiff and Z-Loda Systems one and the same for purposes of \u00a7 31-294c (a). It is the employer, Z-Loda Systems, that was entitled to notice under \u00a7 31-294c (a) so that Z-Loda Systems, <em>itself, </em>could take whatever action <em>it </em>deemed necessary upon receipt of the notice, such as notifying its insurance carrier, investigating the claim or contesting the claim. Thus, for purposes of \u00a7 31-294c (a), Z-Loda Systems is an entity that is wholly separate and distinct from the plaintiff and, consequently, there is no reason to impute the plaintiffs knowledge to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a) requires \u201cwritten notice\u201d of a claim for compensation. To impute to Z-Loda Systems knowledge of the plaintiffs intent to seek survivor\u2019s benefits would require us to read those words out of the statute. \u201c[I]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>struing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 394, 410, 780 A.2d 903 (2001). In the absence of a compelling or overriding reason to do so, we cannot ignore the requirement of <em>written </em>notice contained in \u00a7 31-294c (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the savings provisions of subsection (c) of \u00a7 31-294c evince a legislative intent to permit claims in circumstances such as those in the present case. We disagree. The relevant part of General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (c) upon which the plaintiff relies provides: <em>\u201cNo defect or inaccuracy of notice of claim </em>shall bar maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shows that he was ignorant of the facts concerning the personal injury and was prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy of the notice. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) This savings provision addresses a \u201cdefect or inaccuracy\u201d in a notice of claim for compensation; it does not excuse, however, the <em>failure to file </em>a notice of claim. The plaintiff concedes that she did not file a notice of claim for compensation. Consequently, the plaintiff cannot prevail under the plain language of the provision of \u00a7 31-294c (c) excusing a defect or inaccuracy in a notice of claim but not the failure to file such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We note, moreover, that Public Acts 1913, c. 138, \u00a7 21, a precursor to \u00a7 31-294c (c), included a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>that <em>\u201cno want, </em>defect, or inaccuracy of such notice and claim shall be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shall show that he was ignorant of the injury and was prejudiced by <em>want, </em>defect, or inaccuracy of notice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O.K. Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 222-24, 96 A. 963 (1916), we interpreted \u201cwant\u201d of notice to mean the <em>absence </em>of notice. Thus, our rejection of the plaintiffs claim is buttressed by the fact that the legislature eliminated any reference to the absence of a notice of claim for compensation in the provision of \u00a7 31-294c (c) relating to defective or inaccurate notices.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Although we are mindful of the liberality with which we are to construe our workers\u2019 compensation statutes, \u201c[t]he fundamental problem with the plaintiffs position is that it ignores the fact that the workers\u2019 compensation system in Connecticut is derived exclusively from statute. We have previously observed that the workers\u2019 compensation commission, like any administrative body, must act strictly within its statutory authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>.... It cannot modify, abridge, or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; </em>Webster, 242 Conn. 570, 576, 698 A.2d 873 (1997). Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to comply with an integral provision of our workers\u2019 compensation scheme, namely, the notice requirement of \u00a7 31-294c (a), we conclude that the board properly upheld the determination of the commissioner that the plaintiff is barred from pursuing her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a) provides for, inter alia, the payment of compensation to a dependent of an employee who has died \u201cfrom an accident arising out of and in the course of\u2019 that employee\u2019s employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-13\"> Travelers Insurance Company, Z-Loda Systems\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, also is a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a) provides: \u201cNo proceedings for compensation under the provisions of . . . chapter [568] shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident or within three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury, provided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident or first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents, or the legal representative of the deceased employee, may make claim for compensation within the two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later.

The employer shall send a copy of the notice to the employee in accordance with section 31-321. If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, the employer shall commence payment of compensation for such injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, but the employer may contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, provided the employer shall not be required to commence payment of compensation when the written notice of claim has not been properly served in accordance with section 31-321 or when the written notice of claim fails to include a warning that (1) the employer, if he has commenced payment for the alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim, shall be precluded from contesting liability unless a notice contesting liability is filed within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, and (2) the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death unless the employer either files a notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim or commences payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day. An employer shall be entitled, if he prevails, to reimbursement from the claimant of any compensation paid by the employer on and after the date the commissioner receives written notice from the employer or his legal representative, in accordance with the form prescribed by the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, stating that the right to compensation is contested.

In <em>Tardy </em>v. <em>Abington Constructors, Inc., </em>71 Conn. App. 140, 144, 801 A.2d 804 (2002), the Appellate Court concluded that a dependent seeking survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-306 must file a notice of claim for compensation independent of any notice that the decedent may have filed in connection with his or her underlying claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The plaintiff does not challenge that determination by the Appellate Court in <em>Tardy.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> It is undisputed that Z-Loda Systems had actual notice of the decedent\u2019s death on the date of the decedent\u2019s death, November 14, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (c) provides: \u201cFailure to provide a notice of claim under subsection (a) of this section shall not bar maintenance of the proceedings if there has been a hearing or a written request for a hearing or an assignment for a hearing within a one-year period from the date of the accident or within a three-year period from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, or if a voluntary agreement has been submitted within the applicable period, or if within the applicable period an employee has been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care as provided in section 31-294d. No defect or inaccuracy of notice of claim shall bar maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shows that he was ignorant of the facts concerning the personal injury and was prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy of the notice. Upon satisfactory showing of ignorance and prejudice, the employer shall receive allowance to the extent of the prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to correct certain of the commissioner\u2019s findings. The commissioner denied the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> The plaintiff maintains that the board improperly applied a deferential standard of review to the commissioner\u2019s decision. Because our review of the board\u2019s decision is plenary, any deference that the board may have afforded the commissioner has no bearing on our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\"> We note that, in the present case, the latest date on which the plaintiff could have filed her notice of claim for compensation pursuant to the express provisions of \u00a7 31-294c (a) was November 14, 1993, which was one year after the date of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 31-294c (a) is simply a statute of limitations that sets forth the time period within which a claim for survivor\u2019s benefits must be filed. According to the plaintiff, the purpose of the limitation period is to protect employers from fictitious or false claims. On the basis of this assertion, the plaintiff further maintains that, in the present case, there was no risk to Z-Loda Systems of a fraudulent claim and, therefore, her failure to comply with \u00a7 31-294c (a) should be excused. The plaintiffs argument is unavailing because, as we previously have stated, \u201c[t]his [statutory] requirement [is] not simply a statute of limitations\u201d; <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>143 Conn. 571, 580, 124 A.2d 526 (1956); but, rather, implicates the commissioner\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 5-6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of . . . chapter [568] has been sustained under circumstances creating in some other person than the employer a legal liability to pay damages in respect thereto, the injured employee may claim compensation . . . but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of such injured employee against such other person, but such injured employee may proceed at law against such person to recover damages for such injury; and any employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation . . . may bring an action against such other person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to such injured employee. If either such employee or such employer brings such action against such third person, <em>he shall forthwith notify the other, </em>in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of such fact and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and such other may join as a party plaintiff in such action within thirty days after such notification, and, if such other fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against such third person shall abate. . . .\u201c (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> As we have indicated; see footnote 7 of this opinion; Z-Loda Systems did not receive any part of the one million dollar award stemming from the settlement of the third party action because Z-Loda Systems has never paid any workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the decedent or his estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> In light of onr conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Z-Loda Systems had actual notice of her intent to seek survivor\u2019s benefits, we need not address the plaintiffs claim that she should be relieved of her obligation to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 31-294c (a) because Z-Loda Systems had actual notice of her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> The plaintiff concedes that she is not entitled to relief under any of the provisions of \u00a7 31-294c (c) that obviate the need for a claimant to file a notice of claim altogether.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> The plaintiff also asserts that Z-Loda Systems had sufficient notice of her claim because it had enough information to trigger an investigation of that claim, and that, under those circumstances, Z-Loda Systems was obligated to file a timely written notice in accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (b) that it intended to contest the plaintiff\u2019s claim. See, e.g., <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 612 (\u201c[i]f the notice of claim is sufficient to allow the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim, it triggers the employer\u2019s obligation to file a disclaimer\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The issue of whether a notice of claim for compensation contains sufficient information for the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim such that its obligation under \u00a7 31-294c (b) to respond to the claim is triggered, however, presupposes that the employer has been given proper notice of the claim. Because we conclude that Z-Loda Systems did not receive notice of the plaintiffs claim, it necessarily follows that Z-Loda Systems was under no obligation either to commence an investigation or to provide the plaintiff with a written disclaimer of liability. Similarly, in light of this conclusion, the plaintiff cannot prevail on her related claim that Z-Loda Systems should be precluded from disputing liability because of its failure to notify the plaintiff, in accordance with \u00a7 31-294c (b), that it was contesting her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
