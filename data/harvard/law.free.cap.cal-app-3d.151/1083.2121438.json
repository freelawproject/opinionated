He alleges the following facts in his complaint and the several exhibits incorporated therein by reference:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Botos is a practicing attorney and has been a member of the California Bar for the past 18 years, enjoying a good name and reputation, both personally and professionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">On February 10, 1982, he declared himself a candidate for the office of Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, office no. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">After his official registration, on or about March 1, 1982, LACBA wrote to Botos (and all other candidates for local judicial office) and requested that he complete and return a biographical questionnaire for use by the judicial evaluation committee of LACBA in connection with their preparation of evaluation ratings. Botos failed to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">On or about March 15, 1982, LACBA again requested the same information. On March 20, 1982, Botos responded by letter, refused to provide the requested information and challenged the right of LACBA to evaluate candidates for judicial office. His position was that LACBA\u2019s \u201conly right is to vote for or against the candidate.\u201d Botos refused to give LACBA permission to evaluate him and directed LACBA\u2019s attention to the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>sions of Elections Code section 29630, which pertains to criminal intimidation of the electorate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In a letter dated April 30, 1982, LACBA advised Botos that he had been given a \u201ctentative evaluation\u201d of \u201cnot qualified.\u201d Botos was offered an option to discuss his rating with the judicial evaluation committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">On May 6, 1982, Botos again responded by letter, objected to the evaluation and charged that LACBA was acting \u201cagainst the law\u201d and that the tentative rating was \u201cdefamatory and injurious.\u201d He warned that any release of the evaluation would cause him to seek \u201call proper legal remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">LACBA continued its review and investigation of Botos and by letter of May 21, 1982, advised him that after due deliberation and consideration, the judicial evaluation committee had evaluated him as \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the judicial office for which he sought election. On or about May 25, 1982, the report of LACBA was released and published.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Newspapers in Los Angeles County reported the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">Superior Court \u201cOffice #2: . . . Attorney Bela Botos, not qualified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">\u201cAttorney Bela Botos, \u2018has not demonstrated the [necessary] experience and competence. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Botos\u2019 complaint alleged the falsity of LACBA\u2019s publication, malice, special damages, and the other technical requirements of a cause of action for libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>LACEA demurred to the complaint on two separate grounds: LACBA\u2019s published comment that Botos is \u201cnot qualified\u201d to serve as a superior court judge (1) is not susceptible to a defamatory meaning under Civil Code section 45<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) is an expression of opinion which is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The demurrer was sustained on the grounds urged without leave to amend and this appeal followed the subsequent dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Discussion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">\u201cGood name in man and woman, dear my Lord,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">Who steals my purse steals trash; \u2019tis something, nothing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">\u2019Twas mine, \u2019tis his and has been slave to thousands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\">But he that filches from me my good name</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8F\">Robs me of that which not enriches him</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABX\">And makes me poor indeed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Not unlike Iago\u2019s lament, Botos\u2019 complaint is that he was defamed when LACBA published their evaluation of him as not qualified to perform the duties of a superior court judge. The utterance having appeared in print, the question is whether it is libelous. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 44.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>This is the first time the California courts have addressed the question whether the publication by a local bar association of an opinion regarding the qualifications of a candidate for judicial office may subject the association to an action for libel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">In California a libel is a \u201cfalse and unprivileged\u201d written publication which \u201cexposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">\u201cAn essential element of libel ... is that the publication in question must contain a false statement of <em>fact. . . . </em>This requirement ... is constitutionally based. The reason for the rule, well stated by the high court, is that \u2018Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges or juries but on the competition of other ideas.\u2019 <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 339-340 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 805, 94 S.Ct. 2997], fn. omitted. . . .) In this context courts apply the Constitution by carefully distinguishing between statements of opinion and fact, treating the one as constitutionally protected and imposing on the other civil liability for its abuse, [f] The critical determination of whether the alleged defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law.\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596, 600-601 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425]; see <em>Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 442, 450-451 [175 Cal.Rptr. 157, 629 P.2d 1369], cert. den. 454 U.S. 1099 [70 L.Ed.2d 641, 102 S.Ct. 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">It is well settled law that \u201cmere expression of <em>opinion </em>or severe criticism is not libelous, even though it adversely reflects on the fitness of an individual for public office.\u201d <em>(Yorty </em>v. <em>Chandler </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 467, 472-473 [91 Cal.Rptr. 709], italics added; see <em>Sierra Breeze </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 102, 106 [149 Cal.Rptr. 914], <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bakersfield News-Bulletin, Inc. </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 899, 903 [119 Cal.Rptr. 92], <em>Scott </em>v. <em>McDonnel Douglas Corp., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.3d at pp. 289, 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Although Botos was burdened with the committee\u2019s evaluation of him as \u201cnot qualified\u201d to serve on the superior court bench, it was only their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>collective <em>opinion </em>of him, based on a majority or greater vote.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a collective judgment of his qualifications, it may have ranged from being well founded to utterly wrong,  However, LACBA, like everyone else, has a right to express its views on who is or is not qualified for judicial office. (See <em>Yorty </em>v. <em>Chandler, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d at p. 473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">By entering the arena of public elections, Botos subjected himself to evaluative comment, not only from the local bar association, but also from any and all interested persons. <em>(Eva </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1928) 89 Cal.App. 324, 328 [264 P. 803]; see <em>Yorty </em>v. <em>Chandler, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d at p. 473.) There is \u201cgood authority for believing that grapes do not grow on thorns nor figs on thistles.\u201d <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>MacLennan </em>(1908) 78 Kan. 711, 739 [98 P. 281, 291].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The comments of the court in <em>Eva </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>89 Cal.App. 324, are particularly apt: \u201cAn individual who seeks or accepts public office invites and challenges public criticism so far as it may relate to his fitness and qualifications, ... It is, therefore, justifiable ... to communicate ... to the constituency any matter respecting a candidate material to the election. Having offered profert of himself for public investigation a candidate must expect some criticism of his personal fitness. . . . <em>[T\\emperament and qualifications are mere matters of opinion of which the electors are the only good judges. . . . </em>The right of criticism rests upon public policy and those who seek office should not be supersensitive or too thin-skinned concerning criticism of their qualifications <em>. ... \u2018It would be absurd to hold as libelous to say of a candidate for public office that he was utterly unworthy of public confidence. . . (Id., </em>at pp. 328-329; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In <em>Desert Sun Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 49 [158 Cal.Rptr. 519], the court pointed out that \u201c[o]ur political history reeks of unfair, intemperate, scurrilous and irresponsible charges against those in or seeking public office. Washington was called a murderer, Jefferson a blackguard, a knave and insane (Mad Tom), Henry Clay a pimp, Andrew Jackson a murderer and an adulterer, and Andrew Johnson and Ulyssess Grant drunkards. Lincoln was called a half-witted usurper, a baboon, a gorilla, a ghoul. Theodore Roosevelt was castigated as a traitor to his class, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a traitor to his country. Dwight D. Eisenhower was charged with being a conscious agent of the Communist Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>spiracy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 51; see <em>Grillo </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 868, 872 [193 Cal.Rptr. 414].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">While there is general agreement that a good reputation is one of man\u2019s choicest treasures and that its uncompensated loss through false charges should be required only where it is clear the public good requires this sacrifice (Noel, <em>Defamation of Public Offices and Candidates </em>(1949) 49 Colum.L.Rev. 875, 891), clearly the public is well served by public comment of bar associations and others concerning the qualifications of candidates for judicial office. Further, a local bar association has a vested interest in aiding the public to form sound judgments concerning the quality of judicial candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">An unfavorable evaluation by such an association is not akin to the ringing of a leper\u2019s bell nor a drumming out of the corps. The vast majority of candidates simply accept the ultimate results of the election and carry on unencumbered by residual memory. Some even win the subject seat and have the last laugh. Moreover, we are reminded of the wise words credited to President Harry S. Truman: \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the [evaluative] heat, get out of the [electoral] kitchen.\u201d (See <em>Desert Sun Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We hold, therefore, that LACBA\u2019s published <em>opinion </em>that Botos is \u201cnot qualified\u201d to sit as a superior court judge is nonlibelous as a matter of law. (See <em>Yorty </em>v. <em>Chandler, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d 467; and see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bakersfield News-Bulletin, Inc., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 902.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so holding, we are not unmindful of Botos\u2019 concern that his reputation has been injured by the unflattering LACBA evaluation of his fitness for judicial office. However, there exists no protective mantle from fair, open and honest comment when one seeks a place of public trust and service. The hallowed hall of justice is not a sheltering inn for members of the bar who may not possess the attributes of courage, character, habit, industry, mentality and morality required of those who would sit in the seat of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">An order sustaining a demurrer will be upheld on appeal where, as here, the complaint fails to state a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Klein, P. J., and Lui, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-13\"> The individual defendants were not served.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\"> Elections Code section 29630 states: \u201cEvery person who makes use of or threatens to make use of any force, violence, or tactic of coercion or intimidation, to induce or compel any other person to vote or refrain from voting at any election or to vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure at any election, or because any person voted or refrained from voting at any election or voted or refrained from voting for any particular person or measure at any election is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months or two or three years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b842-12\"> In addition to the evaluation, LACBA\u2019s public report explained the composition and structure of its judicial evaluation committee and outlined its procedures. It stated that the standards used \u201cnecessarily involve and contemplate a <em>qualitative evaluation </em>and are, therefore, very different from the mere eligibility provisions of the California Constitution ....\u2019\u2019 (Italics added.) There was an explanation that a \u201cnot qualified\u201d evaluation meant the candidate lacked \u201csome or all of the qualities of professional ability, experience, competence, integrity and temperament indicative of fitness to perform the judicial function satisfactorily.\u201d The report indicated the scope of the evaluations were limited: \u201cThe Committee firmly emphasizes that it has limited its evaluations only to a determination of the candidate\u2019s present qualifications for judicial office and it does not purport in any way to reflect upon any candidate\u2019s capabilities for any other office or as a practicing attorney or in any other endeavor. <em>The following final evaluations of the Judicial Evaluation Committee are limited to the Committee\u2019s considered opinion as to the candidate\u2019s present ability to serve as a judge for the court to which he or she seeks election </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-12\"> Civil Code section 45 provides: \u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b843-13\"> William Shakespeare, Othello, Act III, scene 3, line 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b843-14\"> \u201cThe modern tort of defamation developed from two sources. The action for written defamation, called libel, grew out of a criminal action in the Star Chamber, while the action for spoken defamation, called slander, arose in the ecclesiastical courts. When the common-law courts took jurisdiction over slander, they allowed recovery only where pecuniary loss was proved, or where the slanderous accusation was one of a few which were considered so serious as to create a great probability that such loss would be suffered. In the Star Chamber, however, only reputational harm was necessary for the crime of libel. When, upon the abolition of that tribunal, libel became the basis for a tort action in the common-law courts, this basis of liability was retained. Thus the outcome of many actions became dependent upon the form in which the defamation was published; courts might allow recovery for a written defamatory statement read by few persons but not for an identical statement made in a speech before a large audience. The difference has been justified on the ground that since libel is in a more permanent form and will be taken more seriously, pecuniary harm is so probable that it can be presumed.\u201d <em>(Developments in the Law\u2014Defamation </em>(1956) 69 Harv.L.Rev. 875, 887, fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\"> A similar issue was addressed by the Illinois courts in <em>Anagnost </em>v. <em>Chicago Bar Ass\u2019n </em>(1980) 83 Ill.App.3d 466 [38 Ill.Rec. 902, 404 N.E.2d 326], On appeal, the conclusion of the trial court that the comments of the Chicago Bar Association were not libelous was affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> The special committee on judicial evaluations was appointed by the president of LACBA during the administration year 1981-1982. Its composition represented a cross-section of the legal community, as it included minorities, women and men, public and private sector lawyers, sole practitioners and members of small, medium and large law firms. The preponderance of the membership was said to possess broad litigation experience and knowledge concerning those characteristics and attributes required for judicial office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> Since an essential element of libel is that the publication in question contain a false statement of <em>fact, </em>we need not review the trial court\u2019s determination that LACBA\u2019s statement is not susceptible to a defamatory meaning.
