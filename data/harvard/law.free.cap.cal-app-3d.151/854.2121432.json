A jury convicted San Jose Police Officer Kevin B. Pringle of refusal by a peace officer to receive or arrest a person charged with a criminal offense (Pen. Code, \u00a7 142), but acquitted him of assault under color of authority (Pen. Code, \u00a7 149). We reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">On January 7, 1982, at 12:11 a.m., San Jose Police Sergeant David Longaker detained 19-year-old Sandra M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on suspicion of driving while intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>icated. She was speeding and driving erratically. Sergeant Longaker made a radio request for a drunk driving patrol car. Officer Pringle responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Pringle arrived on the scene at 12:13 a.m. He conducted field sobriety tests, which Sandra failed. The officers concluded that she was legally intoxicated. Longaker told Pringle to \u201ctake her in and process her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Pringle announced that Sandra was under arrest for driving while intoxicated. He handcuffed her and placed her in the front seat of his patrol car. (The car did not have a partition between the front and back seats.) He began driving, purportedly to take Sandra to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">At this point the trial testimony of Pringle and Sandra diverged. Both agreed that Pringle drove to a remote area, removed Sandra\u2019s handcuffs, and had sexual intercourse with her. Sandra testified that after Pringle started driving he said nothing to her; Pringle stopped the car and asked her \u201cif I gave head;\u201d she responded that she did not; without any further verbal exchange he removed the handcuffs and her clothes and engaged in an act of sexual intercourse, Sandra not resisting because \u201clam afraid of guns.\u201d Pringle testified that while he was driving Sandra propositioned him; she said, \u201cI\u2019d like to make love with you, would you like to make love with me?\u201d and asked him to \u201ctell me what you want;\u201d he responded by suggesting an act of fellatio, with which she complied; she removed her own clothes; after a period of foreplay they had consensual sexual intercourse. The jury apparently disbelieved Sandra, as it acquitted Pringle of the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">After the sexual encounter ended, Pringle drove Sandra to her boyfriend\u2019s house, following her directions. He released her and drove away. Sandra made no claim that Pringle had agreed to have sexual intercourse with her in exchange for her release.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Pringle contends that the trial court should have granted his motions for acquittal as to the charge of violating Penal Code section 142. Section 142, subdivision (a), provided: \u201cAny peace officer who has the authority <em>to receive or arrest a person charged with a criminal offense and wilfully refuses to receive or arrest such person </em>shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in the state prison, or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d (Italics added.) Pringle contends that there was no evidence that he refused \u201cto receive or arrest a person charged with a criminal offense.\u201d He argues that once he announced Sandra\u2019s arrest, handcuffed her, and placed her in the patrol car for transportation to the police station his conduct was no longer governed by section 142, but was governed by Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Code section 849. The latter statute affords an officer discretion to release a person arrested without a warrant if the officer \u201cis satisfied that there are insufficient grounds for making a criminal complaint.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 849, subd. (b)(1).) Pringle argues that he was subject only to administrative discipline for violating or neglecting his official duty (Pen. Code, \u00a7 661) by abusing his discretion under section 849.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Respondent concedes that Pringle \u201carrested\u201d Sandra within the meaning of section 142, but argues that he nevertheless violated section 142 by failing to \u201creceive\u201d Sandra after the arrest. The argument is based on a very broad construction of the word receive, which respondent defines variously as reception of the arrestee for the purpose of \u201cproducing her before a magistrate, clerk, or jail facility officer\u201d and \u201crepose in custody after delivery until release is authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The issue, therefore, is how to construe the word receive in section 142. Resolution of this issue is aided by consideration of the first part of the statute as it read from its enactment in 1872 until it was rewritten in 1970: \u201cEvery sheriff, coroner, keeper of a jail, constable, or other peace officer, who wilfully refuses to receive or arrest any person charged with a criminal offense, is punishable . . . .\u201d (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 142, first amended in 1970 by Stats. 1970, ch. 829, \u00a7 1.1, p. 1563.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The word receive in the 1872 statute seems most logically to have referred only to the duty of jailers and persons performing like functions to receive prisoners and the duty of police officers to receive persons arrested by citizens, with the word \u201carrest\u201d logically referring to the similar duty of police officers to make arrests. This construction is supported by the fact that the only recorded litigation involving section 142 has occurred in situations involving the duty of jailers to receive prisoners (see Comment, <em>Some Proposals for Modernizing the Law of Arrest </em>(1951) 39 Cal.L.R. 96, 103) and the duty of peace officers to receive persons arrested by citizens (e.g., <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 761 [87 Cal.Rptr. 638]; <em>Shakespeare </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 375, 382 [40 Cal.Rptr. 863]).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Perhaps more significant is the fact that the broad construction urged by respondent would create an untenable conflict with Penal Code section 849, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>the purpose of which is to vest peace officers with discretion to release persons arrested by officers or citizens \u201cwhen the situation and circumstances dictate.\u201d (52 Ops.Atty.Gen. 65, 68 (1969).) To construe section 142 as prescribing criminal sanctions for release of an arrestee before \u201crelease is authorized by law,\u201d as respondent urges, would result in sanctions for an <em>improper </em>exercise of discretion under section 849. This would draw such a tenuous line between the valid exercise of discretion under section 849 and the violation of section 142 (the sole determining factor being the propriety of the officer\u2019s \u201csatisfaction\u201d as to whether there were sufficient grounds for making a criminal complaint) that few officers would risk criminal sanctions by exercising their discretion under section 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Ultimately, the only basis urged by respondent for adding the concepts of \u201cretention\u201d and \u201cproduction before a magistrate, clerk, or jail facility officer\u201d to the word \u201creceive\u201d in section 142 is that such broad construction is necessary to ensure that arrestees are held in custody until disposed of in a lawful manner. Implicit in this argument is the proposition that because no criminal statute was directly applicable to Pringle\u2019s wrongdoing, the most closely related statute should be stretched to fit the facts of the case. But Pringle <em>could </em>have been prosecuted under a directly applicable statute. Upon arresting Sandra for driving under the influence, he was statutorily required to take her without delay before a magistrate (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40302) or, if a magistrate was unavailable, before a magistrate\u2019s clerk or the officer in charge of the most accessible jail facility (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40307). His omission to perform these duties was made a crime by Government Code section 1222, which provides, \u201cEvery willful omission to perform any duty enjoined by law upon any public officer, or person holding any public trust or employment, where no special provision is made for the punishment of such delinquency, is punishable as a misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pringle was prosecuted under the wrong statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We severely condemn Officer Pringle\u2019s conduct. Abhorrence of his conduct, however, does not justify or permit conviction under an inapplicable criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In short, Pringle discharged his duties under Penal Code section 142 when he arrested Sandra. He may have violated Government Code section 1222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>when he subsequently released her without taking her before a magistrate, clerk, or jail facility officer; however, he was not prosecuted under that statute. The trial court should have directed a verdict of acquittal on the charge of violation of Penal Code section 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Low, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-13\"> We use Ms. M\u2019s first name in this opinion to avoid any possible embarrassment to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> Pringle, subsequent to this incident being brought to the attention of his supervisors, resigned from the police force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> The 1872 statute was derived from an 1850 law that provided, \u201cIf any Sheriff, Coroner, Keeper of a Jail, Constable, or other officer, shall wilfully refuse to receive or arrest any person charged with a criminal offense, such Sheriff, Coroner, Jailor, Constable, or other officer so offending, shall, on conviction, be fined in any sum not exceeding five thousand dollars, and imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding five years.\u201d (Stats. 1850, ch. 99, \u00a7 100.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\"> Pringle was a \u201cpublic officer\u201d within the meaning of Government Code section 1222.
