Code, \u00a7 8240),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> chiefly its support of a proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the federal Constitution. They filed this taxpayers\u2019 action for declaratory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>injunctive relief seeking to abolish the commission or, failing that, to prohibit it from lobbying or promoting its views concerning actions the commission deems appropriate to improve the status of women. The trial court denied relief aimed at abolition of the commission but granted judgment for plaintiffs encompassing the alternate relief they sought. The commission appeals from the judgment. Plaintiffs cross-appeal from the denial of their paramount request.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In 1965 the California Legislature adopted an act creating the Advisory Commission on the Status of Women to study various subjects, including employment conditions, relating to the equality of treatment of women and to report its recommendations to the Legislature. (Stats. 1965, ch. 1378, pp. 3283-3285.) In 1969 the Legislature amended the act to specify additional functions of the commission. (Stats. 1969, ch. 721, \u00a7 6, p. 1415.) In 1971, the act was amended to create the Commission on the Status of Women and to add yet other duties. (Stats. 1971, ch. 541, pp. 1050-1052.) The legislation was codified in the Government Code in 1977. (Stats. 1977, ch. 579, \u00a7 65, pp. 1857-1858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In 1972 the Legislature ratified the proposed ERA (Stats. 1972, res. ch. 148, pp. 3440-3441) which provides: \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Plaintiffs filed the complaint in this action in November 1976, alleging the commission unlawfully promoted the ratification of the ERA in California and elsewhere and illegally urged conformity of California\u2019s laws to the ERA standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They claim any such promotion is ultra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>vires or, alternatively, prohibited because it denies them constitutional rights to equal protection of the law and freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">This court considered the controversy in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 762 [151 Cal.Rptr. 197] <em>(Miller 1) </em>and reversed a summary judgment in favor of the commission, with two justices concluding the commission\u2019s \u201cadvocatory or promotional position on ERA\u201d required \u201c \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 legislative authorization,\u201d which had not been shown. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 771-772.) Thereafter, shortly after the rendering of the judgment here in issue, the Legislature enacted section 8246 (Stats. 1982, ch. 1118, \u00a7 1) which provides: \u201c(a) The commission is expressly authorized to inform the Legislature of its position on any legislative proposal pending before the Legislature and to urge the introduction of legislative proposals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201c(b) The commission is expressly authorized to state its position and viewpoint on issues developed in the performance of its duties and responsibilities as specified in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201c(c) This section is declaratory of existing law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The case, as framed by plaintiffs and the order of the court below, involves declaratory and injunctive relief that looks only to the future. Accordingly, we address the matter in the present tense, cognizant of the most recent expression of legislative will.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757, 773 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222], fn. 8; cf. <em>Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 125 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In essence the judgment declares and orders that the commission must refrain from expressing to the Legislature or the public any opinion of its own on any issues of \u201c[w]omen\u2019s educational and employment problems, needs, and opportunities. \u201d The commission is relegated thereby to the status of a librarian, a collector and indexer of data and opinions of others on these subjects. The authority advanced for this bar is <em>Miller I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>Miller I, </em>however, is no longer authority for such claims; the enactment of section 8246 has cut the ground from beneath it. The commission is now \u201cexpressly authorized to state its position and viewpoint on issues developed in the performance of its duties and responsibilities\u201d (\u00a7 8246, subd. (b)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>which are broadly set forth in section 8245.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The authorization for the commission to speak its mind \u201con issues\u201d developed on these matters can only be interpreted as a legislative warrant to advocate and promote the commission\u2019s positions on these subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 sole rejoinder to the new legislation is the remarkable assertion that, notwithstanding the plain language of the statute, because subdivision (c) of section 8246 states the section is declaratory of existing law, the Legislature intended to endorse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Why the Legislature would have amended the statute to indulge a redundancy is not explained. The words read otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We do not imply that a legislative warrant for promotional activity is wholly insulated from all but constitutional reproof. We doubt the warrant was intended to authorize advocacy of election of candidates for public office based upon their stand on matters affecting the status of women. Be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that as it may, no allegation of improper promotional activities is made out by plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings. Their complaint lies on a more generalized plane: that <em>any </em>advocacy or promotion by the commission of its views on such matters is prohibited. On that plane their remaining arguments are addressed to the Constitution. We turn to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Plaintiffs make two constitutional claims in support of the judgment and in support of its extension to abolish the commission.  They contend the very establishment of a commission on the status of women runs afoul of state and federal constitutional precepts of equal protection of the law.  Alternatively, they contend permitting the commission to speak its views on controversial \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d infringes their constitutional right to freedom of speech.  Neither contention has merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection contention is but an attempt to hoist the commission with its own petar. They reason \u201c[p]reference of women over men in the application of public resources is just as invalid as excluding women from their benefits,\u201d relying on <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 1 and <em>Arp </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 395 [138 Cal.Rptr. 293, 563 P.2d 849], They read the law as judging any gender classification or gender preference suspect and sustainable only on a showing of compelling state interest. But the use of gender-framed measures, supported by public resources, to remedy gender bias serves the interests of equality protected by our Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the California Supreme Court observed in the course of equal protection analysis, \u201c[sjociety is belated in its recognition of the baseless prejudice inherent in longstanding notions of <em>woman\u2019s </em>proper social and economic roles . . . .\u201d <em>(Arp, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 405; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The use of public resources for the establishment of a commission to develop and advocate measures to foster the economic and social equality of women is not a preference of women over men in the application of public resources. Its purpose is the fulfillment of constitutional principles of equality. That is the heart of plaintiffs\u2019 problem, for their view is that equality (in employment, etc.) <em>itself </em>trenches upon values they hold dear.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>This position is made clear by their next argument, which they clothe in First Amendment dress.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Plaintiffs submit that: \u201c[i]mplicit in the statements and conduct of the Commission is the feminist ethic that woman\u2019s maximum contribution to society is her productive labor which necessarily increases her financial independence and serves as the pretext to emancipate her from unwanted child bearing, child rearing and domestic confinement.\u201d This perceived ethos<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> conflicts with plaintiffs\u2019 view that: \u201cwomen\u2019s maximum contribution to society [is] the bearing and rearing of the future of the race . . . .\u201d They ask that we \u201cnot allow the Commission to use its preferred position and funding to enhance without any defined limit its own speech to the detriment of plaintiffs\u2019 right both to speak in opposition to the Commission and their right not to enhance the Commission\u2019s speech by tax support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This claim fails to make the critical First Amendment distinction between the \u201c[g]overnment\u2019s [ajddition of its [o]wn [v]oice [and the] [g]overnment\u2019s [s]ilencing of [o]thers.\u201d (See Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) p. 588.)  \u201cThat government must regulate expressive activity with an even hand if it regulates such activity at all does not mean that government must be ideologically \u2018neutral.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.', </em>also see Shiffrin, <em>Government Speech </em>(1980) 27 UCLA L.Rev. 565; see generally Ziegler, <em>Government Speech and the </em>Constitution: <em>The Limits of Official Partisanship </em>(1980) 21 B.C. L.Rev. 578.)  Ordinarily, government may not compel citizens to express a view any more than it may forbid someone to express a view. (See, e.g., <em>West Virginia State Bd. of Edu. </em>v. <em>Barnette </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 624 [87 L.Ed. 1628, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674].)  And, it may not delegate the authority to a nongovernmental entity to extract funds for support of political and ideological activity not directly related to the purpose for which the entity is given the power to levy. (See <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Board of Education </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 209 [52 L.Ed.2d 261, 97 S.Ct. 1782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u201cBut none of this means that government cannot add its own voice to the many that it must tolerate, provided it does not drown out private communication. The first amendment does not, for example, prevent gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ernment from promoting respect for the flag by proclaiming Flag Day or by using public property to display the flag. Those who disdain the national symbol may express that view but may not silence government\u2019s affirmation of national values, nor may they insist that government give equal circulation to their viewpoint\u2014any more than they may insist that the flags of their choice be flown alongside the American flags that ring the Washington Monument. And if government expends public funds to subsidize flag production, the fact that some people object to this expenditure of their tax money to propagate the state\u2019s patriotic message is likely to be deemed irrelevant, either in a challenge to the expenditure itself or in a challenge to the payment of the full amount of tax.\u201d (Tribe, <em>supra, </em>at p. 590; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The root problem with plaintiffs\u2019 free speech contention is that it proves too much. They offer no point of distinction between government speech addressing the status of women and government speech on any other topic; save that they deem the topic of women\u2019s status \u201ccontroversial.\u201d But, controversial or not, it is too late in the day to contend the economic and social status of women is not a legitimate topic of governmental concern.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the government, i.e., the Governor and legislative leaders, cannot appoint a commission to speak on the topic without implicating plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights it may not address any other \u201ccontroversial\u201d topics. If the government cannot address controversial topics it cannot govern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cGovernment has legitimate interests in informing, in educating, and in persuading. If government is to secure cooperation in implementing its programs, if it is to be able to maintain a dialogue with its citizens about their needs and the extent to which government can or should meet those needs, government must be able to communicate. An approach that would invalidate all controversial government speech would seriously impair the democratic process.\u201d (Shiffrin, <em>supra, </em>27 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 606; fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The irrefutable need for government speech does not provide absolute license and in some guises government speech may have the effect of trammeling the free speech rights of others. In this regard, it is important to note what is not in issue here. This is not a circumstance in which government has established a forum for speech and is precluding some points of view from an equal opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See Kalven, <em>The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, </em>1965 Sup.Ct. Rev. 1; compare <em>Police </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 92 [33 L.Ed.2d 212, 92 S.Ct. 2286], city may not permit labor picketing near school buildings and outlaw all other picketing.) To analogize the commission to such a public forum would lead to far-reaching possibilities; for example, must the federal Department of Defense permit an equal opportunity for pacifists to rebut its views <em>in </em>the myriad of statements and publications it produces? (See Shiffrin, <em>supra, </em>27 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 572 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Neither have plaintiffs made out a case of government speech drowning out private communication. The speech activities of the commission are in essence these: responses to inquiries; lobbying legislators; circulation of a newsletter to persons and groups that ask to receive it, and issuance of press releases on \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d Granting that the commission has engaged in advocacy and promotion of its views in the course of these activities, neither the scale of that speech nor the vehicles employed appear likely to drown out plaintiffs\u2019 contrary views. That the imprimatur of government has conferred an advantage upon the commissioners is undeniable. That advantage, however, has not risen to the level of drowning out plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Finally, this is not a case where government speech has entered the lists in a political controversy submitted to a vote of the people. We are told that when the electorate is to exercise its franchise there is a heightened need for constitutionally based judicial oversight to avoid \u201cpoisoning the well\u201d of majoritarian principle. (See, e.g., <em>Stanson </em>v. <em>Mott </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 206, 219 [130 Cal.Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We perceive no reason grounded in plaintiffs\u2019 right to freedom of speech to uphold or extend the judgment\u2019s mandate of neutrality in these circumstances. Plaintiffs\u2019 generalized umbrage is aimed at the ideological content of the commission\u2019s speech and not with the concept of a commission speaking about the status of women. To the extent plaintiffs take offense from the ideas of equality of social and economic opportunity for women their remedy is amendment of the constitution, to reflect their views. To the extent they accept these ideas but desire to change the tone of the commission\u2019s speech, i.e., to emphasize how measures which may enhance the ability of women to choose to enter the work force may implicate other values, they must seek redress from the Legislature and the public officers to whom that body has granted the power to appoint members of the commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Sparks, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> All statutory references are to the Government Code, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"> The California Constitution contains a similar guarantee of rights.

Prior to ratification of the ERA by California\u2019s Legislature the commission advocated this action to its members and to the public. In 1973 the commission \u201cobtained passage\u201d of Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 33 creating a Joint Committee of Legal Equality. (See Stats. 1973, res. ch. 114, pp, 3242-3243, establishing a joint committee to study conforming California\u2019s laws \u201cwith the principle that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.\u201d) After 1973, the commission established a syndicated newspaper column entitled \u201cA Woman Ought to Know\u201d with a \u201cpartisan\u201d slant in favor of the ERA and biased on other \u201cpolitical and controversial topics.\u201d Since 1973 the commission has prepared various materials for public consumption \u201cto the end of implementing the legal and societal standards of the [ERA]. \u2019\u2019 Since 1974 the commission has printed a newsletter for the purpose of supporting the ERA. In August of 1974 the newsletter stated falsely that legal authorities agree a state cannot rescind their ratification of the ERA. In January of 1975 the newsletter urged letters and contributions to the effort to obtain ratification of the ERA in seven other states. In August of 1975 the newsletter urged readers\u2019 attendance at an August rally at the State Capitol Building and subsequent visits to legislators to ask for legislation conforming California laws to the ERA and to oppose rescission of California\u2019s ratification of ERA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\"> We note the matter of attorney fees was reserved by the trial court.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFW\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The recent enactment of Government Code section 8246 (Stats. 1982, ch. 1118, \u00a7 1) is clearly a legislative response to the trial court\u2019s judgment and was plainly intended to supersede the trial court\u2019s more narrow interpretation of the commission\u2019s authority. The judgment below prohibits the commission \u201cfrom expressing to the Legislature or the public any opinion of its own on any issues of \u2018[w]omen\u2019s educational and employment problems, needs, and opportunities.\u2019\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 697.) Giving effect to newly added Government Code section 8246,1 agree the judgment cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 762 [151 Cal.Rptr. 197] <em>(Miller I), </em>we held that plaintiff\u2019s showing that the commission had spent public funds to promote the Equal Rights Amendment was adequate to defeat the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because such conduct would constitute unlawful election campaigning in the absence of \u201cclear and explicit\u201d legislative authorization for such activity. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 771-772.) Summary judgment was therefore reversed. After plenary trial the court made findings and rendered the judgment from which this appeal is taken. In its findings and judgment, the trial court did not expressly address the issue of expenditure of public funds for election campaigning considered by this court in <em>Miller I. </em>It did find that \u201csome of the activities of the Commission and its members . . . have been in excess of the statutory authority and purposes for which the Commission was established\u201d and that \u201csuch activities have involved the expenditure of public funds . . . .\u201d The court further found, however, \u201cthat evidence as to the extent of the expenditure of public funds is insufficient upon which to base a judgment. . . .\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal does not challenge the latter finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The decision in <em>Miller I </em>affords no basis to deny full effect to the subsequent legislative clarification of the commission\u2019s authority. Conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>this appeal does not provide the occasion either to question or denigrate our holding in <em>Miller </em>/. The question of whether newly added Government Code section 8246 provides the commission \u201cclear and explicit legislative authorization\u201d to \u201cexpend public funds to promote a partisan position in an election campaign\u201d <em>(Miller I, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.3d at p. 764, quoting <em>Stanson </em>v. <em>Mott </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 206, 209-210 [130 Cal.Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1]) simply is not tendered by the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 28, 1984.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
