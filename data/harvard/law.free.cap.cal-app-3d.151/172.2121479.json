(dba Taylor California Cellars, hereinafter Taylor) published an advertisement in 18 California newspapers offering a $1 rebate, plus postage, to retail purchasers of certain types of its wines. On May 16, 1983, Taylor received a letter from respondent Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (hereinafter Department) advising Taylor that its promotion was unlawful and instructing Taylor to discontinue the offering or giving of rebates. The Department also issued a \u201cBulletin\u201d to all wholesale and retail license holders in the state warning them that if they participated in Taylor\u2019s promotion they risked suspension or revocation of their licenses. Taylor sought mandate in this court alleging the Department\u2019s actions were in excess of its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taylor prays that this court issue a writ \u201ccompelling respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>dent to refrain from enforcing and threatening to enforce in any manner any interpretation of Business and Professions Code section 25600 as prohibiting cash rebates directly to consumers; ...\u201d (All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated.) We issued an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The central issue in this case is whether Taylor\u2019s rebate promotion violates section 25600 which provides: \u201cNo licensee shall, directly or indirectly, give any premium, gift, or free goods in connection with the sale of any alcoholic beverage. Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d We conclude that a rebate is not a \u201cpremium, gift, or free goods\u201d and issue a peremptory writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In resolving the question of whether section 25600 prohibits rebates \u201cthe court \u2018turns first to the words themselves for the answer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tracy </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 760, 764 [150 Cal.Rptr. 785, 587 P.2d 227], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182 [217 P.2d 1]; and see <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>City of Anaheim </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 609, 613-614 [177 Cal.Rptr. 441].)  Courts must give effect to the words of a statute according to their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 698; <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Alexis </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 709, 715 [182 Cal.Rptr. 593].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">At the outset, we prune away some obfuscative foliage by noting that Taylor\u2019s rebate is obviously neither a \u201cgift\u201d nor \u201cfree goods.\u201d  A gift is commonly defined as \u201csomething that is voluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 956.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taylor\u2019s rebate does not fall within the definition of \u201cgift\u201d because the rebate is inextricably bound up with a bargained exchange of reciprocal consideration: in order to receive Taylor\u2019s rebate, one has to purchase its wine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Similarly, the $1 rebate is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cfree goods\u201d because \u201cgoods\u201d does not ordinarily mean \u201cmoney.\u201d Thus the word, \u201cgoods\u201d is commonly defined as, \u201ctangible movable personal property having intrinsic value [usually] excluding money . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 978.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">As the parties recognize in their briefs, where they conduct a war of dictionary definitions, the hub of the matter is whether Taylor\u2019s rebate constitutes a \u201cpremium\u201d for purposes of section 25600.  In this regard, the parties generally agree that a \u201crebate,\u201d in the context of this dispute, is \u201ca retroactive abatement, credit, discount, or refund (as from a wholesaler to a retailer) [usually] as consideration for a specified volume of business . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 1892.) They disagree, however, with respect to whether a \u201crebate\u201d is a \u201cpremium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It is clear to us that the word \u201cpremium\u201d may be commonly defined variously to include or exclude a \u201crebate.\u201d Thus, if \u201cpremium\u201d is defined as \u201csomething . . . given without charge or at less than usual price with the purchase of a product or service\u201d (Webster\u2019s, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 1789), then Taylor\u2019s $1 rebate arguably falls within the definition of \u201cpremium.\u201d On the other hand, if \u201cpremium\u201d is defined as \u201csomething paid over and above a fixed wage, price, or other remuneration: Bonus . . .\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>then Taylor\u2019s rebate, arguably representing a refund of a portion of the purchase price, is not a \u201cpremium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The parties ask us to resolve this semantic ambiguity by interpreting section 25600 in such a way that the statute furthers important public policies. The parties\u2019 respective policies are, however, dramatically different. The Department asks us to interpret the statute so as to outlaw Taylor\u2019s rebate to further the judicially recognized policy of promoting temperance (see <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 431, 457 [146 Cal.Rptr. 585, 579 P.2d 476, 96 A.L.R.3d 613]), apparently upon the assumption (empirically undemonstrated on this record) that Taylor\u2019s rebate program will result in increased alcohol consumption. (See <em>Rice, supra, </em>at pp. 457-458.) Not surprisingly, Taylor and amicus curiae Federal Trade Commission ask that section 25600 be interpreted so as to encourage price competition. (See, e.g., <em>Rice, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 438-439; <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 979 [153 Cal.Rptr. 757], affd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>sub. nom California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 97 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 100 S.Ct. 937],)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">At this juncture, we find it unnecessary to referee this apparent clash of policies because we conclude statutory history demonstrates that \u201crebate\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d have different meanings in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (hereinafter the Act). (\u00a7 23000 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We discover that the Legislature for many years recognized a distinction between a \u201crebate\u201d and a \u201cpremium\u201d in the Act. Section 25600, with its present wording, first appeared in 1937 as an amendment which added section 55.7 to the then uncodified Act of 1935. (Stats. 1937, ch. 758, \u00a7 89, p. 2174.) In 1949, the Legislature added section 55.65, subdivision (m) to the still uncodified Act, and that section provided in pertinent part as follows: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the giving of, or offering to give, any <em>rebate, </em>free goods, . . . <em>premium, </em>... or any other thing or service of value, directly or indirectly, in connection with the sale of wine subject to this section, or, in any other way circumventing this section to effect a sale at a price other than the price shown in the applicable price schedule, shall be a violation of this section . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1949, ch. 574, \u00a7 1, p. 1069, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In 1953, when the Act was codified, former section 55.7 became section 25600 and former section 55.65, subdivision (m) was incorporated in section 24878. (Stats. 1953, ch. 152, \u00a7 1, pp. 1007, 1020.) Section 24878 was repealed, along with all other related alcohol price maintenance provisions, in 1980, (Stats. 1980, ch. 1368, \u00a7 5, p. 4963) following the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97 [63 L.Ed.2d 233], where the high court affirmed the opinion of this court that the price maintenance statutes violated the Sherman Act. (See <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">For present purposes, the importance of this history is that, for a period of 30 years, the relevant provisions of former section 24878 and of section 25600 lived together in the same Act. During this time, the word \u201crebate\u201d appeared in the same sentence as the word \u201cpremium\u201d in former section 24878.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The word \u201crebate\u201d did not, however, appear in section 25600, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>although, of course, the word \u201cpremium\u201d did. From this comparison and history of the two statutes, a compelling inference may be drawn that the Legislature perceived a difference between a \u201crebate\u201d and a \u201cpremium\u201d and intended to distinguish between them in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">An established canon of statutory construction is that significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose; a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. <em>(Palos Verdes Faculty Assn. </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 650, 659 [147 Cal.Rptr. 359, 580 P.2d 1155].) The Legislature is ordinarily not presumed to use statutory language in a sense which would render nugatory or redundant important provisions of the statute. <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 647 [335 P.2d 672]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawes </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 930, 939 [181 Cal.Rptr. 456].) We therefore assume that when the Legislature used the words \u201crebate\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d in the same sentence in former section 24878, the Legislature intended that the words have different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The purposes of section 25600 and of former section 24878 were closely allied: during their coexistence in the Act, both statutes sought to outlaw certain transfers of consideration in connection with sales of alcohol.  \u201cIt is well-settled that statutes that \u2018. . . are <em>in pari materia . . . </em>must be construed together. Accordingly, there being no contrary intention expressed by the Legislature, ... [a word common to two such statutes] must be given the same meaning in each enactment. [Citations omitted.]\u2019 <em>Hunstock </em>v. <em>Estate Development Corp. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 205, 210-211 [138 P.2d 1, 148 A.L.R. 968]; see also, 58 Cal.Jur.3d, Statutes, \u00a7 127, p. 521.)\u201d <em>(Estate of Downing </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 256, 265 [184 Cal.Rptr. 511].) We therefore assume, in accordance with what we believe to be common sense, that \u201cpremium\u201d meant the same thing in former section 24878 as it does in section 25600 and that it meant (and means) something different from \u201crebate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Finally we note that, \u201cThe fact that a provision of a statute on a given subject is omitted from other statutes relating to a similar subject is indicative of a different legislative intent for each of the statutes. [Citations.] Where a statute with reference to one subject contains a certain vital word, omission of that word from a similar statute on the same subject is significant to show a different intention.\u201d <em>(Hennigan </em>v. <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 1, 8 [125 Cal.Rptr. 408]; see <em>Estate of Simpson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 594, 600 [275 P.2d 467, 47 A.L.R.2d 991]; <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>County of Tulare </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 688, 691 [193 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>511]; <em>Foraker </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 856, 863 [124 Cal.Rptr. 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">From the foregoing we infer that the Legislature did not intend to include a \u201crebate\u201d as a \u201cpremium\u201d within the meaning of section 25600. This inference of legislative intent is consistent with the ordinary understanding of rebate as a refund of a portion of the purchase price of a product constituting, ultimately, a mere reduction in the purchase price and not something extra (a \u201cpremium\u201d) given for the purchase of a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We hold that where a manufacturer of wine offers retail consumers a rebate of money, in the form of a refund of a portion of the retail price paid for the wine, the rebate does not constitute a \u201cpremium, gift, or free goods\u201d within the meaning of section 25600 and is therefore not made unlawful by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We acknowledge, of course, the possibility that our conclusion, derived from an analysis of the statutory history of the Act, may incorrectly reflect the Legislature\u2019s current intent. However, if that be true, we see no point in speculating about what the Legislature might do in the future or about what issues might then arise. Suffice it to say that we can outlaw no rebate on wine before its time.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent to refrain from undertaking any measures to curtail or restrain petitioner\u2019s consumer rebate program, as described in the petition on file herein, on the ground that said rebate program violates the provisions of Business and Professions Code section 25600.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Puglia, P. J., and Carr, L, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 22, 1984, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 2, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\"> Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 23090.5, this court shares exclusive original jurisdiction with the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandate to the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> The legal definition is in accord. \u201cA gift is a transfer of personal property, made voluntarily, and without consideration.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1146; 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Personal Property, \u00a7 84, p. 1685.) Where personal property is transferred for more than nominal consideration, the transaction is not a gift. <em>(University of South. California </em>v. <em>Bryson </em>(1929) 103 Cal.App. 39, 45 [283 P.2d 949]; compare <em>Estate of Hall </em>(1908) 154 Cal. 527, 531 [98 P. 269].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> The Department argues that Taylor\u2019s rebate is a gift because no purchase of wine is required. This argument is factually inaccurate in that Taylor\u2019s rebate offer clearly requires the purchase of its wine as a condition of receiving the rebate. Moreover, if the Department\u2019s factual premise were true, Taylor\u2019s promotion would not offend section 25600 because it would not be an offer \u201cin connection with the sale of an alcoholic beverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> CaIifornia Uniform Commercial Code section 2105, subdivision (1) similarly provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Goods\u2019 means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> Neither Taylor nor amicus argues that if section 25600 is interpreted so as to outlaw rebates, the statute would violate the Sherman Act. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.) Rather, they simply contend the statute should be interpreted so as to further the desirable policy of allowing competition to reduce consumer prices. We do not address the Sherman Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\"> The word \u201crebate\u201d also appeared in the same sentence as \u201cfree goods\u201d and \u201cthe giving of . . . any . . . thing ... of value\u201d in former section 24878.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
