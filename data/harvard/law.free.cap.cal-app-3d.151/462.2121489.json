J.</author>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Defendant Richard Pena (Pena) appeals from a judgment of conviction and petitions for a writ of habeas corpus on the same judgment. Defendant was originally charged by information with murder in violation of section 187 of the Penal Code and with use of a firearm within the meaning of Penal Code sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192, subd. 1; the jury also found true the allegation defendant had personally used a firearm within the meaning of Penal Code sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">Based upon the testimony of six witnesses, the People established that Frank Ambrosio (Ambrosio) had entered the bar area of the Mexican Village restaurant on February 24, 1978, sometime between 10 and 10:30 p.m. He walked at a normal pace toward defendant and a group of men who were standing at the bar; defendant stood with his back toward the bar. Prior to Ambrosio\u2019s entry, the men had glanced repeatedly toward the door. Am<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>brosio walked with his hands at his sides; he was smiling. He patted one of the men who had been watching the door. Ambrosio and defendant appeared to be talking. A loud sound was heard; Ambrosio fell. The entire incident from the time Ambrosio entered the bar until the shooting took between 30 and 45 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">None of the witnesses observed any violence other than the shooting. Prior thereto, defendant was heard to say to Ambrosio, \u201cDon\u2019t say anymore. Don\u2019t say anymore.\u201d Defendant was seen holding a gun and a \u201cblack-like business card case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Abel Olivares (Olivares), owner of the Mexican Village restaurant, testified defendant had been in the restaurant to settle his account earlier in the evening; he visited the restaurant approximately twice per month. Defendant returned with friends at approximately 9 p.m. Olivares was in the dining room at 10:30 p.m.; he entered the bar area after hearing a shot. He removed a gun from defendant\u2019s hands, put it on the floor and then devoted 10 to 20 seconds to Ambrosio\u2019s care. When Olivares looked up, defendant and his friends had departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Abel Armas, captain of police, Los Angeles Police Department, was dining in the Mexican Village the night Ambrosio was shot. He heard the shot and observed defendant \u201cwalk quickly away\u201d from the area. Defendant exited from the kitchen area. Although he did not appear to be limping, defendant was \u201cslightly hunched.\u201d Once outside the restaurant, defendant was joined by another man; defendant used a key to open the door of a blue Lincoln Continental. Both men entered the car; they drove off rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Lieutenant Robert Kurowski, assigned to the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, arrived at the restaurant shortly after the shooting. He found the deceased on the floor with a revolver within a foot or two of his body. The weapon, a Smith and Wesson .44 magnum, contained five live and one expended round of magnum hollow point ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Expert testimony established defendant stood 5 feet <em>7\u00bd </em>inches tall and weighed approximately 160 pounds; Ambrosio was 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 241 pounds on the day of his death. According to Arleigh McCree, a weapons expert, Pena\u2019s gun had been fired from inside its zippered case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Richard Pena owned an auto body shop and also worked as an investigator for a law firm; he had known Frank Ambrosio, Jr., for some time, had travelled to Costa Rica with Ambrosio and had been best man at Ambrosio\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>wedding. Pena considered Ambrosio a violent person. He had seen Ambrosio become angry at two young girls and \u201cbeat the hell out of them bad\u201d; Ambrosio \u201ckicked them, threw them on the floor, hit them with a bottle of Chivas Regal Scotch.\u201d Although Pena attempted to stop the beating, he was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Ambrosio told Pena he had committed \u201ca few armed robberies and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon,\u201d that he had killed someone while out joy-riding and that \u201che almost killed a black man because he was talking to a white waitress. . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, Pena was aware the law firm for which he worked had represented Ambrosio on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. While at the firm\u2019s office, Pena heard Ambrosio say \u201cthat he beat up two guys at the Candelarea. Sent them to the hospital.\u201d On several occasions, Pena saw Ambrosio carrying a weapon; he was aware the Cuban community considered Ambrosio a \u201cbad cat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Defendant hired employees who had previously worked for Ambrosio to work for him at his auto body shop; he had heard Ambrosio was angered by his action. Isaac Perez, Pena\u2019s brother-in-law, was told Ambrosio claimed Pena had stabbed him [Ambrosio] in the back and he was going to get even one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In 1977, Ambrosio called Pena and asked him to guarantee bail bonds for two individuals; Pena did so. Neither individual appeared in court. The bail bondsperson called and informed Pena he would have to pay for the nonappearances. Defendant called Ambrosio. He told Ambrosio to pay the bonds, but Ambrosio refused, saying \u201cI [sic] not going to pay for it. You pay for it, you son-of-a-bitch. If you want the money, go and get a gun and come down and get your money. Better yet, don\u2019t come down. I am going to go out and look for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Pena was stunned. He stayed home for three days; afterwards he carried a .44 magnum revolver wherever he went. He was frightened; he knew \u201cwhat [Ambrosio] was capable of doing.\u201d Pena was aware that Ambrosio was a karate expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">One of his employees told him, \u201cI know what happened. Frank Dennis told me. You better start carrying a gun. Don\u2019t let him get close to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Ambrosio called Pena and said, \u201cBe sure to look behind every time you turn around.\u201d When he heard that, Pena felt \u201cshaky and my stomach cramped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Jesse Halpern (Jesse), Penh\u2019s attorney/employer, had known Pena for approximately 12 years. On February 23 or 24, Pena arrived at the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>office with a satchel containing his gun. Pena explained he was carrying it because Ambrosio had threatened his life; he took the threat seriously and felt he had to carry the gun for protection. Pena appeared \u201cquite upset.\u201d He told Jesse \u201cAmbrosio knew where he lived, knew where he worked, knew where he went and he didn\u2019t feel that there was any way that he could avoid him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Russell Halpern (Russell), Pena\u2019s other employer, also knew Ambrosio; he was aware Ambrosio had earned a black belt in karate. Russell testified Ambrosio\u2019s \u201creputation was that he would engage in many fights; that he was very violent.\u201d After Pena explained his reason for carrying a gun, Russell called Ambrosio; Pena was able to hear the conversation on a speaker phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Russell began by saying, \u201cFrank, what\u2019s wrong between you and Pena? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Ambrosio answered, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Russell responded, \u201cWhat do you mean, nothing? He just left the office with a gun in his hands, running. He was going over your place.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">After Ambrosio stated, \u201cGod, I am not ready for this bastard,\u201d Russell explained he was joking. Ambrosio responded, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. Tell the------------I am ready for him. I am waiting for him.\u201d Ambrosio added words to the effect, \u201cI\u2019ll be looking for him. So, tell him to be ready.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">According to Russell, Ambrosio\u2019s voice \u201cwould become angrier, more irritated or agitated\u201d; he referred to Pena by using a vulgarity. Pena appeared physically disturbed as he listened to the conversation. He left the law offices and returned to his body shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">An employee at Pena\u2019s body shop attempted to take defendant\u2019s gun; Pena said, \u201cI cannot be without a gun. That\u2019s my life.\u201d The gun was returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">At approximately 9 p.m. on February 24, 1978, Pena and friends went to the Mexican Village restaurant; he parked his car in front of the restaurant. Pena sat at barstool number eight; he saw Ambrosio come through the door. Pena had the magnum in its carrying case; Ambrosio came straight toward Pena and stopped directly in front of him, two or three feet away. Pena had grabbed the gun; Ambrosio\u2019s hands were held in front of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Ambrosio said something like, \u201cYou better draw faster than that.\u201d Pena believed his life was in danger; he believed Ambrosio had a gun, for he thought Ambrosio carried one at all times. He testified at trial that Ambrosio \u201cattacked me. Came forward.\u201d Pena tried to push Ambrosio away; the gun was in Pena\u2019s left hand. Pena \u201cpushed him away with both hands.\u201d Pena hit him either on the chest or on the forehead; Ambrosio may have kicked Pena. The barstool was knocked over. Pena perceived Ambrosio on top of him; the gun went off against Ambrosio\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Pena testified to the following: He did not intend to kill or maim Ambrosio; he intended only to defend himself. The owner of the restaurant and a busboy ushered Pena out of the restaurant; he got in his car and drove away. Pena called Jesse Halpern; he said he had just shot Ambrosio, \u201cthat Ambrosio had come through the door and walked directly towards him and said something to him, and that he had taken the gun out and it had gone off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Jesse told Pena to meet him at a restaurant across from the Halperns\u2019 law office. Russell and Jesse met Pena at the restaurant shortly thereafter. Pena \u201cappeared to be very upset, appeared to be like someone who was in shock.\u201d Russell noted Pena was \u201cvisibly shaking. Visibly saddened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Pena stated Frank Ambrosio had come into the restaurant and walked up to him; he reached for the gun, and Ambrosio said something to the effect, \u201cYou better draw faster than that\u201d and then lunged at him. Defendant heard the gun go off but didn\u2019t know how or why it went off. After meeting with the Halperns, Pena met with his family. He surrendered to police shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">At trial, numerous witnesses testified to having seen Pena carrying a gun prior to February 24; all testified that Pena had explained he was carrying the gun due to fear and concern for his safety. Danielo Perez testified that Ambrosio was \u201ca mean fighter.\u201d Juvenal Castro told of several occasions on which he had observed Ambrosio fighting; he recalled one incident when \u201csomebody stepped on his foot and he just turned around and knocked the guy out.\u201d On another occasion, Castro saw Ambrosio grab \u201ca glass that was sitting on the table and just hit the guy in the face with the glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Defendant\u2019s first trial ended on October 29, 1979; a mistrial was declared as the jury was <em>unable to reach a </em>unanimous decision. Eleven jurors voted not guilty; one voted guilty. The case was dismissed on December 18, 1979, on the grounds that defendant had once been in jeopardy. On March 3, 1981, however, the Second Appellate District Court of Appeal reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>dismissal and remanded the case for a new trial. The California Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On October 16, 1981, the jury at defendant\u2019s second trial found defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192, subdivision 1. The jury also found defendant had used a firearm within the meaning of Penal Code sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1). The jury was polled; after each juror indicated the announced verdict was his or her verdict, the jury was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel expressed concern about juror misconduct. An investigation into the matter commenced; a hearing was held January 20, 1982. The court found allegations of juror misconduct true and declared a mistrial on the grounds the verdict had not been unanimous and a verdict, therefore, had not been rendered. After denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, however, the court specifically held that defendant could be retried for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">On February 10, 1982, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s plea of once in jeopardy to the crime of murder in the first and second degree. On March 15, 1982, the Second Appellate District Court of Appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate and prohibition directing the trial court to accept defendant\u2019s plea of once in jeopardy tendered on February 10, 1982, and prohibiting defendant\u2019s further trial for murder either in the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">On March 19, 1982, the trial court vacated its previous order which had rejected defendant\u2019s plea of once in jeopardy and accepted defendant\u2019s plea to once in jeopardy for the crimes of murder in the first and second degree. After the court denied defendant\u2019s renewed motion for new trial, it vacated its order of January 20, 1982, granting a mistrial and reinstated the jury verdict finding defendant guilty of the crime of voluntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192, subdivision 1, as well as the use allegation within the meaning of Penal Code sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Defendant\u2019s petition for alternative writ of prohibition/mandate, filed with the Court of Appeal April 2, 1982, was denied on April 8, 1982. The appellate court noted, \u201cOn recording of verdict, no mistrial could be granted.\u201d A similar petition was denied by the California Supreme Court on April 19, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Defendant\u2019s renewed motion for new trial was denied by the trial court on May 20, 1982. Defendant was sentenced to the term imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\n<em>On Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Defendant contends the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury that his actions may have been justified by threats made against him by the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Defendant also contends the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy precludes renewed prosecution on charges of either murder I or II.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Defendant asserts the trial court abused its discretion by refusing his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Finally, defendant avers determinations made by the trial court with respect to the introduction of certain evidence were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">\n<em>On Habeas Corpus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">Defendant contends he was denied a fair trial by virtue of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b324-18\">Defendant characterizes the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury, on the effect of his knowledge of threats made against him by the deceased, as reversible error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-19\">A jury is entitled to instructions pertaining to the particular facts of the case being tried. <em>(Borenkraut </em>v. <em>Whitten </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 538, 545 [15 Cal.Rptr. 635, 364 P.2d 467].) Defendant\u2019s fate, therefore, should not rest</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>on abstract generalizations. <em>(Self </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 1, 10 [116 Cal.Rptr. 575].)  Rather, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction regardless of how remote or incredible the theory if \u201c \u2018evidence deserving of any consideration whatsoever\u2019 \u201d existed in support thereof. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sam </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 194, 211 [77 Cal.Rptr. 804, 454 P.2d 700], quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 768, 773 [228 P.2d 281].)  The adequacy of instructions given, therefore, will be determined from our examination of the entire charge of the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 974, 979 [110 Cal.Rptr. 448].)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Several cases have addressed the necessity to proffer an instruction virtually identical to that requested by defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bush </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 294, 304 [148 Cal.Rptr. 430]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 517 [275 P.2d 485]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradfield </em>(1916) 30 Cal.App. 721 [159 P. 443].) From them it is apparent that an instruction on the effect of antecedent threats known by a defendant is required where evidence establishes both threats of death or great bodily harm made by the deceased against the defendant and the defendant\u2019s belief and reliance thereon as influencing or justifying his actions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bush, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 294, 304; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 146 [210 P.2d 324]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradfield, supra, </em>30 Cal.App. 721.)  Whether defendant has personally perceived threats or has been informed of threats by others is irrelevant so long as his belief in the danger represented by those threats is both reasonable and honest. The jury should be so instructed where evidence reasonably supports two interpretations, i.e., that defendant was either the aggressor or the victim of fear induced by the deceased\u2019s threats or actions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d 517.) The error is presumed prejudicial, requiring reversal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bush, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 294; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The fact that the jury was instructed with respect to the propriety of concluding defendant\u2019s actions were justified by his perception of imminent danger or great bodily harm is insufficient to mitigate the omission. Absent instruction with respect to the effect of prior threats, jurors could believe they were precluded from considering the effect of prior threats on defendant\u2019s perception of his <em>immediate </em>danger. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bush, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 294; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Although prosecuted for murder, defendant sought to excuse and justify his action by his belief that self-defense was necessary.  Inasmuch as defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, we can assume the jury viewed his belief as <em>unreasonable, </em>for \u201c[a]n honest but <em>unreasonable </em>belief that it is necessary to defend oneself from imminent peril to life or great bodily injury negates malice aforethought, the mental element necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>murder, so that the chargeable offense is reduced to manslaughter. \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1980) 25 Cal.3d 668, 674 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1], emphasis added.)  Had the jury concluded defendant\u2019s belief was both honest and reasonable, it would have excused defendant\u2019s actions and rendered a verdict of not guilty. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 675; <em>People </em>v. <em>Best </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 606, 610 [57 P.2d 168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The <em>reasonableness </em>of defendant\u2019s belief, however, is precisely the issue addressed by defendant\u2019s proffered instruction.  The jury must take defendant\u2019s knowledge of uncontradicted antecedent threats into consideration in its determination of whether \u201c \u2018defendant acted in a manner [in] which <em>a reasonable person </em>would act in protecting his own life or bodily safety.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, 43 </em>Cal.2d 517, 528, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 146, 151-153; italics original.)  Absent a clear instruction to consider defendant\u2019s knowledge of the uncontradicted antecedent threats made by Ambrosio to him and to others about him, we cannot be sure jurors did not construe instructions which were proffered as narrowing the scope of facts and circumstances which they were entitled to consider to only those perceived by any other \u201creasonable man\u201d approached by Ambrosio while sitting in the bar at the Mexican Village restaurant. Suffice it to say, that other \u201creasonable man\u201d would view Ambrosio simply as another patron; Ambrosio\u2019s entrance and approach would lack the import perceived by one aware of antecedent threats. A defendant\u2019s knowledge of uncontradicted antecedent threats must, therefore, be taken into consideration in the determination of the reasonableness of a belief in the necessity of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The record of the instant case includes adequate uncontradicted facts from which the jury could conclude defendant had been the aggressor; the same facts, however, support a finding that defendant\u2019s actions had been induced by threats made against him by the deceased. Defendant had seen the decedent inflict a vicious beating on two young girls; he knew from personal observation that decedent regularly carried a gun. Pena was aware Ambrosio had been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and had committed numerous armed robberies. In addition, Ambrosio had told Pena he had killed someone while out joy riding and, on another occasion, had beat up two men and sent them to the hospital. Pena had particular cause to be concerned with Ambrosio\u2019s precipitate, anger, for Ambrosio had told him that \u201che had almost killed a black man\u201d simply for speaking with a white woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Moreover, Pena heard Ambrosio make the following threats against him: \u201cDon\u2019t come down. I am going to go out and look for you. Be sure to look behind every time you turn around,\u201d and \u201cTell the------------I am ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>for him. I am waiting for him.\u201d In view of defendant\u2019s knowledge of Ambrosio\u2019s character and activities, having received such threats, defendant might well have feared death or great bodily injury regardless of the fact that neither was expressly threatened. Such belief would be reasonable in view of the fact defendant knew decedent was a karate expert who was <em>5\u00bd </em>inches taller and approximately 80 pounds heavier than he.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In view of the above, it appears defendant was entitled to an instruction directing jurors to consider the effect of Ambrosio\u2019s threats, i.e., whether defendant\u2019s knowledge of those threats justified quicker and, perhaps, harsher action than would be expected from a person who had not received similar threats.  The People would limit those occasions necessitating the jury\u2019s instruction with respect to the effect of threats to those instances wherein the defendant was subject to prior physical violence at the hands of the victim. We find such restriction without precedent. To the contrary, analysis of <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradfield, supra, </em>30 Cal.App. 721, decided by this district in 1916, reveals the instruction is necessary despite the absence of prior physical altercation. The defendant, in <em>Bradfield, </em>managed a corporation which repeatedly made use of a road located on property allegedly owned by the victim, Henley. On one occasion, three years prior to the day he was shot, Henley personally advised defendant that he objected to defendant\u2019s or the corporation\u2019s use of the road without payment for the privilege; Henley was threatening and abusive. During the interchange, Mrs. Henley stood by a building leveling a double barreled shotgun in defendant\u2019s direction. The <em>Bradfield </em>court characterized the incident as a \u201cwordy encounter\u201d and specifically noted Henley had \u201cmade no attack upon Bradfield and showed no weapons.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 723.) Aside from reporting this meeting, the court recounted no face-to-face meeting between the parties in the intervening years. Thus, case authority directly contradicts the People\u2019s theory, for the incident in <em>Bradfield </em>can hardly be characterized as an instance wherein the defendant was subjected to physical violence at the hands of the victim. Despite the absence of such violence, the <em>Bradfield </em>court upheld the necessity for the jury instruction concerning the effect of threats of harm on the defendant\u2019s actions. It is apparent, therefore, that the necessity for the instruction arises even in the absence of a prior altercation involving physical interaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The People assert the omitted jury instruction was harmless error, if error at all, inasmuch as the jury\u2019s verdict indicated its finding of a specific intent to kill. Such reasoning is circuitous and specious for two reasons. First, a finding of specific intent to kill could result from focusing on defendant\u2019s actions without consideration of his knowledge of prior threats; had the jury been properly instructed, a different finding might have been reached. Second, absent the proffered instruction, the jury might not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>taken into consideration the full scope of facts and circumstances rightfully considered in a determination of whether an intent to kill was justifiable or excusable. Thus, assuming it did find an intent to kill, the jury was precluded from determining whether the act flowing from that intent was justifiable or excusable. The omission is, as we noted <em>ante, </em>reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bush, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 294; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Defendant argues the constitutional protection against double jeopardy precludes his further prosecution on charges of either murder I or II. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Article I, section 15 of the California Constitution provides in pertinent part, \u201cPersons may not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense, . . .\u201d At his second trial, defendant was tried for murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter. That conviction is reversed by virtue of the decision announced today. Reversal, however, does not entitle the People to another opportunity to prosecute defendant on charges of murder I or II, for a defendant who obtains reversal of a conviction of a lesser included offense may not be tried again for the greater offense; although a verdict may not have been expressly reached on the greater offense, an acquittal is entered by implication. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 184 [2 L.Ed.2d 199, 78 S.Ct. 221, 61 A.L.R.2d 1119]; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 518 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809].)  Both federal and California courts have long held a criminal defendant may not be retried for an offense following an acquittal. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(1896) 163 U.S. 662, 671 [41 L.Ed. 300, 303, 16 S.Ct. 1192]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1869) 38 Cal. 467, 479-480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">In the event this court had disagreed with defendant\u2019s initial contention addressing the omitted jury instruction, defendant proffered the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion for new trial as additional prejudicial error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Generally, the decision to deny a motion for new trial is within the trial court\u2019s discretion; however, that decision may be disturbed on review upon a clear showing that the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marchialette </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 974 [119 Cal.Rptr. 816]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bryan </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 327 [83 Cal.Rptr. 291].)  The facts of this case establish such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On October 16, 1981, the jury\u2019s verdict was recorded. On January 20, 1982, the court made specific findings of juror misconduct and declared a mistrial. In early March, the Court of Appeal directed the trial court to accept defendant\u2019s plea of once in jeopardy to murder I and II. The trial court did accept defendant\u2019s plea on March 19; however, after vacating its order of January 20, granting a mistrial, the court reinstated defendant\u2019s conviction for voluntary manslaughter despite the earlier findings of juror misconduct. Defendant petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of prohibition. On April 8, in its denial of that writ, the reviewing court noted, \u201cOn recording of verdict, no mistrial could be granted.\u201d Again, defendant sought a new trial; his renewed motion was denied on May 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The above course of events provides ample evidence of procedural error. The verdict was \u201ccomplete\u201d on October 16, 1981, after the jury had been polled and its verdict entered in the minutes (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1164); the jury\u2019s function had ceased, and the trial was closed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lee Yune Chong </em>(1892) 94 Cal. 379 [29 P. 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peavey </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 44, 49 [178 Cal.Rptr. 520].) The court was no longer entitled to exert any control over the verdict. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As the Court of Appeal noted on April 8, the court was not entitled to declare a mistrial. The proper remedy for a verdict resulting from juror misconduct is the grant of a new trial.  Penal Code section 1181 provides in pertinent part, \u201cWhen a verdict has been rendered or a finding made against the defendant, the court may, upon his application, grant a new trial . . . when the jury has . . . been guilty of any misconduct by which a fair and due consideration of the case has been prevented. ...\u201d  Thus, it is apparent that the trial court erroneously denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, for there is absolutely no evidence on the record to rebut the presumption of prejudice raised by juror misconduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adame </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 402, 405 [111 Cal.Rptr. 462].) Absent such evidence, defendant was entitled to a new trial. As we have noted in our discussion <em>ante, </em>consideration of defendant\u2019s culpability at that new trial would not include the consideration of guilt on charges of either murder I or II.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Finally, defendant characterizes various evidentiary rulings as abuses of the court\u2019s discretion. We disagree. Although we have concluded reversal is mandated by the court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury, we explain the rationale for our conclusions on the evidentiary issues lest they arise within the context of future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Evidence Code section 352 provides that the \u201ccourt in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the probability that its admission will. . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice . . . .\u201d On appeal, reversal is not warranted simply by a state of facts affording an opportunity for reasonable minds to differ on whether proffered evidence is more probative than prejudicial or whether the converse is true. Rather, relief is unwarranted absent a finding that the injury is of such gravity as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>(Ford </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 507 [172 Cal.Rptr. 162]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Newby </em>(1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 615, 618 [103 P.2d 1018].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Clearly, the court\u2019s decision to permit the district attorney to ask defendant whether he was an ambulance chaser does not fall within that category of decisions susceptible to characterization as a manifest miscarriage of justice. A careful reading of the facts reveals the great extent to which testimony from both Jesse and Russell Halpern was relied upon to establish defendant\u2019s state of mind. The extent of witnesses\u2019 bias in defendant\u2019s favor was relevant to the determination of the amount of weight to be afforded their testimony. Evidence that the Halperns had a vested interest in defendant\u2019s continued employment with their firm could well bear on that determination. Thus, evidence that defendant was in the practice of procuring personal injury clients for the Halperns was relevant to show the extent to which the Halperns\u2019 firm might have suffered in defendant\u2019s absence and, as a result, the extent to which their testimony might have been biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Defendant also directs our attention to three instances in which the court refused to permit the introduction of certain testimony, not one of which, in our opinion, amounts to an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. For example, the court ruled inadmissible evidence that Juan Echevarria had felt justified on one occasion in holding the decedent at bay with a gun. Despite defendant\u2019s assertion that the reasonableness of Echevarria\u2019s action lent credence to the reasonableness of his own action, the court was entitled to view the prejudicial impact of the proffered testimony as far outweighing its relevance, for the reasonableness of Echevarria\u2019s action sheds no light on the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s actions absent any indication either that conditions surrounding the two events were similar or that defendant knew of the former incident and was certain that Echevarria\u2019s action was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In another incident, the court refused to permit Russell Halpern, a lawyer, to testify either to the nature of his representation of the decedent in 1977 or to any communications with Ambrosio during the course of their lawyer-client relationship. The court based its decision on the fact that the decedent\u2019s father, Francisco Ambrosio, Sr., the duly qualified representative of decedent\u2019s estate, asserted tile lawyer-client privilege.  According to Evidence Code section \u25a0'954, the holder of the privilege may \u201crefuse to disclose ... a confidential communication between client and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>lawyer . . . .\u2019\u2019By statute, the personal representative of a deceased client is a \u201cholder of the privilege.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 953, subd. (c).) Ambrosio, Sr., was therefore clearly entitled to assert the lawyer-client privilege.  California courts have long recognized exercise of the attorney-client privilege may result in decisions which appear unjust; despite the inherent risk, however, the courts have respected the necessity of protecting the privilege. <em>(City &amp; County of S. F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 227, 235 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 559, 563 [139 Cal.Rptr. 546].)  On the facts of this case, the \u201csacred\u201d privilege of confidential communication between client and attorney was properly preserved. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 565.) We cannot agree the privilege should have been dissolved simply to divulge that in 1977 decedent had informed his attorney he had been charged with assault with a deadly weapon; even in the absence of the attorney-client privilege, the court\u2019s refusal was warranted by the fact that the proffered testimony was minimally relevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Defendant also asserts the court erroneously refused to permit Ambrosio, Sr., to testify to the fact his son said that he (decedent) had told defendant \u201cIf you want the money that way, you better get a gun and come and get it.\u201d The court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous, for the relevance of the proffered testimony is unclear. The statement does little more than establish the extent of decedent\u2019s unwillingness to voluntarily pay the bail forfeitures. It contains neither threat nor indication of hostility flowing from decedent to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Similarly, we cannot agree with defendant\u2019s final assertion. The trial court did not erroneously refuse to allow introduction of evidence decedent had a juvenile record for possession of a Molotov cocktail. Again, the prejudicial nature of this fact weighs strongly against its probative value, for such evidence sheds little light on inquiries relevant to a determination of defendant\u2019s culpability, i.e., the nature of decedent\u2019s attitude toward defendant or defendant\u2019s perception of decedent\u2019s attitude toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for retrial. The trial court is directed to release defendant on reasonable bail. The habeas corpus petition is denied; the issue of juror misconduct raised therein is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Lillie, J., and Gutierrez, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 1, 1984, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 2, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
