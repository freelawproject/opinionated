In a companion appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Division Two of this court concluded plaintiffs did succeed in stating causes of action against codefendant homeowner\u2019s association, Kite Hill Commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>nity Association (Association), for negligence, breach of covenants, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. For the reasons set forth below, we concur and accordingly reverse the judgment of dismissal as to S &amp; S and Cupito.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The issues in the companion appeal were the nature and extent of Association\u2019s duty to enforce the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (Declaration) against plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors, the Ehles and Lees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who have allegedly installed fences and landscaping which destroy plaintiffs\u2019 premium view, and the Association\u2019s potential liability for breach of that duty. These issues are also presented here in the context of whether the developer owed similar duties to plaintiffs. A second issue is whether statements by S &amp; S sales agent Cupito concerning plaintiffs\u2019 protected view are actionable as fraud and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> The facts are set forth in Division Two\u2019s published opinion; we do not reiterate them, except to note the following.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Premiums were charged for view lots in the Kite Hill Development. Plaintiffs were induced to pay a $35,000 lot premium based on Cupito\u2019s assurances the Declaration protected the view from their lot and the architectural committee would not approve fence or landscaping plans which would interfere with the view. At all pertinent times in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, S &amp; S controlled the Association\u2019s board of directors, as provided by the Declaration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Declaration provides a procedure for establishing an architectural committee to review all fence and landscape proposals,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but it was not observed. An S &amp; S employee assumed responsibility for review and approval of these proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The court in the companion appeal found an affirmative fiduciary duty to act in good faith in enforcing the Declaration on the part of the Association. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>It also concluded the purported exculpatory clauses do not immunize the Association from plaintiffs\u2019 suit. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Kite Hill Community Assn., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 642, 654-655.) We agree and in addition conclude the Declaration\u2019s exculpatory clauses do not immunize S &amp; S from liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">S &amp; S not only authored the Declaration, it also assumed responsibility for its enforcement and administration, e.g., by controlling both the Association\u2019s board of directors and procedures for approval of submitted landscape and fence plans. It is of no moment that the Association, a nonprofit corporation, is a separate legal entity. The Declaration provides for monitoring of many of the Kite Hill homeowners\u2019 activities. Initially this task is performed by the developer, its agents and employees. The homeowners are particularly vulnerable therefore to mismanagement or carelessness by the developer. Under these circumstances, as a matter of public policy, the exculpatory language in the Declaration does not foreclose the liability of S &amp; S to plaintiffs. <em>(Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 92 [32 Cal.Rptr. 33, 383 P.2d 441, 6 A.L.R.3d 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The immunity issue resolved, we proceed to consider the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against S &amp; S. Plaintiffs seek damages for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, all based on the developer\u2019s alleged failure to properly administer and enforce the Declaration. Division Two has already determined these allegations are sufficient as against the Association; and we find them adequate against S &amp; S as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">A developer\u2019s liability to a homeowner\u2019s association for breach of the basic fiduciary duty to act in good faith, exercise proper management, and avoid conflicts of interest is well settled. <em>(Raven\u2019s Cove Townhomes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kruppe Development Co. </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 783 [171 Cal.Rptr. 334].) This fiduciary duty extends to individual homeowners, not just the homeowner\u2019s association. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Kite Hill Community Assn., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 642, 652-653.) Efforts by S &amp; S to distinguish <em>Raven\u2019s Cove, supra, </em>are unavailing. As the court there noted, \u201ca developer . . . may not make decisions for the Association that benefit [its] own interest at the expense of the association and its members. . . .\u201d (114 Cal.App.3d atp. 799.) When the developer and its employees control the association, and the association thus controlled permits mismanagement, the developer may be liable. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 800.) Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against S &amp; S in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>the eighth, ninth and tenth causes are sufficient, and the demurrer was improperly sustained. <em>(Cohen, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In the sixth and seventh causes of action, plaintiffs seek damages from S &amp; S and sales agent Cupito, for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Defendants argue Cupito\u2019s statements were true and, in any event, nonactionable opinion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Generally, actionable misrepresentation must be one of existing fact; \u201cpredictions as to future events, or statements as to future action by some third party, are deemed opinions, and not actionable fraud. . . .\u201d (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 447, p. 2712.) But there are exceptions to this rule: \u201c(1) where a party holds himself out to be specially qualified and the other party is so situated that he may reasonably rely upon the former\u2019s superior knowledge; (2) where the opinion is by a fiduciary or other trusted person; [and] (3) where a party states his opinion as an existing fact or as implying facts which justify a belief in the truth of the opinion.\u201d <em>(Borba </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 144, 152 [138 Cal.Rptr. 565].) Examples of actionable statements under these exceptions include a sales agent\u2019s representation that a condominium with structural defects was nevertheless luxurious and an outstanding investment <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Jevne </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 860, 866 [128 Cal.Rptr. 724]) and a realtor\u2019s opinion that the purchaser of a particular lot would have an enforceable access easement. (So<em>uthern Cal. etc. Assemblies of God </em>v. <em>Shepherd of Hills etc. Church </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 951, 959 [144 Cal.Rptr. 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to meet the requisites of each exception. Plaintiffs allege S &amp; S emphasized the development\u2019s panoramic views in its marketing and held themselves out as experts in establishing and administering homeowner associations and maintaining the aesthetic integrity of their developments.  Moreover, a sales agent for the seller who knows facts \u201cmaterially affecting the value or the desirability of property offered for sale and these facts are known or accessible only to him and his principal, and [who] also knows that these facts are not known to or within the reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer, the broker or agent is under a duty to disclose these facts.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Jevne, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d 860, 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">At this stage we cannot determine whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on these allegations, but they have alleged adequate facts to state causes of action against S &amp; S and Cupito for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Drug, Inc. </em>(1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 697 [88 P.2d 929].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Judgment reversed.
