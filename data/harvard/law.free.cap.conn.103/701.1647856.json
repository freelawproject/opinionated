J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1O0\">The various grounds of appeal resolve themselves into three. The first arises out of the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion that the finding embody (1) the fact of the death of the defendant company\u2019s employee, Biederzycki, and the name, residence, and age of his widow, and the names and ages of the minor children; (2) the date of the accident, the habits of the employee, and the period of time he worked after October 31st, 1923, when the finding of June 19th, 1923, recites he collapsed, and the physical condition of the employee at this time; or that a hearing <em>de novo </em>upon these issues be accorded. Defendants\u2019 motion rests upon their claim that the case of the widow is separate and distinct from that of her husband, the employee of defendant Farrel Company, and therefore they are entitled at their \u2018option to retry <em>de novo, </em>in whole or in part, the facts as found in the case of the employee. Defendants\u2019 purpose is to retry the issues of fact determined in the finding made in the case of the employee, in order to prove that the conclusion there reached, that deceased received a compensable injury, was erroneous. The commissioner\u2019s power to modify or reopen an award is governed by General Statutes, \u00a7 5355, that, any award or voluntary agreement for compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act shall be subject to modification, upon the request of either party, \u201cwhenever it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>appear to the compensation commissioner that the incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or that the measure of dependence, on account of which the compensation is paid, has changed, or that changed conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of such agreement or award in order properly to carry out the spirit of this chapter. The commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the State has to open and modify a judgment of such court.\u201d Our construction of this statute in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 123 Atl. 9, determines the point now raised by the defendants adversely to them. The defendants in that case moved to reopen the award for the reason that, although defendants had voluntarily agreed to pay compensation to the claimants, nevertheless they had discovered, more than a year after making the agreement, that the plaintiffs were not employees of the defendant manufacturing company but were employees of an independent contractor. Defendants ignore the effect of this? decision, and read <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Berlin Construction Co., </em>93 Conn. 155, 105 Atl. 326, as holding that the claim of the deceased employee and the claim of his dependent are separate and distinct, and as a consequence the dependent,must be required to prove her claim without reference to the facts found in an adjudication of the employee\u2019s claim. The opinion does not countenance this claim. It holds that the classes of compensation awarded the employee and his dependents are separate and independent of each other. But each arises out of the same compensable injury. If the employee is awarded compensation for an injury, and in consequence of it, subsequently dies, the injury preceding the death and the death arose out of the one injury, compensation for the latter is payable to and belongs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>to the dependent, while the compensation awarded to the living employee is payable to and belongs to him. Upon the death of the employee within the two-year statutory period, the dependent is entitled to compensation under the statute. The facts found in the finding and award in favor of the employee, must be accepted as facts finally found in the claim for compensation by the dependent on account of the death of the employee. All that the dependent must prove are, the employee\u2019s death, the dependence, and the causal connection between the injury for which the employee was awarded, or was entitled to have been awarded, compensation, and the death. No consideration advanced by the defendants in this case has made it necessary to modify or restate the construction placed upon General Statutes, \u00a7 5355, in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The second ground of appeal is the alleged error of the commissioner in refusing to apportion the claim of the widow on account of the death of her husband in accordance with the provision of General Statutes, \u00a7 5341, as amended by the Public Acts of 1919, Chapter 142, \u00a7 1, as amended by the Public Acts of 1921, Chapter 306, \u00a7 1, which reads as follows: \u201cIn any case of aggravation of a disease existing prior to such injury, compensation shall be allowed only for such proportion of the disability due to the aggravation of such prior disease as may reasonably be attributed to the injury.\u201d Defendants argue that as the compensation for this employee\u2019s incapacity resulting from the injury was by this statute apportioned, it is inequitable not to apportion in the same manner the compensation as to the beneficiary on account of the death of the employee in the same manner. And further, that this and other sections of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act make it reasonably clear that when this amendment to \u00a7 5341 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>provides that in case of aggravation of a disease existing prior to the injury, compensation shall be apportioned for such proportion of the disability as may reasonably be attributed to the injury, it used the word disability as applicable to the incapacity prior to the death, as well as to the death resulting from the injury. We are unable to agree in this construction. The true construction seems to us so plain that we do not purpose a comprehensive analysis of the terms of this Act in order to meet this argument. When the amendment uses the term disability, it manifestly uses it in the sense of incapacity, a use which prevails through the Act. If we are right in this, it would follow that the amendment we quote refers to the living, and not to the case of death. Neither in this section nor in the entire Act is disability used in the sense of death. And everywhere the Act uses incapacity, total or partial, in the sense of disability. This section makes the distinction when it provides, \u201cthe employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from injury so sustained.\u201d Construction was placed by the commissioner of the second district, in 1921, upon the use of the word incapacity as synonymous with disability, and the Superior Court sustained the holding. This construction has been accepted and followed until this case arose. Death is a fixed fact which cannot be apportioned in the manner provided in the amendment to this section of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The point which the defendants argue last underlies each of the other procedural points which they present, and, if sound, would make unnecessary their determination, for it would demonstrate that there had been no compensable injury suffered by this em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ployee. The contention is that the principle announced in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>90 Conn. 349, 97 Atl. 345, and in <em>Linnane </em>v. <em>Aetna Brewing Co., </em>91 Conn. 158, 99 Atl. 507 \u2014 that \u201cpersonal injury within the meaning of the Act involves both an accident and a bodily injury, as distinguished from a disease\u201d and a \u201cbodily injury ... is always assignable to some definite part or organ of the body, and when caused by accident is always sustained at the time of the accident or at least during the time within which the accidental condition is operative\u201d \u2014 was only made ineffective by the amendment of 1919 to this section of the statute as to occupational diseases, and still remains effective as to nonoccupational diseases. We decided in <em>Dupre </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co., </em>98 Conn. 646, 120 Atl. 288, that this amendment applied to all forms of disease, whether occupational or otherwise. In <em>De la Pena </em>v. <em>Jackson Stone Co., </em>103 Conn. 93, 130 Atl. 89, wo affirmed this ruling of the <em>Dupre </em>case and held that the amendment of the Public Acts of 1921, Chapter 306, \u00a7 11, of the amendment of \u00a7 1 of Chapter 142 of the Public Acts of 1919 to General Statutes, \u00a7 5341, includes as compensable all disease, occupational or otherwise, subject to the limitation of \u00a7 11 of Chapter 306, that if the disease is an occupational one and is of a contagious, communicable or mental nature, it is not compensable. \u201cCombining our definition and description,\u201d we said in the <em>De la Pena </em>case, at page 99, \u201cof a personal injury as given in the <em>Dupre </em>case with this provision of \u00a7 11, we have the following result: a compensable personal injury is an abnormal condition of a living body which arises out of and in the course of the employment and produces an incapacity to work for the requisite statutory period. It need not be traced to a definite happening or event. It may be caused by accident or disease, and includes diseases peculiar to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>occupation except those of a \u2018contagious, communicable or mental nature.\u2019 The happening or event includes the entire transaction to which the injury is traced, not only the operative causes but their effect on the body of the injured person.\u201d The point now urged was finally settle i in the <em>Dupre </em>and <em>De 7a Pena </em>cases, and these decisions must control while the present statute remains unchanged. None of the grounds of appeal are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Before closing this opinion, we call attention to the bad practice of including as a part of the memorandum of decision of the commissioner some thirty pages of testimony evidencing the discussion of counsel of one of the points in issue and the ruling of the commissioner thereon. The claims of counsel and the ruling made should have been shortly stated in the finding. It is the duty of counsel to keep matters of this objectionable nature out of the record, and the duty of the trial court to refuse to certify a record with it in, and to direct the clerk of the court to refuse to print it. The unnecessary printing makes it imperative that these directions be strictly observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The Superior Court is advised to enter judgment dismissing the appeal from the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
