The portion of this statute reading \u201cat the time of making such deed or will\u201d has been construed to be equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>these words, \u201cat the time of the delivery of such deed or death of the testator.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>65 Conn. 492, 499, 500, 33 Atl. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>60 Conn. 498, 512, 21 Atl. 1075, we say: \u201cBy the decisions of this court, also', it hag been determined that the provisions of the statute apply ... to all gifts made by will, whether the property attempted to be given be real estate or personal property, or both together.\u201d We have repeatedly held that a gift or devise or bequest which may by possibility offend against the statute is void and of no effect. <em>Tingier </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>71 Conn. 466, 469, 72 Atl. 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">From the terms of the statute, if we construe the word issue in clause nine, which reads in part, \u201cin the event of her [Mary Ann\u2019s] death, no issue surviving, said property shall be divided equally among her brothers and sisters and their issue per stirpes\u201d (except the issue of two of his deceased children), as meaning \u201cdescendants in every degree,\u201d the gift over would be invalid as contravening the statute against perpetuities. If we construe the word issue in clause nine as meaning children, the gift over would be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We are therefore confronted with the question as to what construction is to be placed on the word issue in clause nine. There are general rules as to the construction of wills to be kept in mind, as: \u201cThe intention of the testator is to govern if it can be ascertained, and is conformable to law; and of course it is the intention expressed and made manifest in the words used; which words may, if necessary, be read in the light of facts and circumstances relating to the condition of the testator\u2019s family, and the like, under which they were written\u201d; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>65 Conn. 492, 495, 33 Atl. 503; and \u201cone of the fundamental rules in the construction of wills is that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>testator is always presumed to use the words in which he expresses himself according to their strict and primary acceptation, unless from the context of the will it appears that he has used them in a different sense.\u201d <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>60 Conn. 498, 508, 21 Atl. 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The strict primary acceptation of the word \u201cissue\u201d has been defined by us, when used as a word of purchase, to include descendants of every degree. <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>89 Conn. 270, 93 Atl. 535. In that case, p. 277, we said: \u201cThis, however, is not its invariable meaning, and in the interpretation of wills a more restrained one, making it synonymous with 'children/ will be given to it where it appears that the testator so used it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The defendants claim that it appears clearly in this case that the testator used the word issue as equivalent to children in clauses nine and fifteen, and that an inspection of the context of the will discloses this. As to the rule of construction to be followed in the study of the context of a will, we quote from the same case: \u201c 'If two modes of construction are fairly open, one of which will turn a bequest into an illegal perpetuity, while by following the other it would be valid and operative, the latter mode must be preferred.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 185, 70 Atl. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The term issue is used three times in clause nine of the will. It occurs first in the clause which reads: \u201cAt the death of my daughter Mary Ann Lockwood, said property shall be by my executors divided per capita among her lawful children; and in the event of her death, no issue her surviving, said property shall be divided . . It is apparent that in this excerpt the testator uses issue as the equivalent of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The second use of the term issue in clause nine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in the provision disposing of the property in case Mary Ann died without children surviving her. The provision is: \u201cSaid property shall be divided equally among her brothers and sisters and their issue per stirpes.\u201d The term issue is not here definitely characterized and it is necessary to ascertain the meaning of issue by ascertaining how it is used elsewhere in the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The third use of issue in clause nine occurs in the same sentence when he excepts \u201cthe issue of my deceased son Edward and my deceased daughter Julia Baldwin, otherwise provided for in this will.\u201d We turn to the clause in the will providing for the issue of his deceased son Edward to ascertain whom he had in mind in using the word issue. This provision is in clause eight, which is as follows: \u201cEighth. I give and devise to Annie Philips the widow of my deceased son Edward Philips, and to their four youngest children, to wit: Eveline Theresa Philips, Ada It. Philips, Edward Philips and Eugene H. Philips, the house and lot situated and known as Number 137 (One hundred and thirty-seven) Allen Street in the City of New York until the said Eugene H. Philips shall attain the age of Twenty-five years or happen to die, and upon his attaining that age or death, whichever of those events shall first happen, I give and devise said house and lot to them, their heirs and assigns forever, and I give and bequeath to the said Annie Philips the sum of Two thousand Dollars and I give and bequeath to the said Eveline Theresa Philips, Ada A. Philips, Edward Philips and Eugene H. Philips the sum of Three hundred Dollars each, and I release and discharge the said Annie Philips and her children from the payment of the amounts charged against her and them in said book of private accounts at page 61.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Prom this clause it appears that the term issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>clause nine when used to refer to the \u201cissue of my deceased son Edward . . . otherwise provided for in this will,\u201d was used as the equivalent of the children of Edward specifically mentioned in clause eight in this will, where they were provided for, and the same is true as to the word issue in relation to his deceased child Julia as appears in clause five of the will, where her \u201cchildren\u201d are provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">These uses of the word issue as equivalent to children in clause nine indicate that the term issue in clause nine was used as the equivalent of children, because \u201cif two modes of construction are fairly open, one of which will turn a bequest into an illegal perpetuity, while by following the other it would be valid and operative, the latter mode <em>must be preferred.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The foregoing examination of the context in order to gather the use made of the term issue in clause nine, demonstrates that it was used as the equivalent of children and therefore the provisions of clauses nine and fifteen are not repugnant to the statute against perpetuities in force at the time of the testator\u2019s death, and it is not necessary to pursue the claim made by the defendants as to the construction of the clauses in question in case we should hold that issue was not used as the equivalent of children in clause nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Under the clauses in question with the word issue construed as the equivalent of children, we may read clause nine as if it read, \u201cAt the death of my daughter Mary Ann Lockwood said property shall be by my executors divided per capita among her lawful children and in the event of her death no issue her surviving, said property shall be divided equally among her brothers and sisters and their children per stirpes except\u201d the children of two deceased children of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The defendants in their brief summarize their claims . in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">1. That the word issue wherever used in paragraph nine of the will means children.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">2. That the provisions of the will for gifts over upon the death of Mary Ann Lockwood, leaving no children surviving her, were valid and not against the statute of perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">3. That the trust fund created by paragraph nine, so far as it concerns personal property, should be distributed to the brothers and sisters of Mary Ann Lockwood (except that two shall taire nothing), provided that if any of said brothers and sisters to whom said bequests inured died before the death of the life tenant, their respective shares should go to their personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">We think that these claims are valid. When the testator executed the will he had six children' living and two children had already predeceased him, to wit: Edward and Julia, as to whose children special provision was made in the will, and they were excepted from the provisions of clause nine. When the testator died the six children still survived him. The question presents itself as to what the testator meant when he said in clause nine \u201csaid property shall be divided equally among her [Mary Ann\u2019s] brothers and sisters and their issue per stirpes.\u201d Does he mean among her brothers and sisters, but if any brother or sister predeceased me, then to his (or her) children <em>per stirpes \u00b6 </em>Or does he mean that, at the testator\u2019s death, brothers and sisters of Mary Ann shall take a vested interest in the nature of a contingent remainder in competition with their own children. This construction is an unnatural and unreasonable one. Furthermore, it is a principle of law that a construction which admits children to compete with their living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>parents is to be avoided, unless such was plainly the testator\u2019s intention. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>229 Mass. 527, 529, 118 N. E. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">This was plainly not the testator\u2019s intent in this case, and hence the construction first suggested is the one intended, to wit: that the division was to be among the brothers and sisters of Mary Ann who survive the testator, and if any of the five predecease him, then to the children <em>per stirpes </em>of such brother or sister of Mary Ann as predeceased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In the instant case the five brothers and sisters of Mary Ann survived the testator and hence each then took a vested interest by way of a contingent remainder; vested, in such a situation, means a remainder so far vested as to be capable of alienation and the subject of succession by inheritance. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>65 Conn. 492, 499, 33 Atl. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">This vested interest in the nature of a contingent remainder would become fully vested when Mary Ann died, no children surviving her, and if any such brother or sister predeceased Mary Ann, his or her right, under- the admitted facts, would become the property of his or her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The questions submitted should be answered as follows : Question one, no; question two, no part of the will is inoperative; question three, yes; question four, no; question five, One fifth part to each of the estates of Susan M. Dimon, George A. <em>F. </em>Philips, Charles S. Philips, Henry C. Philips and Alice P. Lea-man, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
