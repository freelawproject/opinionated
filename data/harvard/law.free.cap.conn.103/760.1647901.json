We directed the Superior Court to return the case to the commissioner for a further finding of the specific facts, as to whether the claimant suffered his injury while engaged in horseplay or in the course of his employment. The commissioner has added to the original finding the specific facts surrounding the claimant\u2019s employment, out of and in the course of which his injury arose. These facts show that the claimant had reason to believe that at boy was in the vicinity of the refrigerator for the purpose of purloining therefrom the defendant\u2019s foodstuffs, and thereupon he, being the manager of the defendant\u2019s hotel, through, a desire to protect her property, and while removing the boy from the vicinity of the refrigerator, fell through an open doorway and suffered the injury for which he claims compensation. These facts fully support the conclusion that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment. The present appeal is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
