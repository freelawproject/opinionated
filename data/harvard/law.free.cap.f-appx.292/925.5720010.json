Lacking jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court dismisses.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b947-20\">Mr. Williams served in active duty from May 1971 to May 1973. In August 1997, he filed an application to reopen his claims for service-connected schizophrenia, heart disease, ulcer disease, and a back disability. The Regional Office (RO) denied this request for lack of any new and material evidence. The RO also denied service connection for bilateral foot and eye disabilities. In April 2001, the RO denied Mr. Williams\u2019 claim for a total disability rating. Mr. Williams appealed these decisions to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-21\">On May 14, 2007, the Board agreed that Mr. Williams had presented no new and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>material evidence showing service connection for heart disease, ulcer disease, and a back disorder. The Board also upheld the RO\u2019s denial of service connection for bilateral foot and eye disabilities. The Board further upheld the RO\u2019s denial of a total disability rating. The Board, however, reopened Mr. Williams\u2019 claim for service connection for schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Mr. Williams filed a Notice of Appeal on September 19, 2007 \u2014 128 days after the mailing of the May 14, 2007 Board decision. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) ordered the appellant to show cause for the delay. On October 15, 2007, the appellant explained that he had not received the Board\u2019s decision until it was mailed to him by the General Counsel\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The Deputy Director of the Management and Administration Service of the Board filed a declaration showing that the Board had mailed the decision to the appellant and his attorney on May 14, 2007. The Board\u2019s computer tracking system verified this declaration. The record did not indicate that the letters had been returned as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Weighing the evidence, the Veterans Court found that the Board\u2019s decision was mailed to both Mr. Williams and his attorney on May 14, 2007. Because a Notice of Appeal must be filed within 120 days after the mailing of a decision, the Veterans Court dismissed Mr. Williams\u2019 appeal as untimely. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266; U.S. Vet. App. R. 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Mr. Williams seeks review of the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal. On appeal, he requests remand for a factual determination regarding the timeliness of his Notice of Appeal. He submits that the Veterans Court did not consider his explanation for the filing delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">This court has limited jui-isdiction to review the decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. As proscribed by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), except for constitutional issues, this court \u201cmay not review any challenge to a factual determination or any challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Nicholson, </em>451 F.3d 1331, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">On appeal, Mr. Williams argues that he did not receive the May 2007 Board decision by mail and that his mail delivery was not dependable. He submits that the Veterans Court did not consider these arguments in its dismissal. Mr. Williams asks this court to remand for a factual determination on timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Contrary to Mr. Williams\u2019 characterization, the Veterans Court considered Mr. Williams\u2019 explanation for the filing delay. The \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d supports official acts of public officers and applies to veterans benefits cases. <em>Butler v. Principi, </em>244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2001). The doctrine presumes that public officers have properly discharged their duties in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Mr. Williams had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the Board\u2019s decision was not mailed on May 14, 2007. The Veterans Court was not persuaded by Mr. Williams\u2019 arguments and dismissed his appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">The Veterans Court\u2019s determination regarding the timeliness of a Notice of Appeal presents a question of fact. <em>Leonard v. Gober, </em>223 F.3d 1374, 1376 (Fed.Cir. 2000). Section 7292(d)(2) expressly bars the review of any challenge to a factual determination or any challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 1376. Because Mr. Williams challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>factual determination regarding the timeliness of his appeal, or in the alternative, seeks remand for reconsideration of that factual determination, this case falls outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">For these reasons, this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">\n<em>COSTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
