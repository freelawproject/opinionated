Nov. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">With regard to Zhou\u2019s religious persecution claim, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that he failed to establish changed circumstances sufficient to excuse his motion from the applicable time and number limits for such motions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). While Zhou argues that the evidence he submitted established changed circumstances in China, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s finding that such evidence was insufficient to carry his burden of proof. In particular, the BIA found that the letter from his mother was insufficient to establish changed circumstances in China with regard to his religious persecution claim, where that claim had previously been denied by the IJ for \u201ca failure of proof.\u201d The BIA opined that Zhou could not \u201cuse a motion to reopen as a second effort to prove factual allegations that could have been made before the immigration judge.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii). Zhou does not meaningfully challenge this finding in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7. Instead, he argues that the 2006 Country Report shows the deterioration of religious freedom in China. However, while that report may indicate that the Chinese government closely monitors religious activity in China and detains house church members, Zhou does not demonstrate how such repressive treatment reflects a change in the government\u2019s policies as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Indeed, the report provides that the government <em>continued </em>its crackdown on unregistered religious groups. Because the report does not provide material support for Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it did not explicitly address it in its evaluation of his religious persecution claim. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir. 2006) (presuming that the agency has taken into account all of the evidence before it, unless the record eompellingly suggests otherwise). Zhou\u2019s reliance on the 2007 Asylum Profile fails for these same reasons. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Zhou had failed to establish that circumstances in China had sufficiently changed with regard to his religious persecution claim to excuse his motion to reopen from the applicable time and number limits. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The petition for review therefore is DENIED with respect to Zhou\u2019s claim of religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">With respect to Zhou\u2019s family planning claim, it is ORDERED that decision on the petition for review is DEFERRED pending the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>No. 07-3415-ag and <em>Ji Wen Shi v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>07-2666-ag, or another prece-dential decision of this Court deciding whether to uphold the BIA\u2019s analysis of the country condition evidence addressed in <em>In re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247 (BIA 2007) and <em>In re J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185 (BIA 2007). Upon the Court\u2019s issuance of such a decision, the Clerk\u2019s Office will issue a new briefing schedule, directing the parties to submit supplemental papers explaining the relevance and impact of the Court\u2019s ruling on the instant case. The supplemental papers will be sent to a new panel of the Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
