The district court sentenced Frank to a term of imprisonment of 235 months for both convictions. Frank is currently in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On appeal, Frank argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion seeking acquittal on the basis of insufficient evidence of intent to cause death or serious bodily injury during the attempted car-jacking; (2) his term of imprisonment is unreasonable because the district court relied on an incorrect psychological report regarding Frank\u2019s mental condition; and that (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because (a) his trial counsel failed to present a mental illness defense, and (b) his sentencing counsel failed to present mitigating evidence of Frank\u2019s mental condition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). The underlying facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">1. We review' a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 Motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence for an abuse of discretion and examine whether \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Riggins, </em>40 F.3d 1055, 1057 (9th Cir.1994) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Doe, </em>136 F.3d 631, 636 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe same test [for sufficiency of the evidence] applies to both jury and bench trials.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Frank claims that there was insufficient evidence to establish the first element of attempted car-jacking, an \u201cintent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119. We reject his claim. The district judge\u2019s finding that Frank possessed the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm was supported by the following facts revealed at trial: (1) Frank jumped into the bed of the victim\u2019s pickup truck; (2) the victim repeatedly told Frank to get out of the truck, but Frank refused to do so; (3) Frank attempted to put his hand through the driver\u2019s window; (4) Frank pulled out a loaded, operable handgun and tapped the barrel against the glass window of the truck\u2019s cab behind the driver\u2019s head, and then pointed the gun at the driver and twice exclaimed to the driver, \u201cKeep going\u201d; and (5) at the time of his apprehension, Frank was found in the driver\u2019s seat of the truck, immediately after the truck had been abandoned by the victim, with the gun on the passenger\u2019s seat containing five rounds of live ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We conclude that the government established beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cat the moment [Frank] demanded ... the driver\u2019s [truck], [he] possessed the intent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the [truck].\u201d <em>Holloway v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 1, 12, 119 S.Ct. 966, 143 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez, </em>952 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.1991). An attempted car-jacking \u201cvictim need not suffer actual serious bodily injury in order to establish the specific intent requirement of \u00a7 2119.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>265 F.3d 337, 342 (6th Cir.2001). Although Frank did not inflict serious bodily harm.on the victim, the fact that he was able \u201cto achieve the goal of obtaining the [truck] without resorting to the infliction of death or serious bodily harm obviously does not negate the intent to cause such harm in order to obtain the [truck].\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>108 F.3d 478, 484 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>2. Where an appellant challenges the sentence imposed by the district court, we employ a two-step inquiry. <em>United States v. Warr, </em>530 F.3d 1152, 1158 (9th Cir. 2008). First, we consider \u201cwhether the district court properly calculated the applicable range under the advisory guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Barsumyan, </em>517 F.3d 1154, 1157 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir.2006)); <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991 (9th Cir.2008). Second, we consider \u201cchallenges to the reasonableness of the overall sentence in light of all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Barsumyan, </em>517 F.3d at 1157 (citing <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 (9th Cir.2006)); <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991. Our \u201creview of the district court\u2019s sentence is for reasonableness, which merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Warr, </em>530 F.3d at 1158 (internal quotation marks omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory sentencing guidelines range. <em>Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d at 1279. The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its application of the Guidelines to the facts is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d at 985; <em>Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We detect no error in the sentence imposed by the district court. The district court considered: (1) the crimes of violence for which Frank was convicted; (2) Frank\u2019s criminal history, including his pri- or crimes of violence; (3) mitigating factors presented by Frank, including physical disabilities, a difficult childhood, gang affiliation, his low IQ, and his claim of mental impairment; (4) Frank\u2019s request for downward departure on the grounds of imperfect duress and coercion based upon his alleged mental illness; (5) the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s Psychological Update dated August 23, 2004, finding no suggestion of mental illness in Frank\u2019s history, and no evidence of mental illness at the time of his admission to the Mental Health Treatment Unit or during his three-month period of observation there; and (6) the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines. Frank has failed to point to anything in the record that demonstrates that the district court did not appreciate its authority to downwardly depart. Even if the district court did not discuss all of the factors set forth in section 3553(a), we have held that a district court \u201cneed not rehearse on the record all of the considerations that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) lists,\u201d <em>United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2006), and \u201cis not required to refer to each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>id., </em>and we see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">3. Frank also claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective due to counsel\u2019s failure to: (1) investigate his mental state when Frank claimed that he was impaired, citing <em>Douglas v. Woodford, </em>316 F.3d 1079, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2003); (2) call a psychiatrist or psychologist as a witness during trial to substantiate Frank\u2019s asserted mental illness; and (3) fully \u201cinvestigate, develop, and present mitigation evidence during the penalty phase proceedings,\u201d citing <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 521-23, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), in that his attorney allegedly never investigated the Bureau of Prisons psychological report, did not speak with Frank\u2019s doctors, and developed the mental health defense solely on the information developed for Frank\u2019s pre-sentencing competency examination, which was prepared for a different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Frank\u2019s ineffectiveness claim is not suitable for consideration on direct appeal because the record is not sufficiently developed to allow this Court to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>merits of the claim. Accordingly, this claim would be more effectively addressed in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Benlian, </em>63 F.3d 824, 826 n. 3 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b641-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
