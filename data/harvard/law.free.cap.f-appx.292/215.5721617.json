Melvin was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">On appeal, Melvin initially contends that the district court erred in sentencing him based on facts that were neither charged, admitted, nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing courts are still required to calculate the applicable advisory guideline range based on appropriate findings of fact. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006). We have previously noted that sentencing factors should continue to be evaluated based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, we conclude the district court properly determined Melvin\u2019s advisory guideline range based on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">Melvin also contends that his sentence is unreasonable. When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Sentences within the applicable Guidelines range may be presumed reasonable. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Melvin, appropriately treating the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculating and considering the applicable Guidelines range, and weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>factors. Furthermore, Melvin\u2019s sentence, which is no greater than either the Guidelines range or the maximum, may be presumed Thus, we conclude Melvin has failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the chosen</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
