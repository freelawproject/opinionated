Zuniga argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal because of his membership in a social group that consists of young, unprotected individuals who refuse to join organized criminal gangs such as Mara 18 and who have reported the gangs\u2019 criminal activities to the authorities. Zuniga further contends that his opposition to joining the gang constitutes a political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">To establish that he is a member of a particular social group, Zuniga must show that he shares a common immutable characteristic that he cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to his individual identity or conscience. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006). Zuni-ga failed to make such a showing. He similarly failed to show that he was persecuted because of his political opinion. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 351 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">Zuniga therefore has not established that it is more likely than not that he would be threatened by persecution on account of either his political opinion or his membership in a particular social group. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s determination that Zuniga is not entitled to withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence and will not be disturbed. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">Zuniga does not seek review of the IJ\u2019s determination that his claim for asylum was time barred. Zuniga has therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>waived the issue. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Zuniga\u2019s CAT claim is likewise 'unavailing, as he has failed to show that he will likely be tortured under government acquiescence if he is returned to Honduras. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 354 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Zuniga\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
