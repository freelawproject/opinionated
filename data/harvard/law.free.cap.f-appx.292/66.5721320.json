Lancaster, a pro se veteran, challenges the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d)\u2019s, affirmance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d)\u2019s finding that there was not clear and unmistakable error in a December 1992 rating decision denying his claim for a left elbow disability. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">While Lancaster was on active duty, a 1975 medical report indicated he had sustained abrasions on his left elbow. After his release from service, in 1988 he filed a claim with the Veterans Administration for a left elbow disability. In December 1992 the Administration\u2019s regional office denied that claim. Lancaster did not appeal that decision, which became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In 2001, he filed with the regional office a claim that the 1992 decision contained clear and unmistakable error. If that claim were sustained, it would terminate the finality of the regional office\u2019s 1992 decision. The regional office denied that claim, however; the Board affirmed; and the Veterans Court affirmed the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The Veterans Court held that \u201cthe correct facts, as they were known, were before the R[egional] 0[ffice]; the R[egional] 0[ffice] applied the applicable statutory provisions existing at the time; and, but for any alleged error, the outcome would not have been different.\u201d The Veterans Court also stated that a clear-and-unmistakable-error claim could not be based upon the regional office\u2019s failure to perform its duty to assist the veteran in presenting his case or the contention that the regional office improperly weighed the evidence. The Veterans Court concluded that the Board\u2019s decision denying Lancaster\u2019s clear-and-unmistakable-error claim was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Under the governing statute, this court has only limited jurisdiction in reviewing a decision of the Veterans Court. \u201cExcept to the extent that an appeal ... presents a constitutional question,\u201d this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Lancaster\u2019s principal contention\u2014 that he demonstrated clear and unmistakable error in the regional office\u2019s initial denial of his claim for a left elbow disability \u2014 rests primarily on his challenge to the regional office\u2019s evaluation of the evidence upon which it based its decision. Unfortunately for Lancaster, we have no jurisdiction to review that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Although Lancaster also alleges generally that he was denied due process, he makes no attempt to explain the theory on which he bases that claim. Describing the rejection of factual allegations as violating due process is insufficient to invoke the constitutional exception to the statutory prohibition on our reviewing a factual question. <em>See Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999). \u201c[T]he mere recitation of a basis for jurisdiction by either party or a court, is not controlling; we must look to the true nature of the action.\u201d <em>Livingston v. Denwinski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">Lancaster makes two statutory contentions. First, he argues that he was \u201cnever afforded protection under [38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131].\u201d That provision outlines the basic entitlement to disability benefits for veterans wTho served during times of peace. That contention is but a reiteration of his factual contention of disability in different dress.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Second, he argues that the \u201cVA refuses to accept [38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107] with regard to this claim as required by law.\u201d That provision indicates that claimants must demonstrate an entitlement to benefits, and when the evidence is in equipoise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the Secretary must give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. The evidence regarding Lancaster\u2019s disability was not in equipoise, however, so that provision is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We have considered all of Lancaster\u2019s other contentions, but deem them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The decision of the Veterans Court affirming the Board decision denying reopening of Lancaster\u2019s left elbow disability claim because he failed to establish clear and unmistakable error is</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
