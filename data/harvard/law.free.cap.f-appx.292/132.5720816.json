In <em>re Lin </em>He, No. A79 663 423 (B.I.A. Feb. 4, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 663 423 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 22, 2006). We assume the parties familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion, <em>See Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>(2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As a preliminarily matter, we lack jurisdiction to consider He\u2019s argument that he is entitled to CAT relief because He failed to raise this challenge to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we dismiss his petition for review to that extent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that He failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future pei\u2019seeution. See <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir.2000). For instance, his asylum application explicitly stated that his mother underwent an abortion procedure on May 18, 2001 \u2014 ten days after the alleged warrant issued on May 8, 2001\u2014 \u201cbecause she feared that officials would arrest [He] and imprison [him.]\u201d It was therefore not unreasonable for the agency to conclude that He\u2019s alleged fear of persecution was diminished, if not mooted, by the fact of his mother\u2019s abortion. Moreover, the BIA properly noted that He never offered any testimony about the alleged warrant, or expressed any fear of persecution based on the warrant. In light of this and other record evidence, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">As He was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to establish eligibility for asylum, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">. Furthermore, because He did not pursue before the BIA or this Court any claims based on (1) his alleged illegal departure from China or (2) his desire to have more children than would be allowed under China\u2019s family planning policy, we deem those claims abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
