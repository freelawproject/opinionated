Oct. 2, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Ma-ghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)). When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">An applicant may file one motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date of the agency\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the time and numerical limitations do not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). It is undisputed that Chen\u2019s second motion, filed more than ten years after her hearing, was untimely and numerically barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">We find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen failed to demonstrate a change in country conditions that would warrant an exception to the time and numerical limitations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because Chen references only her personal affidavit and the 2003 Consular Information Sheet in her brief to this Court, we deem waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding that her other evidence was insufficient to establish that reopening of her proceedings was warranted. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">With regard to the documents Chen does reference in her brief, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s finding that they failed to establish materially changed country conditions. Although Chen argues generally that her affidavit establishes that there is a policy of forced sterilization in her area, she does not chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>lenge the BIA\u2019s finding that her affidavit was insufficiently corroborated and insufficiently detailed in that it did not indicate the likelihood that the \u201cpurported policy would be acted upon, in practice.\u201d According, we leave undisturbed the BIA\u2019s finding that Chen\u2019s affidavit was insufficient. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, Chen does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that the 2003 Consular Information Sheet was insufficient where it reflects only that China does not recognize dual citizenship for children born abroad to Chinese nationals. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we cannot find that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen\u2019s affidavit and 2003 Consular Information Sheet were insufficient to establish her prima facie eligibility for relief where they did not indicate the likelihood of forced sterilizations upon returning Chinese nationals. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). We therefore decline to examine Chen\u2019s argument challenging the BIA\u2019s finding that she must comply with the requirements of a motion to reopen in order to file a \u201csuccessive\u201d asylum application because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the BIA\u2019s conclusion was erroneous, Chen failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
