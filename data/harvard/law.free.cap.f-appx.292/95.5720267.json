A77 569 416/417 (B.I.A. Nov. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Ma-ghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">An alien may only file one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, there is no time or numerical limitation where the alien establishes materially \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely where it was filed more than three years after the BIA\u2019s April 2002 decision dismissing their appeal from the I J\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Petitioners failed to establish materially \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>The BIA properly found that the birth of Petitioner\u2019s children did not suffice to show such changed country conditions. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the birth of children in the United States does not constitute changed circumstances in the country of nationality). As the BIA found, Petitioners failed to identify any evidence indicating that there is a policy of forced sterilization in their local area. With respect to Chen\u2019s affidavit and his father\u2019s letter, the BIA did not err in declining to accord those documents significant weight where Chen\u2019s affidavit was not based on his personal knowledge, and his father\u2019s letter was an unsworn statement. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). Even taking them as true, neither indicates that family planning officials threatened to forcibly sterilize the Petitioners or that there was a general policy of forced sterilization in their local area.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Finally, Petitioners\u2019 reference to the evidence discussed in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006), is unavailing where they did not submit that evidence with their motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). As we have held, remand for agency consideration of documents not in the record is inappropriate where \u201cagency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the BIA for the taking of additional evidence.\u201d <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. That finding is dispositive of Chen and Lin's motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Therefore, we need not reach their challenge to the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of their motion to reopen as to Chen based on the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. <em>Cf. Qian Gao v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 173, 176 (2d Cir.2007), <em>certiorari denied by Qian Gao v. </em>Mukasey,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 959, 169 L.Ed.2d 724 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
