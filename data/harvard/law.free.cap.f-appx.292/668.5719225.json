The IJ\u2019s decision found Nguyen \u201cremovable as charged\u201d and stated that Nguyen chose not \u201cto present any testimony or evidence with regard to the <em>grounds </em>of removability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As Nguyen does not argue that he was incorrectly found to be removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), we need not address his other charged ground of inadmissibility, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
