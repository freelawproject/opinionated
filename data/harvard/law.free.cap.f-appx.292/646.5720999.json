The employees appeal the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on CSRA and Title VII discrimination claims and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>district court\u2019s entry of judgment following a bench trial on ADEA and Title VII retaliation claims. The Secretary cross-appeals the district court\u2019s calculation of damages awarded to two employees for successful ADEA claims. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., </em>256 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm in part and remand in part. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this ease, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The district court did not err in granting judgment in favor of the Secretary on the employees\u2019 claims founded on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 et seq. The ADEA makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual [who is at least 40 years of age] ... because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a), 631(a). The employees argue that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of the Secretary on the employees\u2019 ADEA claims because the court (1) incorrectly applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis despite finding direct evidence that the reduction in force was motivated by age discrimination; (2) failed to apply a mixed-motive analysis; and (3) improperly evaluated statistical evidence regarding disparate impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">When a plaintiff puts forth circumstantial evidence of discrimination in an ADEA claim, courts employ the familiar burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir.2000). The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis contains three steps. First, an employee must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that \u201cthey were (1) members of the protected class (at least age 40); (2) performing their jobs satisfactorily; (3) discharged; and (4) replaced by substantially younger employees with equal or inferior qualifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, if the employee establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282. Third, if the employer presents such a reason, \u201cthe presumption of unlawful discrimination simply drops out of the picture\u201d and the employee has the burden to show that the articulated reason was pretext and the employer thus intentionally discriminated because of the plaintiff\u2019s age. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The employees argue that the district court erred in applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis because they presented direct, rather than circumstantial, evidence of discrimination. When a plaintiff presents <em>direct </em>evidence in support of an ADEA claim, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis is unnecessary because the direct evidence allows the plaintiff to proceed directly to the question of whether the employer intentionally discriminated because of the plaintiffs age. <em>Enlow v. Salem-Keizer Yellow Cab Co., </em>389 F.3d 802, 812 (9th Cir.2004). <em>See also Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). Although the district court did apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, we nonetheless affirm because the mode of analysis made no difference to the ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Forest Guardians v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>329 F.3d 1089, 1097 (9th Cir. 2003) (summary judgment may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record). As a practical matter, there is no effect when, as here, a court first determines that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and that the defendant has articulated a nondiscriminatory reason before proceeding to the question of whether the defendant\u2019s actions were intentionally discriminatory. In either case, the district court\u2019s judgment ultimately rests on a determination of \u201cthe sole remaining issue [of] discrimination <em>vel non.\u201d Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court did reach the question of whether the employees proved intentional discrimination, any error resulting from application of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The employees next argue that the district court erred by not applying the mixed-motive analysis described by this Court in <em>Costa v. Desert Palace, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 838, 853-54 (9th Cir.2002), <em>aff'd </em>539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). The mixed-motive analysis is only applicable, however, when \u201ca protected characteristic was \u2018a motivating factor\u2019 in the employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court found that \u201cthere is <em>no </em>evidence that the relevant decision makers were acting in accordance with an age-based discriminatory animus.\u201d (emphasis added). Because the district court\u2019s finding in this regard was not clearly erroneous, we need not determine whether a mixed-motive analysis would have been proper had there been evidence that the relevant decision makers acted with any discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">The employees additionally argue that the district court made several errors in evaluating the statistical evidence presented regarding disparate impact. First, the employees argue that the district court failed to resolve the conflicting testimony of the parties\u2019 respective statistical experts. District courts are required to make factual findings. <em>Zivkovic v. Southern. California Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1090 (9th Cir.2002). The findings must \u201cbe explicit enough to give the appellate court a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, and to enable it to determine the ground on which the trial court reached its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The district court satisfied this requirement by rejecting the testimony of both statistical experts as inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Second, the employees argue that the district court committed clear error when it found that the employees\u2019 statistical evidence did not show a significant disparate impact on older employees. To establish a prima facie case of a disparate impact violation of the ADEA, an employee must: \u201c(1) show a significant disparate impact on a protected class or group; (2) identify the specific employment practices or selection criteria at issue; and (3) show a causal relationship between the challenged practices or criteria and the disparate impact.\u201d <em>Hemmings v. Tidyman\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Inc., </em>285 F.3d 1174, 1190 (9th Cir.2002). The district court held that the employees had not established a prima facie case of a disparate impact because they failed to isolate and identify the specific employment practice responsible for the disparate impact. We have held that a reduction in force may constitute a specific employment practice. <em>Pottenger v. Potlatch Corp., </em>329 F.3d 740, 749 (9th Cir.2003). However, analyzing the impact of a \u201cgeneralized policy\u201d is not specific enough. <em>Smith v. City of Jackson, </em>544 U.S. 228, 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005). The district court found that the reduction in force could be broken down into different elements and that statistical analysis of the reduction in force as a whole was thus insufficient to meet the employees\u2019 burden. This factual finding is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Third, the employees contend that the district court eired by failing to explain why it did not find that the statistical evidence demonstrated disparate treatment on the basis of age. The district court found that the employees\u2019 statistical analysis failed to provide any meaningful evidence because it did not take into account the type of work performed by each employee. Mindful that we have been skeptical of statistical analyses that \u201cfail to account for other relevant variables,\u201d <em>Pot-tenger, </em>329 F.3d at 748, we see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In sum, the district court did not err in granting judgment in favor of the Secretary on the employees\u2019 ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">The district court did not err in granting judgment on the employees\u2019 claims based on the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703. In an appeal from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board to a district court, the district court must review CSRA claims under the deferential standard described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) and must review discrimination claims de novo. <em>Washington v. Garrett, </em>10 F.3d 1421, 1428 (9th Cir.1993). The employees argue that the district court improperly applied deferential review to their discrimination claims. We disagree. The district court properly applied deferential review to the employees\u2019 CSRA claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary on those claims \u2014 a judgment that the employees do not appeal. The district court declined, however, to grant summary judgment with respect to the employees\u2019 discrimination claims and proceeded to hold a full bench trial in which it considered those claims de novo. Indeed, in its summary judgment order, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-13\">[T]he Court may properly consider Plaintiffs\u2019 claims of other wrongs based on the administrative record separately from Plaintiffs\u2019 discrimination claims, which the Court will review <em>de novo. </em>Thus, in this order, the Court will not consider any of Plaintiffs\u2019 discrimination claims ... and will rule only on Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>garding whether the Division instituted the RIF and separated Plaintiffs in accordance with the CSRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Thus, the district court properly separated the CSRA claims from the discrimination claims and properly reviewed the discrimination claims de novo. There is no basis for reversing the district court\u2019s judgment on the CSRA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The district court properly granted judgment on the claims <em>of </em>Drs. Iyer and King that the Secretary violated their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. The district court granted summary judgment on all of the Title VII except retaliation and granted judgment on the retaliation claims after a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Title VII provides that \u201c [i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). In claims alleging employment discrimination, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis generally applies, unless the employee has put forth direct evidence. <em>Lam v. Univ. of Hawai\u2019i, </em>40 F.3d 1551, 1559 (9th Cir.1994). Here the district court found that although Drs. Iyer and King established a prima facie case, they did not put forth any additional evidence to suggest that the Secretary\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanation for their separation was pretext. The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Title VII also \u201cprohibits an employer from retaliating against an applicant for employment because the applicant has opposed any unlawful employment practice.\u201d <em>Lam, </em>40 F.3d at 1558. Retaliation claims are decided under the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. <em>Id. </em>at 1559 n. 11. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that plaintiff engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) an adverse employment action; (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Miller v. Fairchild Industries, Inc., </em>797 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.1986). The district court found that although Drs. Iyer and King met the first two requirements, they failed to show a causal link between their protected activity and their termination. We review this factual finding under the highly deferential clear error standard. <em>Miller v. Fairchild Indus. Inc., </em>885 F.2d 498, 503 (9th Cir.1989). Applying this standard to the record, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The Secretary cross-appeals the district court\u2019s calculation of damages awarded to plaintiffs Calzia and Wrucke. We review a district court\u2019s computation of damages for clear error. <em>Lentini v. California Center for the Arts, Escondido, </em>370 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">The Secretary argues that the district court erred in calculating Calzia\u2019s damages by presuming that he would have been promoted to a higher pay grade had he not been laid off on account of his age. The district court based its calculation of Cal-zia\u2019s damages on expert testimony that Calzia would likely have been promoted from GS-12, Step 10, to GS-13, Step 4, in 2001 because his supervisors had recommended him for that promotion. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the Secretary argues that promotions to a higher grade are not automatic and Calzia would not necessarily have been promoted, despite his supervisors\u2019 recommendation, the district court\u2019s decision to adopt the expert\u2019s calculations as the most reasonable measure of damages was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">However, in adopting the expert\u2019s calculations, the district court appears to have inserted a typographical error in the final figure, thereby increasing the award from $170,522, as calculated by the employees\u2019 expert, to $171,522. We thus remand for the sole purpose of allowing the district court to reconsider whether the judgment should be amended to correct the apparent clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Secretary argues that the district court erred in calculating Wrucke\u2019s damages because the court failed to accurately determine the salary Wrucke would have earned had he chosen to be reassigned to a lower pay grade. The district court found that Wrucke failed to mitigate his damages when he declined to \u201cbump\u201d into a GS-13 position offered to him. Had Wrucke agreed to the bump to GS-13, he would have remained in his prior grade (GS-14, Step 10) for two years, after which he would have assumed \u201cpay retention\u201d status. Under \u201cpay retention,\u201d Wrucke would have retained the pay of a GS-14 position, as long as it did not exceed 150% of the top step of his bumped position, and would have received 50% of the cost of living increases for the grade of his current position. The Secretary argues that this 50% limitation applies only to the \u201crate of basic pay,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 536.205(c), defined as \u201cexclusive of additional pay of any kind,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 536.102, and that the locality pay increase would thus not have been reduced by 50%. However, the regulations cited by the Secretary are no longer current, and regulations effective May 1, 2005, indicate that locality pay is now treated as the rate of basic pay for purposes of pay retention; the 50% limitation now applies to increases in both regular pay and locality pay. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.610. Thus, the district court correctly calculated the amount Wrucke would have earned had he mitigated his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">We affirm the judgments of the district court, with the exception of the district court\u2019s calculation of Calzia\u2019s damages which is remanded for the sole purpose to allow the district court to enter a corrected judgment, if the district court finds it appropriate. Given our resolution of the issues on appeal, we need not \u2014 and do not\u2014 reach any other argument raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. Because we affirm on the basis of harmless error, we need not determine whether the evidence cited by plaintiffs can properly be considered \u201cdirect evidence.\u201d <em>See Enlow, </em>389 F.3d at 812 (defining direct evidence as \"evidence of conduct or statements by persons involved in the decision-making process that may be viewed as directly reflecting the alleged discriminatory attitude.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. In analyzing the disparate impact claim, the district court recited the \"business necessity\u201d test. The Supreme Court recently noted that \"the business necessity test should have no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases.\u201d <em>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2404, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008). However, prior to considering the applicability of the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d test, the district court held that the employees failed to establish a prima facie case. Because we affirm on this ground, any error the district court made in applying the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d test to a disparate impact claim is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b676-11\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARy\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">At a speech delivered shortly before the round of firings that led to the present case, Dr. Gordon Eaton, the Director of the United States Geological Survey (\u201cUSGS\u201d), asked his audience: \u201cWhat is the difference between Jurassic Park and the Geological Division of the Geologic Survey?\u201d The answer: \u201cOne is an amusement park filled with dinosaurs and the other is a movie.\u201d A poster announcing an employee meeting to discuss the workforce reduction contained the following cartoon caption: \u201cYou gotta help me, Mom ... This assignment is due tomorrow, and Gramps doesn\u2019t understand the new tricks.\u201d These \u2018jokes\u2019 by no means reflect the isolated humor of individual USGS employees. Rather, a 1993 official report set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ting forth the agency\u2019s \u201cVision for the 21 st Century\u201d explained that \u201c[s]ome segments of the USGS currently are suffering from an aging, high-grade workforce\u201d and that this is \u201ca critical problem that must be addressed....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On this record, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s acquiescence in the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is <em>no </em>evidence that the relevant decision makers were acting in accordance with age-based discriminatory animus.\u201d (emphasis added). I would hold that where there is irrefutable evidence of an officially sponsored culture of discrimination in a workplace, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the individual who ultimately undertook the challenged adverse employment action was motivated to do so by his own discriminatory animus. <em>See, e.g., Galdamez v. Potter, </em>415 F.3d 1015, 1026 n. 9 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that discrimination occurs \u201cwhere the ultimate decision-maker, lacking individual discriminatory intent, takes an adverse employment action in reliance on factors affected by another decision-maker\u2019s discriminatory animus\u201d). Because the record in this case contains ample evidence of an officially sponsored culture of age-based discrimination at USGS, I would reach the merits of the employees\u2019 mixed-motive claim and find discrimination in violation of the ADEA. Accordingly, although I concur in the majority disposition in most respects, I respectfully dissent from Part I.B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
