Montes-Ga-ray\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was seventy to eighty-seven months. The district court sentenced him to seventy months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Montes-Garay argues on appeal that the district court erred by failing to properly weigh and balance the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He states, for example, that he reentered the United States only to find work and a seventy-month sentence was too harsh of a penalty for what amounted to no more than an international trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">Our review is bifurcated. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>Second, if the district court did not commit a significant procedural error, we review the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>We review sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">The record shows that the district court heard argument and received information regarding the circumstances of Montes-Garay\u2019s offense, including his motive for reentering the United States. The district court was provided with information that addressed several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of Montes-Garay\u2019s offense, his history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to provide just punishment, to give adequate deterrence from criminal conduct, and to protect the public from future crimes by the defendant. Prior to imposing the sentence, the district court gave Montes-Garay the opportunity to speak on his behalf, and the court specifically addressed both his mitigation arguments and his prior drug offense. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-20\">Montes-Garay has not demonstrated that the district court procedurally or substantively erred and thus abused its discretion in imposing his sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. He has not rebutted the presumption that his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tence, which falls within and at the bottom of a properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). In light of the deferential standard set forth in <em>Gall, </em>Montes-Garay has not established that the district court erred in imposing his sentence. 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Montes-Garay challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
