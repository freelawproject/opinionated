Ranee argues for the first time on appeal that neither Granite Transformations nor Rocksolid Granite had worker's compensation insurance at the time of his injury, entitling him to bring a civil lawsuit under Florida law. Because he did not raise this argument before the district court, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Kelvin Ranee, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his two-count complaint against Rocksolid Granit USA, Inc., based upon negligence and a violation of the Fan' Labor Standards Act (FLSA). On appeal, Ranee argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim, and that the district erred in granting Rocksolid\u2019s motion to dismiss pri- or to <em>sua sponte </em>providing Ranee an opportunity to amend his complaint. We affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion <em>de novo. Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). When ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all of the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded facts as true. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp., Inc. v. Hosp. Corp, of Am., </em>795 F.2d 948, 954 (11th Cir.1986). Moreover, <em>\u201c[pjro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). When considering a motion to dismiss, the court may consider the complaint and all exhibits attached thereto. <em>Thaeter v. Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, </em>449 F.3d 1342, 1352 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">We begin by considering Ranee\u2019s FLSA claim. Ranee\u2019s complaint alleges that he did not receive wages due to him for a portion of one day\u2019s work that he performed for Granite Transformations, an allegedly fictitious corporation owned by Rocksolid. He argues that this violates FLSA\u2019s minimum wage requirements under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of an FLSA violation, Ranee must show \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference\u201d the amount and extent of his work in order to demonstrate that he was inadequately compensated under FLSA. <em>See Caro-Galvan v. Curtis Richardson, </em>993 F.2d 1500, 1513 (11th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Donovan v. New Floridian Hotel, Inc., </em>676 F.2d 468, 475 n. 12 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 686-87, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946).) Ranee has failed to do so because his complaint and attached documentation provide no evidence of the amount and extent of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-14\">Moreover, attached to his complaint is an email that Ranee sent to his supervisor, Frank Baran of Granite Transformations, in which Ranee inquired, \u201cWhen will I get paid for the work done at the Miami location on or about March 28, 2007?\u201d Baran responded, via email, \u201cHow many hours did you end up working that day? Let me know and I will get a check out.\u201d Ranee does not claim that he ever responded to Baran\u2019s email message. In light of this email correspondence with Baran, Ranee has failed to demonstrate that any inadequate compensation was a result of Rock-solid\u2019s actions, rather than his own. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Ranee\u2019s FLSA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Ranee\u2019s complaint also alleges that he was injured while working for Granite Transformations that day. Ranee\u2019s allegation that Rocksolid is liable for negligence due to his injuries can be construed in two ways. First, Ranee\u2019s complaint can be read to allege a Workman\u2019s Compensation claim on the grounds that \u201cDefendant breached its duty of keeping its workplace safe.\u201d (D. Ct. Order at 4 n. 3) The district court found, however, that Ranee\u2019s \u201cappropriate avenue for this claim\u201d would be to pursue a remedy under Florida\u2019s Worker\u2019s Compensation laws. <em>Id. </em>It is fully within the district court\u2019s discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims, and given our finding that the district court did not err in dismissing Ranee\u2019s FLSA claim, we find no error in the district court\u2019s implicit decision not to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1088-89 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Second, Ranee\u2019s complaint can be read to allege that Rocksolid\u2019s negligence is due to its failure to provide Ranee with worker\u2019s compensation insurance information, and its refusal to pay for medical bills or any other damages sustained as a result of Ranee\u2019s on-the-job injury. However, Ranee\u2019s exhibits again directly undermine his claim. Attached to the complaint is an email Ranee wrote to his supervisor, Frank Baran of Granite Transformations, in which he informed Baran, \u201cI was injured on your job yesterday in Miami.\u201d Baran responded, \u201cKelvin, I was not aware please send me the details of what happened.\u201d Ranee did not respond to Baran and accordingly, he cannot not now claim that Rocksolid failed to comply with requests which Ranee has failed to demonstrate that he ever made. We find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ranee\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Finally, Ranee argues that the district court erred by granting Rocksolid\u2019s motion to dismiss without <em>sva spoute </em>providing Ranee with an opportunity to amend his complaint. Ranee has not indicated, however, how he would have amended the complaint to overcome its deficiencies had he been given the opportunity. We therefore conclude that <em>stta, spoute </em>granting Ranee an opportunity to amend his complaint would have been futile. <em>See Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Hardy v. Broward Co. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>238 Fed.Appx. 435, 443 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
