Defonzo denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Min Li, </em>No. A 98 595 571 (B.I.A. Sept. 28, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. A 98 595 571 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 26, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ reasonably found an inconsistency between Li\u2019s testimony that she attended her home church infrequently in 2004 because she was a student and her written application indicating that she stopped attending school in 2000. The agency appropriately rejected Li\u2019s explanation that she \u201cdid not mention 2004\u201d; she had never argued that there were translation errors: <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, this inconsistency substantiated the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Secaida-Ro-sales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Similarly, the IJ correctly noted that Li\u2019s testimony that she was unable to attend religious classes because her church was only open on Sunday was contradicted by her pastor\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony, indicating that the church was open at least four other days during the week. Given that this discrepancy bore on Li\u2019s involvement in religious activities, the agency reasonably found that it undermined her credibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The IJ also properly based his adverse credibility finding on substantial omissions from Li\u2019s written application and the letter she submitted from her mother. The IJ accurately noted that while Li testified that her mother informed her that the authorities continued to look for her, no such assertion appears in either Li\u2019s written application or her mother\u2019s letter. Ordinarily, \u201casylum applicants are not required to list every incident of persecution on their 1-589 statements.\u201d <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir.2006). While Li asserts that evidence of Chinese authorities\u2019 continued interest in her is \u201csuperfluous,\u201d that argument is unavailing where it goes directly to whether she has any fear of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). Further, in providing the details of her asylum claim, Li was not confined to \u201cthe small space on the form itself.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308. Rather, she supplemented her application with a separate statement attached to her Form I-589. Thus, these omissions support the agency\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Secai-da-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Finally, contrary to Li\u2019s argument, there is no indication that the agency failed to consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in rendering its decision. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, its denial of Li\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal was proper to the extent both claims rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"><em>. </em>We decline to review Li\u2019s argument that she misunderstood tire question because she was distraught during this portion of her hearing; as the Government observes, she failed to raise this explanation before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (describing issue exhaustion as \u201cmandatory\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
