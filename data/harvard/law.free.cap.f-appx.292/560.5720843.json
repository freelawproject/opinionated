She contends that pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), the 90-day limit for filing a motion to reopen did not apply because she based her motion on changed country conditions. We disagree; Kaur\u2019s motion stated that conditions in India have not changed. We therefore dismiss the petition for review for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Singh-Bhathal v. INS, </em>170 F.3d 943, 947 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">There is, however, an alternative form of relief to which Kaur may be entitled. Kaur\u2019s husband is either a United States citizen or a lawful permanent resident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2002, he filed an 1-130 petition on her behalf, a petition that ordinarily takes 135-165 days to process. It is now over five years and apparently no decision has been rendered. We therefore exercise our authority to stay the mandate pending resolution of Kaur\u2019s 1-130 which, if granted, may enable Kaur to remain in the United States with her husband. <em>See, e.g., Aguilar-Escobar v. INS, </em>136 F.3d 1240, 1241 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED. MANDATE STAYED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\">. The documents submitted to the Court contain contradictory information as to Kaur\u2019s husband\u2019s status. However, both lawful permanent residents and United States citizens may file 1-130 petitions on behalf of their spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
