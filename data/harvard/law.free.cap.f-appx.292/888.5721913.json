Metropolitan Life Insurance (\u201cMetLife\u201d), the Plan\u2019s administrator, terminated Cross\u2019s disability benefits in March of 2004. Cross sued MetLife to recover and reinstate these benefits, and requested attorneys\u2019 fees and costs related to his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court applied the six-part analysis set forth in <em>Williams v. Bell-South Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) to determine the appropriate standard for reviewing MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s benefits. Ultimately arriving at the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the district court concluded that MetLife\u2019s determination was not supported by reasonable grounds. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment for Cross. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and after hearing oral argument, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Cross. MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s benefits was not supported by reasonable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">In 1984, Gary Cross began working for Georgia Pacific, a manufacturer and marketer of tissue, packaging, paper, pulp, building products, and related chemicals. While employed, Cross suffered from chronic back pain. In 1998, he underwent a microdiscectomy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recovered, and returned to work. The pain, however, continued, and in July of 2001, Cross stopped working. In November of 2001, Cross underwent a second surgery, an anterior dis-cectomy and anterior lumbar interbody fusion with titanium bone cages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A month later, Cross reported that his back pain had returned, and applied for long-term disability benefits under Georgia Pacific\u2019s disability plan. His benefits were approved by MetLife, the Plan\u2019s administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">To be eligible for benefits under the Plan, an employee must meet the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisabled.\u201d During the initial twenty-four months of benefits, the Plan defines \u201cdisabled,\u201d in relevant part, as: due to injury or sickness, being unable to earn more than eighty percent of one\u2019s pre-disability earnings at \u201c[one\u2019s] <em>oivn occupation </em>for any employer in your local economy.\u201d After twenty-four months of benefits, the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisabled\u201d changes, in relevant part, to: being unable to earn more than eighty percent of one\u2019s pre-disability benefits at \u201cany gainful occupation for which [one is] reasonably qualified taking into account [one\u2019s] training, education, experience, and predisability earnings.\u201d At the time of his disability, Cross worked as Shift Supervisor (also referred to as a Lead Operator Technician). According to MetLife\u2019s review of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d), Cross\u2019s position required \u201clight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>strength demand.\u201d The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) who awarded Cross social security benefits, however, found that under the DOT, Cross\u2019s position required \u201cmedium exertion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Cross began receiving disability benefits under the Plan in December of 2001. In August of 2003, MetLife initiated a review of Cross\u2019s entitlement to continued benefits, and over the next several months, it gathered evidence on Cross\u2019s medical status. Then, in March of 2004, MetLife terminated Cross\u2019s benefits, finding that Cross was \u201ccapable of light work capacity,\u201d that his prior job required light physical demand, and, thus, concluding that Cross was no longer considered disabled under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">MetLife based its decision to terminate Cross\u2019s benefits primarily on the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">One, MetLife\u2019s Special Investigation Unit recorded surveillance footage of Cross at a baseball diamond coaching his son\u2019s team. The footage shows, among other things, Cross bending at the waist, squatting, and arranging and carrying equipment. MetLife argues that this footage reveals Cross performing activities inconsistent with his stated limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Two, Cross\u2019s treating neurosurgeon, Dr. Javed, stated that Cross\u2019s MRI did not reveal any disc herniation and that \u201cthe levels above the disc essentially look normal.\u201d He concluded that Cross had reached maximal medical improvement (there was nothing further, surgically, that could be done to improve his condition) and referred Cross to a pain management specialist, Dr. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Three, MetLife ordered an independent medical examination (\u201cIME\u201d) of Cross by Dr. Peach. Dr. Peach examined Cross, and reviewed his medical records and the video surveillance. He stated that Cross was uncooperative during the examination and therefore he was unable to validly estimate Cross\u2019s functional capacity. To that end, Dr. Peach recommended that Cross undergo a Functional Capacity Evaluation (\u201cFCE\u201d) \u201cto determine more objectively any valid functional limitations.\u201d Dr. Peach did, however, indicate that Cross was magnifying his symptoms, and he noted that the surveillance footage was \u201ctotally inconsistent with limitations claimed by the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Four, Dr. Greenhood, another independent physician, reviewed Cross\u2019s medical records and spoke with Cross\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Lee. Dr. Greenhood did not examine Cross. However, from the information reviewed, Dr. Greenhood inferred that Cross\u2019s \u201cfunctional capacity is not severely limited\u201d and that he is \u201ccapable of at least light work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Five, Dr. Gosline completed a psychiatric review of Cross. Dr. Gosline determined that Cross\u2019s prior psychiatric treatment was related to a single episode of hospitalization due to Cross\u2019s narcotic dependence and withdrawal, rather than any ongoing disabling psychiatric condition. He concluded that Cross is not limited in his work capacity by any disabling psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Six, Dr. Ito, an independent rehabilitation specialist, reviewed Cross\u2019s medical records and the surveillance footage. Dr. Ito opined that Cross could tolerate sedentary to light activity, provided that certain accommodations were in place. Dr. Ito also stated that, despite Cross\u2019s history of depression, dysthymia, anxiety, and pain, Cross is able to participate in activities he is motivated to pursue, as evidenced by his ability to coach a baseball team.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">The following evidence, on the other hand, supports Cross\u2019s claim that he is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>One, Cross has an extensive record of medical treatment, back disorders, and pain. He underwent two lumbar surgeries, and a titanium implant was fused to his bone. After surgery, he received a number of epidural injections, and has been on an extensive regimen of pain, anti-anxiety, and anti-depression medication for several years, including Elavil, Methadone, MS-Contin, Avinza, Effexor, Mellaril, Vi-codin, Zoloft, Soma, and Gabitril. A post-surgery, cervical spine x-ray and MRI of Cross revealed a bulging disc and spondy-losis (spinal deformity). Over the years, he has been diagnosed with intervertebral disc disorder, myelopathy (spine disorder) and radiculitis (pain radiating from spine). Since leaving his position at Georgia Pacific, he has seen numerous doctors and has consistently sought treatment for his well-documented history of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Two, Cross\u2019s neurosurgeon, Dr. Javed, noted that Cross continued to experience pain after his surgeries. He recommended that Cross undergo an FCE to better determine his limitations. He stated his belief that Cross would be \u201cunable to return to his present job\u201d but that he may be able to return to \u201clight-duty,\u201d depending on the results of the FCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Three, Cross\u2019s pain management specialist, Dr. Lee, diagnosed Cross with epidural fibrosis (the formation of scar tissue) and failed back syndrome, and stated that he has \u201congoing nerve damage.\u201d Dr. Lee indicated that during an eight-hour day, Cross could only sit one hour, stand one hour, and walk one hour, could only occasionally lift eleven to twenty pounds, and could only carry up to ten pounds. He added that Cross should never climb or crawl and must lie down every two hours and elevate his legs. Dr. Lee noted that when Cross coaches his son\u2019s baseball team he simultaneously increases his narcotic medication, indicating that, while he is physically able to perform the activity, it causes him an increase in pain. Dr. Lee opined that Cross \u201cwould benefit from continued psychiatric support, chronic pain management and spinal cord stimulator therapy.\u201d He concluded that Cross is currently disabled from \u201cperforming any gainful employment\u201d and \u201cwill likely remain disabled for the remainder of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Four, Cross was awarded social security disability benefits in March of 2003. While different standards apply to the ultimate award of benefits in the social security context, the ALJ determined that Cross suffered from \u201csevere\u201d impairments and \u201ccannot perform on a sustained basis, even at the \u2018sedentary\u2019 level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Five, Cross has a documented history of depression and anxiety, and has been prescribed anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication. He was admitted to a hospital due to suicidal ideation, depression, narcotic detox, and history of back pain. Dr. Morgan, a psychiatrist, noted that Cross suffers from \u201cmajor depression [combined with] depression secondary to long-term narcotic use and chronic illness with pain.\u201d Dr. Lee has also noted Cross\u2019s issues with depression and anxiety, finding that Cross\u2019s \u201cdepression scale is quite high\u201d and that his depression is \u201cexacerbating his pain.\u201d He referred Cross to a psychiatrist, Dr. Yost.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">The district court carefully considered all the evidence before it. It found that, while there was some evidence to question Cross\u2019s status as disabled, MetLife gave unreasonable weight to its experts\u2019 opinions in the face of Cross\u2019s contradictory evidence. Moreover, the court noted that while MetLife could have ordered an FCE to more adequately determine Cross\u2019s specific limitations, it did not. Lastly, the court found that MetLife failed to provide any evidence of exactly what job duties Cross could perform. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>court concluded that MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s benefits was arbitrary and capricious, and granted summary judgment for Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in an ERISA action de novo, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Green v. Holland, </em>480 F.3d 1216, 1222 (11th Cir.2007). One of three standards governs our review of a plan administrator\u2019s decision: (1) if the plan does not grant discretion to the administrator in deciding claims, we review the administrator\u2019s decision de novo; (2) if the plan grants the administrator discretion in deciding claims and the administrator does not suffer from a conflict of interest, arbitrary and capricious review applies; and (3) if the administrator has discretion, but suffers from a conflict of interest, we review its decision under a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>See Gilley v. Monsanto Co., </em>490 F.3d 848, 856 (11th Cir.2007); <em>HCA Health Servs. of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 993 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is uncontested that MetLife has discretion in deciding claims under the Plan. It is also uncontested that MetLife does not suffer from a conflict of interest. Thus, as the district court found, and as both parties agree, we review MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s disability benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard. Under that standard, we must determine whether there was a reasonable basis for MetLife\u2019s decision, based on the facts as known to MetLife at the time the decision was made. <em>Glazer v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>524 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 2008); <em>Jett v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala., </em>890 F.2d 1137, 1139 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s disability benefits was not supported by reasonable grounds. The surveillance footage recorded by MetLife\u2019s Special Investigation Unit provided a mere snapshot of Cross\u2019s activities throughout the day. The surveillance spanned five days, but only resulted in approximately two hours of video. While the footage does not show that Cross\u2019s physical abilities were limited, it also does not show Cross exerting himself. At most, Cross is seen occasionally bending at the waist, squatting, and carrying equipment of an unknown weight. What MetLife characterizes as Cross \u201cpitching] baseballs to a player in the batting net\u201d is nothing more than Cross sitting on a bucket next to a batter and tossing baseballs a few feet up in the air for the batter to hit. MetLife remarked that the video did not show Cross using \u201cbraces, supports or other orthopedic devices.\u201d It also noted that the video shows Cross moving in a \u201csmooth, fluid manner, without exhibiting ... external signs of impairment or physical restriction.\u201d While this may be an accurate characterization, these snapshots do nothing to disprove Cross\u2019s reports of pain. In fact, Dr. Lee noted that Cross simultaneously stepped-up his dosages of pain medication during his coaching activities, indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>that these activities caused him an increase in pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Likewise, MetLife\u2019s independent physician reports do not provide a reasonable basis for MetLife\u2019s decision. Of the four physicians relied on by MetLife, Cross was only physically examined by Dr. Peach. However, due to what Dr. Peach felt was a \u201clack of cooperation,\u201d he concluded that he was unable to validly estimate Cross\u2019s functional capacity (\u201cI do not feel, based on the findings of my physical exam, that I can make a valid estimation of [Cross\u2019s] functional capacity.\u201d). Dr. Peach recommended that Cross undergo an FCE, and opined that Cross\u2019s limitations \u201ccannot be validated without\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Dr. Greenhood provided a brief physician consultant report. He did not examine Cross; instead it seems he based his opinion primarily on Dr. Peach\u2019s IME and a conversation with Dr. Lee. Dr. Green-hood noted that Dr. Lee does not believe Cross is capable of working. He inferred, however, from the surveillance, from Dr. Peach\u2019s IME, and from Dr. Lee\u2019s statement that Cross may have symptom amplification or somatization, that Cross is \u201cfunctionally capable of at least light work.\u201d Dr. Greenhood did not expound on his analysis or on what, specifically, he considered to be \u201clight work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Nor did Dr. Gosline examine Cross, although it does seem that he carefully reviewed Cross\u2019s medical records. Nevertheless, Dr. Gosline, a psychiatrist, had no opinion on whether Cross was limited by a physical disability. Instead, he concluded that he could not find \u201cadequate compelling information of a disabling psychiatric condition that would provide a global impairment of function that would prevent [Cross] from performing the duties of some occupation consistent with his physical limitations and with appropriate job modifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Lastly, MetLife relies on a report by Dr. Ito, an independent rehabilitation specialist who reviewed Cross\u2019s medical record and the surveillance footage. After an extensive summary of Cross\u2019s medical history, Dr. Ito opined that Cross could \u201ctolerate sedentary to light activity\u201d provided that the following accommodations were in place: (1) restrictions on frequent overhead work, push-pull work, crouching, twisting and bending; and (2) position changes on an hourly basis, including \u201cpostural adjustments during any static positioning such as sitting or standing.\u201d Dr. Ito also stated that, despite Cross\u2019s history of depression, dysthymia, anxiety, and pain, Cross is able to participate in activities he is motivated to pursue, such as: planning and \u201cparticipat[ing] in scheduled activities,\u201d and \u201crelating] interpersonally with children as well as adults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">Based on the surveillance and the above reports, MetLife concluded that Cross was capable of performing his prior occupation, and therefore, Cross no longer met the Plan\u2019s post-twenty-four-month definition of \u201cdisabled.\u201d To determine the physical requirements of Cross\u2019s prior occupation at Georgia Pacific as Shift Supervisor, Met-Life performed an occupational analysis. The analysis determined that Cross\u2019s position most closely matches the DOT\u2019s position of Process-Area Supervisor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the DOT, the position of Process-Area Supervisor is one of \u201clight-strength demand,\u201d and its physical demands include: (1) lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling twenty pounds occasionally, ten pounds frequently, and a negligible amount constantly; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>frequent reaching, handling, fingering, talking, hearing, and near visual acuity; and (3) occasional climbing, stooping, and crouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">MetLife concluded that Cross is able to engage in the above activities even though none of its independent physicians specified the types of activities Cross is capable of performing. Dr. Peach and Dr. Javed each recommended that MetLife order an FCE in order to assess Cross\u2019s specific limitations. Dr. Peach explicitly stated that Cross\u2019s limitations could not be verified without an FCE. MetLife never ordered one.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Instead, MetLife unreasonably inferred Cross\u2019s abilities from the evidence before it. MetLife relied on the surveillance tapes, which were mere snapshots of Cross\u2019s activities over the course of several days. It did not address Dr. Lee and Dr. Ito\u2019s reports that these activities caused Cross an increase in pain. MetLife relied on an IME by Dr. Peach, the only one of MetLife\u2019s physicians who actually examined Cross. Dr. Peach concluded, however, that he could not validly assess Cross\u2019s actual limitations. MetLife relied on Dr. Gosline\u2019s report, which spoke only to Cross\u2019s psychiatric condition and did not address Cross\u2019s physical limitations. It relied on Dr. Greenhood\u2019s rather concluso-ry report, which stated Cross was capable of \u201clight work\u201d but which did not address Cross\u2019s specific abilities and limitations. Finally, MetLife relied on Dr. Ito\u2019s report, which concluded that Cross could \u201ctolerate sedentary to light activity\u201d conditioned on a number of accommodations. MetLife, however, made no determination of whether these accommodations could be integrated into Cross\u2019s prior position.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">At the same time, MetLife arbitrarily discounted the ample evidence supporting Cross\u2019s disability: the reports of Cross\u2019s treating physicians; Cross\u2019s clear record of pain; his adverse diagnoses, surgery, epidural injections, and extensive medication regimen; and the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cross suffered from \u201csevere\u201d impairments and \u201ccannot perform on a sustained basis, even at the \u2018sedentary\u2019 level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">In light of the above findings, MetLife\u2019s determination that Cross is capable of performing his prior occupation is not supported by a reasonable grounds. Accordingly, we find MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate Cross\u2019s benefits to be arbitrary and capricious, and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">AFFIRMED, IN PART; VACATED, IN PART; AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">.

It appears that the district court also granted Cross\u2019s motion for attorneys' fees, but it did not set forth its reasoning for doing so. In an order dated August 15, 2007, the court states initially that \"Plaintiff's motion for attorney\u2019s fees (Doc.

Then, on May 8, 2008, the court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend its motion for attorneys' fees. This order is the final entry in the docket. We thus vacate the district court's August 15, 2007 order granting Cross\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for the district court to make specific findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
