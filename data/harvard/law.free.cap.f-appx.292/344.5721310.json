Lopez-Morales, </em>256 Fed.Appx. 726 (2007), and remanded this matter for further consideration in the light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Lopez-Morales v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2933, 171 L.Ed.2d 862 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">In our first decision, we rejected Lopez\u2019 assertions that the district court had erroneously applied a presumption of reasonableness to the advisory guidelines sentencing range and had failed to give adequate weight to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We held: that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s remarks at sentencing show that Lopez\u2019s sentence was the result of a balancing of the proper factors, including the guidelines and the considerations of \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d; and that the presumption-of-reasonableness issue, as conceded by Lopez, was foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). 256 Fed.Appx. at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court held: courts of appeals may not use a rigid, mathematical formula in reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to depart from the properly-calculated guidelines sentencing range, nor may they require a district court to show extraordinary circumstances to depart from that range. 128 S.Ct. at 595. The Court further held: district court sentencing decisions are subject to abuse-of-diseretion review; and courts of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly-calculated guidelines sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-24\">Subsequent to remand, the parties were instructed to file briefs addressing the impact, if any, of <em>Gall </em>on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>matter. Lopez essentially repeats his original contentions that the district court applied an erroneous presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines sentencing range, an assertion we have already rejected and that is unaffected by <em>Gall </em>Lopez also appears to contend that the district court\u2019s reliance on the eontrolled-sub-stance guidelines was error because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In any event, that issue was not raised in Lopez\u2019 appeal here and is not within the scope of the remand from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
