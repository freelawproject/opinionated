DeFonzo denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. <em>In re Xue Yu Li, </em>No. A98 769 667 (B.I.A. Nov. 2, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 769 667 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 1, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s pretermission of Li\u2019s asylum application, as she fails to raise a question of law or constitutional claim in challenging that finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 328-29 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">When, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>superced-ed by statute </em>as <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We conclude that the IJ properly found that the evidence Li submitted failed to establish that individuals \u201cwho had given birth to United States citizen children have been subjected to coerced sterilization procedures\u201d in China. As the Government correctly argues, none of the evidence that Li submitted addresses whether and how persons with foreign-born children are sanctioned pursuant to the family planning policy. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. U.S.I.N.S., </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (finding that the petitioner\u2019s fear of sterilization based on the birth of his children in the United States was speculative where the record lacked \u201csolid support\u201d for that claim). Moreover, Li\u2019s argument that the IJ ignored her testimony regarding the sterilization of her family members in China is unavailing, because she did not assert that any of these individuals were sterilized because they had a child outside of China. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 338 n. 17 (\u201c[W]e presume that an IJ has taken into account all of the evidence before him, unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d). Accordingly, she did not show that any similarly situated family members faced the persecution alleged. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Properly construing Li\u2019s appeal as a motion to remand, the BIA denied the motion and found that the documents that she submitted that were unavailable prior to her hearing in 2006 did not warrant remand. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] motion to remand that relies on newly available evidence is held to the substantive requirements of a motion to reopen.).\u201d Specifically, the BIA properly found that neither the 2005 U.S. Department of State Country Report nor the \u201cTips for Travelers to the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d address the sanctions that would be imposed on individuals who return to China with foreign-born children. In her brief to this Court, Li fails to present any argument to the contrary. Additionally, the BIA found that the other documents Li submitted \u201cwere previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>available and could have been presented for the March 1, 2006, hearing,\u201d as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). While Li argues that the BIA abused its discretion in failing to consider the evidence that she submitted with her appeal, she fails to demonstrate that the documents that the BIA did not specifically address were unavailable or undiseoverable at the time of her hearing. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
