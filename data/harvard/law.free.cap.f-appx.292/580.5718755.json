Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 05-76904 and deny the petition for review in No. 06-73198.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of Hossain\u2019s application for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see also Bazua-Cota v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 747, 748 (9th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Hossain\u2019s contention that the agency failed to weigh the equities properly is not a colorable due process claim, and so does not confer jurisdiction. <em>See Bazua-Cota, </em>466 F.3d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">Hossain contends that the IJ violated due process by exhibiting bias. Contrary to Hossain\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We agree with the BIA that the performance of Hossain\u2019s former counsel did not result in prejudice, and thus Hossain\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (petitioner must show prejudice to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). We do not consider Hossain\u2019s contentions regarding his former counsel\u2019s competence because the prejudice determination is dis-positive. Cf<em>. Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (BIA must address competence where prejudice is not dispositive).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">No. 05-76904: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">No. 06-73198: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
