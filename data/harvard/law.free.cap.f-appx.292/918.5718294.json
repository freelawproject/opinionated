Salazar (\u201cSalazar\u201d) seeks review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Salazar v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>No. AT-0752-07-0838-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct.26, 2007) <em>(\u201cDecision\u201d), review denied, Salazar v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>No. AT-0752-07-0838-I-1, 108 M.S.P.R. 577 (M.S.P.B. Feb.14, 2008). Because the Board did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction, or that Salazar failed to show breach of the settlement agreement, we <em>affvnn,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Salazar was employed as an engineer by the Department of Energy (\u201cthe agency\u201d) in Aiken, South Carolina. In 2003, the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), and later the agency, conducted an investigation of Salazar, which revealed that Salazar had given false personal information to the agency. On April 19, 2004, the agency proposed Salazar\u2019s removal, in part, for making false statements regarding his educational qualifications and country of birth. Salazar responded in writing to the proposed removal, in which he suggested several options for a \u201cwin-win scenario,\u201d including \u201can early out retirement\u201d or \u201cthe opportunity to resign without repercussions.\u201d In June 2004, Salazar and the agency entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the agency\u2019s proposed removal, the basic premise of which was that Salazar would remain employed \u201cuntil he [wa]s eligible for early retirement from Federal Service, which is currently calculated as August 25, 2005.\u201d On August 25, 2005, Salazar filed an \u201cApplication for Immediate Retirement,\u201d on which he listed his date of birth as January 30, 1954. The application was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">On February 8, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Salazar on four counts related to making false statements in his employment and retirement applications. The jury subsequently convicted Salazar on two counts: (i) Count 2, which involved his false statement \u201cthat he was born in Nogales, Arizona, when ... he was born in Nogales, Mexico\u201d; and (ii) Count 4, which involved his knowing and willful submission of an application for immediate retirement in which he falsely asserted \u201cthat he was born on January 30, 1954, when, in truth ..., he was born on January 30, 1958, and was therefore not eligible for retirement.\u201d Following Salazai\u2019\u2019s conviction, OPM notified him that, because of his failure to meet the age and service requirements at the time of his retirement, his annuity would be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">On July 10, 2007, Salazar appealed to the Board, alleging that his retirement pursuant to the settlement agreement was involuntary. He also argued, alternatively, that the agency breached the settlement agreement. The Board dismissed Salazar\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Salazar\u2019s retirement was not involuntary. The Board\u2019s conclusion was based on Salazar\u2019s express acknowledgment in the settlement agreement that he was signing the agreement voluntarily, as well as evidence in the record that the early retirement was Salazar\u2019s idea. <em>Decision </em>at 3. The Board also rejected Salazar\u2019s contention that the agency had breached the settlement agreement. The Board concluded that, even if the agency had revealed Salazar\u2019s false statements to the government in violation of a confidentiality provision, \u201cas a matter of public policy, an agreement between an agency and a former employee in settlement of an appeal from an adverse action cannot be construed as barring the United States from making criminal referrals based on the underlying conduct.\u201d <em>Decision, </em>at 4 (citing <em>Fomby-Denson v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>247 F.3d 1366, 1377-78 (Fed.Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>2001)). Salazar timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Our scope of review of Board decisions is defined and limited by statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation, having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). Salazar, as the petitioner, bears the burden of demonstrating error in the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record, as well as Salazar\u2019s arguments urging reversal, but find no basis to disturb the Board\u2019s decision. Salazar\u2019s arguments on appeal relate primarily to his contention that his retirement was involuntary. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 3 (arguing that he \u201cwas coerced or had <em>no choice </em>but to sign the agreement.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Based on the evidence in the record, however, the Board did not err in finding that Salazar\u2019s acceptance of the settlement agreement was voluntary, and thus plainly did not rise to the \u201cdemanding legal standard\u201d we have set for showing involuntariness. <em>See Garcia v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2006) (en banc). Consequently, the Board did not err in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over Salazar\u2019s appeal. The Board also did not err in concluding that Salazar failed to show breach of the settlement agreement. As the Board correctly concluded, any confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement could not prohibit the agency, as a matter of public policy, from reporting Salazar\u2019s misconduct to the appropriate authority for prosecution. <em>See Fomby-Denson, </em>247 F.3d at 1377-78. Moreover, Salazar cannot be heard to complain about any breach, as it is evident from the criminal proceeding that he is not eligible for early retirement benefits. For these reasons, the decision of the Board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
