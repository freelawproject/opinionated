Bell appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>her sentence. She argues that the district court\u2019s loss calculation is incorrect and that both the loss amount and her base offense level should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to properly calculate and consider the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when fashioning a sentence. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). When reviewing a sentence, we consider whether the district court committed significant procedural error and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district coui\u2019t\u2019s sentencing decision is ultimately reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.', see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564 (5th Cm.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Bell has shown no significant procedural error in connection with her sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court\u2019s findings concerning the amount of loss are plausible when considered in view of the record as a whole and thus are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Janes, </em>475 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Bell. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 564. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
