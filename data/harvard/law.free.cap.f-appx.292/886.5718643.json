On appeal, Oliver argues that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing because his counsel, Billy L. Spruell (\u201cSpruell\u201d), did not inform him of a plea offer extended by the government on the eve of his trial and he meets the criteria for an evidentiary hearing in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-22\">This Court reviews the denial of an evi-dentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2002). An evidentiary hearing must be held on a motion to vacate \u201cunless the motion and files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). However, \u201con habeas a federal district court need not conduct an evidentiary hearing if it can be conclusively determined from the record that the petitioner was not denied effective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>counsel.\u201d <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). On review, the district court \u201cmust accept all of the petitioner\u2019s alleged facts as true and determine whether the petitioner has set forth a valid claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">To prevail on an effective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must demonstrate both (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>ie., </em>the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To meet the deficient performance prong of the <em>Strickland- </em>test, a defendant must show that counsel made errors so serious that he or she was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Oliver\u2019s motion without an evidentiary hearing because the record reflects that Oliver was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Accepting Oliver\u2019s alleged facts as true, Oliver\u2019s attorney failed to inform him of the government\u2019s eve-of-trial plea offer, which constitutes deficient performance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (stating that defense counsel has a duty \u201cto consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution\u201d). However, Oliver has not demonstrated prejudice as a result of his attorney\u2019s error. When a defendant challenges a not-guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In <em>Coulter, </em>this Court rejected a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the defendant could not show that, absent counsel\u2019s errors, he would have accepted the plea offer. <em>Id. </em>Here, Oliver stated only that he would have \u201cseriously considered\u201d the government\u2019s plea offer, which, as in <em>Coulter, </em>falls short of the required standard. In addition, Oliver maintained his innocence throughout trial and during his sentencing, which undermines his claim that he would have consented to a plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>(rejecting-defendant\u2019s claim that he would have accepted a plea agreement when he had not indicated any desire to plead guilty prior to his conviction). As a result, Oliver has not established that, but for Spruell\u2019s failure to inform him of the government\u2019s proposed plea offer, the outcome would h\u00e1ve been different. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Oliver\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. Oliver\u2019s counsel, Spruell, stated in an affidavit that \"neither of us\u201d seriously considered the plea agreement offered by the government on the eve of trial. The district court interpreted that statement as implying that Oliver and Spruell had discussed the plea offer. However, Spruell stated that he did not remember discussing the plea offer with Oliver. Oliver alleges that \"neither of us\u201d referred to Spruell and his co-counsel, not Spruell and Oliver. The district court was bound to accept Oliver's allegation on this point as true. <em>Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 834. However, as discussed in the remainder of this opinion, Oliver cannot meet the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\">. As the district court did, we afford little weight to Oliver's claim before the district court that he would have accepted the government's plea offer. This is because Oliver stated in an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that he would have \"seriously considered\" the plea offer. The statement made under penalty of perjury is entitled to more weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
