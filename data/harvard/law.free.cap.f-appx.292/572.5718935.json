Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and constitutional claims. Vasquez-<em>Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to them qualifying relatives. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the hardship standard fell within the broad range authorized by the statute, <em>see Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2003), and petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency violated their due process rights by failing properly to consider them hardship evidence does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that them removal would result in the deprivation of their children\u2019s rights is not supported. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Urbano de Malaluan v. INS, </em>577 F.2d 589, 594 (9th Cir.1978) (rejecting argument that deportation of parents amounts to de facto deportation of child and thus violates child\u2019s constitutional rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The BIA also did not err when it declined to consider new evidence presented by petitioners on appeal. Under regulations effective September 25, 2002, the BIA is not permitted to \u201cengage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals,\u201d and petitioners did not file a motion to remand. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">We do not address whether the agency erred in determining that Contreras\u2019 conviction for spousal battery falls under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2), precluding his eligibility for cancellation of removal, because the hardship determination is dispositive. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) (to be eligible for cancellation of removal the applicant must establish the requisite hardship).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b595-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
