At sentencing, the district court made a specific finding that Ayala-Vasquez\u2019s 1994 California conviction of possessing marihuana for the purpose of a sale was a drug trafficking offense for purposes of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>For the first time on appeal, Ayala-Vasquez argues that the district court erred in imposing the 16-level enhancement based on the California conviction. Because Ayala-Vasquez did not raise this issue in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">It is undisputed that Ayala-Vasquez was convicted under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11359, which states, \u201cEvery person who possesses for sale any marijuana, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d In <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471, 473-76 (5th Cir. 2005), we held that an offense under Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11351 constituted a drug trafficking offense. Section 11351 provides, \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this division, every person who possesses for sale or purchases for purposes of sale\u201d certain controlled substances shall be punished by imprisonment. In <em>Palacios-Quinonez, </em>it was conceded that possession for sale was a drug trafficking offense. <em>Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d at 474. Our analysis there also equated \u201cpurchase for sale\u201d with \u201cpossession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474-76. On appeal, Ayala-Vasquez has not shown that the district court plainly erred in finding that his prior conviction was a drug trafficking offense and in sentencing him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Ayala-Vasquez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Ar-rellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-17\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
