Petitioner also seeks review of the denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings which was based on petitioner\u2019s new evidence of hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relatives. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003). We, therefore dismiss petitioner\u2019s petition for review from the BIA\u2019s underlying denial of his application for cancellation of removal relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In his motion to reopen, petitioner offered new evidence of hardship by submitting evidence that his children were suffering depression and educational difficulties in the wake of deportation proceedings against petitioner. We conclude that the BIA considered the new evidence, and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in No. 06-75747; PETITION FOR REVIEW FOR REVIEW DENIED in No. 07-72053.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
