We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Sanchez-Espinoza contends that the district court impermissibly enhanced his sentence beyond the two-year statutory maximum based upon a prior conviction that was neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This contention is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. CovianSandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Sanchez-Espinoza also contends that the district court erred in failing to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and by attaching a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines. This contention fails as the record reflects that the district court imposed the within-Guidelines range sentence after properly considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Sanehez-Espinoza\u2019s request for a downward departure and arguments in mitigation. Furthermore, the district court expressly noted that the Guidelines were not binding. The district court did not procedurally err, and the sentence is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 994-95 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
