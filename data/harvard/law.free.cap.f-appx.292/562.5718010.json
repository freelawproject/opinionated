Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims. <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 923 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The agency denied Londono\u2019s cancellation of removal application in the exercise of discretion. We lack jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe [have] interpreted [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)] to encompass all discretionary decisions involved in the cancellation of removal context, including the ultimate discretionary decision to deny relief.\u201d); <em>see also Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Londono contends that he was denied a full and fair hearing because the IJ failed to advise him to apply for asylum and voluntary departure. We agree with the BIA that Londono was not prejudiced. He pointed to no evidence that his fear of persecution in Colombia was based on a protected ground, and he did not have a reasonable possibility of being eligible for voluntary departure. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, an individual must show error and substantial prejudice); <em>cf. Bui v. INS, </em>76 F.3d 268, 270 (9th Cir.1996) (IJ must inform an alien of \u201ca reasonable possibility that the alien may be eligible for relief\u2019). Our conclusion that Londono was not prejudiced also disposes of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>conduct may have affected the outcome of proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
