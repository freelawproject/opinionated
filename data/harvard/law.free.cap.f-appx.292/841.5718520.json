Pruett argues that the district court erred by denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>him as untimely a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he entered his plea a few hours before trial. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a) (Nov.1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We review factual findings concerning a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir. 2005). The defendant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to the reduction, and the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57. An error in sentencing may be harmless if the district court would have entered the same sentence without the error. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Under section 3El.l(a), a defendant who proves acceptance of responsibility is entitled to a two-level decrease in his offense level. In determining whether the defendant has accepted responsibility, the commentary states that the court should consider eight factors, including \u201cthe timeliness of the defendant\u2019s conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1(h). Subsection (b) provides for a further one-level decrease if (1) the defendant qualifies under subsection (a); (2) the defendant\u2019s offense level is at level 16 or greater; and (3) the government files a \u201cmotion ... stating that the defendant [had timely notified] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(b). The commentary to section 3E1.1 explains, \u201cBecause the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 6. In addition, \u201ctimeliness of [a] defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is a consideration under\u201d both subsections (a) and (b), and it is \u201ccontext specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We treat the commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual as authoritative. <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Pruett\u2019s plea was not timely. Pruett entered his plea of guilt only a few hours before trial. Alternatively, Pruett concedes, in his reply brief, that the district court would have entered the same sentence, absent any miscalculation, so any error was harmless. We affirm Pruett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
