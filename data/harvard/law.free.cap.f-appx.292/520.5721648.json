On appeal, Niehaus argues that her confinement in a residential re-entry center is unreasonable, and that her revocation sentence is greater than necessary to meet the statutory goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Niehaus\u2019s challenge to this condition of her sentence is moot because she has been released from the residential re-entry center. <em>Cf. Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 5-7, 18, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (habeas challenge to parole revocation became moot upon expiration of sentence). After careful review, we conclude that her revocation sentence, which is within statutory limits, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, is not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825-26 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (court reviews revocation sentences under \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standard announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>see also United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005) (reasonableness of sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion, which occurs if court fails to consider relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only appropriate factors but commits clear error of judgment in weighing factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-14\">.
