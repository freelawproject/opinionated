We conclude that the BIA considered the new evidence, and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b712-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
