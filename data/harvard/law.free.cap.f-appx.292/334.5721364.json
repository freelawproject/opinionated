The district court gTanted a downward departure of six monkks from iow end of the guidelines r\u00a3fflge and sentenced Garza to 64 months.</p>\n<p id=\"a6h-dedup-0\">Garza challenges his sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He asserts that the distl'ict court misaPplied the criteria to determine substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. He contends that instead of evaluating his assistance to the Government, the district court utilized the criteria for the application of the safety valve provision. He argues that the error affected the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"axk-dedup-0\">Because Garza did not object on these specific grounds in the district court, re-y\u00a1ew is for plain error only. <em>See United, States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>-U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679\u2019 681 (5th Cir-2007)- Under Plain\u2122 review\u2019 even \u00fc there is obvious eiTOr that affects substantial rights&gt; we need not C01\" rect the error unless failure to do so would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or Publie reputation of judicial proceedings, <em>jones </em>489 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"AN8k\">, A district court has discretion to choose the appropriate sentence within the advisory range and to determine \u201cthe appropriate extent of a departure.\u201d <em>United, States v. Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d 36, 39 (5th Cir.1995); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>see also United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 183 (5th Cir.2006). Despite the latitude courts are given under \u00a7 5K1.1, a judicial inquiry into each individual case is required to ensure an independent determination of the propriety and extent of any sentencing departure. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>33 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994). [T]he court is free to deny departure or to grant a departure which is greater or smallen than that recommended by the government.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>33 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">The assessment of a departure begins with the factors enumerated in \u00a7 5K1.1, but a district court may consider additional factors \u201crelated to determining the nature, extent, and significance of assistance.\u201d <em>Desselle, </em>450 F.3d at 182. The extent of a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure must be based solely on assistance-related concerns. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJq\">The record demonstrates that the district court considered the nature and extent of Garza\u2019s assistance in the invest\u00ed-gation of other criminal activity and the usefulness of his assistance. Because the court based its departure decision on at least two of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors, Garza cannot establish that it committed a violation of law by granting a six-month downward departure rather than the departure recommended by the parties. <em>See Johnson, </em>33 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">Garza\u2019s argument, that the district court misapplied the criteria to determine a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 because the court believed that Garza was required to provide more information than what he had already disclosed to qualify for the safety-valve, is unavailing. The downward departure of six months indicates that the court believed that Garza provided some assistance in excess of that taken into account by the safety-valve provision. Garza has not shown an error that is plain or that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Jones, </em>489 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"ALk\">Garza avers that the district court erroneously reduced the extent of the downward departure in anticipation of a potential future reduction under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) and that error is a violation of law. Because Garza preserved the objection, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 182. \u201cA district court abuses fts discretion if it departs on the basis of legal]y unacceptable reasons or if the degree of the departure is unreasonable.\u201d M (intepnal quotation marks and citation omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">The district court considered appropriate factors in making the downward departure and did not abuse its discretion by considering future Rule 35 downward departure recommendations in determining extent 0f the departure. <em>See Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d at 36 n. 5. Accordingly, Garza has not shown abuse of discretion. <em>Desselle, </em>450 F.3d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">Garza contends the district court\u2019s failure to grant the extent of the downward departure requested by the government resulted in an unreasonable sentence. Once an appellate court has decided that there has been no \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence,\u201d that court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Garza did not object to reasonableness in the district court, review is for plain error, <em>See Hemandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d at 272; <em>Jones, </em>489 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The district court based its sentencing decision on the seriousness of the offense, the need to provide just punishment and respect for the law, and the need to pro- , ,^ tect the public. Garza has not shown er- , , , . . , ror, much less plam error, with respect to , \u2019 ,. ,. \u201e T substantive reasonableness. <em>See Jones, </em>^ 489 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"AVk\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"aqa-dedup-1\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
