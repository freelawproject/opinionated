We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 595 (9th Cir.2004), and review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s factual findings, <em>Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that petitioners and their attorney both were served with the notice of the changed hearing date and the notice sent to petitioners was not returned as undeliverable; that the petitioners did not keep in contact with their attorney; and that petitioners have not made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (defining exceptional circumstances as \u201ccircumstances ... beyond the control of the alien\u201d); <em>Reyes, </em>358 F.3d at 596 (requiring <em>Lozada </em>compliance to establish exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel). The BIA therefore did not abuse its discretion by dismissing petitioners\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
