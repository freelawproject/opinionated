On appeal, counsel has filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, noting that Person waived the right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement and, thus, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. In the event this court invalidates the waiver, counsel asserts that Person\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because the career offender designation overstates the seriousness of Person\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon Person\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his light to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162,168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Person knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. Moreover, the sentencing issues raised on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver. We therefore grant, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude our review of any errors in Person\u2019s conviction that may be revealed by our review pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>Our review of the transcript of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Person\u2019s guilty plea and that any omissions did not affect his substantial rights. The district court ensured that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily and was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFus-co, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir. 1991). Thus, we deny, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues not covered by the waiver. We therefore affirm Person\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform the client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. <em>Anders v.

To the extent he asserts that counsel provided ineffective assistance, we decline to review those claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v.
