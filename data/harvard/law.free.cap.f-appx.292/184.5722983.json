He alleges that the defendants have retaliated against him for exercising his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. Convicted sex offenders confined at the STU are required to participate in treatment sessions during which they are told disclose their past, sexually violent behavior to other group members. Aruanno refuses to participate vocally in these sessions, because he argues that he is being compelled to confess to crimes that he has not committed. Since he has refused to reveal his sexual history during these therapy sessions, the defendants have withheld certain privileges, such as his job (including unpaid back wages), television, and stereo. They have also placed him in \u201ctreatment refusal status,\u201d thereby impeding his progression through the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">After screening the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the District Court allowed Aruanno\u2019s First Amendment claim to proceed, but dismissed Aruanno\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim, concluding that he could no longer claim a right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court further noted that any possibility that his admissions during his treatment program could lead to further prosecution was \u201cremote and speculative.\u201d Later, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the surviving claim on qualified immunity grounds. Aruanno timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>a District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>See Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 232-33 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">The Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause provides that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal [proceeding] to be a witness against himself.\u201d This right, however, does not apply in the absence of compulsion. <em>See Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 806, 97 S.Ct. 2132, 53 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977). And, \u201c[n]ot all pressure necessarily \u2018eompel[s] incriminating statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 49, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002)(0\u2019Connor J., concurring in the judgment). In <em>McKune, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a Kansas prison treatment program that withheld privileges from inmates convicted of sex offenses who refused to disclose the details of them prior sexually violent histories during therapy. <em>Id. </em>As the court found, there is no compulsion triggering a right under the Fifth Amendment where the consequences of an in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>mate\u2019s refusal to participate in a therapy program are related to its objectives and impose no \u201catypical and significant hardships\u201d in relation to the ordinary incidents of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the Fifth Amendment protects against \u201creal dangers, not remote and speculative possibilities.\u201d <em>Zicarelli v. N.J. State Comm'n of Investigation, </em>406 U.S. 472, 478, 92 S.Ct. 1670, 32 L.Ed.2d 234 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In this case, Aruanno\u2019s claim cannot succeed, because he does not demonstrate that he faces the possibility of a penalty \u201cso great as to constitute compulsion\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. <em>McKune, </em>536 U.S. at 49, 122 S.Ct. 2017. Aruanno argues that the consequence for his refusal to participate in the group therapy sessions \u2014 the denial of a prison job, television and other similar privileges\u2014 compels him to reveal potentially incriminating statements in the group therapy sessions. We disagree. The deprivation of a prison job may pressure Aruanno to pai-ticipate vocally in the group therapy sessions, but it does not compel him within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, Aruanno neither shows a grave possibility of prosecution for disclosing his prior violent sexual history, nor does he anticipate parole proceedings where such information would be revealed and, as a result, lengthen his period of confinement. <em>See Zicarelli, </em>406 U.S. at 478, 92 S.Ct. 1670. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The First Amendment right to freedom of thought encompasses \u201cthe right to refrain from speaking at all.\u201d <em>Wooley v. Maynard, </em>430 U.S. 705, 714, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977). However, it is well established that in the penological context, \u201can inmate does not retain those Fust Amendment rights that are inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the penological objectives of the corrections system.\u201d <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 129, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977)(quoting <em>Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)). Nevertheless, we note that other courts have determined that, for the purposes of the First Amendment, a detained sexually violent predator\u2019s \u201crefusal to recognize [his] \u2018illness\u2019 or affirmatively participate in treatment is not inherently inconsistent with the purposes for which [sexually violent predators] are detained.\u201d <em>See Hydride v. Hunter, </em>500 F.3d 978, 991-92 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Despite that, Aruanno cannot obtain relief under this claim. He alleges that defendants are denying him a job and other privileges for not participating vocally in treatment. But even so, these consequences for refusing to describe his past sexual behavior are not so severe that participation in treatment is essentially compulsory. <em>See, e.g., McKune, </em>536 U.S. at 49, 122 S.Ct. 2017 (finding that, in a case where an inmate refused to participate in a sexual abuse treatment program, certain changes in living conditions, such as restrictions in visitation privileges, reduction in wages from prison employment, and a transference from a medium security to maximum security facility program, were not \u201cserious enough\u201d to constitute unconstitutional compulsion). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Aruanno is being compelled to speak so as to trigger a right under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In any case, we agree with the District Court that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. When evaluating whether qualified immunity relieves defendants of liability for damages arising from a civil rights suit, we must evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>whether their conduct violated clearly established statutory or constitutional law of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>See Berg v. County of Allegheny, </em>219 F.3d 261, 272 (3d Cir.2000). In this case, even if we were to conclude that Aruanno had a right to refrain from disclosing his past sexual history and we have not so concluded, we could not hold that the right is clearly established under the First Amendment, and that it was one of which defendants should have been aware. <em>See, e.g., Hydrick, </em>500 F.3d at 992. This is particularly so since the group therapy sessions appear to be related to the purposes for which Aruanno has been civilly confined. And, we have not yet established what constitutional limits, if any, there are on the state\u2019s conditioning of privileges for confined sexually violent predators on vocally participating in these kinds of therapy programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\">. The District Court dismissed Aruanno's Fifth Amendment claim without prejudice, giving him an opportunity to amend his complaint to plead facts demonstrating compulsion. However, Aruanno failed to file an amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
