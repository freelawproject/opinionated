The district court sentenced Dixon principally to a term of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> Dixon argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because Judge Sand erroneously believed his task was to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence, rather than \u201c \u2018a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u2019 of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>United, States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006)). In sentencing Dixon, Judge Sand said that \u201c[t]he question is what is a reasonable sentence under all the facts and circumstances.\u201d Dixon protests that reasonableness is the appellate standard of review of sentences, not the standard to be applied by district judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">We rejected this argument when reviewing a sentence following a <em>Crosby </em>remand. <em>See Williams, </em>475 F.3d at 477 (\u201cWilliams has failed to demonstrate that the District Court\u2019s reference to the appellate standard of review when deciding whether to resen-tence him constituted reversible error. There is no indication in the record that the District Court\u2019s reference to its duty to impose a sentence that was \u2018reasonable\u2019 affected in any way its assessment of whether resentencing ... was warranted.\u201d (internal citation omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Ministro-Tapia, </em>470 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A district] court\u2019s reference to imposing a \u2018reasonable\u2019 sentence under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as opposed to say an \u2018appropriate,\u2019 \u2018sensible,\u2019 or \u2018fair\u2019 sentence under those factors, ... does not invariably plant the seeds of reversible error\u2019 \u201d (some alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>461 F.3d 752, 756 (6th Cir.2006))). Judge Sand\u2019s offhand reference to his duty to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence does not indicate that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. Nothing in the record suggests that Judge Sand failed to give due consideration to the applicable sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> Dixon argues that his sentence was unreasonably long given that [i] the Guidelines ranges for other offenses that he regards as more serious than his are lower; [ii] the government offers illegal reentrants lower sentences in \u201cfast-track\u201d districts elsewhere in the country; and [iii] he reentered the United States to care for his ill son.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. Although we do not presume that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable, we have \u201crecognize[d] that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">As to [i], there was no error because the Guidelines\u2019 16-level enhancement for illegal reentrants who were previously convicted of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), reflects Congress\u2019s intent to impose increasingly serious penalties depending on the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s pre-deportation criminal history. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">As to [ii], we have rejected this precise argument before and do so again. <em>See United States v. Hendry, </em>522 F.3d 239, 241-42 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201cthe absence of a fast-track program does not require the court to adjust the sentence\u201d to prevent a sentencing disparity, and rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe fact that other courts give lower sentences [in such districts] demonstrates that lower sentences suffice to meet the aims enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Finally, as to [iii], Judge Sand acknowledged Dixon\u2019s stated reason for reentering the United States, but observed that Dixon then remained in the country for years after the death of his son. Accordingly, Judge Sand was reasonably skeptical of Dixon\u2019s assertion that he reentered the country solely to care for his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In all, we cannot conclude that Dixon\u2019s sentence \u2014 which is at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 falls outside \u201cthe broad range of sentences that would be reasonable.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Finding no merit in Dixon\u2019s remaining arguments, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
