We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the dismissal de novo, and factual findings for clear error. <em>O\u2019Guinn v. Lovelock Corr. Ctr., </em>502 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-24\">Johnson contends for the first time on appeal that he exhausted prison administrative remedies. He states that the prison rejected his grievance because of a pending investigation into staff misconduct. We decline to consider this contention, which is based on facts presented for the first time in Johnson\u2019s opening brief. <em>See Dream Palace v. County of Maricopa, </em>384 F.3d 990, 1005 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cOrdinarily, we decline to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. This rule serves to ensure that legal arguments are considered with the benefit of a fully developed factual record, offers appellate courts the benefit of the district court\u2019s prior analysis, and prevents parties from sandbagging their opponents with new arguments on appeal.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States v.
