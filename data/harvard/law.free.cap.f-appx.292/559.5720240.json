R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b582-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Florindo Pablo-Bautista, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir.2005). We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Pablo-Bautista has shown extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Pablo-Bautista\u2019s asylum claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Pablo-Bautista failed to establish either past persecution or a clear probability of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002). Pablo-Bautista\u2019s experiences do not compel the conclusion that he has established a pattern of persecution based on his family membership. <em>See Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991). Moreover, Pablo-Bautista failed to establish a nexus to an imputed political opinion, because he did not show his alleged persecutors knew or assumed he held a particular political belief. <em>See Molina-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1094-95; <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\">. Because Pablo-Bautista is ineligible for asylum, we do not review his contention that he is entitled to humanitarian asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
