Herrera filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to challenge his conviction and sentence, and he moved this court for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. Herrera was granted a COA on the issue whether the district court erred by determining that Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">Herrera argues that his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed and that the district court improperly calculated the time he had to take a direct appeal. The Government agrees that the district court\u2019s timeliness calculations were flawed but contends that this court may affirm the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief on the basis that Herrera\u2019s claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">We agree that the district court erred by determining that Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely. When conducting its timeliness analysis, the district court determined that Herrera had ten calendar days, rather than ten working days, to file his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), 26(a)(1),(2). We conclude that Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\">We may affirm the denial of Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Aeby v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 1, 2 (5th Cir.1969). Nevertheless, the record is not sufficiently developed to permit consideration of Herrera\u2019s claims on the merits. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
