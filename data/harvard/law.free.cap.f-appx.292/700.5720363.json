He appeals his convictions on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">1. Eye-witness identification</p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">We assume without deciding that the identification given at the scene of the accident and the photo array presentations several days after the accident were impermissibly suggestive and that the district court erred by admitting the subsequent identification testimony at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>150 F.3d 983, 992-93 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing standard for admission). Nevertheless, any error was harmless due to the substantial evidence of Ortiz-Romero\u2019s pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Simoy, </em>998 F.2d 751, 753 n. 1 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">2. <em>Daubert </em>error</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Similarly, although the district court erred by not making an express finding that Officer Vandiver\u2019s challenged expert testimony was reliable, the error was harmless due to Officer Vandiver\u2019s qualifications and the other, admissible testimony of accident reconstruction and blood pattern evidence. <em>See United States v. Jawara, </em>474 F.3d 565, 583 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">3. Instructional error under <em>Lopez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The Government concedes that the jury instructions in this case were erroneous, as to the \u201cbringing to\u201d counts, because the instructions mischaracterized the termination point of a \u201cbringing to\u201d offense. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>484 F.3d 1186, 1191 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201creject[ing] the \u2018immediate destination\u2019 (or ultimate destination) test set forth in <em>United States v. Ramirez-Martinez </em>[273 F.3d 903 (9th Cir.2001) ]\u201d). Nevertheless, the error was harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The evidence clearly established that the aliens were not dropped off at a point within the United States\u2014terminating the \u201cbringing to\u201d offense\u2014prior to Ortiz-Romero\u2019s actions. <em>See Lopez, </em>484 F.3d at 1191. Rather, the aliens\u2019 guide stayed with them and directed them into the van driven by Ortiz-Romero. Any rational trier of fact would have concluded that Ortiz-Romero acted to aid and abet the \u201cbringing to\u201d offense prior to the completion of that offense, due to the apparently coordinated effort. The dissent cites our recent case, <em>United States v. Hernandez-Orellana, </em>539 F.3d 994, 1005-06 (9th Cir. 2008) to support a contrary conclusion. However, in that case, no evidence linked the defendant to the planning activities in Mexico. <em>See id. </em>By comparison in this case, the guide linked Ortiz-Romero\u2019s involvement to the activities in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">4. Instructional error under <em>Munoz</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">The Government also concedes that the jury instructions in this case, as to the \u201cbringing to\u201d counts, were erroneous under <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>412 F.3d 1043, 1046-47 (9th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, the error was clearly harmless. We agree with the Government\u2019s statement that \u201cthe evidence overwhelmingly established the pecuniary motive\u201d and that any rational juror would have concluded that Ortiz-Romero acted with the required intent as an aider and abettor to financially benefit a principal to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">5. Prosecutorial misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Finally, we reject Ortiz-Romero\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments, a claim which was not raised below and is therefore reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>462 F.3d 1124, 1136 (9th Cir.2006). Under the circumstances of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not constitute impermissible vouching, nor. did they misconstrue the law regarding the requirement that the jury not speculate, but base its deliberations on the evidence presented, or the lack of evidence. Moreover, even if there was any marginal impropriety in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s remarks, the error was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-20\">. Because we assume error, we do not address whether, as Ortiz-Romero contends, the Government bears the burden of demonstrating the reliability of the in-court identifications by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Cossel v. Miller, </em>229 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">. We reject Ortiz-Romero's argument that the error conceded by the Government is structural. <em>See Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 12-13, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (\"[Tjhis Court has applied harmless-error review in cases where the jury did not render a 'complete verdict\u2019 on every element of the offense ....\u201d); <em>cf. Powell v. Galaza, </em>328 F.3d 558, 566 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe instructional errors at issue in <em>Carella, Neder </em>and <em>Rose </em>were subject to harmless error review precisely because the juries in those cases made other factual findings that were untouched by the court's errors.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b725-6\">PAEZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"adg-dedup-0\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s holding that the instructional error under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>484 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We have found jury-instruction errors to be harmless where the erroneous instruction went to an element which was \u201cuncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gracidas-Ulibarry, </em>231 F.3d 1188, 1197 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Here, however, the question of whether Ortiz-Romero acted before the \u201cbringing to\u201d crime was complete is contested and involves substantial, conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The relevant facts are these: the guide led the aliens on a two-day walk from Mexico to a location within the United States where they awaited further transportation. The guide was continuing on with the group as a passenger; his ultimate destination was Ohio. The aliens and the guide hid for several hours. Eventually, a car came by, asked how many were in the group, and left. Another car came by and told the group to keep waiting. A half-hour later, a car and a van\u2014allegedly driven by Ortiz-Romero\u2014picked up the group. The guide rode in the van with Ortiz-Romero and approximately ten of the aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">In the Government\u2019s view, it is pivotal that, unlike in <em>Lopez, </em>where the guide abandoned his group to await transportation at a point inside the United States, the guide\u2019s involvement here continued at least until he and the aliens entered the van. The Government argues that this shows that the guide continued to \u201ctransport\u201d the aliens until he had shepherded them into the van, and that the guide\u2019s \u201cbringing to\u201d offense thereby extended at least until the point that he and the aliens entered the van. Because Ortiz-Romero began driving the van to the location and waited in the van while the group ran from its hiding place, the Government argues that Ortiz-Romero\u2019s acts in furtherance of the crime occurred before the \u201cbringing to\u201d offense was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">To the contrary, Ortiz-Romero argues that the guide\u2019s crime was complete when he delivered the group to its pick-up point in the desert, near the side of the road. After that point, the guide was present merely as a fellow traveler, not as a leader or transporter. Because the group arrived at the pick-up point several hours before the van arrived at the scene, Ortiz-Romero argues that there is no evidence (or, at least, not overwhelming evidence) that he had any part in transporting the aliens before the guide\u2019s crime of \u201cbringing to\u201d was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">The dispute between the parties, in considering whether Ortiz-Romero \u201cacted before the drop-off to aid and abet the extraterritorial offense,\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>484 F.3d at 1198-99, is at what point the \u201cdrop-off\u201d occurred. This point is essential, because there is no evidence to connect Ortiz-Romero to the broader smuggling scheme, and, therefore, like the driver in <em>Lopez, </em>Ortiz-Romero could have been recruited into the scheme at the \u201clast minute\u201d\u2014i.e., in the hours between the aliens\u2019 arrival at the side of the road and the arrival of the van to pick them up. Moreover, the guide\u2019s presence, by itself, is insufficient to establish Lopez\u2019s connection to the smuggling activities in Mexico. <em>See Lopez, </em>484 F.3d at 1200 (noting that \u201cLopez was contacted on the day she transported the[aliens] only after the aliens were already in the country and the plan for the first person to pick them up had [failed]\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number><em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Orel-lana, </em>539 F.3d 994, 1006 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe evidence ... establishes no explicit extra-territorial connection as <em>Lopez </em>requires\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Ortiz-Romero argues that the \u201cdrop-off\u2019 happened when the group stopped walking and began waiting near the road. After that point, according to Ortiz-Romero, the guide was a mere fellow traveler. The Government, on the other hand, argues that the \u201cdrop-off\u2019 was actually a \u201chand-off,\u201d and that the aliens were not dropped off until they were delivered into the van by the guide. This is a factual dispute. The Government\u2019s theory is legally tenable in light of <em>Lopez, </em>but is not mandated by <em>Lopez. </em>The key is whether, during the period that the group waited to be picked up, the guide was acting as a criminal transporter or as a passenger. That was a determination for the jury. Because of the district court\u2019s erroneous instruction, however, the jury was not presented with that question. Moreover, the error is not harmless, because the evidence is hardly so one-sided that rational jurors could not disagree. A juror might well agree with Ortiz-Romero that the guide\u2019s testimony showed he \u201cdropped off\u2019 the aliens when they reached the pick-up point, and that, from that point on, the guide was present merely because he was waiting for his own ride to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In sum, it is not \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u201d <em>Gracidas-Ulibarry, </em>231 F.3d at 1197 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, I would reverse Ortiz-Romero\u2019s convictions on counts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 16 (the \u201cbringing to\u201d counts) and remand for a new trial on those counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
