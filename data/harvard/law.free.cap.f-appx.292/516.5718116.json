KANNE, Circuit Judge, ANN CLAIRE WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge and JOHN DANIEL TINDER, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b538-22\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b538-23\">Gregory Johnson, an Illinois prisoner, was convicted after a bench trial of first-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. The district court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, adopting outright the state\u2019s reasons urging dismissal set forth in its 70-page response. Johnson now seeks a certificate of appealability, but because the district court failed to analyze Johnson\u2019s claims and articulate the reasons for its decision, we vacate the judgment and remand the case with instructions that the district comply with the dictates of Circuit Rule 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-24\">Johnson raised ten claims in his petition. The state, in its response, contended that eight were procedurally defaulted and that the other two failed on their merits. The district court, noting that it was a \u201cmajor departure\u201d from its usual practice, explained that it was accepting and adopting outright the state\u2019s reasons for dismissal because \u201cextraordinary care had been devoted to all the issues.\u201d The district court offered no other reason for denying relief under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-25\">The district court\u2019s order does not comport with this circuit\u2019s Rules. Circuit Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>50 provides that \u201c[w]henever a district court resolves any claim or counterclaim on the merits, terminates the litigation in its court (as by remanding or transferring the case, or denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis with or without prejudice), or enters an interlocutory order that may be appealed to the court of appeals, the judge shall give his or her reasons, either orally on the record or by written statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We have explained before that a district court who adopts a party\u2019s brief outright as the statement of reasons for granting summary judgment fails to fulfill its obligation under Circuit Rule 50. <em>See Rakestraw v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 1524, 1527 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Wienco, Inc. v. Katahn Associates, Inc., </em>965 F.2d 565, 568 (7th Cir.1992); <em>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>901 F.2d 624, 626 (7th Cir.1990). The same is true when the district court adopts a state\u2019s response outright as the basis for dismissing a \u00a7 2254 petition. As we have said, \u201c[jjudicial adoption of an entire brief ... withholds information about what arguments, in particular, the court found persuasive, and why it rejected contrary views.\u201d <em>DiLeo, </em>901 F.2d at 626. The district court\u2019s order here falls short in this regal'd. And the appropriate remedy for a violation of Rule 50 is to remand the case for compliance with it. <em>Sims v. Lucas, </em>9 F.3d 1293, 1294 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">According, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND the case so that the district court may set forth its reasons for dismissing Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
