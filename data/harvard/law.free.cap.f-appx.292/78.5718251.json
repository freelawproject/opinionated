Straus denying her application for asylum. <em>In re Simech Meas, </em>No. A95 841 147 (B.I.A. Nov. 30, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A95 841 147 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Apr. 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-26\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Liu v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Passi. v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98,100-01 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">We conclude that the agency reasonably found that Meas failed to establish that she suffered past persecution. While Meas asserts that \u201cthe emotional trauma that she suffered by watching the death of her parents\u201d constituted persecution, except in rare circumstances, the persecution of family members \u201cdoes not form the basis for a finding of past persecution.\u201d <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 n. 2 (2d Cir.1999); <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007). <em>But see Jorge-Tzoc v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 146, 150 (2d Cir.2006). Meas also asserts that she suspected that she was being followed by persons from the People\u2019s Party investigating her political activities with the Sam Rainsy Party, and that she was repeatedly told by her supervisor to join the People\u2019s Party. These acts, however, do not constitute persecution, even if Meas perceived them as threatening, where those threats went unfulfilled. <em>See, e.g., Ci Pan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 408, 412-13 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir.2002). On this record, we cannot conclude that the agency erred in deciding that Meas failed to establish past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We further conclude that the agency properly found that Meas failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. While she asserts that she fears returning to Cambodia because \u201cher family told her that police had come looking for her,\u201d she testified that she was not aware that anyone was looking for her in Cambodia. The IJ reasonably found that the evidence failed to establish that the Cambodian government had any interest in Meas, particularly where she continued to work for and be paid by the government. Meas fails to identify evidence in the record to support her claim that the government seeks her arrest. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the IJ erred in making his finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The BIA further noted that Meas\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution was undermined when she traveled to Thailand for vacation in 2001 and returned to Cambodia. That finding was not erroneous, inasmuch as Meas did not assert that she encountered any difficulties upon her return to Cambodia. To the contrary, her testimony and asylum application indicate that she continued to work for the government until she came to the United States. <em>Cf. Wensheug Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir.2007). Further undermining Meas\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear, as the BIA found, is the fact that her child and siblings have resided in Cambodia since she left in September 2001. <em>See Matter of A-E </em>\u2014 , 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1157, 1159-60 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">An asylum applicant asserting eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution is required to present credible testimony that she subjectively fears persecution and establish that her fear is objectively reasonable. <em>See Ramsameachire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). Meas has failed to satisfy the latter requirement, inasmuch as she has not presented \u201creliable, specific, objective supporting evidence\u201d to demonstrate the reasonableness of her fear. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Ccrrdero-Trejo v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 482, 491 (1st Cir.1994)). Accordingly, the agency did not err in finding that Meas failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Because the agency\u2019s conclusion that Meas failed to establish both past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution is dispositive in this case, we need not consider its finding that she failed to establish that the harm she suffered was on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) (requiring an asylum applicant to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
