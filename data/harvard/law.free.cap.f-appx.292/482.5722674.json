For the reasons that follow, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-24\">A native of Boxancan, Guatemala, Ramirez-Felipe came to the United States in 1993, three years before the end of the decades-long Guatemalan civil war. Although he filed an application for asylum in 1993, he never attended an asylum interview and remained in the United States without a grant of asylum and without filing a new application for the next twelve years. In 2005, he filed a new application requesting asylum and withholding of removal and applied for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-25\">At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ), Ramirez-Felipe testified that in the mid-1980s, when he was 11, his mother and three brothers were murdered, and about a month later his father was murdered on the road outside his family\u2019s village. Ramirez-Felipe had \u201cno idea\u201d why his parents and brothers were killed and described the assailants simply as \u201cstrangers\u201d who came to their house. JA 136, 139. In 1990, Ramirez-Felipe was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>conscripted into the government\u2019s civil patrol, and he completed his required service of two-and-a-half years before coming to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The IJ found that Ramirez-Felipe\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his written application. Among other inconsistencies, the IJ noted that Ramirez-Felipe\u2019s written application said that his parents and brothers were killed by the government security forces for being guerrilla sympathizers, while his testimony said that he had \u201cno idea\u201d why his parents and brothers were killed. JA 139. The IJ ultimately denied each of Ramirez-Felipe\u2019s applications, holding that (1) due to the inconsistencies between his testimony and his written application, he was not \u201cfully credible,\u201d JA 80, (2) he did not establish a connection between the violence against his family and any protected ground, (3) even if he had proven persecution on account of a protected ground, the end of the civil war in 1996 meant that \u201cconditions have changed to such an extent that the respondent no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to Guatemala,\u201d JA 85, (4) the failure of his application for asylum doomed his application for withholding of removal, (5) he provided no evidence of past torture and failed to establish that he would more likely than not face torture if he returned to Guatemala and (6) he made no showing that he was eligible for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The BIA affirmed. In a brief opinion, it noted that Ramirez-Felipe did not show that his family members\u2019 murders were related to any protected ground, and that in light of changed country conditions he did not show that he would be subject to harm if he returned to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In his sole assignment of error, Ramirez-Felipe argues that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not based on substantial evidence. The argument contains at least three serious flaws. First, even if he could show that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was unsupported, that would not get him anywhere. While the IJ premised its denial of asylum (and withholding of removal) in part on an adverse credibility determination, the IJ and BIA, in denying these claims, also relied (1) on the absence of any connection between the murders of his family members and a protected ground for asylum and (2) on the existence of changed country conditions brought about by the end of the Guatemalan civil war. Having waived any challenges to these additional explanations for the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions, <em>see Badwan v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 566, 571 (6th Cir. 2007), Ramirez-Felipe necessarily cannot prevail even if he could show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Second, even if Ramirez-Felipe had challenged the other grounds for the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions and had challenged the denial of his torture claim, he still would come up short. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that, because of changed country conditions, Ramirez-Felipe no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in his home country, <em>nee </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A), and substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Ramirez-Felipe does not qualify for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">To be eligible for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b), an alien must prove that he is unable or unwilling to return home \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Even if an applicant establishes past persecution, his application will be denied if there has been \u201ca funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>mental change in circumstances such that [he] no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). Where the BIA adopts and affirms the decision by the IJ but adds its own commentary, we \u201cdirectly review the decision of the IJ while considering the additional comment[s] made by the BIA.\u201d <em>Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 283 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In Ramirez-Felipe\u2019s written application, he suggested that the government attacked his family on account of them actual or imputed association with the guerrillas. <em>See </em>JA 206 (\u201cWhen we returned [to our house] the next morning, we discovered that someone had taken our mother and two older b[r]others away. Other families in the village had recently been taken by Government Security Forces for being supposed guerrilla sympathizers.\u201d). But even assuming he is right about this, ample evidence shows that changed country conditions eliminate any well-founded fear of persecution that Ramirez-Felipe otherwise might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The 2004 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices in Guatemala says that the Government \u201cgenerally re-spectfs] the human rights of its citizens,\u201d JA 253, and Ramirez-Felipe himself admits that the war \u201ccalmed down\u201d by the time he left Guatemala in 1993, which was still before the 1996 conclusion of the civil war, JA 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Perhaps more importantly, nothing indicates that, if Ramirezr-Felipe returned to Guatemala, those engaged in any continuing violence would target him <em>because of </em>his past association with the guerrillas. Even an applicant for asylum who sewed in the civil patrol <em>and </em>for the guerrillas during the Guatemalan civil war, we have held, did not have an objectively reasonable fear of persecution upon his return\u2014 long after the conclusion of the war. <em>See Pascual v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 483, 488 (6th Cir.2007). To the extent Ramirez-Felipe alleges persecution on account of a <em>mistaken </em>association with the guerrillas, it seems particularly unlikely that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. \u201cWhy would anyone today ascribe a mistaken anti-government or anti-guerrilla opinion to [the applicant] \u2014 given that the war ended over ten years ago ... ?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. And although the State Department Report notes that there are still \u201ccredible reports of unlawful killings by security forces,\u201d JA 253, and \u201ccredible reports of individual police officers\u2019 involvement in kidnappings for ransom,\u201d <em>id., </em>the report also says that there are \u201cno <em>politically motivated </em>killings by the Government or its agents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 254 (emphasis added), and \u201cno reports of <em>politically motivated </em>disappearances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 256 (emphasis added). Because it does not suffice that Ramirez-Felipe might be subject to random violence if he returned to his home country, and because there is no evidence that he would be subject to violence <em>\u201con account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added), his asylum application necessarily fails. <em>See Daneshvar v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 615, 624 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The State Department Report is not Ramirez-Felipe\u2019s only problem. Any risk that he might be targeted due to his family\u2019s association with the guerrillas is diminished by his testimony that his sister Martha, who was in the house with his mother and brothers when they were killed, still lives in Guatemala, as do his four children and his other four sisters. \u201c[T]he fact that members of his family,\u201d particularly his four children, \u201clive in Guatemala makes it reasonable to expect him to be able to do so as well.\u201d <em>Pascual, </em>514 F.3d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Ramirez-Felipe also argues that his past persecution was so severe that he is entitled to relief even if conditions in Guatemala have changed. <em>See In re Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16, 19 (BIA 1989). However, with respect to this claim, he still has not demonstrated that the past persecution was on the basis of a prohibited ground. Nor, for this reason and others, has he established a reasonable possibility of suffering other serious harm if returned to Guatemala. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Because Ramirez-Felipe cannot establish that he qualifies for asylum, he also cannot meet the more demanding requirements for withholding of removal. <em>See Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>864 F.3d 700, 703 n. 3 (6th Cir.2004). Nor is there any evidence in the record suggesting that he \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would \u201cface torture if returned to Guatemala.\u201d JA 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">For these reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
