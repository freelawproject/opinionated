Counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising sentencing issues but stating that in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for review. Bryant has not filed a supplemental pro se brief. The Government has declined to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">Bryant\u2019s probation officer recommended an offense level of twenty-three. At sentencing, the Government moved for a three-level reduction in offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2002) based on Bryant\u2019s cooperation in the investigation of the fraudulent home lending schemes with which he was involved. The district court granted the motion. With an offense level of twenty and a criminal history category of I, Bryant\u2019s advisory guideline range was 33-41 months. The district court sentenced him to thirty-three months in prison and ordered restitution of $60,768.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">Bryant argues that the district court should have exercised its discretion to further reduce his offense level below level twenty because his substantial assistance outweighed his recent state convictions. Whether a defendant may appeal a sentence is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000). <em>United States v. Pridgen, </em>64 F.3d 147, 148 (4th Cir.1995). Section 3742 permits an appeal if the sentence: (1) was imposed in violation of law; (2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tion of the sentencing guidelines; (3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range; or (4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We have jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a sentence based on the grounds listed in \u00a7 3742, but the court interprets its jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a) narrowly. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 323-24 (4th Cir.1995). Moreover, we have held that mere dissatisfaction with the extent of a district court\u2019s downward departure does not provide a basis for appeal under \u00a7 3742. <em>Hill, </em>70 F.3d at 324. Here, Bryant\u2019s sentence was not imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the advisory guidelines nor was it greater than his advisory guidelines range. Finally, the record does not indicate that his sentence was imposed in violation of the law. Accordingly, Bryant\u2019s challenge to the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure is barred by \u00a7 3742. <em>Hill, </em>70 F.3d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Next, Bryant contests a portion of the restitution order. He argues that the loss sustained by First Guaranty Mortgage in relation to real property located at 6622 Thermal Road, Charlotte, North Carolina, should not have been included in the restitution order because the property was sold by his wife during their separation and he was not involved in the transaction. He also contends that the district court erred in imposing restitution because restitution is only available for losses caused by the conduct underlying the elements of the offense of which the defendant is convicted, and this transaction was not part of the same fraudulent scheme serving as the basis for his conviction. We review a restitution order for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 420 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Under the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), the district court may order a defendant to pay restitution to any victim of an offense of conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2008); <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 506 (4th Cir.1996) (observing that the authority of a district court to order restitution is limited to the terms of the VWPA). Restitution is due a victim under \u00a7 3663 if the act that harms is either conduct underlying an element of the offense of conviction, or an act taken in furtherance of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity that is specifically included as an element of the offense of conviction. <em>See Blake, </em>81 F.3d at 506; <em>see also Hughey v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990) (restitution allowed only \u201cfor the loss[es] caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding Bryant responsible for the loss sustained by First Guaranty. Bryant was at the least a co-owner of the property in question. The property was sold to a buyer who was involved in-multiple fraudulent purchases. And, in fact, the property went into foreclosure, fitting the pattern of many of the fraudulent purchases made as part of the scheme serving as the basis for Bryant\u2019s conviction. We therefore find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Bryant\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
