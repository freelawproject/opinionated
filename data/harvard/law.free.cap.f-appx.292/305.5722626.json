He petitions this court for review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) order of removal. Chambers was found to be removable as an alien who had remained in the United States longer than permitted, as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense, and as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">When, as in this case, the BIA enters a decision independent of the IJ\u2019s decision, this court will confine its review to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir.2002). The BIA\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>This court lacks \u201cjurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u201d certain criminal offenses, including a controlled substance offense or an aggravated felony. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (a)(2)(B). However, this court does have jurisdiction to review its own jurisdiction and to review constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See Omari, v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2005); \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-18\">Chambers argues that the BIA erred by finding that he was bound by his counsel\u2019s concessions of the factual allegation against him and his removability; he also argues that counsel\u2019s concessions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. An alien generally is bound by his counsel\u2019s admissions. <em>See Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). In the instant case, the BIA found that Chambers failed to meet any of the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See In re Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988); <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir.2000). Nothing in the record suggests that Chambers complied with these requirements. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in rejecting Chambers\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Chambers\u2019s other primary argument is that the Government failed to show that his prior state felony conviction was an aggravated felony or a drug trafficking offense. \u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(A) (iii). For immigration purposes, an aggravated felony includes drug trafficking crimes as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Section 924(c)(2) provides that the phrase drug trafficking crime includes \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d A state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law. <em>See Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 629-33,166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">When determining whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony, this court \u201clook[s] at the statute under which the alien was convicted rather than at the particular underlying facts.\u201d <em>Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 307. \u201cIf the statute of conviction defines multiple offenses, at least one of which does not describe an aggravated felony,\u201d then this court looks to the record of conviction to determine under which subsection the individual was convicted to determine whether the conviction is an aggravated felony. <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 464 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308. The record contains a certified copy of Chambers\u2019 judgment of conviction and order for commitment, which reflects Chambers\u2019s guilty plea and conviction for \u201cpossession with intent to distribute-cocaine.\u201d R. 141-42; 8 C.F.R. 1003.41(a). Chambers was convicted under New Jersey Stat. Ann. 2C:35-5a(l), which tracks the language of the analogous federal statute criminalizing possession with intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The record also contains a certified copy of Chambers\u2019s indictment, which specifies that Chambers \u201cknowingly or purposely did possess with intent to distribute cocaine in a quantity of five ounces or more.\u201d Therefore, the BIA did not err in finding that Chambers\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. As an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, Chambers was correctly found to be removable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Chambers also filed a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. However, as he does not address this issue in his brief, it is abandoned. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
