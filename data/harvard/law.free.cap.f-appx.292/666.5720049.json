Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-19\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Osuna-Estrada is removable for attempting to bring a large quantity of iodine across the border in the trunk of her car. <em>See Alarcon-Serrano v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1116, 1119-20 (9th Cir.2000). Osuna-Estrada\u2019s contention that her conviction is insufficient to sustain the removability charge is unpersuasive, as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) does not require a conviction. We therefore lack jurisdiction over this aspect of the petition for review. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Lopez-Molina v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1206, 1209 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">We reject Osuna-Estrada\u2019s contention that res judicata bars the agency\u2019s removability determination, as the doctrine she invokes applies to successive agency proceedings rather than a criminal trial followed by removal proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Bravo-Pedroza v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 1358, 1359 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>We also reject as unsupported by the record Osuna-Estrada\u2019s contentions that she was denied the assistance of counsel and a full and fair hearing. The IJ did not demonstrate bias in presiding over Osuna-Estrada\u2019s case. Nor was OsunaEstrada denied an opportunity to examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Finally, Osuna-Estrada has not shown either a lack of notice or prejudice resulting from the government\u2019s amendment of her Notice to Appear. <em>See Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
