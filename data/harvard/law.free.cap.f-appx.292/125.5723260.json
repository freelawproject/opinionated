Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Defendant was sentenced principally to a term of 96 months\u2019 incarceration. Our Court subsegently affirmed the judgment of convic^ion an&lt;^ remanded the case for resentenc*n\u00a7 *n <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court imposed the same sentence on remand. Before our Court, defendant now challenges his sentence on the ground that the District Court committed a procedural error by refusing to consider the disparity between the defendant\u2019s federal sentence and the sentence he would have received in state court for the same offense. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and , ,, . . procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"apr-dedup-0\">We have previously held that a District Court is not required to consider the disparities between the federal and state penalties for his offense of conviction when determining the appropriate sentence. See <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>505 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.2007). The District Court\u2019s reasons for refusing to consider \u00bfpg federal-state sentencing disparity were similar to those given in <em>Johnson, </em>namely that such a consideration \u201cwould make federal sentences dependent on the law of the state in which the sentencing court was located, resulting in federal sentencing that would vary from state to state [contrary to the intent of the Guidelines].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123 (quoting <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F 2d 65, 70 (2d Cir.1993)). We con-elude that the District Court properly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the defendant\u2019s sentence was not otherwise pr0cedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>For the reasons stated above, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
