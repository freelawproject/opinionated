He argues that the Government did not establish by competent evidence \u201cthe fact\u201d of his prior convictions. Specifically, he asserts that, in light of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) and <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352 (5th Cir. 2005), the California abstract of judgments utilized by the district court are considered \u201cunreliable\u201d to establish the existence of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Aguilera\u2019s reliance on <em>Gutierrez-Ramirez </em>is misplaced. <em>In Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 358-59, this court determined that the district court erred under <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard, </em>when it \u201cexclusively\u201d relied on a California abstract of judgment to determine whether the defendant\u2019s pri- or conviction qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). As Aguilera acknowledges in his brief, his argument does not implicate <em>Taylor </em>or <em>Shepard </em>because he is only challenging the existence of his prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 590-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1106, 169 L.Ed.2d 838 (2008). Because Aguilera failed to produce any evidence calling into question the reliability of the abstract of judgments, the district court did not err in using them to establish Aguilera\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Aguilera challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Al-mendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
