He moves to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Johnson leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons stated in its order denying relief. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Johnson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\u201cSection 3582(e)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. GonzalezBalderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and this court reviews the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Johnson based his motion on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)). Johnson argues that in the light of Amendment 706, he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence regardless of his career offender status for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">As the district court\u2019s reasoning suggests, a reduction in Johnson\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect Johnson\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment, which derived from an application of \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Johnson\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Johnson was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that ha[d] subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. To the extent that Johnson argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>did not involve a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Johnson argues for the first time on appeal that he seeks reduction in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sentence based on Amendment 709 to the Guidelines. Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we decline to consider it. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cThis court will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Johnson has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cir. </em>R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
