Canterbury contends that there was insufficient evidence to find that he had violated the terms of his supervised release by committing assault and battery in violation of W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-2-9 (Michie 2005) and that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">A decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282 (4th Cir.1999). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008). We review for clear error factual determinations underlying the conclusion that a violation occurred. <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">Canterbury argues that the evidence was insufficient to find by a preponderance of the evidence that he committed assault and battery because the witnesses whose testimony supported such a finding were not credible. However, this court gives due regard to the district court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses and does not review credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Lowe, </em>65 F.3d 1137, 1142 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>find no abuse of discretion in the revocation of Canterbury\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Next, Canterbury argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable. We will affirm a sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory limits and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). The sentence first must be assessed for reasonableness, \u201cfollow[ing] generally the procedural and substantive considerations that we employ in our review of original sentences, ... with some necessary modifications to take into account the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39; <em>see United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn applying the \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, we first determine, using the instructions given in <em>Gall[v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) ], whether a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d). If we find the sentence to be reasonable, we affirm. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this court \u201cdecide whether the sentence is <em>plainly unreasonable.\u201d Id.-, see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 294. Although the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the requirements of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), \u201cthe [district] court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We have thoroughly reviewed Canterbury\u2019s sentence and find it to be procedurally and substantively reasonable. Based on this conclusion, \u201cit necessarily follows that [Canterbury\u2019s] sentence is not plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Canterbury\u2019s supervised release and imposing an eleven-month prison term. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
