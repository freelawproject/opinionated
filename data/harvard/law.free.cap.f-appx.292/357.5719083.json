We find that we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pryor\u2019s suit because Pryor did not timely file an appeal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">The district court dismissed Pryor\u2019s case on May 3, 2006. Pryor filed a motion to vacate that judgment, and the district court denied the motion on May 23, 2006. Pryor did not timely file a notice of appeal regarding that judgment. Then, on October 31, 2006, Pryor filed a motion to reopen the time to file an appeal. The district court denied Pryor\u2019s motion on November 29, 2006 and therefore refused to provide Pryor additional time to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">Pryor then on May 1, 2007 filed a motion to vacate the district court\u2019s order denying additional time to appeal. The district court denied that motion on June 1, 2007. Pryor timely appealed the district court\u2019s most recent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">As the district court concluded, Pryor did not timely file a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to vacate its original judgment dismissing Pryor\u2019s case. Pryor argues that he should have been allowed more time to file an appeal because he never received notice of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate. However, the record shows that Pryor did have adequate notice of the district court\u2019s denial of his original motion to vacate. Pryor concedes that he received the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>August 30, 2006, thereby giving him notice of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the time to file an appeal of an order may be reopened \u201cif the motion is filed 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(B). Pryor filed his untimely motion to reopen the time to file an appeal on October 31, 2006, two months after he received notice of the order. Pryor had seven days after receiving notice of the order on August 31, 2006 to file a motion to reopen the time to file an appeal, yet he did not file his motion until two months later. Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to grant Pryor additional time to appeal its May 23, 2006 order denying the original motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Pryor\u2019s appellate brief asks this court to evaluate the correctness of the district court\u2019s refusal to vacate its judgment dismissing his claims. However, given our conclusion that Pryor did not timely appeal that judgment, we do not have jurisdiction to address the remainder of Pryor\u2019s arguments. \u201cA timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional, and we have no power to enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Matter of Lacey, </em>114 F.3d 556, 557 (5th Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted). Therefore, we DISMISS Pryor\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
