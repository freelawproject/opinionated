Diaz argues for the first time on appeal that the district court committed \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d by failing to adequately explain the sentence it chose. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (a district court commits procedural error if fails to adequately explain its chosen sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">We review Diaz\u2019s argument for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, 410 </em>F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir. 2005). Diaz\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s explanation of its sentence did not comport with <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), is without merit. Accordingly, Diaz has shown no procedural error, plain or otherwise, by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Diaz also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the sentencing range set forth under the Guidelines was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that although his sentence was within the guidelines range, it should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). This argument also is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">Although <em>Kimbrough </em>made clear that a district court may, in certain cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>conclude that the Guidelines fail properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s considerations and may disagree with guidelines policy, it does not follow that a district court abuses its discretion when it concludes, as the district court did here, that the Guidelines are appropriate. Further, because the district court was free to vary from the Guidelines if it disagreed with the application of \u00a7 2L1.2, no plain error is shown. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Diaz has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that should be afforded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In assessing Diaz\u2019s sentence, the district court concluded that Diaz\u2019s prior offense was, in fact, serious and that Diaz had options other than illegally returning to the United States to avoid being kidnapped. The sentence was not unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
