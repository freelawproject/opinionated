On August 29, 2006, defendant pleaded guilty to one charged count of conspiracy to commit murder for hire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958, and one charged count of distribution and possession of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(C). Defendant\u2019s plea was entered pursuant to a plea agreement, which stated that defendant \u201cwill not file a direct appeal, nor litigate under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255 and/or Section 2241, any sentence at or below the Stipulated Guidelines Sentence set forth above (860 months).\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. at 26. The District Court sentenced defendant principally to a term of imprisonment of 360 months. Defendant asserts on appeal that the District Court\u2019s plea allocution failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(b)(l)(N), which requires that a court accepting a guilty plea determine that the defendant understands \u201cthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.\u201d Specifically, defendant claims that \u201c[t]he District Court did not address or explain the concept of \u2018collateral attack,\u2019 \u201d and that therefore this Court should vacate the conviction and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">We reject defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was not \u201cintelligent\u201d and \u201cknowing\u201d because the District Court did not explicitly discuss the issue of collateral attack. Because this claim was not raised before the District Court, we review it for plain error, taking into account the entire record. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). The record makes clear that the District Court correctly determined that defendant understood the terms of the plea agreement, which waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack any sentence at or below 360 months. The District Court confirmed that defendant had read the plea agreement before he signed it, that he understood its terms, and that no one coerced him into signing it. The District Court also confirmed that defendant had met with his attorney to discuss the case, that his attorney had explained the consequences of pleading guilty, and that he was satisfied with his representation. As to his right to appeal, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Court asked defendant directly if he understood that he was \u201cgiving up [his] right to appeal [his] sentence at all in any way and for any reason\u201d as long as he was sentenced to \u201c30 years of imprisonment or less.\u201d Appellee\u2019s App. at 54. Defendant replied that he understood. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we find no error, let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Finally, we note that defendant argues that the phrase \u201ccollateral attack\u201d is \u201ca legal term that is not generally known or understood outside the criminal courts.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. The logical implication of defendant\u2019s statement is that for a defendant to understand the concept of \u201ccollateral attack,\u201d he would need an explanation of the phrase in non-legal terms. We have not required such an explanation but we note, in any event, that the District Court gave precisely such an explanation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and oral argument, we reject defendant\u2019s remaining arguments as lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
