The sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range that was increased by a prior conviction for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">Aguilar-Matias contends that his seixtence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not give a sufficient explanation for the sentence. Because Aguilax-Matias did not object to the explanation at sentencing, we review this contention for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2008) (No. 08-5514).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-24\">The district coux-t\u2019s adoption of the presentence x\u2019eport and its consideration of Aguilar-Matias\u2019s ax\u2019guments for a downward departure and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in detei\u2019mining his within-gxxidelines sentence constituted sufficient reasons for imposing his sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226). There was xxo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>clear or obvious error that affected Aguilar-Matias\u2019s substantial rights or rendered the sentence procedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>581 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Aguilar-Matias also contends that <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which issued after his sentencing, abrogated the rationale of previous Fifth Circuit decisions by broadening the district court\u2019s discretion to impose a nonguidelines sentence. Aguilar-Matias argues, therefore, that the sentencing court labored under a misconception that it could not sentence him below the Guidelines in the absence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or based on the court\u2019s disagreement with guidelines policy or based on disfavored guidelines factors such as his purported family obligations and the harshness of his past life</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Because this issue was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court was constrained by this court\u2019s precedent from considering all of Aguilar-Matias\u2019s arguments for a non-guidelines sentence. Accordingly, there was no plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Aguilar-Matias also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because there is no empirical support for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline mandating the 16-level increase for a crime of violence. Because Aguilar-Matias did not challenge the empirical grounds for \u00a7 2L1.2 in the district court, his contention is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court believed that it was precluded by circuit precedent from imposing a lesser sentence in the face of \u00a7 2L1.2. Aguilar-Matias shows no plain error. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
