Horn denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chun Qing Chen a.k.a. Jason Hoang, </em>No. A 96 395 183 (B.I.A. Sept. 28, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 395 183 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The Government correctly asserts that, even assuming credibility, Chen is not entitled to asylum based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that, pursuant to <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>\u201ca claim of persecution based <em>solely </em>on a forced abortion\u201d brought by someone other than \u201cthe individual who has undergone the procedure ... is doomed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Moreover, Chen has failed to adequately raise a past persecution claim based on his own resistance to China\u2019s coercive population control program. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The BIA has stated that the term \u201cresistance\u201d includes, but is not limited to, \u201cexpressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy .... and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family planning law.\u201d <em>Matter of S-L-L, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006). Although Chen\u2019s original claim was based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion, the factual record was \u201c \u2018adequately developed\u2019 \u201d with respect to the issue of \u201cresistance.\u201d <em>Shu Wen Sun, </em>510 F.3d at 381 n. 5 (quoting <em>Gui Yin Liu, </em>508 F.3d at 723). However, despite having been given the opportunity to testify fully about the circumstances leading up to and following his wife\u2019s forced abortion, Chen never alleged that he personally experienced harm. Furthermore, although he conclusorily asserts in his brief to this Court that his \u201caction\u201d amounts to \u201cother resistance,\u201d he fails to identify that action. To the extent Chen argues that he resisted China\u2019s family planning policy by having a child without permission, we have found that \u201c[mjerely impregnating one\u2019s girlfriend is not alone an act of \u2018resistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313 (quoting <em>Ru Jian Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>(5th Cir.2004)). Thus, Chen\u2019s claim of past persecution based on \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program is without merit. <em>See Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In light of Chen\u2019s failure to establish that he had been subjected to past persecution, he was not entitled to a presumption that he would be subjected to future persecution in China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). In this regard, the IJ reasonably found that although the background material may have indicated that Chen violated the family planning policy by having a child prior to marriage, \u201cnothing occurred to him as a result of the violation.\u201d Indeed, Chen does not assert in his brief that authorities ever sought to apprehend him in China or that they have any current interest in him. Rather, he contends only that he is presumed to have a well-founded fear in China based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion and that he would have an \u201cactual well-founded fear\u201d of persecution in China <em>\u201cif </em>they were to attempt to have another child.\u201d Given that the documents Chen submitted do not reference forced or mandatory sterilization in particular circumstances and he does not allege what harm he believes he will face, we will not disturb the I J\u2019s conclusion that Chen failed to meet his burden to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on his family planning claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B); <em>see also Jiau Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an applicant\u2019s fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable because it lacked \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and was merely \u201cspeculative at best\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Because Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Lastly, because Chen fails to meaningfully argue in his brief to this Court that he is eligible for CAT relief, and because addressing this argument does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
