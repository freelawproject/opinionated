We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and a motion to reconsider, <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Dompas\u2019 motion to reopen because Dompas failed to set forth new facts or present new evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Dompas\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); Socop-<em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">To the extent Dompas challenges the agency\u2019s order denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, that order was not petitioned to this court. <em>See Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 553, 558 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">We reject Dompas\u2019 contention that the immigration judge was biased, intimidated his family, and failed to consider the evidence because it is unsupported and belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
