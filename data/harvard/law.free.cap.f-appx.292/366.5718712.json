Mendez argues that the district court plainly erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior conviction for a crime of violence, the burglary of a habitation. He argues that the statute under which he was convicted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a) includes a means to commit the offense that does not meet the definition of a generic burglary as required by the Guidelines to impose such an enhancement. Mendez also asserts that, although the indictment charged him conjunctively under two sections of the statute, one section of which satisfied the definition of generic burglary, his guilty plea did not establish that he committed the conduct under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">Mendez was charged conjunctively in the indictment under Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) and \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), which provide different means of committing burglary of a habitation. The latter section does not require an intent to commit a crime at the time of the unlawful entry. \u00a7 30.02(a)(3). <em>See United States v. Herrera-Montes, </em>490 F.3d 390, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007). The record in this case contains no evidence reflecting the specific subsection to which Mendez pleaded guilty, nor does it contain the factual basis for his plea. Thus, we cannot determine whether Mendez pleaded guilty to an offense that meets the definition of a generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in imposing the 16-level sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">Despite this error, reversal is not required. In <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 655-57 (5th Cir.2008), this court determined that the district court erred in applying the Guidelines, but it determined that \u201c[n]ot all errors in determining a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence require reversal.\u201d The court affirmed the sentence, finding that \u201cbecause the district court imposed an alternative non-guidelines sentence, the advisory sentence did not result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>from the guidelines error and we need not vacate the sentence on that basis.\u201d 524 F.3d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In the instant case, the district court made it clear that it would have imposed the same sentence even if \u00a7 2L1.2 were inapplicable. The district court\u2019s comments reflect that, like the district court in <em>Bonilla, </em>it imposed an alternative non-guidelines sentence. Moreover, the reasons given by the district court for the non-guidelines sentence imposed were adequate. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
