On appeal, Brown argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel during his guilty plea and sentencing proceedings. He also contends that the lengthy delay on appeal due to multiple substitutions of appointed counsel resulted in a violation of his due process rights. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">Brown alleges that trial counsel was ineffective because he did not zealously investigate defenses to the charges; did not thoroughly cross-examine the Government witness who testified to establish the factual basis for the plea; did not argue for a sentence of 180 months, the low end of the range specified in the plea agreement; and did not contest the quantity of drugs attributed or a firearm enhancement. Unless an attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness is apparent on the face of the record, ineffective assistance claims are not generally addressed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d <em>387, </em>391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (providing standard and noting that ineffective assistance of counsel claims generally should be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, Brown must show that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>der prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, to satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong in the guilty plea context, a petitioner must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Brown does not contend on appeal that, but for trial counsel\u2019s alleged lack of a defense against the charge, he would not have pleaded guilty. At no time did Brown attempt to withdraw his plea, and he, in fact, affirmed at the plea hearing that he was satisfied with the services of his attorney. The Government had evidence of three controlled drug buys with recordings of the phone calls setting up the buys. The cocaine base received during the buys was sent to and analyzed by a laboratory. In addition, the Government contended that nine persons who were involved in the drug activity were available to testify. Brown\u2019s co-defendant had also pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Brown regarding the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The remaining two ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims involve counsel\u2019s representation at sentencing. Brown claims that counsel should have filed objections to the presentence report and should not have agreed to a sentencing range of 210 to 240 months instead of 180 months as the lower range. He also claims that counsel did not contest evidence of drug amount and the gun enhancement. Brown affirmed that the 210 to 240 month Guidelines range was properly calculated at sentencing. Further, the gun enhancement was applicable because several witnesses stated that Brown often carried a firearm. The enhancement was not based on the presence of a firearm at the time of arrest. While a district court retains the discretion to apply a downward variance and therefore a 180-month sentence may have been a possibility, the Guidelines range was properly calculated, and the court considered the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West Supp.2008) factors in crafting the sentence. Therefore, there appears to be no ineffective assistance in failing to challenge the Guidelines range calculation. In light of these and other facts, we conclude that ineffective assistance of trial counsel is not apparent on the face of the record and therefore will not be addressed and is best adjudicated in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Next, Brown argues that the two-year and nine-month delay of this appeal resulted in a violation of his due process rights. Brown states that, because current appellate counsel could not recreate the entire case file of trial counsel, he was prejudiced. He also states he suffered anxiety because he was effectively without representation to appeal his 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">This court has recognized that an \u201cundue delay in processing an appeal may rise to the level of a due process violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>732 F.2d 379, 381 (4th Cir.1984). In determining whether such a delay results in the denial of a speedy appeal, we adopted the four-factor speedy-trial test of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). <em>Johnson, </em>732 F.2d at 381-82. The four factors are: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>right; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. <em>Johnson, </em>732 F.2d at 381-82 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182). In <em>Johnson, </em>we held that the two-year delay in that case was \u201cin the range of magnitude of delay as a result of which courts have indicated that due process may have been denied.\u201d 732 F.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Here, the two-year and nine-month delay alleged in this case would be sufficient to trigger the balancing test. <em>See Smith v. Kansas, </em>356 F.2d 654, 657 (10th Cir.1966) (recognizing constitutional implications of one-year delay in appeal from post-conviction proceeding). The reason for the delay is entirely due to the need for substitute appellate counsel. Brown timely asserted his right to appeal. Therefore, the first three factors of the test weigh in Brown\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Brown, however, still needs to demonstrate that he has suffered prejudice from the delay. Brown\u2019s brief confuses prejudice related to the ineffective assistance of trial claims, which are unrelated to the delay, and the prejudice related to appellate delay. Brown has now presented his claims, and they are without merit; therefore, his substantial rights have not been violated. Anxiety alone over case status is not sufficient to find that there was prejudice affecting Brown\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
