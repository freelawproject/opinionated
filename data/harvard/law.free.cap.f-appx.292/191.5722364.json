The facts are well-known to the parties, so we will not recount them here at length. In summary, Snyder, along with his siblings Shanni Snyder, Kash Snyder, and Scott Snyder shared ownership of a number of properties located in Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties. Mortgage foreclosure actions regarding those properties commenced in July 2003 in Allegheny County and in October 2003 in Westmoreland County. On November 24, 2003, default judgment was entered in the mortgage foreclosure action in Allegheny County, and on December 2, 2003, default judgment was entered in the mortgage foreclosure action in Westmoreland County. The Allegheny County properties were sold at a sheriffs sale on January 14, 2005; those properties were then sold to third parties in June 2005 and September 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">Meanwhile, Snyder and his siblings filed a number of individual bankruptcy petitions after foreclosure proceedings were initiated; none of the bankruptcy cases proceeded beyond preliminary stages. The bankruptcy filings included several petitions filed by Snyder himself, including a petition filed on November 17, 2003. Notably, in Kash Snyder\u2019s case, the Bankruptcy Court granted in rem relief from the automatic stay in January 2005 so that foreclosure on the Allegheny County properties could proceed. Also, in February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>2006, the Bankruptcy Court retroactively annulled the automatic stay in Shanni Snyder\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding to declare that the sheriffs sale of the Allegheny County properties was not in violation of the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In August 2006, the holder of the mortgage note, Edward J. Quinlan, filed a motion to reopen Snyder\u2019s November 17, 2003 bankruptcy petition in order to retroactively annul the automatic stay. In the motion, Quinlan noted that in July 2006, Snyder argued for the first time that the default judgment in Westmoreland County was entered during the pendency of his November 2003 bankruptcy petition. After a hearing on September 29, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order reopened the bankruptcy case to retroactively annul the automatic stay, declare that the default judgment in Allegheny County was not in violation of the automatic stay, and validate the sales of the specifically listed properties in Allegheny County, noting that \u201cthe sales to third parties cannot be unwound.\u201d <em>In Re: Mark Snyder, </em>No. 03-34366 (Bankr. W.D.Pa. Sept. 29, 2006). However, the Bankruptcy Court denied the requested relief as to the Westmoreland County judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On Snyder\u2019s appeal, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, determining that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in retroactively annulling the automatic stay as to the Allegheny County properties. In affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, the District Court adopted the reasoning in the opinion and order of the District Court in Shanni Snyder\u2019s bankruptcy appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We undertake plenary review of the District Court\u2019s decision acting as an appellate court of a bankruptcy matter. <em>In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d 120, 124 (3d Cir. 2007). In reviewing the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, we exercise the same standard of review as the District Court. <em>See id. </em>at 125. That is, we review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>its factual findings for clear error, and its discretionary determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>See Reconstituted Comm, of Unsecured Creditors of the United Healthcare Sys., Inc., v. State of N.J. Dept. of Labor (In re United Healthcare Sys., Inc.), </em>396 F.3d 247, 249 (3d Cir.2005). As pertinent to this appeal, we review for abuse of discretion the decision to annul the automatic stay. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 128.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The Bankruptcy Code allows for relief from an automatic stay in a number of ways, including \u201cterminating, annulling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>modifying or conditioning\u201d the stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). By virtue of the term \u201cannulling\u201d being present in the statute, courts are empowered to <em>grant </em>retroactive relief, such as ratifying violations of the automatic stay that otherwise would be void. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 127-28; <em>In re Siciliano, </em>13 F.3d 748, 750-51 (3d Cir.1994). We have observed a number of pertinent factors in determining whether the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in annulling a stay, including (1) whether the creditor was aware of the bankruptcy filing or encouraged violation of the stay; (2) whether the debtor is guilty of inequitable, unreasonable, or dishonest conduct; and (3) whether the creditor would suffer prejudice. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 129. We also have noted that the Bankruptcy Court has a wide latitude to balance the equities when granting relief from the automatic stay. <em>See id., </em>491 F.3d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Applying these factors to Snyder\u2019s case, we cannot say that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in annulling the automatic stay for the purpose of ratifying the Allegheny County sheriffs sale. From the hearing transcript and the language of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order, the Bankruptcy Court focused on the equities involved regarding the third-party purchasers of the Allegheny County properties. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Court noted at the hearing that the serial bankruptcy filings by Snyder family members in their efforts to stop the sales of the properties was evidence <em>of </em>bad faith conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We have considered the remaining arguments presented in Snyder\u2019s brief and find them to be unpersuasive. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order. Snyder\u2019s motion to compel appellees\u2019 counsel to disclose client contact information is denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. Shanni Snyder's appeal from the District Court's decision is considered separately at C.A. No. 06-4066.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. Snyder contends that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to \"reopen\u201d his dismissed bankruptcy case because the matter was never \"closed\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(a); rather, his case was dismissed for failure to file the necessary schedules. <em>See In re Income Property Builders, Inc., 699 </em>F.2d 963, 965 (9th Cir.1982). Snyder further argues that, even if the Bankruptcy Court were empowered to act under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), Quinlan's motion for relief was filed beyond one year after the dismissal of his bankruptcy case. We note, however, that no specific time limit is prescribed for motions under Rule 60(b)(6), as such motions must be made within a \"reasonable time.\u201d By granting the motion to \u201creopen\u201d the bankruptcy case, in essence, the Bankruptcy Court nullified the dismissal. The Bankruptcy Court appears to have found the motion to have been timely filed in light of the facts of the case, and we discern no abuse of discretion in that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">. Snyder readily admits in his brief that he filed for bankruptcy in order to activate the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to defer responding to the state court foreclosure action in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-22\">. Quinlan was a party to this appeal individually and as agent for the other appellees. The Court has received notice from the appellees that they would not be participating in the appeal in light of Quinlan\u2019s death in September 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
