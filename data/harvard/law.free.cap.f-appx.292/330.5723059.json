Johnson asserts that he is entitled to a COA for three claims:</p>\n<p id=\"A4q\">, 4 . \u201e (1) The State s suppression of evidence ,, \\,, , that two of the State s witnesses at trial , , , , ,. , . , , , T 1 ! had been hypnotized violated Johnson s . . , . . <em>T, , </em>., due process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L Ed 2d 215 (1963);</p>\n<p id=\"A-B\">(2) The district court erred by refusing to consider the affidavits of attorneys on <em>the </em>issue of whether Johnson\u2019s trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance; and</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">(3) Johnson\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by calling Johnson\u2019s brother, Terry, as a witness at the guilt phase of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AUx\">To obtain a COA, Johnson must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, he must demonstrate that \u201cjurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of ^is constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322 327, 123 S.Ct 1029; 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been and ^ ^ hag <em>m </em>consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. The Supreme Court has instructed us that, in . . , . . . making our decision whether to gi'ant a 4 COA, we must limit our examination to a \u201e , , ,, . . \u201e , . , threshold inquiry, which consists of an ^ OTerview of the claims ln the babeas Petl\" tion and a general assessment of then-merits\u201d <em>1(1 </em>at 327&gt; 336\u2019 123 S'Ct 1029' We cannot deny a C0A because we believe the petitioner ultimately will not prevail on the merits of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 123 ~ ,, ,, , , , S.Ct. 1029. On the other hand, however, , issuance of a COA must not be <em>pro forma </em>\u201e ., \u201e\u201e\u201e ,, or a matter of course. <em>Id. </em>While the nature of a caPital case is not of itself sufficient to warrant the issuance of a COA, in a death penalty case any doubts ag to a C0A should issue must be in the petitioner\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Ra- ^ u </em>39g <em>FM m </em>(5th Cil.2005) (interna] quotation marks and d. , ... tations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ATY\">Based on our limited, threshold inquiry and general assessment of the merits 0f Johnson\u2019s claims, we conclude that his <em>Brady </em>and ineffective assistance of counsel claims present issues that are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. We therefore GRANT a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>COA authorizing Johnson to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief for these two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">A COA is not required for Johnson\u2019s claim that the district court erred by refusing to consider the attorney affidavits he submitted to the district court in support of his ineffective assistance claim. This claim by Johnson involves an evidentiary ruling of the district court and not a claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Lewis v. Quarterman, </em>272 Fed.Appx 347, 351 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished). Accordingly, the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to consider the attorney affidavits will be addressed in connection with the ineffective assistance claim for which we have granted a COA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We think that these issues have been well briefed. If, however, Johnson wishes to file a supplemental brief with respect to the merits of the claims, he may do so within thirty days of the date of this order. The supplemental brief should address <em>only </em>matters, if any, that have not already been covered in the brief in support of the COA application. If Johnson files a supplemental brief, the State may file a response fifteen days thereafter, to be similarly limited to matters that have not already been covered in its brief in opposition to Johnson\u2019s COA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Johnson\u2019s request for a COA is GRANTED in part and DENIED, as unnecessary, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AES\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
