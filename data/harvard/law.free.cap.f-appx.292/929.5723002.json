Simmons appeals from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cCAVC\u201d) affirming, inter alia, the denial of his claim for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder. <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-3225, 2007 WL 2937603 (Vet.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Aug. 20, 2007). We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">\u201cOur jurisdiction to review the decisions of the CAVC is limited by statute.\u201d <em>Summers v. Gober, </em>225 F.3d 1293, 1295 (Fed. Cir.2000). While this court is authorized to \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law, including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions,\u201d we cannot adjudicate \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case,\u201d unless a constitutional issue is presented. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">In an attempt to gain a jurisdictional footing, Mr. Simmons (who is represented by counsel) asserts that the CAVC \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b) because the \u201cfacts ... show that the appellant testified that he was in combat\u201d and that testimony is allegedly corroborated by documentary evidence. During oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel also argued that, because this evidence establishes a \u201cprima facie case,\u201d the burden of proof should have shifted to the Secretary, who should then have been required to prove that Mr. Simmons did not actually \u201cengage[] in combat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Section 1154(b) grants \u201cany veteran who engaged in combat with the enemy\u201d a relaxed evidentiary standard for establishing service-connection for a disease or injury. In order to be entitled to this statute\u2019s evidentiary benefit, a veteran must first establish that he \u201cengaged in combat with the enemy.\u201d <em>Stone v. Nicholson, </em>480 F.3d 1111, 1113 (Fed.Cir.2007). To have \u201cengaged in combat,\u201d a veteran must establish that he \u201cpersonally participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality, as determined on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Moran v. Peake, </em>525 F.3d 1157, 1159 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">In this case, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) found that Mr. Simmons \u201cdid not engage in combat with the enemy.\u201d The Board based this factual finding on a detailed review of the documentary record, which included operation reports for Mr. Simmons\u2019s battalion. (When the Board\u2019s decision was appealed, the CAVC simply summarized the Board\u2019s analysis and conclusion in this regard.) We lack jurisdiction to review this factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">With regard to appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion that the CAVC (or, more accurately, the Board) improperly allocated the burden of proof, appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument is defeated by this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Stone, </em>which held that the relaxed evidentiary standard provided by \u00a7 1154(b) does not apply when attempting to establish entitlement to use that statute (i.e., by showing a veteran \u201cengaged in combat\u201d). 480 F.3d at 1113. After the Secretary\u2019s response brief identified this case, appellant\u2019s counsel devoted his entire reply brief to requesting that this court \u201caccept the dissent\u201d from Stone. During oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel was informed that a panel of this court cannot overturn our precedent and adopt a dissenting opinion. In response, counsel requested that we distinguish the holding in <em>Stone.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such an analysis, however, would require us to distinguish the law in that case based on its facts, which, as noted above, we lack jurisdiction to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Thus, because Mr. Simmons\u2019s counsel only challenges a factual determination and an application of law to fact, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Accordingly, we dismiss Mr. Simmons\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. During oral argument, appellant's counsel clarified that he was not requesting that this court grant a rehearing en banc to reevaluate <em>Stone's </em>holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
