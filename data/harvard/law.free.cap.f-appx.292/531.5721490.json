We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Petitioners argued in their motion to reopen that conditions in Bangladesh have changed since the time of their merits hearing, and attached a recent State Department Country Report and several Amnesty International reports to support their argument. The State Department Country Report submitted at the time of petitioners\u2019 merits hearing made no mention of any anti-Ahmadiya activity. In contrast, the new evidence presented with the motion to reopen is replete with accounts of threats, intimidation and hate speech against Ahmadiyas, and it indicates an escalating threat to Ahmadiyas in Bangladesh. In particular, the Amnesty International Reports indicate that Ahma-diyas in Bangladesh \u201cmay be at risk of violent attack\u201d by orthodox Islamist groups, and describe the \u201cimpunity for violence\u201d against Ahmadiya members as \u201cendemic\u201d in Bangladesh. Accordingly, we conclude that BIA abused its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen where they provided sufficient evidence that circumstances have changed in Bangladesh regarding the Ahmadiya community such that petitioners now have a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 947-48 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA with instructions to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
