He argues that the district court miscalculated his sentencing guideline range in relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1 rather than \u00a7 2B1.1 to determine the base offense level. He contends that his scheme involved a mere alteration of instruments and not counter-<em>r, ... </em>, . , . , . \u201e feitmg, which requires making or manufac- .... tt turmg the instrument m its entirety. He \u00bfi j. e m-\u00bb!-1 t , , reasons that \u00a7 2B5.1 applies only to coun- , \u201e \u201e\u201e TT . . , ,, , terfeitmg offenses. He acknowledges that ,, . , , , .. . . this court has not addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"afz-dedup-0\">, The government responds that, even if \u00a7 2B5.1 was improperly applied, the court could have increased* Jacob\u2019s offense level, because the offense involved sophisticated means. The application of the sophisticated-means enhancement would require a factual determination, because this court cannot make the initial determination of the enhancement\u2019s application. <em>See United States v. Hooten, </em>942 F.2d 878, 882 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"A2r\">Under the advisory sentencing guidelines, we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the considerations in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir. 2005). Reasonableness review entails an abuse-of-discretion standard that applies regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside the guideline range. See <em>Gall v. United States, \u2014 </em>U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"A3-\">In <em>Gall, </em>the Court set out a bifurcated process for reasonableness review. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). First, the appellate court must ensure that the sentencinS court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (\u00b0r imProperly calculating) the Guidelines ranSe&gt; treatinS the Guidelines as mandato- ^ failinS to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) fac' tors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts\u2019 or failinS to adequately exPlain the chosen sentence-including an exPlanat\u00edon for any deviation \u00f1&gt;om the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the district courts decision is procedur- \u201e , \u201e\u201e \u201e ^ , ,, ally sound, the appellate court should ,, \u2019 f , then consider the substantive reasonable- ,, , . , ness of the sentence imposed under an , .... , . . \u201e r. abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9R\">Although this court has not decided whether \u00a7 2BU or \u00a7 <em>^5.1 </em>applies where an offense invoives sprinting higher denominations on bills that have been bleached) it is not necessary to resolve that in thig case_ In <em>United States v. Bonilla 524 </em>F 3d 647) 655.57 (5th Cir.2008), a post<em>GaU </em>case&gt; tMg eomt determmed that the district court had erred in applying the but it decided that \u201c[n]ot all errors \u00a1n determining a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence require reversal.\u201d We affilmed on the ground that \u201cbecause the district court imposed an alternative non-guideline sentence, the advisory sentence did not result from the guideline error and we need not vacate the sentence on that basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">The district court made it obvious that would have imposed the same sen. tence eyen if \u00a7 2BL1 were appiicabie. The courj,s comments reflect that, like the dMrict ^ in Ma&gt; ft imposed an alternative non-guideline sentence. Thus, even if there were an error in the application of the guidelines, it does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Jacobs further argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court gave inappropriate weight to only-one factor, his prior violent conduct, which he contends was an unsupported finding. After reviewing Jacobs\u2019s criminal history, the court noted that he was a \u201cvery violent man\u201d and \u201ca danger to other people.\u201d The court further stated, however, that it had reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and had determined that the thirty-month sentence met the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The sentence imposed does not reflect an abuse of discretion and is reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ayg\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
