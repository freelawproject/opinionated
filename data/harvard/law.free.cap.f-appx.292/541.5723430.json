We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm, but remand to correct the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Vargas-Castaneda\u2019s motion to file his untimely reply brief is granted. The Clerk shall file the reply brief received on April 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">Vargas-Castaneda contends that his underlying deportation proceeding was invalid because the immigration judge failed to advise him that he was eligible to apply for waiver of deportation, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). We conclude that Vargas-Castaneda was not prejudiced by any defect in his deportation proceeding. Vargas-Castaneda has not shown a plausible ground for relief from deportation because the evidence of extreme hardship to his United States citizen children is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">We remand to the district court with instructions to correct the reference in the judgment to \u201c8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b).\u201d <em>See United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding sua sponte to delete the reference to \u00a7 1326(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED to correct judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
