Barcoe argues that his within-Guidelines sentence was unreasonable because his family circumstances are such that the district court should have granted a departure from the Guidelines. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">We review the district court\u2019s final sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). We must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. U.S., </em>522 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is proeedurally sound, we must then consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">As an initial matter, we note that Barcoe does not claim any procedural error in the determination of his sentence. The record demonstrates that the district court correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>range, allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and thoroughly explained its reasoning. The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was procedurally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Next, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and conclude that Barcoe\u2019s claim that the district court acted unreasonably in failing to grant a departure based on his family circumstances is without merit. At sentencing, Barcoe argued for mitigation based on his family obligations, including his responsibilities to his three children in the United States and the recent death of his father and grandfather. After this allocution, the district court considered Barcoe\u2019s family situation, but found that this mitigating factor was outweighed by the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the Guideline range, Barcoe\u2019s criminal history that was not taken into account by the Guidelines, and Barcoe\u2019s history of illegally returning to this country. The district court placed special emphasis on Barcoe\u2019s criminal history, and it concluded that 77 months\u2019 imprisonment\u2014 which was the lowest within-Guidelines sentence available and far below the statutory maximum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 is reasonable. We find no abuse of discretion in the determination that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In short, Barcoe\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is neither proeedurally nor substantively unreasonable, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing it. For the foregoing reasons, Barcoe\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. Based upon Barcoe\u2019s offense level of 21 and criminal history category of VI, the presen-tence report calculated a Guideline range of 77-96 months. The statutory maximum is 20 years and there is no statutory minimum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
