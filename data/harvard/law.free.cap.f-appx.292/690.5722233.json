Petitioner also petitions for review from the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation of removal was denied because she failed to establish the requisite exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her United States citizen relatives. We lack jurisdiction to review this discretionary determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). We retain jurisdiction to consider colorable due process claims arising in connection with a discretionary determination. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir.2006). We reject petitioner\u2019s contention that her due process rights were violated by the IJ\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance. The IJ did not abuse her discretion in denying the request, <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996), and petitioner failed to show prejudice, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the motion addressed the same basic hardship ground previously considered by the IJ. <em>See Fernandez, </em>439 F.3d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART, and DENIED IN PART in No. 07-71858; PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in No. 07-73948.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
