Petitioners further contend that the BIA violated their due process rights by depriving them of a fan* and full hearing by not considering the IJ\u2019s rulings on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Petitioners fail to present a colorable due process claim. The BIA\u2019s determination that petitioners failed to establish hardship is dispositive of their cancellation of removal claims, and it was unnecessary for the BIA to consider the IJ\u2019s findings on the other cancellation factors. <em>See INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to demonstrate the requisite hardship to their qualifying relatives. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ed by 9 th Cir.
