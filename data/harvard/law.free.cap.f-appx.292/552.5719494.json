We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and review de novo due process claims. <em>Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1023 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen because petitioners have not established prejudice from their prior counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See id. </em>at 1024 (challenges based on ineffective assistance of counsel require showing of prejudice). Petitioners\u2019 motion does not include evidence describing or documenting whether their daughter has existing or future medical needs. Evidence of their daughter\u2019s past surgery and the general assertion in Arambula Martinez\u2019s affidavit that the child requires \u201cspecialized treatments\u201d in the United States are not sufficient to establish that counsel\u2019s failure to raise the daughter\u2019s condition may have affected the outcome of proceedings. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Petitioners have not raised, and have therefore waived, any direct challenge to the BIA\u2019s 2005 order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
