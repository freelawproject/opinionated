Hodge pleaded guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) and was sentenced principally to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We review sentences <em>post-Booker </em>for reasonableness, which is the \u201cfamiliar abuse-of-diseretion standard of review.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally reasonable, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Hodge argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. To support his argument, he makes three assertions: (1) the district court imposed sentence without considering Hodge\u2019s history and characteristics, specifically his drug addiction, \u201clife on the streets,\u201d and Tourette\u2019s Syndrome; (2) the recent amendment to the crack cocaine Guidelines create an even greater gap between sentences for crack cocaine offenses and sentences under the career offender Guidelines; and (3) the sentence imposed here is more than five times the length of any sentence the defendant has served before. For the reasons stated briefly below, none of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Hodge first argues that the district court did not consider his history and characteristics, as is required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). Although \u201cthe sentencing judge must consider the Guidelines and all of the other factors listed in section 3553(a),\u201d <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005), \u201cwe entertain a strong presumption that the sentencing judge has considered all arguments properly presented to her, unless the record clearly suggests otherwise,\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 29 (2d Cir. 2006). The record does not support Hodge\u2019s claim that the district court disregarded his drug addiction and his difficult childhood. After listening to Hodge\u2019s family members tell the court about Hodge\u2019s struggles as a youth and the impact of the Tourette\u2019s Syndrome on his personal development, the district court stated, \u201cI certainly understand what [Hodge\u2019s sister] has said about that there may have been other effects by reason of taunting by classmates and so forth. But the condition is not one that diminishes capacity.\u201d The district court then asked defense counsel about a diagnosis regarding the condition, and Hodge\u2019s attorney discussed Tourette\u2019s Syndrome and Hodge\u2019s mental capabilities. Furthermore, the district court explicitly acknowledged that the history and characteristics of the defendant are \u201cfactors that the court is required to consider pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).\u201d Finally, in reaching its decision, the court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the arguments of counsel and the factors that are set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d The district court clearly considered Hodge\u2019s history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Although Hodge acknowledges that the <em>post-Kimbrough </em>amendments to the crack cocaine Guidelines do not directly affect his sentence, he maintains that the amendments still should have bearing on his sentence. Specifically, he contends that the amendments, by lowering the Guidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, have created a wider gap between the career offender Guidelines ranges and the crack cocaine Guidelines ranges. So the argument goes, the career offender Guidelines are too harsh for crack cocaine offenders who would otherwise have a lower sentence. This argument mistakenly suggests that the career offender Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ranges should somehow be tied to the Guidelines ranges for the current offense. There is no authority for this proposition\u2014 in fact, the career offender Guidelines, as applicable to Hodge\u2019s conviction in this case, specifically instruct that \u201cif the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, Hodge argues that his sentence is unreasonably long compared to sentences imposed for his prior convictions. There is no legal basis for this argument, as nothing in the Guidelines or in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) requires a district court to consider how the sentence imposed compares with sentences for prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We have considered all of Hodge\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
