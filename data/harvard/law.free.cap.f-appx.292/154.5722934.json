Horn denying his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Sheng He Lu, </em>No. A 98 401 045 (B.I.A. Dec. 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 401 045 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 11, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">When the IJ\u2019s decision rests on multiple alternate grounds and the BIA adopts and affirms that decision without expressly addressing each of the grounds, we review the entire IJ decision rather than confining our review to the grounds expressly addressed by the BIA. <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>nee Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ accurately observed an inconsistency between Lu\u2019s testimony and written application concerning when he learned that the Chinese government had demolished his house. Because Lu\u2019s past persecution claim rested in large part on his allegation that the authorities demolished his house because he practiced Falun Gong, the agency properly relied on this inconsistency to find him not credible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Moreover, the IJ reasonably rejected Lu\u2019s explanation that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he testified that his house was destroyed after he came to the United States. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also supported by the IJ\u2019s finding that it was implausible that Lu was able to depart from a Beijing airport using his own passport, despite his claim that he was sought by authorities as a fugitive. Irrespective of whether Lu\u2019s ability to depart China can be \u201cexplained or rationalized,\u201d the IJ appropriately found this aspect of his claim implausible. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>cf Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201c[WJhen an adverse credibility finding is based partly or entirely on implausibility, we review the entire record, not whether each unusual or implausible feature of the account can be explained or rationalized.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Further, the IJ properly declined to give weight to the letter purportedly from Lu\u2019s mother where it was not notarized and provided no definitive evidence of its au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>thorship. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that the weight afforded to documentary evidence \u201c \u2018lie[s] largely\u2019 within the discretion of the IJ\u201d). Similarly, the IJ properly found that Lu\u2019s photographs did not corroborate his involvement in Falun Gong when they depicted events that occurred during the course of only a single day. <em>See id. </em>Lu has waived any challenge to that finding, moreover, due to his failure to raise it in his brief to this Court. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Lu\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony in this manner bore on his credibility, because his deficient corroboration rendered him unable to rehabilitate testimony that had already been called into question. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Under the circumstances, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Thus, its denial of Lu\u2019s application for withholding of removal was proper, and we need not reach the IJ\u2019s alternate finding with respect to Lu\u2019s burden of proof. Lastly, because Lu has failed meaningfully to challenge before this Court the agency\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief, and because addressing that claim does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
