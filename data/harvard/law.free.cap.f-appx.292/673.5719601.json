Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Yuliana\u2019s experiences in Indonesia do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1016-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">To the extent the IJ found that Yuliana\u2019s experiences were not on account of a protected ground, this finding is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). After the IJ\u2019s decision and before the BIA\u2019s decision, this court issued its opinion in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir. 2004). In her brief to the BIA, Yuliana argued that she is a member of a disfavored group under <em>Sael. </em>Because the BIA streamlined and did not consider her argument, we remand Yuliana\u2019s asylum and withholding claims to the agency to determine Sael\u2019s application in this case. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (holding that when an agency has not reached an issue, the proper course is to remand to the agency to address in the first instance).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
