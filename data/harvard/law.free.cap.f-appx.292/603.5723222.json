We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Garcia applied for social security benefits in 2000. Three times the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Garcia\u2019s application, and the Appeals Council vacated and remanded the case for further proceedings each time. In the fourth hearing in 2005, the ALJ again denied Garcia\u2019s application, and the Appeals Council denied her request for review. Garcia then filed an action in the district court seeking reversal of the ALJ\u2019s decision and a remand with directions for an award of benefits. The district court remanded the case for further consideration of Garcia\u2019s ability to perform other work.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that further proceedings would prove useful and would not simply delay the award of benefits. In remanding for further proceedings, it noted inconsistencies in the ALJ\u2019s decision regarding Garcia\u2019s ability to do other work and therefore refused to affirm that conclusion. The district court determined that Garcia\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) is inconsistent with the definition of light work and is more consistent with the lowest exertional level, sedentary work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a) (defining sedentary work). Additional proceedings, far from merely delaying an inevitable receipt of benefits, are necessary to allow an ALJ to determine the availability of significant work compatible with Garcia\u2019s RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The ALJ cannot determine whether Garcia is disabled without determining her ability to complete \u201csubstantial gainful work.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a) (defining \u201cdisability\u201d as including inability to do substantial gainful work). Adjudication and resolution of these issues are best left to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Although we are affirming the district court\u2019s remand order, this case has had a long and tangled procedural history and the delay in reaching a resolution does not reflect well on the system. The nature of the remaining issue suggests that mediation may be the most appropriate means of resolving the dispute. Counsel for the parties are directed to confer and, within ten days of the filing date of this disposition, advise the clerk\u2019s office of the Court whether the parties agree to submit the matter to a Ninth Circuit mediator. If not, then the mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">AFFIRMED. The mandate shall not issue until notice from this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
