Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, note 1, one looks to section 4B1.2 for the definition of crime of violence. Section 4B 1.2(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-18\">\u201c(a) The term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-19\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-20\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">Application note 1 to section 4B1.2 states that \u201c[f]or purposes of this guideline\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-22\">\u201c \u2018Crime of violence\u2019 includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \u2018crimes of violence\u2019 if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (ie., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>victed involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The PSR advised that Fernandez\u2019s two prior Texas convictions for aggravated assault constituted crimes of violence. Fernandez filed (on May 17, 2007) a written objection to this portion of the PSR on the basis that at the time of the 1991 aggravated assault Fernandez was 17 years old and \u201c[ujnder Federal law Defendant would have been a minor. Under Texas law he is considered an adult.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His objection also asserted that \u201cthere is not enough documentation for the court to ascertain if the two aggravated assaults are a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>470 F.3d 1143 (5th Cir.2006).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the sentencing hearing (on May 25, 2007), Fernandez\u2019s counsel initially said he had nothing to add to his written objections to the PSR. After the district court adopted the PSR (as modified) and announced its advisory guideline determinations, the court asked defense counsel if he had anything further. Counsel then reiterated that Fernandez was only 17 when the 1991 prior aggravated assault was committed. The court then asked the government if it had anything. The government then offered in evidence a copy of the indictments and judgments of conviction on each of the two prior Texas aggravated assault convictions. It noted that this was in response to defense counsel\u2019s objection that there was a lack of documentation regarding the prior crimes of violence. Defense counsel objected, stating only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cYour Honor, I have seen those documents, and we would object to them as not being timely offered into evidence. This case is over eight months old, I think. We would object on the timeliness issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The district court overruled the objection and admitted the documents in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The only point of error urged by Fernandez on appeal is that the district court erred by admitting and considering the indictment and judgment of conviction for each of the two prior Texas aggravated assault convictions. The only objection made below was that those were not timely submitted. That objection is wholly without merit. The documents were tendered in response to defendant\u2019s \u201clack of documentation\u201d objection made some two weeks previously; defense counsel had admittedly \u201cseen those documents\u201d and did not ever claim <em>any </em>surprise. Nor could any such reasonably be claimed. Moreover, the PSR also provided adequate notice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Howard, </em>444 F.3d 326 (5th Cir.2006). And, Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(2) specifically provides that at sentencing \u201c[t]he court may permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections.\u201d Finally, there has never been any claim that the exhibits in question were in any way incorrect, incomplete or otherwise in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The district court did not err in admitting the exhibits. No other relevant objection to application of section 4B1.1 was both made below and carried forward here.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In this court, appellant\u2019s new counsel seems to argue that the two pri- or aggravated Texas aggravated assault convictions are not for crimes of violence under sections 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. Such argument \u2014 assuming arguendo that it is adequately now advanced \u2014 was not raised below, and hence is reviewable only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We hold that there was no error in this respect, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">As we said in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 413 (5th Cir.2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWd\">\u201cBecause the guidelines do not define the enumerated crimes of violence, this court adopts a \u2018common sense approach,\u2019 defining each crime by its \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 .... [citations]. <em>See also United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir.2006) (\u2018Applying a common sense approach and the ordinary, contemporary and common meaning\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The relevant Texas Penal Code provisions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">\u201c\u00a7 22.01. Assault</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">(a) A person commits an offense if the person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">(1) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another, including the person\u2019s spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">(2) intentionally or knowingly threatens another with imminent bodily injury, including the person\u2019s spouse; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">(3) intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">\u00a7 22.02. Aggravated Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">(a) A person commits an offense if the person commits assault as defined in \u00a7 22.01 and the person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-16\">(1) causes serious bodily injury to another, including the person\u2019s spouse; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">(2) uses or exhibits a deadly weapon during the commission of the assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">We held in <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197 (5th Cir.2007), that the offense denounc\u00e9d by section 22.02(a) was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because it constituted \u201caggravated assault,\u201d as referenced in that guideline\u2019s list of offenses which were crimes of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Guillen-Alvarez, </em>we specifically relied on the fact that section 22.02(a) is predicated on \u201c \u2018the two most common aggravated factors\u2019 \u201d which other states employ to elevate an ordinary assault offense to aggravated assault, namely \u201c \u2018the causation of serious bodily injury and the use of a deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200 (quoting <em>United States v. Mungia-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 817 (5th Cir. 2007)). Because article 22.02(a) \u2014 quoted in <em>Guillenr-Alvarez </em>\u2014 states these two factors in the <em>alternative </em>and only <em>one </em>(use of a deadly weapon) was present there, it is clear that under <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>either alone suffices to properly elevate a section 22.01(a) assault to aggravated assault within the meaning of that term in the above quoted portion of application note 1 to section 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Here, the indictment charging the 1991 aggravated assault, of which appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty thereto, alleged that Fernandez in Harris County, Texas, \u201con or about December 21, 1991 did then and there unlawfully intentionally and knowingly threaten imminent bodily injury to Roderick A. Rosemond by using a deadly weapon, namely, a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">This 1991 offense is plainly an assault under Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(2) which section 22.02(a)(2) makes into an aggravated assault by reason of the use of a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Similarly, the indictment charging the 1993 aggravated assault, of which appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty thereto, alleged that Fernandez, in Harris County, Texas, \u201con or about August 27, 1993, did then and there unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly cause serious bodily injury to Clayton Goodman, hereinafter called the Complainant, by striking the complainant with an unknown object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">That 1993 offense is plainly an assault under Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) which \u00a7 22.02(a)(1) makes into an aggravated assault by reason of the causation of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Accordingly, the two prior Texas aggravated assault convictions were each for the offense of aggravated assault as enumerated in the application note 1 commentary to section 4B1.2 and were hence convictions for crimes of violence under section 4B1.1. <em>Guillen-Alvarez. See also, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Ramirez, </em>230 Fed.Appx. 458 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jove-Reyes, </em>262 Fed.Appx. 580 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"ac9-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\">. This objection has not been raised on appeal and is hence abandoned. In any event, it is facially without merit. See \u00a7 4B1.2, application note 1 (\"A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-12\">. In <em>Garcia </em>we remanded an enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 depending on a prior Colorado guilty plea conviction for third degree misdemeanor assault as we did \"not have the Colorado state indictment before us\u201d and hence could not identify \"under which portion of the Colorado assault statute Garcia was convicted\u201d and directed the district court to \"order the government to supplement the record with the charging documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\">. The relevant guideline definition of crime of violence in \u00a7 2 L1.2 (b) (1 )(A) (ii) is not materially different in any presently relevant respect from that at issue here, so <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>is plainly controlling. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
