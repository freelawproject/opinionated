Taylor and Toby C. Taylor (\u201cthe Taylors\u201d) petitioned the district court to quash an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) summons served on the custodian of records of the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (\u201cLDS Church\u201d) for records relating to possible criminal tax violations by the Taylors. The district court granted the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The Taylors appeal arguing that the district court erred in dismissing their petition. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">On August 1, 2007, Special Agent David Booth, an IRS criminal investigator, served a summons on the LDS Church seeking records relating to possible criminal tax violations by the Taylors for the tax years 2002-2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The summons required LDS to comply by August 13, 2007. Relying on an exception to the notice requirement for such third-party summonses, Agent Booth did not serve notice upon the Taylors. However, LDS Church notified them of the summons and its willingness to comply. On August 7, 2007, LDS Church sent the summoned information to the IRS. On August 9, 2007, relying on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(b)(2), the Taylors filed a petition to quash the IRS\u2019s summons. They also sought various forms of equitable relief in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1340, 1343(a)(3), 1346 and Article III of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">The IRS moved to dismiss the petition to quash arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over an action against the United States where the government\u2019s sovereign immunity had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>been waived. The magistrate judge agreed that the district court lacked jurisdiction. Specifically, the magistrate judge determined that: (1) although 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609 provides for a waiver of the government\u2019s sovereign immunity in certain actions brought by persons named in an IRS summons issued to a third-party, an exception to that waiver applied and barred the Taylors from bringing an action to quash the summons served on LDS Church; and (2) general jurisdictional statutes such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1340, 1343(a)(3), 1346 and Article III of the United States Constitution do not waive the government\u2019s sovereign immunity without an explicit statement from Congress. On November 16, 2007, the district court adopted the report and recommendations of the magistrate judge and issued a final judgment granting the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Taylors timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, is a jurisdictional question that we review <em>de novo. See Jones v. Grinnell Corp., </em>235 F.3d 972, 974 (5th Cir.2001). Our analysis begins with the fundamental principle that the United States cannot be sued unless its sovereign immunity has been explicitly and unequivocally waived through Congressional statute. <em>See United States v. Dalm, </em>494 U.S. 596, 608, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990); <em>see also Wilkerson v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 112, 118 (5th Cir.1995). Where Congress has statutorily waived the United States\u2019s sovereign immunity, an action against the government will be strictly construed, and a court will lack subject matter jurisdiction over any action that does not fit within the scope of the Congressional waiver. <em>See Wilkerson, </em>67 F.3d at 118. Courts have held that an action to quash a summons issued by the IRS is a suit against the United States requiring a waiver of its sovereign immunity. <em>See Barmes v. United States, </em>199 F.3d 386, 388 (7th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). Thus, resolution of the Taylors\u2019s appeal turns on whether the government has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the action they brought in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">On appeal, the Taylors contend that the district court retained jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in them petition for two reasons: (1) the statutory exception that the district court believed stripped it of jurisdiction is inapplicable to them case; and (2) other federal statutes confer jurisdiction on the district court because Agent Booth\u2019s actions were unconstitutional, exceeded the scope of his statutory authority and were taken in his official capacity as an officer of the government and under color of law. We will address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">In them first point of error, the Taylors allege that the district court had jurisdiction over them petition to quash because Congress waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity within the statutory framework of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">As a general rule, \u00a7 7609 requires the IRS to serve anyone whose financial records are sought pursuant to a third-party summons with a notice copy of the summons. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a)(1). Persons entitled to notice may then bring a petition in federal district court to quash the summons. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7609(b)(2) and (h)(1). The Taylors and the IRS agree that \u00a7 7609(b)(2) provides for waiver of the government\u2019s sovereign immunity with respect to a petition to quash brought by persons whose financial records are sought in an IRS summons issued to a third-party. However, the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>urges that an exception to that waiver of sovereign immunity found at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(c)(2)(E), bars the Taylors from bringing a petition to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In accordance with \u00a7 7602(b,) which gives the IRS the authority to issue a summons in connection with an inquiry into any \u201coffense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws,\u201d \u00a7 7609(c)(2)(E) excepts certain of those summonses from challenge in the district court if they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">(i) issued by a criminal investigator of the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the investigation of an offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(ii) served on any person who is not a third-party record keeper (as defined in \u00a7 7603(b)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(c)(2)(E)(i)-(ii). In turn, \u00a7 7603(b) lists a number of entities as third-party record keepers; however, LDS Church does not fit into any of those categories, a point conceded by the Tay-lors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Nevertheless, they maintain that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(c)(2)(E) is inapplicable to them. According to the Taylors, that section only applies to persons who may be employees or agents of the IRS, as such persons are tasked with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Therefore, because the Taylors are not IRS employees or agents, they contend they cannot commit any offenses \u201cconnected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws\u201d per \u00a7\u00a7 7602(b) or 7609(c)(2)(E)\u00ae. We disagree with the Taylors\u2019s reading of these statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">A plain reading of \u00a7\u00a7 7602(b) and 7609(c)(2)(E) demonstrates that these provisions relate to possible criminal offenses by a taxpayer that interfere with the IRS\u2019s administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws, as opposed to offenses committed by IRS agents, as urged by the Taylors. Section 7602(b), added in 1982 to the statutory framework for IRS summonses, simply codified the extension of the IRS\u2019s summons power to investigations of a taxpayer\u2019s criminal tax-related liability. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 97-248, 96. Stat. 622. Further support for this reading of \u00a7\u00a7 7602(b) and 7609(c)(2)(E) is found in the federal regulatory guidelines relating to the IRS\u2019s summons authority which explains that \u201c[t]his summons power may be used in an investigation of either civil or criminal tax-related liability.\u201d <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7602 \u2014 1(b)(1). Therefore, \u00a7 7602(b) gives the IRS the authority to issue summonses to investigate whether a taxpayer has criminally violated the internal revenue laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">Here, Agent Booth submitted an affidavit attesting to the fact that the summons issued to LDS Church related to the Tay-lors\u2019s possible criminal tax-related liability for the years 2002-2005. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Taylors acknowledge that LDS Church is not a third-party record keeper. Therefore, the exception of \u00a7 7609(c)(2)(E) fully applies to bar their petition to quash. Accordingly, the government\u2019s sovereign immunity has not been waived with respect to Taylors\u2019s petition, and the district court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In them second point of error, the Tay-lors allege that the district court retained jurisdiction to grant the equitable relief alternatively sought in their petition to quash. The Taylors now concede that general jurisdictional statutes such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1340, 1343(a)(3), 1346, and Article III of the United States Constitution are insufficient in themselves to confer such authority on the district court. However, they argue that other federal statutes give the district court power to grant their requested relief. Based on our review, none of the statutes upon which the Taylors rely abrogate the government\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">First, the Taylors rely on a line of cases that created the so-called <em>\u201cLarsou-Dugan </em>exception\u201d to sovereign immunity to argue that because their petition alleged that the actions of an officer of the United States exceeded the scope of his statutory authority, the district court had jurisdiction to grant them relief. <em>See Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., </em>337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949); <em>Du-gan v. Rank, </em>372 U.S. 609, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJ\">There may be ... suits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign which are not suits against the sovereign .... Where the officer\u2019s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions. The officer is not doing the business which the sovereign has empowered him to do or he is doing it in a way which the sovereign has forbidden. His actions are <em>ultra vires </em>his authority and therefore may be the object of specific relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>See Larson, </em>337 U.S. at 690, 69 S.Ct. 1457; <em>Dugan, </em>372 U.S. at 621-22, 83 S.Ct. 999. However, the Taylors do not provide any facts to support them assertion that Agent Booth exceeded his statutory authority in issuing the summons to LDS Church. Rather, they make only the eonclusory statement that Agent Booth\u2019s actions \u201cegregiously exceed [the] limitations\u201d of his statutory authority. As discussed above, \u00a7 7602(b) grants the IRS the power to issue summonses to third parties, like LDS Church, to investigate possible criminal tax violations of taxpayers, such as the Taylors. Therefore, Agent Booth\u2019s issuing of the summons to LDS Church was within the statutory grant of power, and the Tay-lors have not demonstrated that his actions overstepped the bounds of \u00a7 7602(b). Consequently, the Taylors have not demonstrated that they are entitled to relief under the <em>Larson-Dugan </em>exception to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Second, the Taylors contend that they are entitled to relief in the district court because Agent Booth violated the United States Constitution and \u201crelevant statutes\u201d in issuing the summons. Without providing any facts for this assertion, the Taylors argue that while 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1) exempts government officers from suit individually for common law torts committed within the scope of them employment, that exemption does not apply where a civil action is brought against a government employee for violation of the United States Constitution or a federal statute. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>As best we can determine, the Taylors seek relief from the summons by characterizing their petition to quash as a <em>Bivens </em>action whereby a person may seek damages and other relief when a federal agent has allegedly violated that person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., </em>188 F.3d 579, 590 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bur. of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)). However, them petition to quash falls short of stating a <em>Bivens </em>claim as, significantly, they do not name Agent Booth, in his individual capacity, as a defendant in their action. <em>See Williamson v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>815 F.2d 368, 380-81 (5th Cir.1987) (explaining that a <em>Bivens </em>action only applies against individual federal officers, in their individual capacities ... [while] \u201c[t]he United States and its officers in pursuit of them official duties remain protected by sovereign immunity.\u201d). Consequently, the Taylors cannot rely upon the waiver of sovereign immunity in 28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(2) to seek relief in the district court against the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Finally, the Taylors allege that \u00a7 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) gives the district court power to grant them equitable relief from the IRS\u2019s summons. Section 702 waives sovereign immunity in regard to actions seeking non-monetary relief and claiming \u201cthat an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. However, \u00a7 702 further provides: \u201cNothing herein ... confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a petitioner cannot bring an action against the United States under the APA if another statute prohibits his claim. <em>See McCarty v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 1085, 1088 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Here, the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, specifically prohibits the injunctive relief the Taylors seek, as that statute provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). Courts have held that this prohibition applies equally to actions to enjoin IRS investigations. <em>See Hobson v. Fischbeck, </em>758 F.2d 579, 580-81 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Dema, </em>544 F.2d 1373, 1376 (7th Cir.1976); <em>accord Brittingham v. United States, </em>451 F.2d 315, 317-18 (5th Cir.1971). Additionally, to the extent that the Taylors sought declaratory relief in the district court, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, bars claims with respect to a dispute over federal taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 732 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974) (explaining that Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 evidences its \u201cantipathy for premature interference with the assessment or collection of any federal tax.\u201d); <em>accord Brittingham, </em>451 F.2d at 317-18. Therefore, as both the Anti-Injunction Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act bar the equitable relief sought by the Taylors, they cannot avail themselves of the APA\u2019s waiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>er of sovereign immunity to seek that relief in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
