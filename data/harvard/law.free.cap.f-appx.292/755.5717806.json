O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">Blake Hankins Stover, a federal prisoner represented by counsel, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. The district court dismissed the motion. Stover then filed a request for a certificate of appealability (COA), which the court denied. Stover renews his requests for COA in this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b777-24\">Stover was convicted by a jury of numerous counts involving the manufacture and distribution of drugs. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Stover, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 351 (10th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 909, 123 S.Ct. 2261, 156 L.Ed.2d 121 (2003). Stover filed a \u00a7 2255 motion claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise allegedly meritorious issues on direct appeal. The district court dismissed the motion. <em>See United States v. Stover, </em>Nos. CR-00155M, CIV-04-646M, 2007 WL 2363289 (W.D.Okla. Aug.16, 2007). It concluded the omitted issues were not \u201cdead bang\u201d winners and therefore, Stover failed to show his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise them in his direct ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>peal. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 392 (10th Cir.1995). Thereafter, the district court denied his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">A COA is a jurisdictional pre-requisite to our review. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA only if Stover makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Insofar as the district court dismissed his habeas petition on procedural grounds, he must demonstrate both that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. English v. Cody, </em>241 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cSection 2255 motions are not available to test the legality of matters which should have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). When a petitioner \u201cfails to raise an issue on direct appeal, he is barred from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, unless he establishes either cause excusing the procedural default and prejudice resulting from the error or a fundamental miscarriage of justice if the claim is not considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can establish cause to overcome the procedural bar. <em>Id. </em>Stover must show (1) his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a defendant alleges his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise an issue on appeal, we examine the merits of the omitted issue[s].\u201d <em>Cook, </em>45 F.3d at 392. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment does not require an attorney raise every non-frivolous issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. Rather, counsel\u2019s performance is ineffective when a \u201cdead bang\u201d winner is omitted on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">The district court examined each issue raised by Stover and found not one was a \u201cdead bang\u201d winner. <em>Stover, </em>2007 WL 2363289 at *3-5. Stover reasserts his arguments here but unfortunately provides an inadequate record for our review. His appendix contains individual pages from the trial transcript without offering the entire transcript, or at least the full transcript from the witnesses whose testimony he references. Without a transcript of the relevant proceedings, we cannot determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the merit of his claims and must affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Dago, </em>441 F.3d 1238, 1251 (10th Cir.2006) (stating counseled appellants have a duty to provide an adequate record and the failure to do so will result in the affirmation of the district court\u2019s judgment). For example, Stover states appellate counsel was ineffective because he failed to raise sufficiency of the evidence on two charges and for failing to address several categories of inadmissible evidence. We must review his claims in the light most favorable to the government and \u201cpresume that counsel\u2019s actions constituted sound strategy.\u201d <em>Boltz v. Mullin, </em>415 F.3d 1215, 1222 (10th Cm. 2005). Given this standard, Stover\u2019s submission of random selected pages of the trial transcript cannot establish his claim. Because Stover has not provided a sufficient record to demonstrate the district court\u2019s dismissal is reasonably debatable, he has failed to make a sufficient showing that he is entitled to a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We DISMISS his application for a COA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. \u201cAlthough <em>Strickland </em>set forth standards for determining the effectiveness of trial counsel, we have applied those same standards in assessing the effectiveness of appellate counsel.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>45 F.3d at 394.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-15\">. We note during the course of proceedings in this Court, we issued Stover's counsel several deficiency notices and counsel specifically filed a notice stating a transcript was not necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
