Jahmall argues that when imposing his sentence, the district court failed to consider his advanced age, his medical problems, and his lack of dangerousness. Jahmall contends that his sentence is unreasonable in light of those factors because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under <em>Gall, </em>we must determine first whether the district court committed procedural error. 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we find no procedural error, then we consider the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>Sentences imposed within a properly calculated guideline range are presumed reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because Jahmall did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, we apply a plain error standard of review, \u201cwhich requires considerable deference to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cWe may correct the sentencing determination only if (1) there is error ...; (2) it is plain; and (3) it affects [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Jahmall\u2019s sentencing range was seventy-eight to ninety-seven months. The district court sentenced Jahmall to seventy-eight months, and therefore his sentence is presumed reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">We hold that the district court did not commit plain error in imposing Jahmall\u2019s seventy-eight-month sentence. First, the district court did not commit procedural error. At sentencing, there was testimony concerning Jahmall\u2019s background, advanced age, loss of vision, diabetes, medications, and drug addiction. Before imposing Jahmall\u2019s sentence, the district court expressly considered \u201cthe circumstances of the Defendant, the circumstances of the case ... the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the factors required to be taken into consideration by statute[,] and ... the Presentence Investigation Report.\u201d Second, Jahmall\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. The district court heard evidence at sentencing that Jahmall was arrested for a drug offense while on bail for the instant offense. Despite Jahmall\u2019s contrary contentions, his seventy-eight-month sentence serves sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>eral of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2019s objectives, such as promoting respect for the law, affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). At bottom, the totality of the circumstances in this case, particularly under a plain error review, do not warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We acknowledge that during the pen-dency of Jahmall\u2019s appeal, the Sentencing Commission enacted Amendment 715 to \u00a7 2D 1.1, revising the manner in which combined offense levels are determined in cases involving cocaine base and one or more other controlled substances. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, app. C (2008). Our holding in the present case does not preclude future consideration of this issue in a motion to the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
