Pedro Gonon-Xiap, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing due process claims de novo, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), and factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">Even if the IJ erred by failing to consider the 2002 State Department\u2019s country report for Guatemala, the BIA\u2019s subsequent consideration of the report as part of Yac-Salanic\u2019s motion to reopen and remand cured any error. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995) (explaining that any error caused by IJ\u2019s refusal to consider petitioner\u2019s exhibits was cured by BIA\u2019s subsequent consideration of that evidence). Thus, Yac-Salanic\u2019s due process contention fails because he has not shown prejudice. <em>See Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971 (requiring an applicant to show prejudice in order to reverse BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>decision on due process grounds). Moreover, we reject Yac-Salanie\u2019s contention that the BIA could not consider the report. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Yac-Salanie\u2019s untimely filing of his asylum application should be excused due to changed circumstances. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Yac-Salanic failed to establish he was or will be persecuted by guerrillas on account of a protected ground. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (explaining that applicant for withholding of removal bears burden of showing persecution was or will be on account of a protected ground). In addition, we reject Yac-Salanic\u2019s attempt to recast his claim that civil patrols, as opposed to guerrillas, targeted him in Guatemala. Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Yac-Salanic could relocate to another part of Guatemala.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

We need not reach Yac-Salanic's contention that the IJ improperly found him to be an economic refugee because in its second opinion the BIA, reviewing de novo, did not rely on this finding to deny relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
