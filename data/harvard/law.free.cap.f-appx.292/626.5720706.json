R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b649-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">Lucio Rolon-Morales, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order affirming an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\">Rolan-Morales has failed to challenge the agency\u2019s determination that his asylum application is time-barred, which is dispositive. He also failed to support with argument his contention that he is entitled to CAT protection. He has therefore waived these issues. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that issues not supported by argument are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Rolan-Morales is not eligible for withholding of removal because Rolan-Morales\u2019 fear that he would be targeted by corrupt Mexican officials is highly speculative. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (declining to credit a speculative future persecution claim). Accordingly, Rolan-Morales\u2019s claim for withholding of removal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Rolan-Morales\u2019 contention that the retroactive application of the expanded aggravated felony definition in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), violates due process is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 853 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWe are satisfied that Congress intended the 1996 amendments to make the aggravated felony definition apply retroactively to all defined offenses whenever committed.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid-cd by 9 th Cir.
