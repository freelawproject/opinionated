City and County of San Francisco, </em>33 Cal.4th 1055, 17 Cal. Rptr.3d 225, 95 P.3d 459 (2004). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Lockhart v. United States, </em>376 F.3d 1027, 1028 (9th Cir.2004), and we consider sua sponte whether a claim is moot, <em>Bernhardt v. County of L.A., </em>279 F.3d 862, 871 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The district court properly dismissed appellants\u2019 due process claim because <em>Lock-yer </em>did not grant them a right to a hearing regarding their disabilities. <em>See Cassidy v. Hawaii, </em>915 F.2d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1990) (concluding that the plaintiff did not have a property interest under state regulations and thus failed to prove a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The district court properly dismissed appellants\u2019 ADA claim because they did not show that they were denied the right to marry on the basis of their disabilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; <em>Weinreich v. L.A. County Metro. Trausp. Auth., </em>114 F.3d 976, 978-79 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that the plaintiff failed to show that he was excluded from the public program on the basis of his disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Appellants\u2019 equal protection challenge fails because they did not allege facts to support their assertion that defendants treated them differently than similarly situated non-disabled persons. <em>See Lee v. City of L.A., </em>250 F.3d 668, 686-87 (9th Cir.2001) (setting forth requirements for an equal protection claim based on disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">In light of the California Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>In re Marriage Cases, </em>43 Cal.4th 757, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 183 P.3d 384 (2008), we dismiss as moot the appeal from the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief. <em>See Outdoor Media Group, Inc. v. City of Beaumont, </em>506 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were mooted by repeal of the challenged ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
