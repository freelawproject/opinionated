We lack jurisdiction in this appeal to review two of the orders \u2014 one denying leave to amend the complaint and the other dismissing certain defendants \u2014 because the orders were not final when this appeal was filed, and did not otherwise qualify for interlocutory appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292; <em>Kassuelke v. Alliant Techsys., Inc., </em>223 F.3d 929, 930-31 (8th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As to the order denying a preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of the grooming policy, we conclude that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employed the proper legal analysis under RLUIPA and did not err in determining that plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. <em>See Fegans v. Norris, </em>537 F.3d 897 (8th Cir.2008) (upholding Arkansas grooming policies against RLUIPA challenge); <em>Hamilton v. Schriro, </em>74 F.3d 1545, 1550-51 (8th Cir.1996); <em>see also Safety-Kleen Sys., Inc. v. Hennkens, </em>301 F.3d 931, 935 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review); <em>Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., </em>640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir.1981) (en banc) (preliminary injunction factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying preliminary injunc-tive relief. We also deny plaintiffs\u2019 request for a writ of mandamus based on conclusory assertions of the district court\u2019s bias, and we deny as moot plaintiffs\u2019 motion to consolidate this appeal with Appeal No. 07-3835.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">.

David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
