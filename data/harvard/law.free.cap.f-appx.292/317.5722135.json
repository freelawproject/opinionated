Carmell argues that his constitutional rights were violated when the Texas Court of Appeals reaffirmed his convictions on remand from the United States Supreme Court, and that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel during those remand proceedings. With respect to his first contention, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. However, we conclude that Car-mell\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on remand warrants relief. Thus, we reverse and remand solely on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">Scott Leslie Carmell was convicted of fifteen counts of sexual offenses committed against his step-daughter \u2014 eight counts of indecency with a child, five counts of sexual assault, and two counts of aggravated sexual assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carmell appealed, arguing, inter alia, that four of his fifteen convictions were obtained without sufficient evidence. <em>See Carmell v. State (Carmell I), </em>963 S.W.2d 833, 835-36 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1998, pet. refd). Carmell\u2019s argument rested on article 38.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, which, prior to a 1993 amendment, allowed convictions for indecency with a child and sexual assault to be supported by \u201cthe un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>corroborated testimony of the victim of the sexual offense if the victim informed any person, other than the defendant, of the alleged offense within six months after the date on which the offense is alleged to have occurred.\u201d TexCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.07 (Vernon 1992) (emphasis added). The pre-1993 statute further provided that \u201c[t]he requirement that the victim inform another person of an alleged offense does not apply if the victim was younger than 14 years of age at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Carmell argued that under this statute one of his sexual assault convictions, Count 7, and three of his indecency convictions, Counts 8 through 10, were based on insufficient evidence because they rested only on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim who had failed to make a timely outcry. <em>See Carmell I, </em>963 S.W.2d at 836. At the time that the sexual conduct underlying the four convictions occurred, Car-mell\u2019s victim was over fourteen years of age, yet she waited more than a year to reveal to her mother what had happened. Consequently, her outcry was not timely under the 1992 version of article 38.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Texas Court of Appeals held that the 1993 version of article 38.07 applied to Carmell\u2019s convictions and rejected Car-mell\u2019s insuffieiency-of-the-evidence claim. <em>Id. </em>The amended version of the statute raised the age of victims who were not required to make a timely outcry from \u201cyounger than 14\u201d to \u201cyounger than 18\u201d years of age. Act of May 10, 1993, 1993 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. ch. 200, 389 (West) (codified as amended at TexCode Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.07 (Vernon 1993)). Despite the fact that the amended statute took effect after the offense conduct occurred, the Texas Court of Appeals found that it applied to Carmell\u2019s case because it was merely \u201ca rule of procedure.\u201d <em>Camiell I, </em>963 S.W.2d at 836. As the victim was younger than eighteen years old when the conduct alleged in Counts 7 through 10 occurred, there was no eorroboration-or-outcry requirement under article 38.07, as amended, so the Texas Court of Appeals affirmed Carmell\u2019s convictions. <em>Id. </em>Car-mell\u2019s petition for discretionary review was refused by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (the \u201cTCCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed Carmell\u2019s convictions on Counts 7 through 10. <em>See Camrell v. Texas (Carmell II), </em>529 U.S. 513, 552-53, 120 S.Ct. 1620, 146 L.Ed.2d 577 (2000). The Court compared the 1993 amended version of article 38.07, which was applied by the Texas Court of Appeals in Carmell\u2019s case, with the earlier version that required, for conviction, corroborating evidence or outcry within six months if the victim was over fourteen years old, and concluded that the amended version changed the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 120 S.Ct. 1620. Thus, because Carmell committed the offenses charged in Counts 7 through 10 before the effective date of the 1993 amendment and his victim was over fourteen years of age at the time of the offenses, the Supreme Court held that Carmell\u2019s convictions on those four counts, \u201cinsofar as they are not corroborated by other evidence,\u201d violated the constitutional prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws and could not stand. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 120 S.Ct. 1620. The Court reversed the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 553,120 S.Ct. 1620.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Three days after the Supreme Court issued its decision, the Texas Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, and Carmell requested appointment of counsel on remand. By order issued on June 14, 2000, the Texas Court of Appeals granted Car-mell\u2019s request by abating the appeal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>remanding the case to the trial court for the appointment of counsel by June 27, 2000. The order also provided for the automatic reinstatement of the appeal upon receipt of the supplemental record. On June 21, 2000, the trial court appointed Tom Whitlock to represent Carmell.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On June 26, 2000, the Texas Court of Appeals received the trial court\u2019s supplemental record reflecting the appointment of Whitlock. At that point, the appeal having been automatically reinstated and submitted to a panel, the State of Texas filed a motion requesting leave to file a supplemental brief. The State argued that \u201cthe opinion on remand raised a new issue that the State did not have an opportunity to brief,\u201d namely, whether there was sufficient corroborating evidence adduced at trial to sustain the conviction under the 1992 version of article 38.07. The Texas Court of Appeals granted the motion, and the State filed its supplemental brief on July 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On July 5, 2000, Carmell drafted a letter to Whitlock which set forth certain expectations Carmell had of the representation. These expectations included: maintaining confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege; communicating with Carmell in a timely and direct manner; being willing to file a brief in excess of the 50-page limit as well as a reply to the State\u2019s brief; requesting oral argument; obtaining records still in the custody of trial counsel; and obtaining Carmell\u2019s approval before filing any briefs. Carmell concluded his list of expectations with a conditional request: \u201cIf you do not have the time, interest, or orientation to work with me according to the things contained herein, then I respectfully] ask you [to] file a Motion to Withdraw and a Motion to Appoint Appellate Counsel.\u201d The letter also contained a post-script reading: \u201cDo whatever it takes to win. Or, get me another attorney.\u201d Despite the overtone of an ultimatum, Car-mell apparently did not assume that this language would deter Whitlock from representing him because he concluded the letter by saying: \u201cI am looking forward to a phone call (or a visit) in the immediate future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">After receiving this correspondence from Carmell, Whitlock determined that he would not be able to provide satisfactory representation to Carmell. Whitlock filed a motion for leave to withdraw in the trial court on July 24, 2000 \u2014 the same day that the State filed its supplemental brief. The trial court granted the motion and substituted Jack McKeathen as Carmell\u2019s counsel on July 24, 2000. The Texas Court of Appeals received notice of the substitution of counsel on July 26, 2000, as well as another supplemental record documenting the substitution of counsel in the trial court shortly thereafter. About three weeks later, on August 17, 2000, the Texas Court of Appeals issued its opinion in the case. <em>Carmell v. State (Carmell III), </em>26 S.W.3d 726 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2000, pet. ref d). After a de novo review of the trial record, applying the 1992 version of the statute, the Texas Court of Appeals concluded that the victim\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated at trial and affirmed Carmell\u2019s convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 727-28. The next day, Carmell\u2019s new attorney, McKeathen, sought leave to file a supplemental brief and requested that the court delay the release of its opinion. In his motion, McKeathen explained that he was not informed of his appointment as Car-mell\u2019s attorney until July 28, 2000, and further certified that the State had no objection to the motion. However, on August 21, 2000, the Texas Court of Appeals denied McKeathen\u2019s request as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">On August 22, 2000, Carmell filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the Texas Court of Appeals seeking the dismissal of McKeathen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the appointment of new counsel based on the complete lack of communication from McKeathen regarding the status of his case on remand. His motion was denied. McKeathen then moved for rehearing, to have the court\u2019s opinion withdrawn, and for leave to file a supplemental brief. But, once again, the Texas Court of Appeals denied the motions. Thus, no brief was ever filed by, or on behalf of, Carmell during the appellate proceedings on remand. Subsequently, the TCCA refused Carmell\u2019s petition for discretionary review, and the Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Carmell sought state habeas relief in fifteen separate applications (one for each of his convictions), arguing, in relevant part, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during his appellate proceedings on remand from the Supreme Court, and that his constitutional rights were infringed by the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to affirm his convictions again on remand. All fifteen applications were denied without written order on November 13, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Having exhausted his state court remedies, Carmell timely filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition on December 18, 2002. As he had in his state habeas applications, Carmell argued that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel in the Texas Court of Appeals upon remand from the United States Supreme Court, and that the Texas Court of Appeals violated his constitutional rights by refusing to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. On January 17, 2006, a magistrate judge (the \u201cMJ\u201d) recommended that all of Carmell\u2019s claims be denied on the merits. Carmell objected to the MJ\u2019s report and recommendation, but the district court overruled those objections and adopted the MJ\u2019s report and recommendation in an order dated March 6, 2006. That same day, the district court entered its final judgment denying Carmell\u2019s petition. Carmell timely filed a notice of appeal and sought a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). The district court granted Carmell IFP status but denied him a COA. Subsequently, this court granted Carmell a COA solely on the following two issues: (1) whether the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on remand from the United States Supreme Court violated Carmell\u2019s constitutional rights by considering whether there was other evidence of Carmell\u2019s guilt in the trial record that corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony; and (2) whether Carmell was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u201cIn an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo.\u201d Bosley v. Cain, </em>409 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2005). The Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) requires a district court considering a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition to defer to the state court\u2019s adjudication on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims unless the state court\u2019s adjudication resulted in a decision that was: \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d; or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 336-37 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cA state court\u2019s decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>facts.\u201d <em>Mi-niel, </em>339 F.3d at 336 (citation omitted). \u201cA state court\u2019s decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In this case, Carmell\u2019s post-conviction proceedings in state court resulted in denials without written order by the TCCA. These denials were nevertheless \u201con the merits.\u201d <em>See Bledsue v. Johnson,, </em>188 F.3d 250, 256-57 &amp; n. 13 (5th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Ex parte Thomas, </em>953 S.W.2d 286, 288-89 (Tex.Crim.App.1997)). Thus, the TCCA\u2019s denial of Carmeh\u2019s claims is entitled to deference under AEDPA, with the unreasonable-application inquiry for each claim focusing on the TCCA\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion, not its reasoning. <em>See Neal v. Puckett, </em>286 F.3d 230, 246 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Carmell challenges the district court\u2019s rejection of his claim that the decision to affirm his convictions on Counts 7 through 10 on remand violated his constitutional rights. Carmell argues that the Texas Court of Appeals acted in contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate by reviewing the record to find evidence corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony even though, he contends, the Supreme Court had already determined that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain those convictions. Thus, according to Carmell, the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 error in implementing the mandate on remand violated not only the Supremacy Clause, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2; <em>Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee, </em>14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but also his due process rights when \u201cthe State [was allowed] to resurrect the corroboration issue.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we see Carmell\u2019s mandate argument, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Carmell II </em>was based on a violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, and were Carmell to be held in violation of the Court\u2019s mandate (as he argues), the violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause would be ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">It has long been established that inferior state courts are obligated to enforce the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate on remand. <em>See Briggs v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>334 U.S. 304, 306, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403 (1948); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>say that once a case has been decided by the Supreme Court on appeal and remanded to the court below, \u201c[w]hatever was before the Court and is disposed of, is considered finally settled. The inferior court is bound by the decree, as the law of the case; and must carry it into execution according to the mandate.... \u201d <em>Ex Parte Sibbald v. United States, </em>37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 488, 492, 9 L.Ed. 1167 (1838); <em>see Vendo v. Lektro-Vend Corp., </em>434 U.S. 425, 427-28, 98 S.Ct. 702, 54 L.Ed.2d 659 (1978); <em>In re Sanford Fork &amp; Tool Co., </em>160 U.S. 247, 255, 16 S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895); see <em>also United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 753 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201c[A] lower court on remand must implement both the letter and the spirit of the [appellate court\u2019s] mandate, and may not disregard the explicit directives of that court.\u201d (second alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Farias, </em>481 F.3d 289, 291-92 (5th Cir.2007). However, \u201c[w]hile a mandate is controlling as to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.\u201d <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 347 n. 18, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979) (quoting <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939)). Therefore, to determine whether the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate was not followed in <em>Car-mell III, </em>we must carefully examine the issues that were actually decided by the Supreme Court in <em>Carmell II </em>as well as the Court\u2019s final directive in that case. <em>See Kansas City S. Ry. Co. v. Guardian Trust Co., </em>281 U.S. 1, 10, 50 S.Ct. 194, 74 L.Ed. 659 (1930) (\u201cFor the proper construction of the decree under consideration, regard is to be had to the issues before the court on appeal, the findings applied for and the directions given.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>deciding criminal appeals as of right are subject to the demands of due process in that they must provide for an adequate, effective, and fair appeal); <em>see also Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 19-20, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) (imposing constitutional constraints on states when they choose to create appellate review). Along those lines, Carmell urges that \u201d[j]ustice ... cannot be secured\u201d when an inferior court, the Texas Court of Appeals here, \"refuses to honor the decision of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d the final arbiter of the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>To begin, in support of his construction, Carmell cites to several places in <em>Carmell II </em>where he claims that the Court suggested that the evidence of corroboration was insufficient. <em>See, e.g., </em>529 U.S. at 530, 120 S.Ct. 1620 (\u201c[Petitioner could be (and was) convicted on the victim\u2019s testimony alone, without any corroborating evidence.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 531, 120 S.Ct. 1620 (\u201cTexas\u2019 retrospective application of the amendment to [a]rticle 38.07 permitted petitioner to be convicted with less than the previously required quantum of evidence.\u201d). However, these snippets from the majority opinion were preceded by footnote four, explaining in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">The State argues that there is evidence corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony, so it does not help petitioner even if the old law applies. Before the state court, however, petitioner argued that \u201cthere was nothing to corroborate [the victim\u2019s] version of events,\u201d ... and <em>that court accepted the contention as correct for the purposes of its decision. We do the same here.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\"><em>Carmell II, </em>529 U.S. at 519 n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 1620 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). The most plausible reading of this passage is that the Court only assumed a lack of corroborating evidence, <em>arguendo, </em>in order to reach the <em>ex post facto </em>question. Such assumptions are not part of the mandate and, as such, do not constrain the lower court on remand. <em>See </em>18B Wright, Miller <em>&amp; </em>Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u00a7 4478.3, at 757 (2002) (\u201cA mere recital of <em>matters assumed for purposes of decision </em>and dicta are not part of the mandate.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Uccio, </em>940 F.2d 753, 757-58 (2d Cir.1991) (explaining that the passage in the court of appeals\u2019 opinion that simply stated the position taken by the district court before the appeal was not a ruling on the issue and did not establish the law of the case). Thus, the Court\u2019s later references to insufficient corroboration neither explicitly nor implicitly disposed of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Further support for this interpretation is found in Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in <em>Carmell II. Cf. Harris v. Sentry Title Co., </em>806 F.2d 1278, 1280-81 (5th Cir.1987) (relying, in part, on the dissent in the prior appeal to determine the scope of the court\u2019s mandate). In particular, the dissent cites the majority opinion\u2019s footnote four, noting: <em>Carmell II, </em>529 U.S. at 555 n. 2, 120 S.Ct. 1620 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Additionally, it is key that the majority opinion\u2019s ultimate holding was open-ended \u2014 \u201cwe hold that petitioner\u2019s convictions on [C]ounts 7 through 10, <em>insofar as they are not corroborated by other evidence, </em>cannot be sustained under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause\u201d \u2014 and instructed that \u201cthe judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded <em>for fwi iher proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d Id. </em>at 552-53, 120 S.Ct. 1620 (emphasis added). Taken as a whole, it is clear that the Supreme Court in fact neither considered nor decided (even implicitly) the issue of corroboration, and thus the Texas Court of Appeals decision to visit the issue of corroboration on remand was not inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">The Texas Court of Appeals did not rule on whether the State in fact did corroborate [the victim\u2019s] testimony at trial. I note the testimony of [the victim\u2019s] mother that when she visited Carmell in jail and told him he needed to confess if he was sorry for what he had done, he wrote \u201c \u2018adultery with [the victim]\u2019 \u201d on a piece of paper. <em>[Carmel </em>/,] 963 S.W.2d at 835. \u201cThat testimony might count as corroboration. <em>Because this question is outside the grant of certiorari, I (like the Court, see </em>ante, <em>at [519 </em>] <em>n. I) do not further address it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Additionally, we find unpersuasive Carmell\u2019s citations to decisions from other courts construing his victory in <em>Carmell II </em>to suggest that a different outcome should have resulted on remand in <em>Carmell III. See, e.g., Hameen v. Delaware, </em>212 F.3d 226, 241-42 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[The <em>Carmell II </em>Court] held that the 1993 amendment to the Texas law was ex post facto as applied to [Carmell] because it reduced the \u2018quantum of evidence\u2019 necessary to convict [Carmell] inasmuch as without the amendment he could not have been convicted on the counts in question.\u201d); <em>McCulloch v. State, </em>39 S.W.3d 678, 683 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2001, pet. ref'd). Those opinions only in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>voked <em>Carmell II </em>for its <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. They neither conducted a searching review of the case nor ascertained the exact scope of the mandate. For those courts\u2019 purposes, it was sufficient to present the underlying facts in <em>Carmell II </em>without explaining that the corroboration issue had yet to be decided in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Carmell further argues that the Texas Court of Appeals determined in <em>Camiell I </em>that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, and, thus, that its subsequent decision on remand, <em>Carmell III, </em>also conflicted with the \u201claw of the case.\u201d Carmell misreads the opinion of the Texas Court of Appeals in <em>Car-mell I, </em>which only mentioned the issue of corroborating evidence in framing Car-mell\u2019s argument. <em>See Carmell I, </em>963 5. W.2d at 836 (\u201cIn his sixth point, appellant argues that he should be acquitted of one of the sexual assault convictions because [the victim] did not tell her mother about the abuse until \u2018years after the offense\u2019 and <em>there ivas nothing to corroborate [the </em>victim\u2019s] <em>version of events.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Thereafter, the Court dealt solely with the issue of which version of article 38.07 should apply \u2014 the <em>ex post facto </em>issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In sum, we agree with the district court\u2019s decision to deny relief on this issue because we cannot say that the state habe-as court\u2019s decision \u2014 an implied conclusion that <em>Carmell III </em>is not inconsistent with <em>Camiell II </em>\u2014 \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Carmell also contends that he was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel in the Texas Court of Appeals during the continuation of his direct appeal proceedings on remand from the Supreme Court. As support, Carmell points to his first attorney\u2019s withdrawal from the case because of his \u201cunwillingness to be a zealous advocate\u201d and to his second attorney\u2019s failure to: \u201c(1) file a brief, (2) file a responsive brief to the State\u2019s brief, (3) file a motion for extension of time to file a brief, and/or (4) request oral argument.\u201d Additionally, Carmell urges that both attorneys\u2019 alleged failures amounted to the constructive denial of any assistance on appeal requiring a presumption of prejudice. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 88, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Alternatively, Carmell submits that prejudice exists because there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels\u2019 deficient performance, Carmell would have prevailed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Before turning to the merits of Car-mell\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we first address a factual finding of the district court. In its answer to Car-mell\u2019s federal habeas petition, the State argued, very briefly, that Carmell could not allege that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he requested that his counsel withdraw at a critical stage of the proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The MJ\u2019s report and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ommendation, which was adopted by the district court, found that \u201ccounsel withdrew as counsel for Petitioner based upon Petitioner\u2019s own request\u201d in the July 5, 2000 letter and that Carmell had failed to show deficient performance by virtue of that requested withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that Carmell requested Whitlock to withdraw as counsel is a finding of fact that is reviewed for clear error. <em>Bosley, </em>409 F.3d at 662. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Carmell requested Whitlock to withdraw is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Whitlock\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel states that he withdrew because he \u201ccould not meet certain criteria set out in writing by [Carmell].\u201d The criteria set forth in the letter, detailed <em>supra </em>in Part I, do not exceed reasonable expectations of competent representation. Confidentiality, communication, and collaboration are essential to all representations and are neither excessive nor unreasonable demands to make upon counsel. Cannell\u2019s post-script to \u201cdo whatever it takes to win[, o]r get me another attorney\u201d was not a directive requiring Whitlock to withdraw. Indeed, Carmell\u2019s letter concluded with the statement that he was looking forward to a phone call or visit from Whitlock. In sum, Cannell\u2019s letter was merely an expression of an earnest desire to have competent, dedicated representation during the remand proceedings. Only Whitlock was in a position to determine if he had sufficient time and resources to provide Carmell with the quality of representation described in the letter. Whitlock made this determination unilaterally and had no contact with Carmell regarding the decision to withdraw. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred when it found Carmell requested Whitlock to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">We next turn to the substance of Car-mell\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After the district court faulted Car-mell for the ill-timed substitution of counsel, it apparently failed to consider Car-mell\u2019s argument that his second attorney, McKeathen, rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file any brief or motion for extension of time before the Texas Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on his first appeal as of right. <em>Evitts v. Lacey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 397, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985). Because an appellant after remand \u201cstands in the same position\u201d under Texas law as when the initial appeal was filed, <em>Titeas o. State, </em>863 S.W.2d 489, 491 (Tex. CrimApp.1993) (en banc), this constitutional guarantee extends to the remand proceedings here. Ordinarily, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To demonstrate prejudice, a petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. However, \u201c[i]n certain Sixth Amendment contexts, prejudice is presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052. One such context includes the \u201c[ajctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether.\u201d <em>Id,; Penson, </em>488 U.S. at 88, 109 S.Ct. 346. Carmell contends that the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>of his appointment of counsel rendered it a \u201cmere formal appointment\u201d and the proceedings on remand a \u201cmeaningless ritual.\u201d Consequently, he argues that prejudice should be presumed, as it was in <em>Penson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In <em>Penson, </em>the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel filed a document captioned \u201cCertification of Meritless Appeal and Motion,\u201d failing to draw attention to anything that might arguably support the appeal as suggested by the Court in <em>Anders v. Califo-nia,1 </em>and moved the court to allow him to withdraw as appellate counsel. 488 U.S. at 77-78, 109 S.Ct. 346. The state appellate court granted the counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw before its own examination of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 109 S.Ct. 346. Some time later, the state court reviewed the case and found that the record supported several arguably meritorious grounds for reversal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction and modification of his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 109 S.Ct. 346. Nevertheless, it did not appoint new counsel. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that the state appellate court had erred when it failed to appoint new counsel once it had determined that the record supported several arguable claims. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346. Because this left the petitioner \u201centirely without the assistance of counsel on appeal,\u201d the Court presumed prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 109 S.Ct. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In the more recent case of <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000), the Court further explained the scope of its holding in <em>Penson. </em>Namely, in <em>Penson </em>the Court \u201cdistinguished denial of counsel altogether on appeal, which warrants a presumption of prejudice, from mere ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, which does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 120 S.Ct. 746. In <em>Robbins, </em>the Court concluded that because the defendant there \u201cha[d] received appellate counsel who ha[d] complied with a valid state procedure for determining whether the defendant\u2019s appeal [was] frivolous, and <em>the State ha[d] not at any time left the defendant without counsel on appeal, </em>there [was] no reason to presume that the defendant had been prejudiced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Robbins </em>Court reiterated that while a \u201cstrong presumption of reliability\u201d normally applies to judicial proceedings, \u201cwhen, as in <em>Penson, </em>there has been a complete denial of counsel, [courts] understandably presume the opposite.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Here, Carmell contends that because his first attorney withdrew and no brief was ever filed on his behalf during his appeal proceedings on remand, his situation is similar to that of the petitioner in <em>Penson. </em>However, the facts presented in <em>Penson </em>were more egregious than those in this case in that in <em>Penson </em>the state appellate court chose not to appoint new counsel even after it discovered arguable merit in the petitioner\u2019s appeal. Those facts stand in stark contrast to the Texas trial court\u2019s decision here to appoint new counsel the same day that Carmell\u2019s first attorney on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>remand was permitted to withdraw. As such, Carmell, unlike the petitioner in <em>Pen-son, </em>was never <em>actually </em>denied counsel at a critical stage of his appeal on remand. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (\u201cThe presumption that counsel\u2019s assistance is essential requires us to conclude that a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage. The same is true on appeal.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Of course, the \u201ccomplete denial of counsel,\u201d \u2014 when counsel is either totally absent or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of a proceeding \u2014 is not the only situation in which prejudice is presumed. <em>Wright v. Van Patten, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 743, 746, 169 L.Ed.2d 583 (2008) (citation omitted). In <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), the Supreme Court recognized two additional situations in which a Sixth Amendment violation may be found \u201cwithout inquiring into counsel\u2019s actual performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had\u201d on the proceeding. <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 695, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). They include: \u201cwhere counsel is called upon to render assistance under circumstances where competent counsel very likely could not\u201d; and, most relevant here, where a petitioner is represented by counsel, but his or her \u201ccounsel <em>entirely </em>fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 122 S.Ct. 1843 (emphasis added) (citation omitted); <em>see Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2039 (\u201cThe right to effective assistance of counsel is ... the right of the accused to require the prosecution\u2019s case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d). With respect to the latter category of cases, the Court has clearly indicated that the attorney\u2019s failure to test the prosecution\u2019s case must be complete in order to presume prejudice. <em>Cone, </em>535 U.S. at 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843; <em>see also Haynes v. Cain, </em>298 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc) (reinforcing the notion that defense counsel must <em>entirely </em>fail to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing for the <em>Cronic </em>exception to apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Here, Carmell\u2019s attorneys completely failed to challenge the State\u2019s case during remand proceedings in the Texas Court of Appeals. Specifically, Carmell\u2019s first court-appointed attorney on remand, Whitlock, failed to discuss the case with him. And, Carmell\u2019s second court-appointed attorney, McKeathen, failed to check with Whitlock, the State\u2019s attorney, or the court in order to determine the status of the case before the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment was issued; failed to file a timely motion for leave to file a supplemental brief or for extension of time; and ultimately failed to file a brief in the Texas Court of Appeals responding to the State\u2019s arguments. Without any brief filed on his behalf, Carmell was deprived of his right to challenge the State\u2019s characterization of the trial evidence and the legal theory upon which the Texas Court of Appeals searched the record de novo for corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony. In addition, McKeathen never notified Carmell of his appointment as attorney of record, thereby leaving Carmell entirely unaware of what was occurring in the appeal process. These aggregated errors undermined the reliability of the process. And, they are of sufficient magnitude to warrant the presumption of prejudice and for us to conclude that Carmell\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on appeal (after remand) was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Therefore, we conclude that, in light of the complete lack of an adversarial testing of issues stemming from the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, the state habeas court\u2019s denial of relief on Carmell\u2019s ineffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tive assistance of counsel claim was an objectively unreasonable application of the Supreme Court\u2019s clearly established Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. <em>See Neal, </em>286 F.3d at 236 (analyzing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). As such, the district court erred in denying Carmell federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of relief based on the alleged failure of the Texas Court of Appeals to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. But, with respect to Carmell\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim on remand, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment denying habeas relief and REMAND the case to the district court for entry of judgment granting habe-as relief on Counts 7 through 10, unless the state affords Carmell an out-of-time appeal in the Texas Court of Appeals, with the assistance of counsel, within such reasonable time as the district court may fix.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The Supremacy Clause is not a source of federal rights. Instead, it operates to \"secure federal rights by according them priority whenever they come in conflict with state law.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 613, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. We note that Carmell does not make a direct challenge to the legal sufficiency of the corroborating evidence adduced at trial under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Rather, his due process claim apparently stems from a criminal defendant's guarantee under the Fourteenth Amendment that on a first appeal, as of right, the state court\u2019s actions will comport with fair procedure. <em>See Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 393, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985) (explaining that states\u2019 procedures for</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b345-14\">. <em>See also Hunter's Lessee, </em>14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) at 351-52 (\"It is an historical fact, that the [Slupreme [Cjourt of the United States have, from time to time, sustained this appellate jurisdiction [over state courts] in a great variety of cases, brought from the tribunals of many of the most important states in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>union, and that no state tribunal has ever breathed a judicial doubt on the subject, or declined to obey the mandate of the [S]u-preme [CJourt____ This weight of contemporaneous exposition by all parties, this acquiescence of enlightened state courts, and these judicial decisions of the [Sjupreme [C]ourt through so long a period, do, as we think, place the doctrine upon a foundation of authority which cannot be shaken....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">. We also note that the Supreme Court, in reaching its conclusion that the Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 decision violated the <em>Ex Post Fac-to </em>Clause, stated the Texas rule that a \"trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of [a]rticle 38.07 ... results ... in the reversal of conviction and remand for entry of an order of acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518 n. 2, 120 S.Ct. 1620. Because the sufficiency requirements of article 38.07 were not included in the jury instructions at trial and were first raised as an issue when Carmell appealed his convictions, the \"trial court\u201d did not \"fail[ ] to comply with the requirements of [a]rticle 38.07.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the improper application of the amended version of article 38.07 occurred in the Texas Court of Appeals in <em>Carmell I </em>and could be corrected on remand by applying the pre-amendment statute to the record evidence without transgressing the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. In the State's appellate brief, its argument in the district court has morphed into two more complicated legal arguments: (1) the invited error doctrine estops Carmell from claiming ineffective assistance of counsel because he terminated Whitlock's representation; and (2) Carmell waived his right to counsel by insisting upon his choice of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings. We do not address arguments raised for the first time on appeal. Instead, we will address the argument which the State made to the district court and formed the basis for the district court's finding of fact (and ensuing legal conclusion). We note, however, that the state trial court obviously did not conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Carmell waived his right to counsel based upon the letter because it simultaneously appointed McKeathen when it allowed Whitlock to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">. 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (holding that a criminal appellant may not be denied representation on appeal based on appointed counsel\u2019s bare assertion that he or she is of the opinion that there is no merit to the appeal and thus providing a prophylactic procedure under such circumstances, requiring a \u201cconscientious examination\" of the case and a \"brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\">.
