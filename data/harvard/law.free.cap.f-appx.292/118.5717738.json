Jan. 11, 2007), <em>rev\u2019g </em>No. A71-961-252 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, July 7, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented by this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b.\u201d <em>See also Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 38 (2d Cir.2008); <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). The only exception to this jurisdiction stripping provision is for \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). 11</p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">Efimova purports to make two legal arguments in challenging the BIA\u2019s decision. First, she argues that the BIA committed legal error by not articulating its standard of review. Second, she maintains that the BIA engaged in impermissible factfinding. In substance, neither argument is a question of law under section f.2Wf(D&gt;; <em>fd </em>* dlCt,\u00b0\" 40 e,,tel,tam \u201delth\u201c' \"l!Ument</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">With respect to her first argument, Efimova does not explain how the BIA can commit legal error by failing to cite its standard of review. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1 provides that \u201c[t]he Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from deeisions of immigration judges de novo.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). But neither this regulation, nor any other statute, regulation, or legal principle, requires the BIA to articulate this standard of review in rendering a decision. Indeed, we think Efimova\u2019s standard of review argument is no more than a proxy for her disagreement with the BIA\u2019s \u201cjustification for [its] diseretionary choices.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). We therefore are without juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>diction to review the claim. <em>See </em>id.; <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">With respect to her second argument, Efimova is correct that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)\u00a9 prohibits the BIA from \u201cengag[ing] in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.\u201d It provides that \u201c[f|acts determined by the immigration judge, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But Efimova has pointed to no impermissible factfinding by the BIA in her own case. She instead refers to the BIA\u2019s decision to quote portions of the record that were not emphasized by the IJ. And she characterizes the BIA\u2019s decision to balance the equities differently than the IJ did as factfinding. We disagree. We view her claim as a disagreement with the BIA\u2019s decision, based on the record evidence, to vacate the IJ\u2019s decision and deny her application for cancellation of removal. It was within the BIA\u2019s discretion to reach this conclusion and, under section 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, we lack jurisdiction to review it. See <em>Barco-Sandoval\u2019 </em>516 F.3d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayeg\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
