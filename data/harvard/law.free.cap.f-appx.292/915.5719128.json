Broome appeals a portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which affirmed the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision denying her claim for service-connection for the cause of her husband\u2019s death, and therefore her claim for dependency and indemnity compensation. <em>Broome v. Peake, </em>No. 06-1261, 2008 WL 636946 (Vet-App. Mar. 3, 2008). We <em>affirm-in-paH </em>and <em>dismiss-in-part.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">The veteran died on June 1, 2001, of intracerebral hemorrhage due to spontaneous rupture of a cerebral vessel. Prior to his death, service connection was established for degenerative arthritis and multi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>pie sebaceous cysts. He was granted total disability based on individual unemploya-bility due to his service-connected disabilities effective January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Broome\u2019s assertion of clear and unmistakable error (\u201cCUE\u201d) on the board\u2019s failure to grant claims by the veteran for 100 percent disability prior to January 1, 2000, is not ripe for review because she has yet to file such a claim with the VA regional office (\u201cRO\u201d). Each claim of CUE underlying a request for revision of a previous RO decision must be presented to and adjudicated by the RO in the first instance. Similarly, her new claim of service-connection for Agent Orange exposure first must be presented to the RO for adjudication. Because those issues were raised for the first time on appeal, we <em>affirm, </em>the Veterans Court\u2019s decision not to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Broome also claims that the board and the Veterans Court erred in concluding that the veteran\u2019s intracerebral hemorrhage was not a result of his service-connected degenerative arthritis. We see no legal error in the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusion that the veteran\u2019s service-connected disabilities were not causally connected to his death. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1310; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.312. Credibility of expert testimony is a question of fact, and it was not inappropriate for the board to weigh the expert medical opinions on record for their probative values in determining whether the veteran\u2019s cause of death was service-connected. Contrary to Broome\u2019s contention, the board was not required to consult with medical experts outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d). Indeed, it is up to the board\u2019s judgment to decide whether a case is of such medical complexity or controversy as to warrant an advisory medical opinion from one or more medical experts who are not available within the DVA. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7109; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.901(d). Even if the board concludes that such an advisory medical opinion is warranted, it has some discretion to decide whether to seek one. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7109(a) (stating that, in such a case, \u201cthe Board <em>may </em>secure an advisory medical opinion from one or more independent medical experts who are not employees of the Department\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">We have considered Broome\u2019s remaining arguments, and conclude that they each (1) challenge a factual conclusion reached by the board or the Veterans Court, and (2) fail to raise a constitutional issue. Because we lack authority to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d absent a constitutional issue, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we <em>dismiss </em>the remainder of her appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
