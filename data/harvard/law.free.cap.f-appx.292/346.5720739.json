Gutierrez argues that he is eligible for relief under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (repealed), because that statute does not require the existence of a corresponding or comparable ground of remova-bility in order to obtain discretionary relief, and the denial of relief under that section violates equal protection. He also requests remand to pursue an application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">To the extent that Gutierrez requests that he be allowed to apply for an adjustment of status through his United States citizen daughter, he has not adequately briefed this issue, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993), and we lack jurisdiction to address this claim because he did not request this relief before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies); <em>Falek v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 285, 289 (5th Cir.2007). Gutierrez\u2019s assertions that he is entitled to relief under \u00a7 1182(c) are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Cantu v. Mukasey, </em>267 Fed.Appx. 321 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
