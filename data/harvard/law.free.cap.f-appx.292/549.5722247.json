We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Where, as here, it is unclear whether the BIA conducted a <em>de novo </em>review, the court will \u201clook to the IJ\u2019s oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>See Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels the result, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Djaja has shown extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Djaja\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Djaja failed to establish he had experienced past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir. 1995). In addition, even assuming the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004) applies to withholding of removal claims, the record does not compel the conclusion that Djaja will more likely than not be persecuted upon return to Indonesia. <em>See Hox-ha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Djaja failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">In his opening brief, Djaja fails to address, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
