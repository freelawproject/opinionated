We find that such a claim is not cognizable in immigration proceedings. <em>See Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788, 798 (4th Cir.2008) (holding that retained counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance in a removal proceeding cannot deprive an alien of his Fifth Amendment right to a fundamentally fair hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-21\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-18\"> The Board analyzed Kum\u2019s motions to recal-endar and reissue as motions to reopen, and Kum does not contest this on appeal. Neither does he dispute the Board\u2019s finding that the motions were untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
