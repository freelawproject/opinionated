We review the district court\u2019s denial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007,1009 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">Goins\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence based upon a retroactive amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines relies upon Amendment 506 to the Guidelines, which was effective November 1, 1994. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 506 (Nov. 1994) (amending USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, cmt., n. 2). Because Goins was sentenced on August 28, 1996, Amendment 506 would not apply retroactively to him, as contemplated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and USSG \u00a7 1B1.10. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Goins\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">To the extent that Goins raises arguments based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), such arguments are foreclosed. The application of <em>Booker </em>is limited to cases pending on direct review or not yet final as of January 12, 2005. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2005). Because Goins\u2019s judgment was entered on September 4, 1998, <em>Booker </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">Goins\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Goins has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>previously received warning from this court that the filing of future frivolous appeals may result in sanctions. <em>See United States v. Goins, </em>95 Fed.Appx. 561 (5th Cir.2004). We again caution Goins that further frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary penalties, and restrictions on his ability to file appeals in this court and actions in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\">. We also note the district court\u2019s accurate observation that application of Amendment 506 and the Supreme Court's decision in <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997) would be precluded, because Goins was not sentenced as a Career Offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
