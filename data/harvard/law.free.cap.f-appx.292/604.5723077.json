We find that Khan waived his challenge to the timeliness of Defendants\u2019 argument based on the \u201cgist of the action\u201d doctrine when he argued the issue on the merits in his Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Rule 50 Motions. <em>See Graves v. City of Coeur D\u2019Alene, </em>339 F.3d 828, 838-39 (9th Cir.2003) (finding that parties waived their challenge to a Rule 50(b) motion where they failed to raise it until the appeal), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>542 U.S. 177, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">a. On the merits, we find that the Pennsylvania \u201cgist of the action\u201d doctrine bars Khan\u2019s conversion claim against Shamrock. \u201c[A] claim should be limited to a contract claim when the parties\u2019 obligations are defined by the terms of the contracts, and not by the larger social policies embodied by the law of torts.\u201d <em>Hart v. Arnold, </em>884 A.2d 316, 339-40 (Pa.Super.Ct.2005). Here, Shamrock\u2019s obligation to transfer the warrants was derived from, and defined by, the clearing agreement. <em>Bernhardt v. Needleman, 70S </em>A.2d 875, 876 (Pa.Super.Ct.1997), is inap-posite because it relies on the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, which are not applicable in this case. Thus the \u201cgist of the action\u201d doctrine bars the conversion claim against Shamrock.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">b. The \u201cgist of the action\u201d doctrine also bars Khan\u2019s conversion claim against Kelly. \u201cAs the Pennsylvania courts have spelled out, the gist of the action doctrine bars tort claims against an individual [officer] where the contract between the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tiff and the officer\u2019s company created duties that the individual allegedly breached.\u201d <em>Williams v. Hilton Group PLC, </em>93 Fed.Appx. 384, 387 (3d Cir.2004); <em>see also eToll, Inc. v. Elias/Savion Adver., Inc., </em>811 A.2d 10, 20-21 (Pa.Super.Ct.2002) (finding that tort claims were barred against <em>both </em>an advertising agency <em>and </em>its officers, even though only the agency signed the contract). We decline to apply the rule established by <em>Levert v. Philadelphia International Records, </em>No. 04-1489, 2005 WL 2271862 at *3 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 16, 2005) because it is not supported by Pennsylvania authority. Thus we reverse the award of damages for conversion and we remand for a re-election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">2. We reject Defendants\u2019 challenge to the jury instructions. The district court determined that Khan established a prima facie case for breach, but that Shamrock would not be liable if a jury determined that Khan materially breached the Clearing Agreement first. This holding comports with \u201c[t]he general rule [] that a party who has materially breached a contract may not complain if the other party refuses to perform his obligations under the contract.\u201d <em>Ott v. Buehler Lumber Co., </em>373 Pa.Super. 515, 541 A.2d 1143, 1145 (1988). The court did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury that \u201cMr. Khan is entitled to damages for Shamrock Partner\u2019s breach of the contract, related to the Modacad warrants, subject to Shamrock Partners\u2019 defenses if any.\u201d Further, the jury needed to be told that liability had been determined for it to calculate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">3. We affirm the district court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings excluding evidence regarding Defendants\u2019 state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">a. We decline to consider the exclusion of the testimony of Modacad\u2019s attorney and Kelly regarding Modacad\u2019s willingness to issue the warrants because Defendants failed to raise them argument at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">b. The district court acted within its discretion when it excluded Kelly\u2019s testimony that he believed the Closing Agreement obligated Khan to pay exercise costs. Defendants were not prejudiced by the ruling because Kelly\u2019s prior inconsistent statements undermined the probative value of the testimony. <em>See Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>447 F.3d 769, 782 (9th Cir.2006) (we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, and prejudice must be shown to warrant reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">c. The district court acted within its discretion when it excluded Khan\u2019s Consent to the Entry of Final Judgment in <em>SEC v. Khan </em>because the risk that the jury would consider the evidence for the wrong purpose considerably outweighed its limited probative value. Additionally, Defendants were not prejudiced by this ruling because the district court allowed testimony regarding the existence of the Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief Against Khan into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">d. The district court also acted within its discretion when it excluded the factual findings from the SEC\u2019s Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Order Against Defendants. The fact that Khan was not a party to the proceeding and had no opportunity to participate, while not conclusive under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C), suggests that the evidence might be less trustworthy and therefore less probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">4. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to impose alter ego liability. The jury\u2019s factual findings weigh against piercing the corporate veil. <em>See Lumax Indus., Inc. v. Aultman, </em>543 Pa. 38, 669 A.2d 893, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>895 (1995) (listing factors to be considered in piercing the corporate veil). We distinguish this case from <em>Ashley v. Ashley, </em>482 Pa. 228, 893 A.2d 637, 641 (1978), because <em>Ashley </em>involved: (1) securities purchased with corporate assets issued to the defendant personally, (2) the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was \u201cone and the same\u201d as the corporation, and (3) the defendant\u2019s purchase of his house with corporate funds. In the absence of such extreme facts, we find that the district judge did not err when it declined to pierce the corporate veil.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">5. We decline to reach whether damages for unjust enrichment may be awarded in addition to damages for conversion, because we find that the \u201cgist of the action\u201d doctrine bars recovery for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">6. Finally, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by staying judgment enforcement proceedings after Defendants filed a supersedeas bond. Although, \u201ca pre-bond levy is not automatically extinguished by operation of law upon the Court\u2019s approval of a Rule 62(d) supersedeas bond,\u201d the Central District of California has suggested that a court may \u201cinvoke its general equitable authority\u201d to stay the enforcement of pending levies. <em>Ribbens Int\u2019l, SA. de C.V. v. Transport Int'l Pool, Inc., </em>40 F.Supp.2d 1141, 1145-46 (C.D.Cal.1999); <em>see also Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, </em>463 U.S. 1323, 1324, 104 S.Ct. 7, 77 L.Ed.2d 1426 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that a court retains the power to grant injunctive relief to a party to preserve the status quo during the pendency of an appeal----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART with REMAND for a re-election of remedies.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
