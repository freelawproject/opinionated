Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See In re: GebreSelassie </em>(B.I.A. Oct. 23, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-18\"> Because we agree that Gebre-Selassie\u2019s motion to reopen is untimely, we decline to address the Board's alternate finding that the motion would be denied on its merits. To the extent, however, that Gebre-Selassie argues that his attorney's ineffective assistance prevented him from timely filing his motion to reopen and requests equitable tolling on this ground, we note that the Board did grant him the benefit of equitable tolling. Moreover, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is foreclosed by our recent holding in <em>Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788, 796-99 (4th Cir.2008) (holding that there is no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
