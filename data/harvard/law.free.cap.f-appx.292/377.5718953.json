Meh-mood contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s June 8, 2006 denial of his request for a continuance pending the adjudication of his application for labor certification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both the IJ and the BIA deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mined that Mehmood\u2019s pending application for labor certification did not constitute good cause to continue the removal proceedings. This determination was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>this Circuit held that an IJ\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance pending the adjudication of an alien\u2019s application for labor certification was not an abuse of discretion. 447 F.3d 433, 439 (5th Cir.2006). Pursuant to the LIFE Act, a removable alien is permitted to apply for an adjustment of status if, among other things, the alien is the beneficiary of an application for labor certification properly filed on or before April 30, 2001. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(ii). The Attorney General <em>may </em>adjust an alien\u2019s status after he receives a labor certification if: \u201c(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1255(i)(2). Thus, filing of an application for labor certification does not vest the alien with any right to relief from removal, but is merely the first step in the \u201clong and discretionary process\u201d of obtaining an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Mehmood attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Ahmed </em>by conelusorily asserting that his labor certification was approved and he filed an 1-140 visa application on September 11, 2007. These supposed events, however, allegedly occurred <em>after </em>the BIA issued its August 27, 2007 decision and may not be considered for the first time on appeal, as \u201cour review is limited to the administrative record,\u201d <em>Mirandas-Lores v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994)., and nothing in the administrative record here even hints at any of these supposed events. In any event, this circuit stated in <em>Ahmed </em>that even had the alien\u2019s application for labor certification been approved at the time of the hearing, the alien would have been no less removable. 447 F.3d at 438 &amp; 438 n. 3 (stating that only after the approval of the alien\u2019s 1-140 visa application \u201cwould he have been eligible for the discretionary removal relief contemplated by 1255(i)\u201d). At the time of Mehmood\u2019s removal hearing, an immigrant visa was not available to him; therefore, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Mehmood\u2019s wholly unsupported and eon-clusory contention that the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for a continuance violated equal protection principles because \u201cthe BIA and other courts have allowed continuances based on family based petitions\u201d is deemed waived as inadequately briefed. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Accordingly, Mehmood\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-25\">. The IJ had previously granted nine continuances, the first of which had been granted June 29, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
