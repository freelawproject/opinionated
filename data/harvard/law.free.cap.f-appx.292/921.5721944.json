Hildebrand appeals orders of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado denying his motion for relief from judgment and his application for attorney fees and costs. <em>See Hildebrand v. Steck Mfg. Co., </em>No. 02-CV-01125-LTB, 2007 WL 2350151, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61508 (D.Colo. Aug.15, 2007); <em>Hildebrand v. Steck Mfg. Co., </em>No. 02-CV-01125-LTB, 2007 WL 2332189, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58949 (D.Colo. Aug.10, 2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">On October 28, 2005, a jury found that Hildebrand\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 5,737,981 had been infringed by products manufactured by Steck Manufacturing Company, Inc., Cornwell Quality Tools Company, Mateo Tools, Snap-On Tools Company, Tools USA and Equipment Company, and Mac Tools (collectively \u201cSteck\u201d). The jury determined that Steck\u2019s infringement was not willful and awarded Hildebrand $74,863 in lost profit damages. The court entered judgment on the jury verdict on November 4, 2005, and ordered that the parties proceed according to District of Colorado Local Rule 54.1 regarding the taxation of costs and that Hildebrand submit, within 30 days, an application for attorney fees pursuant to District of Colorado Local Rule 54.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">In December 2005, Hildebrand and Steck cross-appealed to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirmed, holding that the jury\u2019s finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>non-willful infringement was supported by substantial evidence and that the damages award was adequate to compensate Hildebrand for any harm caused by the infringement. <em>See Hildebrand v. Steck Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>232 Fed.Appx. 985 (Fed.Cir.2007) (hereinafter <em>\u201cHildebrand, II </em>\u201d). Subsequently, the district court issued orders that denied Hildebrand\u2019s motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and his application for attorney fees and costs. Hildebrand then sought reconsideration of these orders, but his request for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Hildebrand timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Because the issue of whether to award costs to a prevailing party is a procedural matter not unique to patent law, we apply the law of the appropriate regional circuit. <em>Kohus v. Cosco, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed.Cfr.2002). In the Tenth Circuit, an order denying costs is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Munoz v. St. Mary-Corwin Hasp., </em>221 F.3d 1160, 1170 (10th Cir.2000); <em>Klein v. Grynberg, </em>44 F.3d 1497, 1506 (10th Cfr.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hildebrand his costs. The court\u2019s November 4, 2005 judgment clearly and unambiguously specified that to recover costs Hildebrand had to comply with District of Colorado Local Rule 54.1. That rule requires the party seeking costs to file a bill of costs within ten days after the entry of judgment or final order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since Hildebrand filed his application for costs more than a month after the entry of judgment in his favor, the district court properly concluded that his application was untimely. <em>See Woods Const. Co. v. Atlas Chem. Indus., Inc., </em>337 F.2d 888, 891 (10th Cfr.1964) (\u201cA case cannot remain open for indeterminate or unspecified periods awaiting a party\u2019s action to request the assessment of costs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">On appeal, Hildebrand argues that the district court extended the filing deadline for his bill of costs. Specifically, he points to an October 26, 2005 statement from District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson informing Hildebrand that if he prevailed, he would be given \u201c30 days to file [his] Bill of Costs with the clerk of court.\u201d Even accepting that Hildebrand was given 30 days to file for costs, however, his December 5, 2005 application still would have been untimely since it was filed more than 30 days after the October 28, 2005 jury verdict in his favor. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Hildebrand\u2019s application for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Nor did the district court err in determining that Hildebrand was not entitled to an award of attorney fees. <em>See Digeo, Inc. v. Audible, Inc., </em>505 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cfr.2007) (Whether a case is exceptional for purposes of awarding attorney fees is \u201ca factual determination reviewed for clear error.\u201d). A district court has authority to award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing party in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. \u201cExceptional cases usually feature some material, inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation, such as willful infringement, fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified litigation, conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>that violates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or like infractions.\u201d <em>Serio-US Indus., Inc. v. Plastic Recovery Techs. Corp., </em>459 F.3d 1811, 1321-22 (Fed.Cir. 2006). Here, the jury found that that Steck\u2019s infringement was not willful, and this finding was affirmed on appeal. <em>See Hildebrand II, </em>232 Fed.Appx. at 986. While Hildebrand vigorously asserts that Steck engaged in litigation misconduct, he fails to establish clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary. Without a doubt, the lengthy dispute between Steck and Hildebrand has been strident, resulting in significant costs to both sides. After reviewing the record, however, we see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Steek\u2019s claims and defenses were not frivolous and that the award of attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 was therefore unwarranted. The fact that Steck ultimately decided not to pursue some of the counterclaims it originally asserted does not establish that those counterclaims were baseless or that Steck asserted them in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Hildebrand argues that the fact that this court, in 2002, rejected Steck\u2019s contentions that the district court in Ohio had authority to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute, <em>see Hildebrand I, </em>279 F.3d at 1355-56, establishes that Steck\u2019s arguments regarding jurisdiction were \u201cfrivolous and vexatious as a matter of law.\u201d We disagree. Although this court ultimately concluded that the Ohio district court was without authority to exercise jurisdiction, Steck\u2019s arguments in support of jurisdiction had a reasonable basis and there is nothing to indicate that they were asserted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Finally, we turn to the district court\u2019s order denying Hildebrand\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. Motions seeking relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(3) must \u201cbe made within a reasonable time,\u201d but never \u201cmore than a year after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Tool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., </em>419 F.3d 1084, 1088-89 (10th Cir.2005). Hildebrand has not established that it was reasonable for him to wait until November 6, 2006 to file his motion or that circumstances beyond his control prevented him from filing at an earlier time. <em>Cummings v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>365 F.3d 944, 954 (10th Cir.2004) (noting that Rule 60(b) motions must be filed within a reasonable time, and not merely within one year of entry of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Furthermore, Hildebrand fails to appreciate that a motion seeking relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) is \u201cclearly not a substitute for appeal\u201d and must involve \u201cmatters outside the issues raised and considered by the court in reaching its judgment.\u201d <em>Brown v. McCormick, </em>608 F.2d 410, 413 (10th Cir.1979). While Hildebrand alleges that Steck engaged in fraud before the United States Patent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Trademark Office and the district court, and that its brief before this court contains \u201clies,\u201d he fails to produce the clear and convincing evidence necessary to substantiate his allegations. <em>See Zurich N. Am. v. Matrix Serv., Inc., </em>426 F.3d 1281, 1290 (10th Cir.2005) (A party seeking to rely on Rule 60(b)(3) must produce clear and convincing proof of fraud.). Moreover, although Hildebrand points to what he believes are deficiencies in the jury verdict, Rule 60(b) is not designed to allow a litigant to rehash arguments which have previously been considered and rejected. <em>See Van Skiver v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir.1991) (\u201c[Rjevisiting the issues already addressed is not the purpose of a motion to reconsider.\u201d (quotations and citations omitted)). \u201cRelief under Rule 60(b) is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Bud Brooks Trucking, Inc. v. Bill Hodges Trucking Co., </em>909 F.2d 1437, 1440 (10th Cir.1990). No such exceptional circumstances are present here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-13\">. This was the second occasion that Hildebrand and Steck had come before this court. When the parties were here the first time, the issue was whether the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio had jurisdiction over the dispute. <em>See Hildebrand v. Steck Mfg. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir. 2002) (hereinafter <em>\"Hildebrand I\"). </em>We concluded that the Ohio district court had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>jurisdiction to decide the case because Hildebrand was not an Ohio resident and his contacts with Ohio did \"not create a constitutionally adequate basis for personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-9\">.
