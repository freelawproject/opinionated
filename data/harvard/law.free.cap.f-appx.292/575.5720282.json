Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturrabarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 06-72371, and we deny the petition for review in 07-70639.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review Castellanos-Avalos\u2019 unexhausted contentions that the IJ erred in determining his convictions for possession of stolen property and reckless endangerment were crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Castellanos-Avalos has not supported his contentions that his removal proceedings violated equal protection, that he was not afforded an opportunity to show rehabilitation, and that his removal would result in cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Castellanos-Avalos\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely, because the motion was filed more than eight months after the BIA\u2019s April 12, 2006 final order. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA properly determined that equitable tolling was not warranted because Castellanos-Avalos failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance was prejudicial. See <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We deny Castellanos-Avalos\u2019 Motion for Judicial Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">No. 06-72371: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">No. 07-70639: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
