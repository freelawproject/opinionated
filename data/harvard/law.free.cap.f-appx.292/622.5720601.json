Aguilar contends that the district court improperly instructed the jury and mishandled questions from the jury. He also challenges a series of the district court\u2019s discovery and evidentiary rulings, including the admission of evidence of his prior convictions. Finally, Aguilar appeals his sentence as unreasonable and improper given the circumstances of his case. We affirm the district court\u2019s jury instructions and affirm in part the district court\u2019s discovery and evidentiary rulings. However, we reverse the district court\u2019s admission of evidence of Aguilar\u2019s prior convictions and therefore vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial. Accordingly, we do not review the district court\u2019s handling of the jury questions or Aguilar\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Alviso, </em>152 F.3d 1195, 1198 (9th Cir.1998), and review allegations of <em>Brady </em>violations <em>de novo. United States v. Holler, </em>411 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir.2005). <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">1. The district court did not improperly refuse to instruct the jury on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 as a lesser-included offense of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Section 1325 requires elements that \u00a7 1326 does not and so is not a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 1326. Therefore, Aguilar was not entitled to the instruction. <em>See United States v. Flores-Peraza, </em>58 F.3d 164, 166-68 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">2. The district court adequately instructed the jury even though it failed to define \u201cremoval.\u201d Although the \u00a7 1326 element of \u201cremoval\u201d includes physical removal, <em>see United States v. Bahena-Carde-nas, </em>411 F.3d 1067, 1074 (9th Cir.2005), Aguilar never argued that he was ordered deported but did not physically leave. As the issue was not fairly presented by the evidence, there was no reason to instruct the jury on it. <em>See United States v. Wilcox, </em>919 F.2d 109, 113 (9th Cir.1990). <em>Discovery and Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">1. The district court did not violate Aguilar\u2019s rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it denied discovery pertaining to the government\u2019s maintenance and use of immigration records. To prevail on a <em>Brady </em>claim, Aguilar must show that the information sought was sufficiently material to his defense such that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Mere speculation as to the materiality of the immigration records is insufficient. <em>See Barker v. Fleming, </em>423 F.3d 1085, 1099 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Here, Aguilar has not offered more than mere speculation that withheld information about the immigration records would have resulted in a different verdict, particularly given his ability to inquire into the record-keeping procedures on cross-examination. Accordingly, we deny this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">2. The district court\u2019s certification of the government\u2019s witness as an expert in fingerprint analysis and the admission of fingerprint evidence were not improper. The district court properly found the government\u2019s expert sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert in fingerprint analysis. Moreover, we have recently stated that \u201cthe reliability and admissibility of [inked fingerprints] is long-established,\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon-Segura, </em>512 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2008), and find no reason to deviate from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">3. The admission of Aguilar\u2019s Alien-Registration Files (\u201cA-Files\u201d) under the public records hearsay exception was not an abuse of discretion. That there were multiple A-Files does not necessarily indicate that the files lacked indicia of trustworthiness, as Aguilar\u2019s use of multiple aliases explains the multiplicity. Although it is questionable whether the A-File relating to the 1998 removal correctly identified Aguilar, any error by the district court in admitting it was harmless, as the jury did not find that Aguilar was the alien named in that A-File.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Aguilar also urges the court to overrule <em>United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, </em>411 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir.2005), and hold that admission of immigration records violates the Confrontation Clause under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). As we are bound by <em>Bahena-Cardenas, </em>we hold that immigration records are not \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and are thus admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">4. The district court did not err by precluding Aguilar from presenting evidence about a shredding incident at an INS facility. The incident was only slightly relevant to Aguilar\u2019s case, and he had ample opportunity to present other evidence challenging the government\u2019s record-keeping practices. The district court\u2019s ruling that the risk of confusing the jury outweighed the minimal probative value of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sua, </em>307 F.3d 1150, 1153 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">5. The district court improperly admitted evidence of Aguilar\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The parties agreed before trial that the convictions would not be presented to the jury. Only after Aguilar challenged the government\u2019s INS files, arguing that they were not his files, did the government seek, and the district court allow, admission of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">The probative value of the conviction documents was minimal. They linked, by alias and fingerprint identification, the convictions to specific INS files and the deportation orders therein. But the deportation orders still had to be linked back to Aguilar. Thus, the conviction documents provided only slight reinforcement of the evidence linking Aguilar to the INS files. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the other hand, they were highly prejudicial. <em>See Thompson v. Borg, </em>74 F.3d 1571, 1579 (9th Cir.1996) (Reinhardt, J., dissenting) (\u201cWe have consistently held that information regarding a defendant\u2019s prior convictions is <em>highly prejudicial.\u201d) </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The district court allowed the convictions into evidence on the ground that Aguilar had opened the door to such evidence by arguing that the INS files were not his. However, a defendant does not open the door to otherwise-inadmissible evidence simply by proffering a theory of the case that could be rebutted by such evidence. <em>See United States v. Sine, </em>493 F.3d 1021, 1037-38 (9th Cir.2007). It thus was an abuse of discretion to admit the prior convictions under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Although the admission of the prior convictions may well have been harmless, the government did not so argue on appeal. It has thus waived the argument. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d 1093, 1100 (9th Cir.2005). This is not one of the exceptional eases in which \u201cthe harmlessness of the error is not reasonably debatable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1101; <em>see also United States v. Jimenez-Ortega, </em>472 F.3d 1102, 1104 n. 2 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We therefore vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">REVERSED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b647-8\">HUG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">I agree with the majority on all aspects except for those reasons set forth in section 5. The majority mentions an agreement of the parties that the convictions would not be presented to the jury. That agreement was in the prior trial that was dismissed as a mistrial. In that trial, the parties had discussed the possible admission of the convictions for the impeachment of Aguilar\u2019s testimony under Fed. R.Evid. 609. The parties agreed to a court ruling that the convictions would not be admitted unless Aguilar testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">In this case, the convictions were not admitted for impeachment under Rule 609, but for their relevance under Fed.R.Evid. 404 to show that Aguilar was the alien who had been deported. When his attorney attacked the accuracy and validity of the INS files and records, the court, after several warnings that this continued attack could open the door to admission of the convictions for this purpose, did admit the convictions. Nothing in the record of this case shows the parties had entered a general agreement not to present the convictions to the jury, nor was such an argument made in the appellant\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">The majority incorrectly concludes that the probative value of the conviction record documents was minimal. The conviction records \u201clinked, by alias and fingerprint identification, the convictions to specific INS files and deportation orders therein.\u201d <em>See infra </em>Section 5. The conviction records contained Aguilar\u2019s fingerprints and other identifying characteristics, as did the deportation orders. With these characteristics, the conviction records were important to establish that Aguilar was the person deported. The value of this connection was central to establishing Aguilar as the person deported. Therefore, the probative value of these records was very substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">Additionally, the majority incorrectly concludes the district court abused its discretion in admitting the prior convictions because Aguilar did not sufficiently open the door to allow the prior convictions. The government proffered the prior convictions to rebut Aguilar\u2019s contention that he was not the person deported in the deportation orders. The majority mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>mizes Aguilar\u2019s contention of mistaken identity as a \u201cproffered theory\u201d of his case. However, this characterization misstates the actual nature of Aguilar\u2019s argument. Aguilar claimed that he was neither the person deported nor the person in the deportation documents as a matter of fact, not theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The majority i\u2019elies upon <em>United States v. Sine, </em>493 F.3d 1021, 1037-38 (9th Cir. 2007). As opposed to the situation in <em>Sine </em>where the defendant only made \u201cpassing reference\u201d to an argument that the government claimed opened the door to questioning about otherwise inadmissible evidence, <em>id. </em>at 1037, Aguilar repeatedly referred to the alleged mistaken identity in the deportation orders. Aguilar did more than \u201cproffer a theory\u201d of his case; his identity in the deportation records was central to his defense. He continually attacked the validity of the records, contending that he was not the person in the deportation orders. This continual attack on the validity of the deportation records and Aguilar\u2019s identity as the person deported, after warnings by the court, led to the judge\u2019s order that Aguilar had opened the door to admission of the conviction records. Thus, the district court properly admitted the conviction records to rebut his arguments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
