She asserts the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen as she proffered sufficient evidence of changed country conditions in China, specifically, more aggressive enforcement in Fujian Province of China\u2019s \u201cone-child\u201d policy. In particular, she contends she has submitted similar evidence as that in <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007), which held the BIA abused its discretion in denying a motion to reopen as the petitioner had established changed country conditions in the form of more aggressive enforcement of China\u2019s family planning law. In addition, she contends she is permitted to file a successive asylum application based on changed personal circumstances under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Further, she asserts she may file a motion to reopen at any time pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), as she did not receive proper notice of her original hearing. Finally, she contends even if her request for asylum is untimely she is still entitled to a hearing on her claims of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Rjeview is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day time limit does not apply if the motion to reopen is filed on the basis of changed circumstances in the country of the movant\u2019s nationality. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) (C) (ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must show material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the BIA \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We have held that: \u201c[a]t a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which [the BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001). Forced abortions and sterilizations are considered persecution, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">A person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">We addressed a case with a similar factual background in <em>Li, </em>488 F.3d 1371. Li was a native of Lianjiang, Fujian Province, China, who came to the United States without valid entry documents but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>found to have a credible fear of torture or persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1372. Li missed her hearing date and was found removable. <em>Id. </em>Li filed a motion to reopen in 2006 based on changed conditions, offering evidence that officials in Fujian Province had intensified them persecution of parents with two children. <em>Id. </em>at 1372-73. The evidence included Li\u2019s affidavit of secondhand accounts of forced sterilization and abortion, her mother\u2019s affidavit, the 2003, 2004, and 2005 Country Reports, 2002 congressional testimony from John Aird \u2014 a specialist on China\u2019s population policy, newspaper articles, a 2005 Consular Information Sheet, and evidence that she was the mother of children born in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1373. We vacated the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen stating \u201c[t]he issue before the Board was whether Li\u2019s evidence was material and previously unavailable evidence of changed conditions in China. Li\u2019s evidence of a recent campaign of forced sterilization in her home village ... clearly satisfied the criteria for a motion to reopen her removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375 (citation omitted). We also rejected the BIA\u2019s distinction between foreign-born and Chinese-born children. <em>Id. </em>at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">While there are some minor differences between Yuan\u2019s ease and <em>Li, </em>the underlying factual background and evidence cited are very similar. Yuan has presented evidence of a recent campaign of forced sterilization in her home village in China. Both Yuan and Li are from Lianjiang County, Fujian Province. Yuan, like Li, provided an affidavit of secondhand accounts of forced sterilizations and more aggressive enforcement of China\u2019s family planning law during the same time period. Yuan\u2019s affidavit stated she has been told by her family that village cadres had recently held a number of meetings to discuss China\u2019s 2002 Family Planning Law and the many pregnant women in her hometown were being taken away to undergo abortions and forced sterilizations. She also gave examples of two women who were recently forcibly sterilized after giving birth to a second child. The BIA did not find Yuan\u2019s testimony regarding more aggressive enforcement incredible, and did not specifically address her affidavit. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen,., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Contrary to the Government\u2019s claim, Yuan also cited the 2005 Country Report discussed in <em>Li, </em>which referenced a recently discovered program of forced sterilization of thousands of women in another province.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Yuan also proffered evidence that foreign-born children are treated the same as those born in China, including the Consular Information Sheet similar to the one cited in <em>Li </em>that states China considers the foreign born children of Chinese nationals solely as Chinese citizens. She also provided evidence, in Aird\u2019s affidavit, of a 2003 official correspondence from Fujian provincial family planning officials stating that Chinese nationals whose children were born abroad will be subject to family planning enforcement upon return. The BIA did not address the reference to this correspondence directly,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which seems to contradict, along with her affidavit, the BIA\u2019s finding that \u201c[Yuan] has not demonstrated that she will be sterilized or otherwise subjected to coercive population control measures due to the birth of her United States citizen children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Most of the cases relied upon by the BIA are not persuasive because they predate <em>Li. </em>In its opinion, the BIA rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the documents cited by Yuan stating it had addressed the same evidence in four previous BIA decisions in which it held this evidence did not show a material change in conditions in China. However, a review of the decisions cited indicates three of the four decisions were issued before <em>Li </em>where this Court found much of the evidence discussed to be material. In addition, some of these decisions rely on documents not included in the record in this case, including the 2006 and 2007 Country Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The Government\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Li </em>is unpersuasive. The Government asserts the present case can be distinguished from <em>Li </em>citing the lack of firsthand testimony, that she did not submit the 2005 Country Report, that Yuan\u2019s statements at her original detention are similar those made in her motion to reopen, and that there are indications in the evidence that China\u2019s policy has not changed. First, the Government is correct that Yuan did not submit any firsthand accounts as evidence. However, Yuan describes information given to her by her family in her own affidavit, and it appears the firsthand account submitted in <em>Li </em>was only one piece of evidence considered by this Court and was not dispos-itive, in and of itself. <em>See Li, </em>488 F.3d at 1373. Second, while the 2005 Country Report is not included in the record, Yuan does cite to relevant portions of the report in her brief to the BIA on remand, which the Government did not challenge as inaccurate. Also, Yuan\u2019s original motion to reopen with the BIA predates the 2005 Report. Third, Yuan testified in 2000 she was forced to get an abortion because she was unmarried. In 2005, she stated officials had become more aggressive in forcing sterilization of women who had given birth to more than one child. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, it does not necessarily follow that this testimony shows no change in enforcement, as Yuan\u2019s testimony in 2000 related to forced abortions for unmarried women, while her more recent statements address forced sterilization of married women with more than one child. Finally, the Government argues statements in Aird\u2019s affidavit undermine the argument the policy has changed as he stated \u201cthe basic policy has remained largely unchanged.\u201d Reading Aird\u2019s testimony in context, he is referring to China\u2019s one-child policy and is not discussing the level of enforcement of that policy, the alleged changed conditions in this case. In fact, in the preceding sentences, Aird indicated the enforcement of China\u2019s family planning program has changed over time stating \u201c[a]t times high pressure campaigns mounted to implement this program have backfired, evoking such strong popular resentment that the authorities have had to ease the pressures temporarily. But in each instance when the softer approach led to rising birth rates, the pressure was resumed. Three cycles of relaxing and tightening have occurred since the late 1970\u2019s.\u201d Thus, the testimony cited by the Government arguably supports the contention that enforcement of China\u2019s family planning law can vary.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Lastly, Yuan\u2019s challenge to the distinction the BIA allegedly made between foreign-born children and those born in China with regard to the enforcement of family planning laws is unpersuasive. Unlike in <em>Li, </em>it does not appear the BIA found Yuan would be treated differently because her children were born in the United States, but instead found the birth of her children in the United States, in and of itself, did not constitute changed country conditions but changed personal conditions. There does not appear to be any language in <em>Li </em>that would indicate the BIA erred in making this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">While there are some minor differences between Yuan\u2019s case and <em>Li, </em>the underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ing factual background and evidence cited are very similar. Thus, Yuan has presented material information that was previously unavailable of changed conditions in her home village regarding an increase in forced sterilization for women with two children and a prima <em>facie </em>case that she would be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. As such, the BIA abused its discretion in denying Yuan\u2019s motion to reopen, especially considering the BIA never mentioned <em>Li, </em>much less applied it, even though it was issued five months before the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We grant the petition and vacate the order denying Yuan\u2019s motion to reopen and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">PETITION GRANTED. ORDER VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\">. In generally rejecting the evidence proffered by Yuan, the BIA cited a case which found this document had a limited application. <em>See In Re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 254-55 (BIA 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-15\">. Because we have vacated the BIA's denial of Yuan\u2019s motion to reopen, we need not address Yuan\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
