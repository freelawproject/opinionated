Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The agency properly held that Alonso is not eligible for adjustment of status because her prior expedited removal order was reinstated after she reentered the United States without permission. <em>See Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 925 (9th Cir.2003) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5) bars an alien who has had a removal order reinstated from adjustment of status). Alon-so\u2019s reliance on <em>Perez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 783, 788 (9th Cir.2004), is unavailing because she sought permission to reapply for admission after her prior expedited removal order had been reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review Alonso\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of her request for voluntary departure because she failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ed by 9 th Cir.
