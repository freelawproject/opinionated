We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider, and review de novo due process claims. <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the two motions because Reynoso Cisneros failed to establish prejudice. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (alien must demonstrate prejudice from counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance to establish due process violation). The only additional evidence Reynoso Cisneros provided of his continuous physical presence from 1987 to 1992 is his brother\u2019s declaration, yet the declaration is internally inconsistent regarding when his brother lived in Marysville. The new evidence is therefore insufficient to establish that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmay have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 899-900 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because Reynoso Cisneros did not establish prejudice regarding continuous physical presence, it was unnecessary for the BIA to address his new hardship evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
