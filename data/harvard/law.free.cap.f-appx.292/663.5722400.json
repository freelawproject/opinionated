We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cii'.2006), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">We reject Martinez-Memije\u2019s contentions that the agency erred and violated due process in deciding that his 1998 felony conviction under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351 is an aggravated felony. <em>See Rendon v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 967, 976 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell contains a trafficking element and is an aggravated felony.\u201d). Martinez-Memije\u2019s plea agreement establishes that he pled guilty because he \u201cwillfully [and] unlawfully possessed tar heroin [in] a sufficient quantity for sale.\u201d <em>See Parrilla v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2005) (a written plea agreement is a judicially noticeable document under the modified categorical approach described in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">We also reject Martinez-Memije\u2019s contention that his conviction does not bar him from establishing good moral character for purposes of suspension of deportation and voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(8) (\u201cNo person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who, during the period for which good moral character is required to be established, is ... one who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony[.]\u201d); <em>Castiglia v. INS, </em>108 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir.1997) (section 1101(f)(8) \u201cevidences [congressional] intent that aggravated-felony convictions be an absolute bar to a finding of good moral character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Martinez-Memije\u2019s conviction under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
