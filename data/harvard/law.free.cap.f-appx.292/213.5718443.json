The presentence report calculated Moss\u2019s offense level as 31 and his criminal history category as VI, yielding a sentencing guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. At sentencing, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey noted that several factors militated in favor of \u201ca serious sentence.\u201d Nonetheless, because Moss had accepted responsibility for his conduct, cooperated during his presen-tence report, and was candid with the court, the District Court granted a downward variance of one offense level. This variance resulted in a new sentencing guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. The Court sentenced Moss to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-24\">Moss, proceeding pro se, filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel concluded that there were no non-frivolous issues to appeal and filed a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that the \u201cconstitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process\u201d necessitates that appellant\u2019s counsel vigorously act as an advocate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1896. In <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001), we reiterated that an <em>Anders </em>brief must demonstrate that counsel has \u201cthoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d and it must \u201cexplain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Defense counsel has set forth, with citations to the record, the facts and procedural history of the case. Counsel explained that he considered whether Moss could challenge the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, but concluded that any argument in that regard was frivolous in light of the downward variance which was granted and the below guideline sentence that was imposed. We agree with counsel that it would be frivolous to challenge the reasonableness of the 168 month sentence, particularly in light of the appellate waiver contained in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We conclude that defense counsel has fulfilled his obligation of thoroughly examining the record in search of appealable issues and explained why any such issue lacks merit. Because our own independent review fails to reveal any nonfrivolous issues, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. We further certify that the issues presented in this appeal lack legal merit and thus do not require the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. 3d Cir. L.A.R 109.2(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-18\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>United States v.
