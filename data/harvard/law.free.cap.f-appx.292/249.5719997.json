Justin Benjamin Haste, Jr., was previously convicted and sentenced to 180 months in prison after pleading guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (2000). Although Haste conceded he had two predicate offenses for armed career criminal status under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000), he asserted before the district court and this court that a third conviction for felonious possession of a weapon of mass destruction under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-288.8 (2005) should not have been considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. We disagreed and affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Haste, </em>234 Fed.Appx. 70 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). Having carefully reviewed the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we conclude that a violation of N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-288.8 is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Accordingly, we vacate Haste\u2019s sentence and remand this matter to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
