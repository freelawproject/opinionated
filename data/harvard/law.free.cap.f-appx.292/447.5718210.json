This argument lacks merit, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">On May 25, 2000, the district court sentenced defendant Tyrann Metcalf to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, for distribution of crack cocaine. Defendant was released from custody and began his term of supervised release in August 2005. After he failed to gain steady employment and tested positive for narcotics, the district court modified the terms of his supervised release on July 25, 2006, and ordered him to serve a period of 180 days in the Residential Reentry Center. After additional positive drug tests and termination from the Residential Reentry Center program, the Probation Department filed a petition to revoke defendant\u2019s supervised release. \u25a0 The petition alleged the following violations: (1) failure to reside in the Residential Reentry Center; (2) failure to participate in a program for substance abuse; (3) failure to refrain from drug use; and (4) failure to answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer. Defendant was arrested, and the district court ordered him detained pending a supervised release violation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">On April 26, 2007, the district court held a supervised release violation hearing, at which defendant was present with counsel. At the lengthy hearing, defendant denied the first violation, but admitted the remaining three. The district court found defendant guilty of the first violation. The district court determined, without objection, that defendant committed a Grade B violation and had a criminal history category of V. Based on this determination, the district court concluded, and defense counsel agreed, that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement indicated a range of 18-24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defense counsel asked the district court to sentence defendant to work release, house arrest with work release, or to give credit for the six months he had served at the Residential Reentry Center. Rejecting the argument that a downward variance was warranted, the district court sentenced defendant to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in sentencing defendant to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for violating the conditions of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-19\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b470-20\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release in the same way we review all other sentences after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Book</em>er\u2014\u201cunder a deferential abuse of discretion standard for reasonableness.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>ed States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 575 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). This standard of review has two components: procedural and substantive. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 586; <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"AVj\">B. Procedural Unreasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Review for procedural reasonableness consists of three steps. First, a district court must \u201ccorrectly calculate] the applicable Guidelines range,\u201d which is the \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark\u201d of its sentencing analysis. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596; <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 579. Because there are no Guidelines for supervised release revocation sentences, \u201cthe district court must consider the policy statements contained in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 579 n. 5 (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>501 F.3d 722, 724 (6th Cir.2007)). Second, the district court must give \u201cboth parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate,\u201d and then \u201cconsider all of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596; <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 579-80. The district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d and consideration of all the statutory factors. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 580. Finally, after arriving at a sentence, the district court \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Here, defendant does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation or consideration of the applicable policy statement range of 18-24 months. Our analysis therefore focuses on the district court\u2019s consideration of the statutory factors and defendant\u2019s arguments for leniency, as well as the court\u2019s explanation for ultimately settling on a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">1. Section 3583(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">Defendant concedes that the district court correctly interpreted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) to require revocation of supervised release and imposition of a term of imprisonment on the basis of defendant\u2019s multiple failed drug tests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>however, that the district court erroneously failed to consider \u00a7 3583(d)\u2019s exception to \u00a7 3583(g). Section 3583(d) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual\u2019s current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Essentially, \u00a7 3583(d) \u201crestore[s] discretion to the district judge\u201d in the case of a defendant who is otherwise subject to mandatory imprisonment under \u00a7 3583(g) as a result of a failed drug test. <em>United States v. Crace, </em>207 F.3d 833, 837 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Initially, we note that defense counsel did not raise \u00a7 3583(d) at the hearing before the district court. Regardless, defendant\u2019s argument lacks merit. As the government aptly points out, the district court clearly understood that \u00a7 3583(g) was not mandatory, because it had already modified defendant\u2019s supervised release to allow him to enter the Residential Reentry Center after several failed drug tests. More importantly, the record shows that the district court did consider the availability of substance abuse treatment programs. The court referred to defendant\u2019s \u201csorted [sic] history of drug use combined with his acknowledgment that he has, quote, never been honest with his drug treatment therapist or probation officer regarding his drug use until confronted with results.\u201d Sentencing Tr. p. 32, JA 62. The court also noted, and defendant admitted, that defendant had failed to attend required weekly group drug treatment sessions since his release from the Residential Reentry Center. Clearly, substance abuse treatment had not worked in the past. Defendant argues that the district court did not adequately address his recent progress, but the court considered his claim that he had been drug-free for approximately two months in the context of his past drug use and prior violations. \u201c[W]e do not require magic words in the record of the sentencing hearing indicating that substance abuse treatment was considered in order to uphold the district court\u2019s prison sentence.\u201d <em>Crace, </em>207 F.3d at 836. In this case, the court adequately considered substance abuse treatment as an alternative under \u00a7 3583(d), and adequately explained its rationale for imposing a sentence of imprisonment instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">2. Section 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Defendant next argues that the district court did not sufficiently consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether to grant his request for a downward variance. Section 3583(e) requires a district court to consider the following \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at a supervised release revocation sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-15\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-16\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>rectional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ... (B) ... the applicable guidelines or policy statements ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">(5) any pertinent policy statement (A) issued by the Sentencing Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We have never required, however, a \u201c \u2018ritual incantation\u2019 of the factors to affirm a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>505 F.3d 463, 468 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>403 F.3d 813, 817 (6th Cir.2005)). It is sufficient if \u201cthe district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence makes it clear that it considered the required factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>147 F.3d 490, 491 (6th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Husein, </em>478 F.3d 318, 330 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he reasons that [the district court] provides for the sentence must sufficiently reflect considerations akin to those enumerated in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Here, defendant argues that the district court did not address whether his acceptance of responsibility for the supervised release violations, his family obligations, his present employment, and his lack of drug use since February 2007 warranted a sentence below the policy statement range. But the record shows that the district court considered defendant\u2019s arguments and the statutory factors, and adequately explained its reasoning for imposing the 18-month sentence. As the government points out, the court permitted defendant to give reasons for violating his supervised release and make arguments in support of a more lenient sentence. After a long colloquy with both defendant and his counsel, the court acknowledged defendant\u2019s arguments but stated its concerns regarding his \u201csorted [sic] history of drug use\u201d and apparent inability to remain drug-free, as well as his dishonesty with his drug treatment therapist and probation officer. The court also noted defendant\u2019s failure to attend drug treatment sessions and questioned the earnestness of his efforts to obtain employment. The court did consider defendant\u2019s supportive wife and conscientious attorney, but ultimately concluded that he was \u201cnot deserving of a second chance or a third chance.\u201d All of the court\u2019s reasons were responsive to the arguments defendant had made, as well as the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, the court explicitly stated that it had examined the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the applicable policy statements; indeed, its thorough \u201cexplanation of the sentence makes it clear\u201d that it did. <em>Washington, </em>147 F.3d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">As support for his argument, defendant points to <em>United States v. Yopp, </em>453 F.3d 770, 773 (6th Cir.2006), in which this court vacated a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>But <em>Yopp </em>does not dictate the outcome here. In that case, unlike this one, the district court entirely failed to consider or even mention the Chapter Seven policy statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s imposition of an 18-month term of imprisonment was proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">C. Substantive Unreasonableness<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u201cAfter we have found the district court\u2019s sentencing decision to be procedurally sound, we must \u2018then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 581 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 586). The substantive reasonableness inquiry involves an analysis of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court \u201cselects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>Husein, </em>478 F.3d at 332. Sentences imposed within a properly calculated range under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines enjoy a rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 389-90 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">If a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable, the same is true of a sentence within the policy statement range. <em>See Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 581 (discussing review of supervised release revocation sentences for substantive reasonableness in the same way as review of sentences following a conviction). Here, the district court sentenced defendant at the bottom of the applicable policy statement range of 18-24 months. Further, defendant has failed to offer sufficient evidence or persuasive argument to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. Neither his explanations for violating the terms of his supervised release, nor his arguments in favor of leniency, present circumstances \u201cspecial enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they <em>require </em>a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 390 (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2470, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). This court has even upheld above-guidelines sentences where the defendant had previously violated the terms of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 628 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s imposition of the statutory maximum term of imprisonment was more than justified by [the defendant\u2019s] repeated transgressions.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>United States v. Morrow, </em>207 Fed.Appx. 591, 594 (6th Cir.2006) (approving a sentence two months above the policy statement guidelines where the district court had twice given the defendant \u201ca break\u201d for his repeated violations of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Because defendant has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s 18-month sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\">. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court \u201cinvalidated both the statutory provision which made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and [the provision] which directed appellate courts to apply a <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>novo </em>standard of review to departures from the Guidelines.\" <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (internal citations omitted). As a result, \"the Guidelines are now advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. Booker </em>did not drastically change the process of supervised release revocation sentencing, however, because such sentencing \u201cwas discretionary before <em>Booker </em>and is discretionary after it\u201d as well. <em>United States v.

West, </em>59 F.3d 32, 33 (6th Cir. 1995) (noting, well before <em>Booker, </em>that the Sentencing Commission's policy statements pertaining to supervised release revocation sentencing are \"merely advisory\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) provides, in pertinent part, that a court <em>\u201cshall </em>revoke the term of supervised release and require defendant to serve a term of imprisonment\u201d if defendant \"(1) possesses a controlled substance in violation of\u201d the conditions of supervised release, or \"(4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) (emphasis added). In this case, the district court noted that defendant had tested positive for narcotics on the following dates: October 12, 2005, October 17, 2005, May 6, 2006, June 8, 2006, June 21, 2006, July 11, 2006, July 20, 2006, August 2, 2006, August 11, 2006, and February 6, 2007. Sentencing Tr. p. 31, JA 61. Accordingly, \u00a7 3583(g)(4) required revocation. Mandatory revocation was also warranted under \u00a7 3583(g)(1), as we have held that use of a controlled substance constitutes possession under that subsection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>United States v.

However, \"it does not constitute reversible error to consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for violation of supervised release, even though this factor is not enumerated in \u00a7 3583(e).\u201d <em>United States v.
