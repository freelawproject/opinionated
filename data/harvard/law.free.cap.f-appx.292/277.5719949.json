Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), he seeks a certificate of appeal-ability (COA) for each of the 15 issues on which the district court denied federal-habeas relief. Along that line, he also requests remand for discovery and for a hearing on one of those issues. Because he fails to make the requisite showing, a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">In December 1996, Thompson and Butler robbed a convenience store while armed with handguns. <em>See Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d 549, 551 (Tex.Grim. App.2005). During the robbery, Thompson approached the cash register, pointed his gun at the clerk (first clerk) behind the counter, and demanded money. <em>Id. </em>He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>shot that first clerk in the stomach when he did not move quickly enough. <em>Id. </em>Then he shot at, but missed, a second clerk (ultimately, the victim) who was running toward the back of the store. <em>Id. </em>Turning his attention back to the first clerk, who was lying on the floor, he shot him three more times before demanding he get up and give him the money. <em>Id. </em>That first clerk did so, after which Thompson put his handgun to the first clerk\u2019s neck and pulled the trigger. <em>Id. </em>Upon discovering he already had fired all of the bullets in that weapon, he hit that first clerk over the head with the cash register drawer. <em>Id. </em>He then fled with Butler. <em>Id. </em>As Thompson drove away, Butler fired his handgun from the passenger window and fatally shot the second clerk/victim (at whom Thompson had previously, unsuccessfully shot). <em>Id. </em>The first clerk survived and testified at Thompson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Thompson\u2019s indictment charged he caused the victim\u2019s death during the robbery by shooting him with a firearm. At the time of his trial in March 1998, Thompson had three capital murder, and several aggravated robbery, charges pending against him, including the one at hand, stemming from similar robberies. <em>Id. </em>at 551 n. 5. Regarding all of those charges, by the time his counsel was appointed, he had made statements to the police confessing his involvement in all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The jury was instructed it could find Thompson guilty of capital murder if he: (1) specifically intended to kill, and did kill, the victim; (2) intended to kill the victim by \u201csolicitipng], encouraging], directing], aiding], or attempting] to aid\u201d Butler\u2019s shooting him during the robbery; or (3) conspired with Butler to commit the robbery and Butler\u2019s shooting the victim \u201cwas committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and was an offense that [Thompson] should have ... anticipated\u201d. <em>See id. </em>at 552. The jury found him guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 551. In response to the jury\u2019s answers to the special issues, Thompson was sentenced to death. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Thompson filed a motion for new trial on 15 August 2001. (This motion is <em>not </em>in the direct-appeal record. It is in the state-habeas record because it was filed by Thompson in those proceedings.) The motion relied upon Butler\u2019s affidavit (attached to the motion), which stated he (Butler) did <em>not </em>intend to kill the victim, and upon Butler\u2019s conviction for the lesser offense of felony (unintentional) murder (for which judicial notice was requested). Thompson did not receive a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">On direct appeal, Thompson raised procedural-error and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims (his issues 6-13 &amp; 15 here). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court of the United States denied review. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>No. 73128, 2003 WL 21466925 (Tex.Crim. App.25 Jun.2003) (en banc) (unpublished), cert. <em>denied </em>540 U.S. 1091, 124 S.Ct. 960, 157 L.Ed.2d 797 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">While his direct appeal was pending, Thompson requested state post-conviction relief. He claimed that he was factually innocent of capital murder and that his conviction violated the Constitution (his issues 1-2 &amp; 4 here). As he had in his motion for new trial, he relied upon Butler\u2019s \u201cI did not intend to kill\u201d statement and his <em>felony-murder </em>conviction; he attached Butler\u2019s affidavit and trial transcript. He contended the State violated his due process rights under <em>Brady </em>by suppressing the statement Butler made to investigators that Butler did not intend to kill the victim (his issue 3 here). He also claimed ineffective-assistance-of-counsel on several grounds (including his issues 7, 10, 14, &amp; arguably 5 here). Thompson attached affidavits from his appellate counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>and another local attorney who had reviewed his trial record, opining he received ineffective assistance. The State responded on 29 November 2000 with, <em>inter alia, </em>a 28 November 2000 affidavit from Thompson\u2019s trial counsel, explaining his trial preparation and strategy. On 22 December 2004, Thompson filed his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, attaching trial counsel\u2019s: (1) affidavit (again); (2) letter to appellate counsel; and (3) file from Thompson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The state-habeas trial court adopted the State\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on 25 January 2005, and recommended denying relief. On 13 April 2005, the TCCA ordered supplemental briefing on Thompson\u2019s claims for factual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request a felony-murder instruction. State-habeas relief was denied by the TCCA in an opinion that, <em>inter alia, </em>adopted the state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Thompson then requested federal habe-as relief on 15 issues. In an extremely comprehensive, detailed, and well-reasoned 62-page opinion, relief was denied, as were his motions for expansion of the record, discovery, an evidentiary hearing, and a stay (in order to develop a record regarding his claims). <em>Thompson v. State, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (S.D. Tex. 30 Nov. 2007) (unpublished). In that opinion, a COA was also denied, <em>sua sponte. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Thompson moved to amend the judgment, seeking relief or a COA on all claims. The district court denied reconsideration. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (S.D. Tex. 21 Dec. 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Thompson seeks a COA on each of the 15 issues raised in his federal petition. He also maintains the district court erred in denying his motions to expand the record with certain unspecified documents, and for discovery, an evidentiary hearing, and a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Thompson\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas application is subject to AEDPA. <em>E.g., Penny v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001). Under AED-PA, Thompson may not appeal the denial of habeas relief unless he first obtains a COA from either the district, or this, court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Miller v. Dretke, </em>404 F.3d 908, 912 (5th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). The district court must first decide whether to grant a COA; only if it is denied by that court may a COA on that issue be requested here. Fed. RApp. P. 22(b)(1). Having been denied a COA by the district court, Thompson requests one from this court on each of his 15 issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">To obtain a COA, Thompson must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). To make such a showing when the district court\u2019s habeas denial is on the merits of an issue, Thompson must demonstrate \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further\u201d (reasonable-jurists standard). <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quoting <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">When the district court\u2019s denial of relief for a claim is based on a procedural ruling, such as the claim\u2019s being unexhausted, the requisite showing is expanded. <em>See Foster </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 364 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Hall v. Cain, </em>216 F.3d 518, 521 (5th Cir.2000)), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2099, 167 L.Ed.2d 817 (2007). \u201cIn that situation, the applicant must show jurists of reason would find debatable whether: the habeas petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; <em>and </em>the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis added) (reasonable-jurists/procedural standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In deciding whether to grant a COA, we can make only a threshold inquiry into the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA to Thompson\u2019s constitutional claims; we may not consider the factual or legal merits in support of the claims. <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. \u201cWhen a court of appeals sidesteps this process by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">For purposes of our threshold inquiry, we are cognizant that, under AEDPA, the district court was required, with limited exceptions described below, to defer to the state court\u2019s resolution of Thompson\u2019s claims. Those exceptions turn on the character of the state-court\u2019s ruling. <em>Foster, </em>466 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">First, on questions of law, as well as mixed questions of law and fact, the district court was required to defer to the state-court\u2019s decision unless it \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913. The state-court\u2019s decision is considered contrary to clearly established federal law if it \u201creaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable facts\u201d. <em>Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913 (quoting <em>Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 337 (5th Cir.2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Second, our threshold inquiry must recognize the district court\u2019s obligation to defer to the state-court\u2019s factual findings, unless they \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Along that line, the district court was required to presume the state-court\u2019s factual findings were correct; Thompson had to rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Moreover, our threshold inquiry requires consideration of a COA request against the backdrop of the elements of Thompson\u2019s underlying constitutional claim. <em>See Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913. Needless to say, meaningful review of the district court\u2019s ruling, for COA purposes, on whether Thompson made the requisite 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d requires our considering these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">In the light of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough opinion, and essentially for the reasons stated in it, reasonable jurists could <em>not </em>debate the district court\u2019s rulings \u2014 for either the reasonable-jurists or the reasonable-jurists/proeedural standards. This is especially true in the light of Thompson\u2019s conclusory briefing for most of the 15 requested COAs. Nevertheless, we address each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">As a threshold matter, Thompson complains that the district court erred in denying his motions for factual development of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the record. He seeks remand or a stay to develop the factual basis for several of his 15 claims. The district court denied his motions for expansion of the record, discovery, and an evidentiary hearing \u201cbecause he failed to identify the evidence he wanted to produce, he did not show good cause for discovery, and did not show that he had diligently attempted to develop the record in state court\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (21 Dec. 2007) (discussing <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007) (denying motions)). Such denials are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., In re Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>304 F.3d 410, 433 n. 43 (5th Cir.2002) (expansion of the record) (citation omitted); <em>Clark v. Johnson, </em>202 F.3d 760, 766 (5th Cir.2000) (discovery and evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">At issue are only Thompson\u2019s COA requests. These alleged procedural errors are <em>not </em>phrased as COA requests, but they bear upon his requests. We consider them here for purposes of ruling on those COA requests. <em>See Reyes v. Quarterman, </em>195 Fed.Appx. 272, 278-79 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (unpublished) (considering procedural issues before addressing COA requests); <em>Clark, </em>202 F.3d at 765-68 (considering procedural issues in context of COA requests). Most of those requests are inadequately briefed; nevertheless, we will address each request.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">First, Thompson sought expansion of the record with \u201cthe following materials, including but not limited to ... (1) Letters predating the filing of the petition in district court; (2) Documents; (3) Exhibits; (4) Answers under oath; [and] (5) Written Interrogatories propounded/approved by the judge (if so directed)\u201d. Thompson\u2019s motion identifies no specific documents. As the district court found: \u201cThompson\u2019s motion makes no effort to show what omissions exist in the record, ... specific material he wants to include, or why that material is necessary.... [It] is, in essence, a general discovery request\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">As noted, as well as discussed below, Thompson also sought discovery. The district court considered the motions together, and denied them for \u201clack of specificity\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying expansion of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Second, Thompson sought discovery to obtain unspecified documents from an assistant district attorney and serve interrogatories on the jurors, defense counsel, assistant district attorney, and bailiff for his trial, as well as \u201cothers as necessary\u201d. As noted, this motion, too, was denied for \u201clack of specificity\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u201cA party shall be entitled to invoke the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise of his discretion and for good cause shown grants leave to do so, but not otherwise.\u201d <em>Bracy v. Gramley, </em>520 U.S. 899, 904, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997) (quoting R. Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases 6(a)). \u201c\u2018[W]here specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is ... entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 908-09, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (quoting <em>Harris v. Nelson, 394 </em>U.S. 286, 300, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969)). On the other hand, \u201c[c]onclusionary allegations are not enough to warrant discovery under Rule 6 of the Federal Rules Governing Section 2254 Petitions; the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. Rule 6 ... does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>not authorize fishing expeditions\u201d. <em>Ward v. Whitley, </em>21 F.3d 1355, 1367 (5th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted); <em>see also Murphy v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 809, 814 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding no abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">As discussed, the district court ruled the motions \u201clack[ed] the necessary specificity\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). As such, Thompson did not \u201cpoint to specific evidence that once existed and may continue to exist that holds the potential to exonerate him.... [And he] has not shown any likelihood that physical evidence exists that would render his request for information ... more than a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 \u201d. <em>Reed v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 465, 477 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny discovery.- <em>See id. </em>(finding no abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>392 F.3d 787, 802 (5th Cir.2004) (denying COA on denial of discovery because petitioner \u201cfailed to identify, with specific allegations, any dispositive factual disputes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Third, Thompson sought an evidentiary hearing. His motion maintained: he did not receive a full, fair evidentiary hearing in state court; and \u201c[t]he facts in dispute from the state trial court are the effective assistance of the trial eounsel[,] the failure to disclose relevant <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>information ... [, and] the failure of the trial court to conduct a hearing on a potentially racist comment by a jury member\u201d. The district court ruled the motion \u201clack[ed] specificity and failfed] to make the necessary showing that such development is permitted by [AEDPA] or necessary for the proper adjudication of the claims\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Thompson now asserts the lack-of-specificity denial of his motion is erroneous because the state court did not hold a \u201ctrue hearing\u201d and specificity \u201cis impossible to provide\u201d without discovery. He does <em>not </em>challenge the district court\u2019s ruling he failed to show such factual development would be permitted by AEDPA or to provide sufficient specificity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2), an eviden-tiary hearing is <em>only </em>appropriate when \u201c(A) the claim relies on \u2014 (i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Coui\u2019t, that was previously unavailable; or (ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and (B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\"><em>Comeaux v. Cain, </em>204 Fed.Appx. 471, 474 n. 4 (5th Cir.2006) (holding district court erred in granting hearing where petitioner \u201cclearly cannot meet these requirements\u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">As Thompson does not show, or attempt to show, that he meets \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(A)\u2019s requirements, the denial of an evidentiary hearing was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">As stated, Thompson seeks a COA on 15 issues. They relate to: whether his capital-murder conviction or death sentence violates the Constitution (his issues 1, 2, <em>&amp; </em>4); whether the State suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of his due-process lights (his issue 3); whether the trial court\u2019s procedural and evidentiary errors violated his Constitutional rights (his issues 6, 9, &amp; 15); and whether his counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective, in violation of his Sixth Amendment right (his issues 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>7-8, &amp; 10-14). As stated above and discussed below, none satisfies the above-defined reasonable-jurists or reasonable-jurists/procedural standards for obtaining a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Initially, Thompson seeks a GOA for his three claims that his conviction and sentence violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">First, Thompson seeks a COA on whether he is factually innocent of capital murder, so that his conviction violates due process. Relying on Butler\u2019s conviction for only <em>felony </em>murder and citing <em>Tison v. Arizona, </em>481 U.S. 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987), he asserts he cannot be held liable for capital murder because: \u201cThe state ... cannot hold the vicarious liability of a party to a <em>higher standard </em>than the <em>actual </em>liability of the true perpetrator\u201d; and he did not shoot the victim and was not responsible for Butler\u2019s actions. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\"><em>Tison, </em>however, holds the imposition of the death penalty upon a major participant in a felony who showed reckless indifference to human life is <em>not </em>a violation of the due-process clause. 481 U.S. at 158, 107 S.Ct. 1676. Instead, the Constitution requires that a death sentence \u201cbe tailored to [a defendant\u2019s] personal responsibility and moral guilt\u201d. <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 801, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982). And, under Texas law, Thompson <em>can </em>be criminally responsible for capital murder even if Butler, who fired the fatal shot, is not. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 7.02(a) (defendant intended to kill someone during the aggravated robbery and solicited, encouraged, directed, or aided his accomplice, who also had that intent, to do so), (b) (defendant conspired to commit aggravated robbery and the death was a consequence he should have anticipated); <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 552-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The state-habeas trial court ruled Thompson\u2019s factual-innocence claim was a suffieiency-of-the-evidence claim, which is not reviewable in state-habeas proceedings. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law). On the other hand, the TCCA ordered supplemental briefing on this issue. Ultimately, the TCCA held the jury could have convicted Thompson under any of three theories and had sufficient evidence to find him guilty of capital murder, and also adopted the state-habeas trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 551-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The district court held: Thompson did not show any of those three theories violates due process as described in <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, and <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676; and \u201cthe Constitution does not require that Thompson\u2019s conviction and sentence be less severe than Butler\u2019s\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Next, Thompson seeks a COA on whether his capital-murder conviction or resulting death sentence, in the light of Butler\u2019s <em>felony </em>murder conviction and less-than-death sentence, violates due process or equal protection. He asserts the Constitution is violated because Butler was convicted of only <em>felony </em>murder and was not sentenced to death. As support, he cites <em>Hopkins v. Reeves, </em>524 U.S. 88, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1895,141 L.Ed.2d 76 (1998) (stating death penalty cannot be imposed where defendant \u201cwas a minor participant in the crime and neither intended to kill nor had shown reckless indifference to human life\u201d (citations omitted)), and <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 797, 102 S.Ct. 3368 (holding Eighth Amendment does not al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>low imposition of the death penalty on one who does not kill, attempt to kill, or intend or contemplate that a killing would occur). Thompson relies, however, on Butler\u2019s <em>felony </em>murder conviction. He does <em>not </em>contend that he was a minor participant who did not attempt to kill, intend that a killing occur, or show reckless indifference to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">As discussed above, the Constitution is not violated where, as here, the focus was on the defendant\u2019s actions and intent. <em>See Enmund, </em>458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368; <em>Tison, </em>481 U.S. 137, 107 S.Ct. 1676. In that regard, the TCCA ruled Thompson\u2019s conviction and sentence did not violate the Constitution because sufficient evidence showed he was a major participant in, and showed reckless indifference to human life during, the aggravated robbery. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law). Similarly, the district court ruled Thompson\u2019s Constitutional rights were not violated because \u201chis conviction was based on his own criminal culpability\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Thompson requests a COA for his claim that the State\u2019s suppression of evidence \u2014 Butler\u2019s statement to investigators that he (Butler) did not intend to kill the victim \u2014 violated Thompson\u2019s due-process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\"><em>Brady </em>held: \u201c[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Our court has made clear, however, that, \u201cwhen information is fully available to a defendant at the time of trial and his only reason for not obtaining and presenting the evidence to the Court is his lack of reasonable diligence, the defendant has no <em>Brady </em>claim\u201d. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>628 F.2d 471, 473 (5th Cir.1980) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Run-yan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 246 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The TCCA held Thompson failed to show the State violated <em>Brady </em>by withholding Butler\u2019s statement because Thompson\u2019s trial counsel testified (via affidavit attached to the State\u2019s response in state-habeas proceedings) that he reviewed Butler\u2019s statement and spoke with him in preparation for Thompson\u2019s trial. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law). In fact, as the district court noted, Thompson apparently waived this claim in his statehabeas proceedings, after the State introduced his counsel\u2019s affidavit, by conceding the claim was \u201cwithout merit in that [Thompson\u2019s] trial counsel had access to Butler\u2019s custodial statement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Thompson does not contest the affidavit, access to the statement, or waiver of the claim. (Moreover, Thompson also abandoned this claim by failing to brief it.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Thompson seeks a COA for his claims that three procedural and evidentiary rulings violated his Constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Thompson requests a COA on whether the trial court\u2019s failure to investigate a juror\u2019s alleged statement resulted in Thompson\u2019s being tried by a biased jury, in violation of his due-process rights under <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992). During the punishment phase of Thompson\u2019s trial, a defense witness reported that, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>stepped down after testifying about Thompson, he overheard a male juror say \u201cpoor little black boy\u201d. The trial court held a hearing, and the witness testified he interpreted it as a racist comment. The trial court, however, denied defense counsel\u2019s request to ask each male juror if he made the comment, and, if so, whether he harbored any racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Citing <em>Remmer v. United States, </em>847 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954), Thompson maintains no hearing was held, and complains that his counsel should have been permitted to interrogate the male jurors. <em>Remmer, </em>a <em>jury-tampering case, </em>holds: \u201cThe trial court ... should determine the circumstances, the impact thereof upon the juror, and whether or not it was prejudicial, in a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 74 S.Ct. 450. \u201c[Djeterminations made in Remmer-type hearings will frequently turn upon testimony of the juror in question\u201d. <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 217 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On the other hand, trial courts have wide discretion to control the flow of trial, and are not <em>required </em>to conduct a hearing on juror <em>misconduct </em>\u2014 as opposed to jury <em>tampering. See, e.g., United States v. Webster, </em>750 F.2d 307, 338 (5th Cir.1984). \u201cIn determining whether to conduct a hearing in [a jury misconduct case,] the court must balance the probable harm\u201d from emphasizing the misconduct against the likely prejudice from the misconduct. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d 974, 980 (5th Cir.1978)) (alteration in original). The ultimate inquiry is whether \u201cthe intrusion affect[ed] the jury\u2019s deliberations and thereby its verdict\u201d. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 739, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">On direct appeal, the TCCA found \u201cthe statement that the witness heard is not a clear manifestation of racial bias\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at <em>*2. </em>It noted the statement could have been referring to the <em>witness, </em>or even if not, its underlying basis could have been sincerity or irony. <em>Id. </em>It denied the claim, ruling: \u201cBecause defense counsel did not diligently question the jurors about racial bias during <em>voir dire, </em>an alleged bias manifested later does not constitute juror misconduct\u201d. <em>Id. \u201c\u00a1V\u00a1oir dire </em>examination is the time to uncover potential prejudice or bias in prospective jurors ... and ... a defendant who begins the inquiry in the middle of the trial is not acting timely\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Under Texas law, as recognized by the district court, \u201cif a defendant later \u2018wishe[s] to show bias on the part of a juror, [the] proper remedy [is] a motion for new trial with an accompanying affidavit by a juror showing such bias\u2019 \u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007) (quoting <em>Norman v. State, </em>588 S.W.2d 340, 347 (Tex.Crim.App.1979)) (alteration in original). Thompson\u2019s new-trial motion (from his trial, but, as noted, found only in his state-habeas record), however, does <em>'not </em>mention juror bias. The district court noted: Thompson\u2019s claim <em>speculates </em>that further inquiry would have revealed harmful, racial prejudice; and the state trial court implicitly found no jury bias threatened the fairness of Thompson\u2019s punishment-phase. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The district court held Thompson had not met his burden to show the TCCA\u2019s denial of this claim was unreasonable under AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>Thompson does not challenge these rulings, urging only that the trial court\u2019s denying a hearing was \u201charmful\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">Second, Thompson seeks a COA for his claim that the trial court lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof on the second spe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>eial issue during sentencing (in violation of his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights), by stating, during <em>voir dire, </em>that the jurors would be asked if Thompson <em>\u201cshould have </em>anticipated that a human life would be taken\u201d. (Emphasis added.) There was no contemporaneous objection made to the court\u2019s statement. The second special issue submitted to the jury asked if Thompson \u201cactually caused the death[,] ... intended to kill [the victim] or another, or that he anticipated that a human life would be taken\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On direct appeal, the TCCA denied relief because \u201c[Thompson] failed to object to the trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>of the jury, therefore failing to preserve this error for review\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *7 (citations omitted). The district court ruled it could not consider this claim because it was procedurally barred; and that, even if it were not, the claim failed because the trial court\u2019s special-issue instructions during the punishment-phase did <em>not </em>include the contested \u201cshould have\u201d language. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Here, Thompson failed to brief this claim; therefore, it is abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Third, Thompson seeks a COA for whether the state trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a fail' trial by admitting an officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">During the punishment phase of trial, the jury heard a recording of Thompson\u2019s statements to officers following his arrest, explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>the robbery (and others he admitted committing) as God\u2019s punishment of members of certain ethnic groups operating businesses in his community. Following the recording, one of those officers was asked: \u201cDid you have a feeling, sir, that he was telling the truth about this philosophy of his?\u201d The officer responded, \u201cYes\u201d. Thompson\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection to this testimony <em>as speculative </em>was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">On direct appeal, Thompson asserted that the officer\u2019s opinion about Thompson\u2019s truthfulness was inadmissible <em>expert testimony. </em>The TCCA held this issue was not preserved for appeal because Thompson\u2019s objection at trial was made on different grounds. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The district court held this claim was procedurally barred, because Texas\u2019 rule requiring Thompson to have made the same objection at trial as raised on appeal, in order to preserve the issue for appeal, is \u201can adequate and independent state ground that procedurally bars federal habeas review of [this claim]\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007) (quoting <em>Fisher v. State, </em>169 F.3d 295, 300 (5th Cir.1999)). Although Thompson maintains his objection at trial was sufficient to preserve it for appeal, the district court stated: \u201cFederal courts generally do not assess whether a state court improperly applied its own procedural law\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Estelle v. McGmrre, </em>502 U.S. 62, 68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991)). The district court held, alternatively, that, even if the merits were reached, Thompson had not shown the testimony made his trial unfair so as to entitle him to habeas relief. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Little v. Johnson, </em>162 F.3d 855, 862 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cIn habeas actions, this court does not sit to review the mere admissibility of evidence under state law.\u201d); <em>Shaw v. Estelle, </em>686 F.2d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Last, Thompson seeks a COA for each of the following eight contentions that he received ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(IAC) under the Sixth Amendment from his trial counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">(1) consenting to the dismissal of a prospective juror;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">(2) being absent during the <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">(3) ignoring available defensive strategies, including failing to obtain and introduce favorable expert testimony or introduce Butler\u2019s \u201cI had no intent to kill\u201d statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">(4) failing to request a lesser-included-offense instruction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">(5) failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">(6) failing to object to good-character-of-the-victim evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">(7) discussing Thompson\u2019s extraneous offenses in closing argument; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">(8) misstating the jury\u2019s sentencing duty in his punishment-phase closing argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">In addition, he seeks a COA on the claim that these errors <em>cumulatively </em>amount to IAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">In state court, to make a substantial IAC showing, Thompson was required to establish <em>both: </em>(1) his counsel\u2019s deficient performance; <em>and </em>(2) resulting prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Of course, for habeas review under AED-PA, the state court\u2019s performance and/or prejudice rulings are generally reviewed only to determine whether the state-court decision is unreasonable, not whether, in federal court, petitioner has shown each IAC prong. <em>E.g., Schaetzle v. Cockrell, </em>343 F.3d 440, 443-44 (5th Cir.2003). Generally, as stated, that task must be accomplished in state court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">In state court, to establish deficient performance, Thompson had to \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be \u201chighly deferential\u201d, and courts must make every effort \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. There is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, \u201c[a] conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy cannot be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness\u201d. <em>Crane v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 309, 314 (5th Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">In state court, to establish prejudice, Thompson had to \u201cshow that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">First, Thompson seeks a COA for his claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the dismissal of a prospective juror was IAC. After the State and defense counsel agreed to dismiss this potential juror, who would have had to withdraw from her college classes in order to serve on the jury, Thompson told the trial court he agreed with the potential juror\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">On direct appeal, the TCCA ruled: in the light of Thompson\u2019s consenting to the potential juror\u2019s dismissal, Thompson failed to show his counsel\u2019s agreement was \u201cdeficient performance, much less prejudicial performance\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>21466925, at *3. The district court denied relief, noting Thompson did not contest his consent to the dismissal. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Second, Thompson seeks a COA for his claim that his counsel\u2019s absence during the State\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror constituted IAC. As evidence of his counsel\u2019s absence, he cites the State\u2019s saying, \u201cYou met Mr. Greenlee [defense counsel] and Connie [defense co-counsel] and Casey [co-prosecutor] yesterday. They\u2019re out right now, but they\u2019ll be back in\u201d. Defense counsel conducted his <em>voir dire </em>of that juror immediately following the State\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On direct appeal, the TCCA denied this claim because \u201cthe record does not support the contention that both defense counsel missed [the] <em>voir dire </em>\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *3. It declared the State\u2019s statement ambiguous and cited the lack of other evidence indicating their absence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In denying relief, the district court found Thompson \u201cmade no effort to substantiate his claim that trial counsel \u2018abandoned\u2019 him during jury selection\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). Thus, Thompson failed to refute the state court\u2019s findings by the requisite clear and convincing evidence. In addition, he makes no attempt to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Third, Thompson seeks a COA for his IAC claim that his right to counsel was violated by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate, prepare, or employ a successful strategy, as reflected by his failure to: (1) obtain or introduce favorable psychiatric testimony; or (2) introduce Butler\u2019s statement that he (Butler) did not intend to kill the victim and urge Thompson\u2019s innocence due to Butler\u2019s lacking that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">At trial, counsel chose not to present expert testimony on Thompson\u2019s future dangerousness, explaining to the trial court that the appointed expert\u2019s opinion, based on Thompson\u2019s statements to her, was unfavorable. During state-habeas proceedings, Thompson\u2019s trial counsel submitted an affidavit to that effect (\u201cthe psychiatric evaluation ... was anything but mitigating\u201d). That affidavit also explained that the failure to introduce Butler\u2019s statement at trial was also a strategic decision (\u201cnothing in [Butler\u2019s] statement caused me to change my overall defensive strategy, because they planned the robberies and brought guns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">For the failure to introduce expert testimony, raised in the state-habeas proceedings, the TCCA found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">[T]he trial court granted defense counsels\u2019 ... motion for an independent psychiatric evaluation of [Thompson].... [That expert] evaluated [Thompson] ... and [Thompson] admitted to [her] that he committed robberies and that he would continue the same course of action if he were given a gun.... [The expert] considered [Thompson] a sociopath who cared only for his aunt and had no respect for others\u2019 lives.... [D]efense counsel elected not to present the testimony of [that expert] because her testimony was not beneficial to the defense.... [D]efense counsels\u2019 punishment strategy was to demonstrate ... that [Thompson\u2019s] age and lack of criminal record was sufficiently mitigating to warrant an affirmative answer to the third special issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-15\"><em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ings of fact and conclusions of law). The TCCA ruled this performance was not deficient or prejudicial, noting \u201ccounsels\u2019 <em>voir dire </em>and trial strategy were not premised on the results of [Thompson\u2019s] psychiatric evaluation\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thompson contends counsel should have learned the expert\u2019s opinion before the eve of trial, in order for a different expert to be retained. The district court denied relief, finding: \u201cThe record defeats any inference that, even if trial counsel had [the expert\u2019s] opinion before trial, it would have changed the defensive strategy\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). Thompson provides no evidence that another expert\u2019s opinion would have differed. He challenges these rulings by urging only: the court cannot know counsel\u2019s strategy would have remained the same if the expert\u2019s unfavorable opinion had been learned sooner. There is no support in the record for this proposition, which is, in fact, rebutted by trial counsel\u2019s affidavit. Nor does the record support that the expert\u2019s opinion was not learned until the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Trial counsel\u2019s failure to introduce Butler\u2019s statement (that Butler did not intend to kill the victim) was raised in Thompson\u2019s state-habeas petition. As discussed above, Thompson could have been found guilty even if Butler did not intend to kill the victim. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 7.02(a)(1) (if he intended to kill and aided Butler\u2019s shooting), (b) (if he conspired to commit aggravated robbery and the death was a consequence he should have anticipated); <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 552-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Based on trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, the TCCA found: \u201c[Trial counsel] made a strategic choice not to argue that the shooting ... was unintentional, even though he had reviewed co-defendant Butler\u2019s statement, because counsel found the stronger course of action was to argue that [Thompson] should not have anticipated Butler\u2019s shooting\u201d. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law). It held Thompson failed to show deficient performance or prejudice, stating: \u201c[T]hat another attorney might have pursued [a] different strategy will not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The district court ruled: \u201cThe evidence strongly supported the conclusion that Thompson intended to kill, regardless of Butler\u2019s intent. Thompson has not shown that the state court\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Thompson contests that his counsel chose not to introduce the statement because it reinforced that the men planned the robberies and supported an inference that they intended to kill, as trial counsel stated in his affidavit. Thompson contends that counsel \u201cfailed to understand the significance of [Butler\u2019s] statement or simply failed to pursue it in a timely way\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Thompson also urges that discovery should have been permitted by the district court \u201c[t]o resolve a potential dispute over the use of [Butler\u2019s] statement\u201d. As explained above, Thompson\u2019s motions for factual development failed to, <em>inter alia, </em>convey what \u201cpotential dispute\u201d exists that could entitle him to relief; and the denial of discovery was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">d.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Fourth, Thompson seeks a COA for his claim that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to evidence of the victim\u2019s good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>character deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. During the guilt-innocence phase of his trial, witnesses testified that both store clerks were nice, good people; and that the victim had shielded a bystander from bullets during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">On direct appeal, the TCCA noted the failure to object \u201cmay have been strategic\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *6. In denying the claim, it ruled Thompson had not shown the evidence was inadmissible or that a successful objection would have affected his trial\u2019s outcome. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The district court held: although Thompson cited <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), for the proposition that \u201ca victim\u2019s general character should not be an issue in a trial, especially in guilt innocence\u201d, Thompson had not shown how his counsel could have excluded this testimony. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Thompson asserts the evidence is inadmissible under <em>Payne </em>because this is an extraordinary circumstance where his character should not be compared to the victim\u2019s, because he did not shoot the victim. <em>Payne </em>dealt, however, with character evidence introduced during the sentencing phase of a trial, and held such evidence <em>may </em>be relevant and admissible as to the jury\u2019s decision. <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597. It also states: \u201cIn the event that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief\u2019. <em>Id. </em>at 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597. Thompson has made no showing that this testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">e.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Fifth, Thompson seeks a COA for his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on <em>felony </em>murder, forcing the jury to convict him of an offense more serious than he committed or set him free, in violation of his due-process rights under <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980) (holding death penalty is unconstitutional where evidence supported a lesser-ineluded offense on which the jury was not instructed). Thompson makes no effort, however, to show the jury could have found he was guilty of felony, rather than capital, murder. As noted, the jury was instructed it could find Thompson guilty of capital murder if he: (1) specifically intended to kill, and did kill, the victim during the robbery; (2) intended to kill the victim by \u201csolicitifing], encouraging], directing], aiding], or attempting] to aid\u201d Butler\u2019s shooting him; or (3) conspired with Butler to commit the robbery and Butler\u2019s shooting the victim \u201cwas committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and was an offense that [Thompson] should have [ ] anticipated\u201d. <em>See Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">This claim was denied on direct appeal, the TCCA ruling that Thompson had not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome, had the lesser-offense instruction been requested. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *4-5. It expressed no opinion on whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient (noting the absence of an affidavit from him) or whether the evidence at trial entitled Thompson to such an instruction. <em>Id. </em>at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">On state-habeas review, the State introduced Thompson\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s earlier-discussed affidavit stating that, in the light of the evidence of Thompson\u2019s conduct and confessions, counsel decided not to challenge the State\u2019s evidence of Thompson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>intent to kill or to request an instruction on unintentional murder because such an instruction was not supported by the evidence. The TCCA ordered supplemental briefing on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In its subsequent opinion, the TCCA noted that the claim was denied on direct appeal because the direct-appeal record did not contain \u201csufficient information concerning trial counsel\u2019s strategy\u201d, but that the state-habeas record did. <em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 557. The TCCA held Thompson\u2019s counsel was not ineffective because, considering the evidence at trial, Thompson was not entitled to a felony-murder instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 558-60. It ruled: Thompson \u201cfails to point to any evidence that affirmatively shows [Thompson] did not intend the death of [the victim] or another\u201d; and the evidence of his \u201cintent to kill is not merely sufficient, it is overwhelming\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 559. It also noted that, if Thompson\u2019s counsel had challenged the evidence of his intent to kill, \u201cthe State would presumably walk right through that door with the evidence of two extraneous capital murders [Thompson] committed to prove that he had a murderous intent on this occasion just as he had on those two other occasions\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The district court, after reviewing Texas law, trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, and the TCCA\u2019s decision, agreed. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). It ruled: \u201cTidal counsel made a strategic decision not to seek a felony murder instruction. The [TCCA\u2019s] affirming of that decision is amply supported. There is no basis for relief....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Thompson fails to point to evidence that could show he lacked the intent to kill, or otherwise demonstrate his entitlement to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">f.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Sixth, Thompson seeks a COA on his IAC claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence for the punishment phase of trial violated his Sixth Amendment right under <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). Two affidavits attached to his federal habeas petition (from his mother and grandmother) and four filed with his subsequent request for a stay (from family and friends) attest to his difficult childhood and good character. Thompson asserts this claim was presented to the state courts, without the six affidavits, as part of his IAC-for-failure-to-investigate claim in state-habeas proceedings. This claim also appears to have been included on direct appeal, as part of his IAC-in-the-punishment-phase claim (discussed in the next subpart).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">In the alternative, he contends the district court erred by denying his request for a stay so that he could exhaust this claim in state court. Again, a denial of such a stay is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Brewer v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 491, 492-93 (5th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). A stay should only be granted if: (1) the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust; (2) his claim is not plainly merit-less; and (3) he has not engaged in an intentional delay. <em>See, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 277-78, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005). The district court noted Thompson made none of those showings. Thompson does not explain why he did not file his motion for a stay until several months after filing his federal habeas petition. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The state-habeas trial court made the following, above-quoted findings with regard to his IAC-for-failure-to-investigate claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">[T]he trial court granted defense counsels\u2019 ... motion for an independent psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>chiatric evaluation of [Thompson].... [That doctor] evaluated [Thompson] ... and [Thompson] admitted to [her] that he committed robberies and that he would continue the same course of action if he were given a gun.... [The doctor] considered [Thompson] a sociopath who cared only for his aunt and had no respect for others\u2019 lives.... [D]efense counsel elected not to present the testimony of [that doctor] because her testimony was not beneficial to the defense.... [D]efense counsels\u2019 punishment strategy was to demonstrate ... that [Thompson\u2019s] age and lack of criminal record was sufficiently mitigating to warrant an affirmative answer to the third special issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><em>Ex parte Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The district court noted Thompson: \u201cnever presented this claim in state court\u201d and \u201cconcedes that \u2018any subsequent statehabeas writ would likely be dismissed [as successive] under the state\u2019s ... abuse of the writ doctrine\u2019 \u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). Thus, the claim is unexhausted and would be procedurally barred. <em>Id,.; see also Hughes v. Quarterman, </em>530 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir.2008) (explaining claim must be first considered by state courts, and its dismissal under the abuse of the writ doctrine is an independent and adequate state ground for denial that procedurally bars it from federal habeas review) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Nevertheless, the district court proceeded to consider the merits of the claim. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007). It found that trial counsel was familiar with Thompson\u2019s background, and that three defense witnesses testified to Thompson\u2019s good character and living with relatives while his parents were incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>It also noted that trial counsel\u2019s affidavit, presented by the State during state-habeas proceedings, stated: \u201cthere simply was not much in the way of mitigation to provide\u201d and \u201cMr. Thompson did not want [his attorneys] to present any evidence in the way of mitigation\u201d. <em>Id. </em>It noted Thompson did not contradict his trial counsel\u2019s statement that he did not want his attorneys to introduce mitigating evidence, and, thus, could not show deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>Further, in the light of the earlier-described six new affidavits, it held Thompson had not shown \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result had counsel adopted [Thompson\u2019s] proposed punishment phase strategy\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">As in district court, Thompson makes no effort to overcome the procedural bar or contest his trial counsel\u2019s affidavit. He instead urges the district court erred in ruling he did not show a reasonable probability that his mitigation evidence would have affected his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">g-</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Seventh, Thompson requests a COA on whether his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of \u201cthe many extraneous offenses that the State was intent on introducing at [the] punishment\u201d phase constituted I AC. The State\u2019s punishment-phase evidence showed Thompson confessed to committing two other murders during four similar aggravated robberies' (with Butler, during the week preceding the victim\u2019s death).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Thompson\u2019s counsel objected, initially and unsuccessfully, to the admission of Thompson\u2019s confessions on the basis that they were not voluntary. Thompson maintained on direct appeal that the confessions were admitted without objection, because counsel\u2019s original objections (voluntary intoxication) were abandoned at the pre-trial hearing on admissibility. During the punishment-phase of trial, counsel did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>not dispute the truthfulness of Thompson\u2019s confessions, instead characterizing Thompson\u2019s conduct as an aberration in an otherwise law-abiding life. The jury was instructed to consider the other offenses \u201conly if the extraneous crime or bad act has been shown by the State beyond a reasonable doubt to have been committed by [Thompson]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">This issue was raised on direct appeal and in state-habeas proceedings, in the context of whether this failure, coupled with counsel\u2019s stating that the jury could consider the extraneous offenses, lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof so as to constitute IAC. <em>See Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *6-7. The TCCA ruled, on direct appeal: Thompson failed to establish either deficient or prejudicial performance. <em>Id. </em>at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The district court determined that, under AEDPA, the state-court decision was not unreasonable because Thompson confessed to the extraneous offenses and provided no basis to challenge the admission of evidence to prove his involvement in them. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Thompson urges: even though he admitted to committing these offenses, his counsel should have requested a hearing to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed them and minimize or factually challenge them during the punishment phase. He cites no authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">h.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Eighth, Thompson seeks a COA on his IAC claim that his co-counsel\u2019s closing during the punishment phase lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof on the second special issue. That issue required the jury to find Thompson \u201cactually caused the death ... [or] intended to kill [the victim] or another or that he anticipated that a human life would be taken\u201d. His co-counsel, in closing, rephrased it this way: \u201cthat he\u2019s responsible for this killing in some kind of way\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The TCCA denied relief on this claim on direct appeal, ruling: co-counsel\u2019s statement was not deficient performance because, \u201c[a]bsent evidence to the contrary, we must presume that counsel strategically decided to avert attention from the second special issue\u201d. <em>Thompson, </em>2003 WL 21466925, at *7. It noted the jury was instructed according to Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">On state-habeas, the TCCA noted this issue \u201cneed not be considered\u201d because it had been decided on direct appeal, and held, in any event, that Thompson failed to show \u201cdeficient performance, much less harm\u201d, from the alleged error. <em>Ex paite Thompson, </em>179 S.W.3d at 551 (adopting state-habeas trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">The district court found: co-counsel\u2019s statement would not have lowered the burden of proof or changed the jury\u2019s special-issues verdict because the jury\u2019s instructions properly tracked Texas law. <em>Thompson, </em>No. 4:06-CV-148 (30 Nov. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Finally, Thompson requests a COA on whether these eight claimed errors constitute IAC if considered <em>cumulatively. </em>He also relies on one of his trial counsel\u2019s \u201cextensive disciplinary history\u201d, as presented in his state-habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">Thompson did not present this cumulative-error issue in his COA request in district court. Along that line, as discussed <em>supra, </em>before this court can consider a COA request <em>{%. e., </em>determine whether reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s decision), a COA for that issue must have been denied by the district court. <em>See, e.g., Brewer v. Quaterman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>466 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 63, 169 L.Ed.2d 52 (2007); <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). In other words, \u201clack of a ruling on a COA in the district court causes this court to be without jurisdiction to consider\u201d a COA belatedly requested here. <em>Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 946 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">For the foregoing reasons, a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
