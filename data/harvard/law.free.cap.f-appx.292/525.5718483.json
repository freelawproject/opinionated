The district court also granted Astaris judgment on the pleadings. We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand is reviewable in an appeal from final judgment, <em>see Morgan v. Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co., </em>96 F.2d 470, 472 (8th Cir.1938), and we review the denial de novo, <em>see Schuver v. Mid.Am. Energy Co., </em>154 F.3d 795, 798 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Dunn, whose employment by Astaris was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), was injured on the job in February 2001. He filed a Missouri workers\u2019 compensation claim. Due to the injury, Dunn took a leave of absence in October 2001, and in April 2002 he began his leave under Astaris\u2019s long-term disability plan. In February 2005 Dunn\u2019s long-term disability benefits were discontinued after he failed to provide requested information; thereafter, Astaris terminated Dunn. Dunn, in turn, sued Astaris in state court under Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 287.780 (no employer shall discharge or discriminate against employee for exercising rights under workers\u2019 compensation act), claiming that he should have been allowed to return to work in April 2002 when he reached maximum medical improvement, but that he was denied the opportunity solely because he had filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim a year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Astaris removed the case to federal court arguing that Dunn\u2019s suit was preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (LMRA), because resolution of Dunn\u2019s claim depended on interpretation of Article 11, Section 8, of the CBA, which governed the return to work of employees on medical leave. The provision states in relevant part that an employee who becomes \u201cphysically unfit\u201d to continue in his job \u201cwill by mutual agreement\u201d be placed in a job he can handle. Astaris asserted that Dunn would need to show his filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim was the sole cause of his discharge, and that to determine whether he could do so, the fact finder would have to interpret Article 11, Section 8. The district court agreed with Astaris and concluded that Dunn\u2019s wrongful-discharge claim was preempted because the CBA provision was implicated: the fact finder would have to determine such things as whether Dunn was unfit to perform his job when he sought to return to work, and what the phrase \u201cwill by mutual agreement\u201d meant. The court thereafter granted Astaris\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that Dunn\u2019s claim was time-barred because it was outside section 301\u2019s six-month limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">To determine if Dunn\u2019s claim is preempted, we must find that interpretation of a specific provision of the CBA is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>required, or that the claim is inextricably intertwined with the CBA. <em>See Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 405-06, 410, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988) (there is no preemption unless state-law claim itself is based on, or is dependent on analysis of, relevant CBA); <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 213, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985) (if state law claim is based on CBA or is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with contents of CBA, claim is subject to \u00a7 301 preemption). Some of our cases have applied <em>Lingle </em>in a rather broad way. <em>See Johnson v. Anheuser Busch,, Inc., </em>876 F.2d 620, 624 (8th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, we find the line of cases that has taken a narrower approach to LMRA preemption \u2014 asking only whether the claim itself, regardless of probable defenses, is necessarily grounded in rights established by the CBA \u2014 is the better approach. <em>See Bogan, v. General Motors Corp., </em>500 F.3d 828, at 832 (8th Cir.2007); <em>Meyer v. Schnucks Markets, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1048, 1050-52 (8th Cir.1998) (court is free to choose which line of cases to follow when faced with conflicting precedents; there is no preemption unless state-law claim itself is based on, or is dependent on analysis of, relevant CBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Our analysis begins with what Dunn must prove to be successful: (1) he was an employee of Astaris before the injury; (2) he exercised his rights under the workers\u2019 compensation act; (3) Astaris refused to allow him to return to work in April 2002; and (4) an exclusive causal relationship existed between Dunn\u2019s actions and Astaris\u2019s actions. <em>See Hansome v. Northwestern Cooperage Co., </em>679 S.W.2d 273, 275 (Mo.1984). If Astaris had a valid, nonpretextual reason to refuse to allow Dunn to return to work, then Dunn cannot prove the workers\u2019 compensation claim was the exclusive cause of his termination. <em>See Bloom v. Metro Heart Group of St. Louis, </em>440 F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">It appeal's to us that the question of a causal relationship between Dunn\u2019s claim and Astaris\u2019s refusal to allow him to return to work turns on purely factual questions about Astaris\u2019s conduct and motives rather than on the scope of Astaris\u2019s contractual authority to refuse to reinstate Dunn to his position. <em>See Meyer, </em>163 F.3d at 1050-52 (state-law retaliatory discharge claims were not preempted by LMRA because cases turned on purely factual questions about employer\u2019s conduct and motives rather than on scope of employer\u2019s contractual authority to discharge employees). Astaris\u2019s reliance on Article 11, Section 8, in defense of Dunn\u2019s claim does not render the case removable. <em>See Johnson v. AGCO Corp., </em>159 F.3d 1114, 1115-17 (8th Cir.1998) (presence of federal question, even \u00a7 301 question, in defensive argument does not render cause removable; employer\u2019s non-retaliatory reason to discharge employee based upon provisions in CBA \u2014 that employee\u2019s disability rendered him unable to perform \u2014 was not enough to confer federal jurisdiction based on complete preemption); <em>Humphrey v. Sequentia, Inc., </em>58 F.3d 1238, 1244 (8th Cir.1995) (fact that defense to claim relied upon CBA \u2014 employer asserted there was \u201cjust cause\u201d for discharge under CBA \u2014 held not to create basis for LMRA preemption). In sum, we cannot say that Dunn\u2019s claim is necessarily grounded in rights established by the CBA, or that the claim is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with consideration of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and we remand for entry of an order remanding the case to state court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
