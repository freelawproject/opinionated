Because the district court incorrectly construed the critical claim element of the '104 patent as a means-plus-function limitation subject to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph 6, this court vacates and remands.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Bridgeview\u2019s '104 patent claims equipment that processes baled crop materials such as hay. The device disclosed in the '104 patent includes a container that receives crop bales. The container supports the bale and brings it into contact with a \u201cmanipulator.\u201d The manipulator has rotating rollers which turn the bale above a simultaneously rotating \u201cdisintegrator.\u201d The \u201cdisintegrator,\u201d which shreds the bale, ejects it out of a door. Thus, the entire device facilitates effective shredding of hay and other baled materials. Claim 1 of the '104 patent states:</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">A crop material processor for disintegrating baled crop material comprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApV8\">a container for receiving and containing the crop material, the container having a bottom, a front wall, a back wall, a left side wall and a right side wall; a disintegrator having a roller positioned along the length of the container, wherein the disintegrator roller is adapted to rotate in a clockwise direction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\"><em>a manipulator mounted inside the container for driving the crop material into the disintegrator; </em>a discharge opening at the bottom of the right side wall to discharge material from the right side of the processor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-7\">a rotation converter having an input for connection to a power source rotating in counter-clockwise direction and an output connected to the disintegrator roller to provide the clockwise direction of rotation to the disintegrator roller which discharges the disintegrated crop material through the discharge opening at the right side of the processor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">'104 patent, Col. 10, 11. 39-40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Duratech, who manufactures its own crop material processor, brought suit against Bridgeview for a declaration that its devices do not infringe the claims of Bridgeview\u2019s '104 patent. Before the district court, the \u201cmanipulator\u201d claim element was the only disputed claim limitation. Duratech argued that the term should be construed as a means-plus-function limitation under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, paragraph 6, whereas Bridgeview argued that the term is better understood as connoting structure, and not subject to means-plus-function treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The district court sided with Duratech, construing the term as a means-plus-function limitation. The parties entered into a stipulation of summary judgment of nonin-Mngement, on the basis that Durateeh\u2019s accused devices lack the \u201cmanipulator\u201d claim limitation when the term is construed in the manner determined by the district court. The district court then entered final judgment of noninfringement in favor of Duratech. Bridgeview now appeals that claim construction. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Claim construction is a question of law reviewed without deference. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454-56 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). This court determines the ordinary and customary meaning of claim terms as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, using the methodology expounded in <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1312-19 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">A patentee\u2019s use of the word \u201cmeans\u201d in a claim limitation creates a presumption that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 paragraph 6 applies. <em>TriMed, Inc. v. Stryker Corp., </em>514 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>1256, 1259 (Fed.Cii-.2008). Conversely, a claim term without the word \u201cmeans\u201d suggests that \u00a7 112, paragraph 6 does not apply. <em>See Personalized Media Com-muns., L.L.C. v. ITC, </em>161 F.3d 696, 703-04 (Fed.Ch-.1998). This court has consistently held that \u201c[m]eans-plus-function claiming applies only to purely functional limitations that do not provide the structure that performs the recited function.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1311. Further, \u201c[i]n considering whether a claim term recites sufficient structure to avoid application of section 112 P 6, we have not required the claim term to denote a specific structure. Instead, we have held that it is sufficient if the claim term is used in common parlance or by persons of skill in the pertinent art to designate structure, even if the term covers a broad class of structures and even if the term identifies the structures by then* function.\u201d <em>Lighting World, Inc. v. Birchwood Lighting, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1354, 1359-60 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The absence of \u201cmeans\u201d language in the disputed claim term \u201cmanipulator\u201d entitles Bridgeview to a presumption that means-plus-function treatment does not apply. This presumption \u201cis a strong one that is not readily overcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. Thus, this court looks to whether the term \u201cmanipulator\u201d is one which does not recite \u201csufficiently definite structure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The ordinary meaning of the term suggests that \u201cmanipulator\u201d is a noun whose meaning connotes sufficient structure. \u201cManipulator\u201d is not a generic structural term of the ilk of such placeholder terms as \u201cmechanism,\u201d \u201cdevice,\u201d or \u201celement,\u201d whose meaning requires illumination from the specification. No doubt, the term \u201cmanipulator\u201d does not conjure up any one specific structure. However, it does convey to one of skill in the art a certain genus of structures known as \u201cmanipulators.\u201d Bridgeview presented evidence that practitioners within the mechanical arts field frequently use the term \u201cmanipulator\u201d to define structure coupled with functions, pointing out several prior art device patents in which the term is used in claims without being coupled to the word \u201cmeans.\u201d Tellingly, Duratech\u2019s own expert opined that \u201ca manipulator performing nearly identical functions is shown in the prior art,\u201d implicitly evidencing his understanding of \u201cmanipulator\u201d as a word whose meaning is not purely functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">This court\u2019s precedent is clear that \u201cthe fact that a particular mechanism ... is defined in functional terms is not sufficient to convert a claim element containing that term into a \u2018means for performing a specified function.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, </em>91 F.3d 1580, 1582 (Fed. Cir.1996). As this court noted in <em>Green-berg, </em>many devices take them names from the functions they perform, such as filters, brakes, locks, and clamps. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, simply because claim l\u2019s \u201cmanipulator\u201d takes its name from the verb \u201cmanipulate,\u201d this does not compel the application of \u00a7 112, paragraph 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">This court has also looked to dictionary definitions to discern whether a disputed term is recognized as a noun denoting structure. <em>See Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 1580, 1583 (Fed.Cir.1996) (\u201cDictionary definitions make clear that the noun \u2018detent\u2019 denotes a type of device with a generally understood meaning in the mechanical arts, even though the definitions are expressed in functional terms.\u201d); <em>Lighting World, </em>382 F.3d at 1361 (\u201cDictionary definitions in this case disclose that the term \u2018connector\u2019 has a reasonably well-understood meaning as a name for structure.\u201d). In the instant case, dictionaries readily identify that a \u201cmanipulator\u201d falls into a specific category of structural devices. For example, <em>Random House Unabridged Dictionary </em>(1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>defines \u201cmanipulator\u201d as a \u201cmechanical device for the remote handling of objects or materials in conditions not permitting the immediate presence of workers.\u201d Further, <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>(2008) defines the term generally as \u201ca device used for or in the manipulation of something\u201d and then provides auxiliary definitions for specific types of manipulators, including: \u201cthe transmitter of a dial telegraph,\u201d \u201cdevice for massaging or pummelling the body of a bedridden person, as a substitute for exercise,\u201d \u201can instrument used to teach deaf people how to articulate sounds,\u201d and \u201ca mechanical device for handling radioactive or hazardous material, operated by remote control from behind a protective shield.\u201d This court has clarified in <em>Phillips </em>that dictionaries often lack the specific context relevant to the legal and technical ait of claim drafting and interpretation. <em>See Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1321. With that limitation on dictionary usages in mind, this court notes that these particular definitions bolster the conclusion that \u201cmanipulator\u201d is not a mere \u201cnonce word or a verbal construct,\u201d <em>Lighting World, </em>382 F.3d at 1360, but instead a noun connoting sufficient structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Duratech assigns great weight to many references in the specification in which the inventor describes \u201cmanipulation means,\u201d \u201cmeans for manipulating,\u201d or a \u201csupport and manipulation mechanism.\u201d This, however, ignores the fact that the '104 patent uses the word \u201cmanipulator\u201d numerous times in a manner that connotes structure. For example, \u201c[a]ny number of manipulator rollers are possible, however, the disintegrator is located between and below two of the manipulator rollers,\u201d '104 patent, Col. 1, 11. 31-34; \u201cOften, the result of this impeded rotation is that the teeth of the manipulator rollers tend to break the crop material bale apart ...\u201d <em>Id., </em>Col. 2, 11. 23-25; \u201cthe manipulator rollers 26 would continue to be rotatable in either direction, though clockwise would be their preferred direction of rotation,\u201d <em>Id., </em>Col. 6, 11. 22-24. These references in the specification further support a conclusion that this record does not contain enough evidence to rebut the strong presumption against means-plus-function treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Duratech further argues that means-plus-function treatment is appropriate here since Bridgeview, during prosecution, added the functional language \u201cfor driving the crop material into the disintegrator\u201d to claim l\u2019s \u201cmanipulator\u201d in order to obtain allowance over the prior art. To the contrary, the '104 patent\u2019s prosecution history does not carry such a preclusive meaning. Bridgeview\u2019s arguments to the Patent Office in the amendment which added the functional language served only to distinguish the \u201cdisintegrator\u201d and \u201cdischarge opening\u201d elements of claim 1 from a prior art Canadian reference. Nowhere in the file history did Bridgeview argue that the addition of functional language to the manipulator claim element distinguished the '104 invention from the Canadian reference. This court does not see any reason to limit the meaning of \u201cmanipulator\u201d based on an unrelated amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Thus, this court finds nothing to rebut the strong presumption against the application of means-plus-function treatment to the \u201cmanipulator\u201d claim term.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">In view of the intrinsic and extrinsic record, the district court erred in construing claim l\u2019s manipulator limitation as a means-plus-function element. Manipulator, as used in the '104 patent, is not a purely functional placeholder whose structure is filled in by the specification. Accordingly, this court vacates and remands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the district court\u2019s claim construction for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">VACATED-AND-REMANDED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
