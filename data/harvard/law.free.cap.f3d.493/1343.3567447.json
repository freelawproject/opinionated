The statute also provides benefits to public safety officers who are permanently disabled, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3796(b), and educational benefits to dependents of federal law enforcement officers who are killed or disabled in the line of duty, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3796d.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Congress has assigned administration of the benefit program to the Bureau of Justice Assistance (\u201cBJA\u201d), an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice. Prospective beneficiaries submit claims to the BJA, and the BJA determines, under regulations issued pursuant to statute, whether the decedent was a public safety officer who died under circumstances that entitle the beneficiaries to an award under the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a). Judicial review of the BJA\u2019s decisions is available in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Demutiis v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">This is a consolidated appeal from two decisions of the Court of Federal Claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number><em>Groff v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 68 (2006), and <em>LaBare v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 111 (2006). The two cases both involve challenges to BJA determinations denying death benefits to the relatives of pilots who were employed by private contractors and who died while rendering fire suppression assistance to public agencies. The BJA denied the claims for benefits. The BJA ruled that neither of the pilots was a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of PSOBA, because both were employees of private companies and therefore were not \u201cserving a public agency in an official capacity\u201d at the time of their deaths. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The Court of Federal Claims in the <em>Groff </em>case overturned the BJA\u2019s decision denying benefits, while the court in the <em>LaBare </em>case upheld the BJA\u2019s decision denying benefits. We hold that the BJA\u2019s decision should have been sustained in both cases. We therefore reverse the judgment in <em>Groff </em>and affirm the judgment in <em>LaBare.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Lawrence Groff was employed as a helicopter pilot by San Joaquin Helicopters, a private company based in California. San Joaquin Helicopters entered into a contract with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to provide piloting services for fire suppression missions. The contract provided that the company\u2019s employees \u201cshall act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of the State of California,\u201d that the company would indemnify California and maintain liability insurance for activities performed pursuant to the contract, and that the company would pay and provide benefits for the pilots who performed services under the contract. The aviation procedures handbook of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection states that \u201c[cjontractors must understand that they are acting in an independent capacity in the performance of their service, and not as an officer, employee, or agent of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">While piloting a helicopter pursuant to the contract, Mr. Groff died as a result of a mid-air collision with another aircraft. Following his death, Mr. Groffs wife and stepson, Christine Wells Groff and Michael Wells, applied for PSOBA benefits. The BJA determined that, as the employee of a government contractor, Mr. Groff did not satisfy the PSOBA definition of \u201cpublic safety officer,\u201d and it denied the claim. The claimants then requested and obtained a hearing at two additional levels of administrative review within the BJA, but the claim was denied at both levels. The hearing examiner and the Director of the BJA both wrote lengthy opinions explaining the reasons for the denial. In essence, both concluded, based on a legal position the BJA had \u25a0 adhered to for more than 20 years, that the employee of a private contractor does not qualify as a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of PSOBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The claimants then sought review of the BJA\u2019s decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The court held that the BJA\u2019s decision was erroneous and granted the claimants\u2019 motion for judgment on the administrative record, awarding them $250,000 in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The court noted that PSOBA defines a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d as \u201can individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(9)(A), and that in a 1981 policy directive, the BJA stated that in order \u201cto be serving a public agency in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>an official capacity, one must be an officer, employee, volunteer, or [in a] similar relationship of performing services as part of a public agency,\u201d and that to have such a relationship with a public agency, \u201can individual must be officially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of the public agency.\u201d Measuring Mr. Groff\u2019s service against that test, the court found that he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, but that he was in a \u201csimilar relationship of performing services as part of\u2019 the California agency and that he was \u201cofficially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of\u2019 that agency. Based on those findings and on the court\u2019s conclusion that the statute could not properly be construed to exclude all contract employees from coverage, the court held that the claimants were entitled to benefits based on Mr. Groffs death. The court therefore entered judgment for the plaintiffs for the death benefits payable under the PSOBA statute. The government has taken an appeal from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Craig LaBare was a pilot employed by Hawkins &amp; Powers Aviation, Inc., a private aviation service. Hawkins &amp; Powers Aviation entered into a contract with the U.S. Forest Service to provide airtankers for the suppression of fires. Under the contract, the company was responsible for aircraft equipment, maintenance, safety, and flight crews. The contract also stated that the company was required to obtain liability insurance and would \u201cbe responsible for all damage to property and to persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">While Mr. LaBare was piloting an air-tanker pursuant to the contract, the wings of his aircraft detached, causing a fatal crash. Following his death, his wife Laurie LaBare filed a claim for PSOBA benefits. The BJA denied the claim, on the grounds that Mr. LaBare, as the employee of a government contractor, was not a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d serving a public agency \u201cin an official capacity\u201d within the meaning of PSOBA. Like the claimants in the <em>Groff </em>case, Ms. LaBare obtained a hearing and two levels of review within the BJA, but her claim was rejected, first by a hearing examiner and then by the Director of the BJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Ms. LaBare sought review in the Court of Federal Claims. The court, acting through a different judge from the one assigned to the <em>Groff </em>case, affirmed the BJA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">The court in <em>LaBare </em>looked to whether the decision of the BJA denying Ms. La-Bare\u2019s claim was supported by substantial evidence. The court noted that the BJA defined the term \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d in PSOBA to exclude employees of private companies, even if they were killed while working with public agencies and engaged in fire suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">The court observed that PSOBA did not define what it means to be \u201cserving a public agency in an official capacity.\u201d Relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Chacon v. United States, </em>48 F.3d 508 (Fed.Cir.1995), the trial court held that the BJA\u2019s interpretation of the statute, as expressed in prior decisions of the agency and summarized in a BJA publication, is entitled to deference under the principles of <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Under the BJA\u2019s interpretation of the statute, in order to qualify as a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d the individual in question must be an \u201cofficer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>employee, volunteer, or similar relationship of performing services as a part of a public agency\u201d and must be \u201cofficially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of the public agency.\u201d In this case, the court concluded, substantial evidence supported the BJA\u2019s conclusion that Mr. LaBare, as an employee of a private contractor, was never officially recognized as a government employee or acknowledged as \u201cfunctionally\u201d a part of the Forest Service. The court therefore denied Ms. LaBare\u2019s claim for PSOBA benefits. Ms. LaBare has appealed from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">PSOBA provides that in any case in which the BJA \u201cdetermines, under regulations issued pursuant to [the statute], that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the [BJA] shall pay a benefit of $250,000.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a). PSOBA further provides that the BJA \u201cis authorized to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of [the statute]\u201d and that those rules, regulations, and procedures \u201cwill be determinative of conflict of laws issues arising under [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3796c.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Pursuant to that statutory authority, the BJA has promulgated regulations implementing the statute. The procedural regulations set up a mechanism for claimants to submit claims to the BJA and provide that claimants are entitled to representation in prosecuting their claims. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.22(a) (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations prescribe a three-stage process for adjudicating claims. First, following the claimant\u2019s submission of a claim and any evidence pertinent to the claim, the BJA makes a finding as to the proper disposition of the claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.23. If the finding is one of ineligibility, the BJA is required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">After notice of the BJA\u2019s finding of ineligibility, the claimant is entitled to ask the BJA for reconsideration. As part of the reconsideration proceeding, the claimant is entitled to a hearing before a hearing officer at which the claimant may introduce evidence. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24 (2006). Although the hearing is not governed by formal rules of procedure, the hearing officer is required to conduct the hearing \u201cin such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant\u201d and is required to \u201creceive such relevant evidence as may be introduced by the claimant and shall, in addition, receive such other evidence as the hearing officer may determine to be necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.\u201d The hearing is required to be recorded and a transcript prepared. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.24(c). Following the hearing, the hearing officer is required to make a determination of eligibility, setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the hearing officer\u2019s determination. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.24(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Following that determination, the claimant may request that the Director of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>BJA review the record and the hearing officer\u2019s determination; the Director may also conduct such a review on his or her own motion. At that point, the claimant may comment on the record and offer new evidence or argument. The Director is then required to make a final determination of eligibility, setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the Director\u2019s determination. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24(h), (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">As noted, the agency\u2019s final decision is subject to judicial review in the Court of Federal Claims and then in this court. The courts\u2019 review of the BJA\u2019s denial of a claim for death benefits is limited to three inquiries: (1) whether there has been substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations; (2) whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved; and (3) whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim. <em>Amber-Messick v. United States, </em>483 F.3d 1316, 1321 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>Chacon, </em>48 F.3d at 511. In the present cases, our review focuses on the first issue\u2014 whether the BJA complied with the statutory requirements and the governing regulations in denying the claims. In particular, we must assess whether the BJA acted lawfully when it determined that neither Mr. Groff nor Mr. LaBare was a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of PSO-BA and therefore that the claimants were not entitled to the statutory benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The government asserts that we are obligated to apply the standard of deference articulated in <em>Chevron </em>to the BJA\u2019s determination that a privately employed pilot under contract to render fire suppression assistance to a public agency is not a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of PSOBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The <em>Chevron </em>doctrine of judicial deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is based on the observation that \u201cthe power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created ... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, <em>quoting Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). As the Supreme Court stated recently, \u201cWhen an agency fills such a \u2018gap\u2019 reasonably, and in accordance with other applicable <em>(e.g., </em>procedural) requirements, the courts accept the result as legally binding.\u201d <em>Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2339, 2342, 168 L.Ed.2d 54 (2007). In <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-12\">administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for <em>Chevron </em>deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority. Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways, as by an agency\u2019s power to engage in adjudication or notiee-and-comment rulemak-ing, or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). The core issue in deciding whether <em>Chevron </em>deference is warranted is whether \u201cCongress meant to delegate to the agency the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>make determinations having the force of law.\u201d <em>Cathedral Candle Co. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>400 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>see also Long Island Care at Home, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2350; <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164; <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000). In <em>Mead, </em>the Court explained that its cases had recognized that a very good indicator of congressional intent to delegate lawmaking authority and trigger <em>Chevron </em>deference could be found in \u201cexpress congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.\u201d 533 U.S. at 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In PSOBA, Congress expressly authorized the BJA to \u201cdetermine! ], under regulations issued pursuant to [the Act], that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a), and to \u201cestablish such rules, regulations, and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of [the Act],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3796c(a). We have previously concluded that Congress\u2019s grant of that authority to the BJA reflects Congress\u2019s expectation that the BJA would \u201cbe able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law,\u201d <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164, and that the BJA\u2019s interpretations of the statutory terms accordingly should receive <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>Amber-Messick, </em>483 F.3d at 1323; <em>Chacon, </em>48 F.3d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The claimants attempt to distinguish <em>Amber-Messick </em>on the grounds that the dispute in that case turned on the interpretation of a regulation promulgated through traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking, and that the claimant did not challenge the applicability of <em>Chevron. </em>They distinguish <em>Chacon </em>on the ground that it was decided before the Supreme Court interpreted <em>Chevron </em>restrictively in <em>Mead </em>and <em>Christensen. </em>Those distinctions are unavailing. <em>Amber-Messick </em>and <em>Cha-con </em>are consistent with the principles of <em>Mead </em>and <em>Christensen. </em>While <em>Christensen </em>held that the procedural safeguards of notice-and-comment rulemaking are sufficient to establish that <em>Chevron </em>deference is appropriate, the Supreme Court in later cases has made clear that <em>Chevron </em>deference is not limited to formally promulgated regulations. See <em>Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 221-22, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002); <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 230-31, 121 S.Ct. 2164. Moreover, the BJA interpretation of PSOBA that was at issue in Amber-Messick\u2014the BJA\u2019s ruling that the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cfirefighter\u201d did not include a fourteen-year-old \u201capprentice firefighter\u201d who was prohibited from actively engaging in the suppression of fires\u2014was announced for the first time not through notice-and-comment rulemak-ing but in the adjudication of Ms. Amber-Messick\u2019s claim. In this case, we make explicit what was implicit in our prior decisions in <em>Chacon </em>and <em>Amber-Messick: </em>that Congress intended for the BJA\u2019s statutory interpretations announced through adjudication to have the force of law, and that those interpretations are therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Our conclusion in this regard is consistent with the analysis in <em>Pesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>1372 (Fed.Cir.2001), a post-Mead case in which we held that <em>Chevron </em>deference is due to the Department of Commerce\u2019s interpretation of ambiguous statutory terms articulated in the course of administrative antidumping determinations. In <em>Pesqu-era, </em>we held that an administrative anti-dumping proceeding is the kind of \u201crelatively formal administrative procedure\u201d that the Supreme Court in <em>Mead </em>characterized as qualifying for <em>Chevron </em>deference. 266 F.3d at 1380. In particular, the <em>Pesquera </em>court noted that Commerce\u2019s an-tidumping proceedings were relatively formal, that Congress delegated authority to Commerce to review and determine the amount of any antidumping duty, that the proceeding before Commerce was subject to judicial review based on the administrative record, and that Commerce considered its administrative determinations to be precedential.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Essentially the same factors are present with regard to administrative adjudications before the BJA. First, Congress has expressly delegated to the BJA the duty to determine, pursuant to PSOBA and the BJA\u2019s regulations, whether a public safety officer has died or become disabled as a result of a personal injury suffered in the line of duty and to make various adjustments in the benefit payments. The statute expressly authorized the BJA to issue regulations governing the representation of claimants in claims proceedings before the BJA; it authorized the BJA to use appropriated funds to conduct appeals of death and disability claims; it empowered the BJA to use administrative and investigative assistance from state and local agencies in making its determinations; and it provided that responsibility for making final determinations would rest with the BJA and that the BJA\u2019s rules, regulations, and procedures would be determinative of all conflicts of laws arising under the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796c. The statute thus contemplates the creation by reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>ulation of an administrative process of some complexity, involving investigative actions, findings of fact, the determination and application of legal standards, the creation of administrative appeal proceedings, and the exercise of a degree of discretion as to adjustments and interim payments of benefits. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress contemplated that the BJA would use the process of adjudicating claims to make those legal determinations that would be necessary to fill gaps in the statutory standards. <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424-25, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Second, as the statute appears to contemplate, the administrative procedure that the BJA has created for adjudicating PSOBA claims is relatively formal. As noted, the claimant has a right to pursue the claim through three administrative stages. The claimant has a right to representation throughout and has a right to a full evidentiary hearing before a hearing examiner at the second stage. At each stage the BJA is required to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law to explain its decision. The final stage is a proceeding before the Director of the BJA. Like the antidumping proceeding at issue in <em>Pesquera, </em>the adjudicative proceeding in PSOBA claim cases is formal and culminates in a formal written decision by the head of the agency, not a nonbinding disposition by a low-level agency official. <em>See Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 233-34, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Third, as has been recognized for more than 20 years, the BJA\u2019s decisions on PSOBA benefit claims are subject to review in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Demutiis, </em>291 F.3d at 1376; <em>Wydra v. Law Enforcement Assistance Admin, </em>722 F.2d 834, 837 (D.C.Cir.1983). That review is conducted based on the administrative record. <em>See, e.g., Yanco v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Chacon, </em>48 F.3d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Fourth, the BJA treats at least some of its decisions on issues arising under the statute as creating precedents that govern later decisions in similar cases. This is such an instance, as the BJA\u2019s decision in this case is predicated on a 1980 administrative decision in which the BJA\u2019s predecessor agency denied a claim by the survivor of a contract pilot who died while engaged in firefighting in support of a federal agency. The 1980 decision, moreover, is codified along with other administrative determinations in a BJA document entitled <em>Legal Interpretations of the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act, </em>which the BJA relies on and which has been cited as precedent by this court. <em>See Chacon, </em>48 F.3d at 512. The administrative record thus reflects that the BJA\u2019s position with respect to contract employees is one of longstanding duration and that the agency has given the question \u201ccareful consideration ... over a long period of time,\u201d which supports the conclusion that <em>\u201cChevron </em>provides the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the Agency interpretation here at issue.\u201d <em>Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. at 222, 122 S.Ct. 1265. In sum, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Mead and <em>Barnhart, </em>this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Chacon </em>and <em>Amber-Messick, </em>and the analysis of this court in an analogous setting in <em>Pesquera, </em>we hold that the adjudicative determinations that Congress contemplated that the BJA would conduct are sufficiently formal to be entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Our inquiry under the <em>Chevron </em>standard is twofold. First, we must deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>mine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. But \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The precise issue in this case is whether the term \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d as used in the statute includes privately employed pilots such as Mr. LaBare and Mr. Groff who render fire suppression assistance pursuant to contracts between their employers and public agencies. The Act defines \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d as \u201can individual serving a public agency in an official capacity, with or without compensation, as a law enforcement officer, as a firefighter, as a chaplain, or as a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(9)(A). Congress did not further define what it means to serve \u201cin an official capacity,\u201d leaving the statute silent as to whether contract pilots fall within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The BJA, however, has addressed the question several times since the enactment of the statute. The issue appears to have first arisen in the 1980 case referenced above, which involved a claim filed by the widow of a contract pilot, Mr. Holstine, who died while participating in California Department of Forestry firefighting operations. The BJA\u2019s predecessor agency construed the term \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d using the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\">In order to be serving a public agency in an official capacity one must be an officer, employee, volunteer, or similar relationship of performing services as part of a public agency. To have such a relationship with a public agency, an individual must be officially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of the public agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics, <em>Legal Interpretations of the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act </em>9 (1981) (reprinting the <em>Holstine </em>decision). The LEAA concluded that the pilot, by virtue of being the employee of a government contractor, did not have such a relationship to the agency. In resolving the claims at issue in the <em>Groff </em>and <em>LaBare </em>cases, the BJA followed that precedent and again concluded that contract pilots rendering fire suppression assistance to public agencies are not serving in an official capacity within the meaning of PSOBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">We hold that the BJA\u2019s interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute. As we observed in <em>Amber-Messick, </em>the drafters of PSOBA were concerned with ensuring that both volunteer and public employee firefighters were included within the scope of the Act. See <em>Amber-Messick, </em>483 F.3d at 1324. It was reasonable for the BJA to conclude that Congress intended for the phrase \u201cin an official capacity\u201d to capture those groups while excluding privately employed individuals. Moreover, the legislative history confirms that this is, at a minimum, a plausible interpretation of the statute. The Act\u2019s sponsor in the House of Representatives, Representative Eilberg, stated that the bill would not apply to \u201cprivately employed safety and security officers,\u201d both as a general matter and in the particular scenario in which those officers \u201cwere called by a local arm of the government or the local police organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>to assist in any way.\u201d 122 Cong. Rec. 12,002, 12,009 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201c[t]he remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history,\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979), and we do not suggest that the quoted remark is conclusive evidence of the statute\u2019s scope. Nevertheless, it is difficult to reconcile Representative Eil-berg\u2019s statement with the claimants\u2019 assertion that the congressional intent to include privately employed individuals within PSOBA\u2019s coverage is so clear as to make the BJA\u2019s interpretation unsustainable under <em>Chevron. </em>At a minimum, the legislative history reinforces the notion that the statutory text is open to the interpretation adopted by the BJA in its adjudicative determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The claimants suggest that the issue in these cases should be characterized as whether Congress manifested an intent to exclude contract firefighters, rather than an intent to include them within PSOBA\u2019s coverage. Such a semantic distinction, however, does not alter the analysis. Absent some indication otherwise, \u201cCongress\u2019 silence is just that\u2014silence.\u201d <em>Cmty. for Creative Novr-Violence v. Reid, </em>490 U.S. 730, 749, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989), quoting <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, </em>480 U.S. 678, 686, 107 S.Ct. 1476, 94 L.Ed.2d 661 (1987). Here, Congress has expressed neither an unambiguous intention to include nor an unambiguous intention to exclude the employees of contractors from the Act\u2019s coverage. Because the statute is silent on that issue, and because the BJA\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, we must defer to the agency\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The claimants further contend that in denying the claims in these cases the BJA has misapplied its own criteria for awarding benefits. Even accepting as reasonable the BJA\u2019s definition of serving \u201cin an official capacity,\u201d as first articulated in <em>Holstine, see Chacon, </em>48 F.3d at 512, the claimants argue that Mr. LaBare and Mr. Groff were each \u201cofficially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of\u2019 public agencies, as those terms were used in <em>Holstine. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The claimants cite several facts in support of their argument. In Mr. LaBare\u2019s case, his piloting activity was governed by numerous federal regulations and guidelines that provide protocols for missions and base operations. Contract pilots required Forest Service approval and were obligated to comply with the same Forest Service guidelines applicable to government pilots. And after Mr. LaBare\u2019s death, the Forest Service submitted a report to the BJA that listed the Forest Service as Mr. LaBare\u2019s employer. Similarly, Mr. Groff was subject to pre-approval by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and he operated under the auspices of both state and federal regulations as well. After Mr. Groffs death, the California agency issued an opinion in which it stated that he was an officially recognized member of that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>The undisputed facts, however, show that both Mr. LaBare and Mr. Groff were hired, paid, and subject to termination by their private employers. The contract between the California agency and San Joaquin Helicopters required the company to maintain liability insurance for its activities and stated that contract pilots such as Mr. Groff \u201cshall act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of the State of California.\u201d Similarly, the contract between Hawkins &amp; Powers Aviation and the Forest Service required the company to obtain liability insurance and maintain responsibility for \u201call damage to property and to persons.\u201d The BJA reasonably concluded that neither the government regulation and oversight nor the post-mortem statements of the Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection transformed Mr. LaBare and Mr. Groff from contract pilots into government employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Moreover, the <em>Holstine </em>definition was an explicit restatement of the conclusion that privately employed contract pilots did not serve public agencies \u201cin an official capacity.\u201d It does not give due respect to the administrative interpretation of the statute to say that the rule formulated by the agency does not apply to the very fact pattern for which the rule was designed. The BJA consistently applied its own rule when it concluded that, as employees of government contractors, Mr. LaBare and Mr. Groff were not public safety officers within the meaning of PSOBA. To uphold the BJA\u2019s legal interpretation of the PSO-BA statute means that contract pilots cannot be treated as \u201cserving a public agency in an official capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment in Groff is reversed and the judgment in <em>LaBare </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs for these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">\n<em>No.2006-5U1, REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">\n<em>No.2007-5006, AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. In August 2006, BJA promulgated new regulations that made some changes in the procedures for administrative review of PSOBA claims. <em>See </em>71 Fed.Reg. 46,028 (Aug. 10, 2006). Those regulations were not in effect at the time that the agency decided these cases. We cite to the former version of the procedural regulations in this opinion, not the version of the regulations incorporating the August 2006 changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. We do not rest our decision to apply the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine in this case on the BJA's regulations or its interpretation of its regulations. To be sure, the BJA had a regulation in effect at the time of the administrative proceedings in these cases that defined the term \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d in terms that tracked the statutory language. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>\u00a7 32.2(j) (2002) (\"Public safety officer means any individual serving a public agency in an official capacity, with or without compensation, as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, rescue squad member or ambulance crew member.\u201d). While an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is normally entitled to substantial deference, <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461-63, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997), the <em>Auer </em>standard does not apply when the regulation \u201cdoes little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006). \u201d[\u2019T|he existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question ... is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For that reason, we do not base our decision on the fact that the BJA promulgated such a \"parroting\u201d regulation and interpreted it to exclude contract employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">We also do not rest our decision on the revised version of the BJA's regulations, adopted in August 2006, which provide more detailed guidance as to the meaning of the statutory term \"public safety officer.\u201d The revised regulation, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.3 (effective Sept. 11, 2006), reflects the BJA\u2019s earlier adjudicative determinations and makes clear that contract employees such as Mr. Groff and Mr. LaBare would not be regarded as public safety officers within the meaning of the statute. However, the government did not argue that the new regulation could serve as a basis for upholding the BJA's determinations in these cases, and at oral argument the government expressly declined to rely on the new regulation. Accordingly, we do not rely on that regulation as the basis for our decision, although we note that the Supreme Court has held that legal positions taken in properly promulgated regulations are entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference even if the regulations are promulgated after the administrative decision in question, and indeed even if they are promulgated in response to the very litigation that is under review. <em>See Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., </em>517 U.S. 735, 740-41, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996); <em>United States v. Morton, </em>467 U.S. 822, 836 n. 21, 104 S.Ct. 2769, 81 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-5\">. Representative Eilberg\u2019s statement was made during the debate on a version of the bill that applied only to law enforcement officers, before it was merged with a companion bill covering firefighters. The statement is nevertheless informative, because the bill at that time contained the relevant \"in an official capacity\u201d language. <em>See </em>122 Cong.
