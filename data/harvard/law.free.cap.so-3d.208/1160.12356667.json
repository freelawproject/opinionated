Wesson\u2019s sentence was suspended and he was ordered to serve 24 months of unsupervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">Wesson was indicted for first-degree sodomy, <em>see </em>13A-6-63, Ala. Code 1975, for engaging in deviate sexual intercourse with a woman by forcible compulsion, and for sexual misconduct, <em>see </em>\u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3), Ala.Code 1975, for engaging in deviate sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances other than those covered by Alabama\u2019s sodomy statutes. On April 1, 2014, Wesson moved the circuit court to dismiss the count charging him with sexual misconduct. In his motion, Wesson asserted that, under the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), sexual misconduct as defined in \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3), Ala.Code 1975, is unconstitutional as applied to him. Wesson did not argue in his motion to dismiss that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3), Ala.Code 1975, is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">On April 2, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing on Wesson\u2019s motion to dismiss. During the hearing, Wesson reasserted the argument raised in his motion. He did not, however, present any evidence indicating that his conduct was protected under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lawrence. </em>After hearing Wesson\u2019s argument, the circuit court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">Thereafter, Wesson, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct. In exchange for his guilty plea, the State agreed to nolle pros the first-degree-sodomy charge. Further, Wesson reserved the right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the sexual-misconduct charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">On appeal, Wesson argues that, under <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>\u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3), Ala. Code 1975, is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to him. According to Wesson, \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) criminalizes deviate sexual intercourse between consenting adults; therefore, it is both facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to him. Wesson then argues that, because \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) is unconstitutional, his conviction must be reversed. This Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">To the extent Wesson argues that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) is unconstitutional on its face, his argument is not preserved for appellate review. It is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUNU\">\u201c \u2018[rjeview on appeal is restricted to questions and issues properly and timely raised at trial.\u2019 <em>Newsome v. State, </em>570 So.2d 703, 717 (Ala.Crim.App.1989). \u2018An issue raised for the first time on appeal is not subject to appellate review because it has not been properly preserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>and presented.\u2019 <em>Pate v. State, </em>601 So.2d 210, 213 (Ala.Crim.App.1992). \u2018\u201c[T]o preserve an issue for appellate review, it must be presented to the trial court by a timely and specific motion setting out the specific grounds in support thereof.\u2019\u201d <em>McKinney v. State, </em>654 So.2d 95, 99 (Ala.Crim.App.1995) (citation omitted). \u2018The statement of specific grounds of objection waives all grounds not specified, and the trial court will not be put in error on grounds not assigned at trial.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Frith, </em>526 So.2d 880, 882 (Ala.1987). \u2018The purpose of requiring a specific objection to preserve an issue for appellate review is to put the trial judge on notice of the alleged error, giving an opportunity to correct it before the case is submitted to the jury.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Works, </em>640 So.2d 1056, 1058 (Ala.1994).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfEJ\"><em>Ex parte Coulliette, </em>857 So.2d 793, 794-95 (Ala.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">In his motion to dismiss and at the hearing on that motion, Wesson asserted that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) was unconstitutional as applied to him. He did not, however, challenge \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) as facially unconstitutional. Consequently, Wesson\u2019s argument that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) is unconstitutional on its face is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review and does not entitle him to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Further, Wesson failed to meet his burden of establishing that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) is unconstitutional as applied to him. In his brief, Wesson argues: \u201cThe Sexual Misconduct statute is a clear violation of Mr. Wesson\u2019s right to privacy and Due Process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, to engage in private <em>consensual sexual relations </em>with another <em>consenting adult.\u201d </em>(Wesson\u2019s brief, at 8; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">It is well settled that a person challenging the constitutionality of a statute as applied to him \u201cbears the burden of proving that [the statute] is unconstitutional as applied to his conduct.\u201d <em>Powell v. State, </em>72 So.3d 1268, 1278 (Ala.Crim.App.2011). The Texas Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-8\">\u201cA statute may be found unconstitutional \u2018as applied\u2019 to a specific set of facts or \u2018on its face.\u2019 <em>See Scott v. State, </em>322 S.W.3d 662, 665 n. 1 (Tex.Crim.App.2010); <em>Bynum v. State, </em>767 S.W.2d 769, 773 (Tex.Crim.App.1989). Generally, a defendant must show that a statute is unconstitutional \u2018as applied\u2019 to the conduct for which he was charged. <em>See id. </em>at 774. A claim that a statute is unconstitutional \u2018as applied\u2019 is a claim that the statute operates unconstitutionally with respect to the claimant because of his particular circumstances. <em>Gillenwaters v. State, </em>205 S.W.3d 534, 536 n. 3 (Tex.Crim.App.2006).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\"><em>State v. Johnson, </em>425 S.W.3d 542, 545 (Tex.App.2014). Accordingly, this Court has held that, without evidence or some factual basis in the record, it cannot hold that an appellant has met his burden to establish that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him. <em>State v. Woodruff, </em>460 So.2d 325, 330 (Ala.Crim.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">Wesson pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3), which provides: \u201cA person commits the crime of sexual misconduct if ... [h]e or she engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person under circumstances other than those covered by Sections 13A-6-63 and 13A-6-64. Consent is no defense to a prosecution under this subdivision.\u201d Section 13A-6-60(2), Ala.Code 1975, defines \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d as \u201c[a]ny act of sexual gratification between persons not married to each other involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-11\">\u201cIn <em>Lawrence[ v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558 (2003)], ... the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>Court considered the constitutionality of a Texas statute that provided: \u2018A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.\u2019 Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.06(a) (2003). Another Texas statute defined \u2018deviate sexual intercourse\u2019 as \u2018any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person.\u2019 Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.01(1)(A). The Supreme Court concluded that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and that it \u2018further[ed] no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\u2019 <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 579, 123 S.Ct. 2472.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>184 So.3d 1064, 1069 (Ala.Crim.App.2015). The Supreme Court in <em>Lawrence, </em>however, held only that \u201c \u2018statutory prohibitions on <em>consensual sodomy </em>... are unconstitutional because they infringe upon the rights of \u201cadults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>184 So.3d at 1070 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Doe v. Pryor, </em>344 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2003), quoting in turn <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 564. Section 13A-6-65(a)(3) criminalizes not only consensual deviate sexual intercourse, but also criminalizes other circumstances in which a person engages in deviate sexual intercourse, such as when the act results from fraud, artifice, or extortion. Thus, in an as-applied challenge to \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) the defendant must establish that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to his conduct, i.e., he must establish that he engaged in consensual deviate sexual intercourse. <em>Cf. Woodruff, </em>460 So.2d at 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">The record in this case fails to show that Wesson\u2019s conduct falls within the conduct protected under <em>Lawrence. </em>Specifically, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Wesson engaged in <em>consensual </em>deviate sexual intercourse. Because there is no indication in the record that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lawrence </em>prohibits prosecution for Wesson\u2019s conduct, Wesson failed to meet his burden of establishing that \u00a7 13A-6-65(a)(3) is unconstitutional as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1235-10\">WELCH, BURKE, and JOINER, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b1235-11\">KELLUM, J., concurs in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
