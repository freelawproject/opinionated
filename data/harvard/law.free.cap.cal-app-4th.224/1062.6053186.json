Such a judgment is not a \u201cdismissal\u201d against plaintiffs for which mandatory relief applies. We also remand this matter to the trial court for its consideration of discretionary relief under section 473(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">In June 2007, plaintiffs Anthony H. Noceti and Carol L. Noceti entered into a purchase agreement with defendant Rex R. Whorton to buy his interest in approximately 109 acres of land near Stockton. When defendant allegedly did not complete the purchase agreement, plaintiffs sued him for specific performance and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">In October 2009, the trial court granted a default judgment against defendant based on plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof. In April 2011, defendant moved successfully to set aside this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Trial was set thereafter for October 3, 2011. Although properly notified of this trial date, plaintiffs and their counsel did not appear. Defendant did, however, and moved the trial court for judgment. The court \u201creviewed the entire file\u201d and granted judgment for defendant in the amount of \u201c$0 principal, $0 pre-judgment interest, $0 attorney fees and $0 costs.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel subsequently moved to set aside this judgment pursuant to section 473(b); that is the motion at issue in this appeal. The motion included counsel\u2019s declaration explaining he erroneously calendared the trial date for October 10, 2011, because of \u201cserious chronic health problems\u201d and \u201cthe loss of [his] secretary.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was unable even to appear at the section 473(b) hearing due to the effects of a recent chemotherapy treatment (plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had cancer, eventually succumbing to it).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>After reviewing the documentary evidence and the arguments of both parties (plaintiffs appeared without counsel present), the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 section 473(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Plaintiffs then retained new counsel and timely filed this appeal in June 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">I. Section 473(b)\u2019s Mandatory Relief Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in refusing to grant section 473(b) mandatory relief from the judgment entered against them, because that judgment was tantamount to a \u201cdismissal\u201d within the meaning of section 473(b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The mandatory relief provision of section 473(b) provides, as pertinent, \u201cNotwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court <em>shall, </em>whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney\u2019s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting <em>default </em>entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting <em>default judgment or dismissal </em>entered against his or her client . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">In contrast, the discretionary relief provision of section 473(b) states, as relevant, \u201cThe court <em>may, </em>upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from <em>a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding </em>taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or <em>excusable </em>neglect. Application for this relief . . . shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">The issue here is whether the judgment entered against plaintiffs is tantamount to a \u201cdismissal\u201d under section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory relief provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Several decisions, including many from this court, have interpreted narrowly the word \u201cdismissal\u201d in section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory provision\u2014as applying only when a plaintiff\u2019s attorney fails to respond to a dismissal motion. The basic reasons for this narrow construction are threefold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-14\">First, the language of section 473(b), including the statute\u2019s structure and the dichotomous nature of the relief it affords, discretionary versus mandatory: The discretionary provision applies to \u201ca judgment, dismissal, order, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>other proceeding taken against\u201d a party, while the mandatory provision applies <em>only </em>to a \u201cdefault entered by the [court] clerk,\u201d or a resulting \u201cdefault judgment or dismissal.\u201d Such a \u201cdefault\u201d means only a defendant\u2019s failure to answer a complaint and a \u201cdefault judgment\u201d means only a judgment entered after such failure; so, too, then, \u201cdismissal\u201d must be the procedural equivalent of such a default\u2014i.e., a plaintiff failing to respond to a dismissal motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">Second, section 473(b)\u2019s history: The Legislature, as a matter of fairness, amended the mandatory provision of section 473(b) to add \u201cdismissal,\u201d so as to put plaintiffs on equal footing with defendants who are defaulted for failing to respond to an action (see Historical and Statutory Notes, 15 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (2014 supp.) foil. \u00a7 473, p. 25);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">And, third, the need to harmonize section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory relief with the discretionary dismissal delay statutes (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 583.410 et seq.): Since nearly every discretionary dismissal\u2014for example, failure to timely serve a complaint, or failure to timely bring a case to trial\u2014is caused by the mistake, inadvertence or neglect of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, a broad reading of section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory relief provision involving dismissals would absurdly abrogate the discretionary dismissal delay statutes by implication. (See, e.g., <em>Vandermoon </em>v. <em>Sanwong </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 315, 320-321 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 772] ('Vandermoon); <em>English </em>v. <em>IKON Business Solutions, Inc. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 141-148 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 93] (English); <em>Peltier v. McCloud River R.R. Co. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1809, 1816-1817, 1824 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 182] (Peltier); see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 196, pp. 800-801, and cases cited therein; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2013 supp.) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 196, p. 77, and cases cited therein.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Two decisions have considered section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory relief provision in the context, as here, of a party who fails to appear for trial (or a trial-like proceeding): one from this court, <em>Vandermoon, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th 315, and the other from Division Four of the Second Appellate District, <em>Yeap </em>v. <em>Leake </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 591 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] <em>(Yeap).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In <em>Vandermoon, </em>we concluded that a properly noticed <em>defendant who failed to appear for trial </em>was not entitled to section 473(b) mandatory relief from a judgment entered for the plaintiff who appeared and presented the evidence supporting his case. Such a judgment was not a default or a default judgment within the meaning of the mandatory provision of section 473(b)\u2014it was a judgment following an uncontested trial. <em>(Vandermoon, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at pp. 317-321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Leap\u2019s facts are nearly our facts. There, the <em>plaintiff and her counsel failed to attend a judicial arbitration </em>and the arbitrator rendered a judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>\u201c$0.\u201d <em>(Yeap, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 595.) The majority in <em>Yeap </em>concluded the plaintiff was entitled to section 473(b) mandatory relief: \u201cthe judgment entered . . . was analogous to a default because it came about as a result of [plaintiff\u2019s and counsel\u2019s] failure to appear and litigate at the arbitration hearing.\u201d <em>(Yeap, </em>at p. 601.) The dissent in <em>Yeap </em>concluded there was no default, and no dismissal either\u2014i.e., no withdrawal of an application for judicial relief by the party seeking such relief, nor the removal of such an application by the court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 603-604 (dis. opn. of Epstein, Acting P. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In <em>English, </em>we disagreed with the <em>Yeap </em>majority and agreed with the <em>Yeap </em>dissent. <em>(English, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at pp. 144, 147-148.) We characterized the <em>Yeap </em>majority\u2019s section 473(b) conclusion that the judgment there was analogous to a default as an \u201cunwarranted, expansive interpretation of the mandatory provision of section 473(b) based on statements taken out of context\u201d from our <em>Peltier </em>decision. <em>(English, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Interestingly, the very same appellate district and division (Second Appellate District, Division Four) that decided <em>Yeap </em>has now all but repudiated that decision\u2019s broad interpretation of section 473(b)\u2019s mandatory provision and agreed with the narrow interpretation this court advanced in <em>English. (Hossain </em>v. <em>Hossain </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 454, 456, 458 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 356] [holding that \u00a7 473(b)\u2019s mandatory provision does not apply to an attorney\u2019s failure to timely file opposition to a motion to enforce a settlement; it must also be noted that Justice Epstein, who dissented in <em>Yeap, </em>authored <em>Hossain, </em>persuading two colleagues who had not sat on the <em>Yeap </em>matter].)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">That brings us to the present matter. Here, plaintiffs and their counsel did not fail to respond to a dismissal motion. Instead, they failed to appear for trial because the attorney miscalendared the trial date. Defendant moved for judgment. In considering defendant\u2019s request for judgment, the trial court \u201creviewed the entire file,\u201d which included plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for specific performance and breach of contract, defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint, the legal description of the property in question (exhibit A to complaint), and the purchase agreement and initial escrow instructions (exhibit B to complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The record does not indicate the trial court granted judgment for defendant, let alone a dismissal, simply because plaintiffs failed to appear for trial. The trial court considered the \u201centire file\u201d and entered a judgment for defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>as stated in the accompanying minute order, of \u201c$0 principal, $0 prejudgment interest, $0 attorney fees and $0 costs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In light of all we have said above, we must reject plaintiffs\u2019 broad reading of the section 473(b) mandatory provision in the context presented here. We conclude the judgment at issue was not tantamount to a \u201cdismissal\u201d within the meaning of that mandatory provision\u2014it was a judgment for defendant following an uncontested trial. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying plaintiffs mandatory relief from this judgment under section 473(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">II. Section 473(b)\u2019s Discretionary Relief Provision<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The order denying plaintiffs\u2019 section 473(b) motion to set aside the judgment is affirmed regarding mandatory relief and reversed to the extent it denied (or failed to consider) discretionary relief. The matter is remanded to the trial court for its consideration of whether plaintiffs are entitled to section 473(b) discretionary relief and, depending upon that determination, appropriate proceedings related thereto. Plaintiffs are awarded their costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Robie, Acting P. J., and Mauro, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\"> Upon defendant\u2019s postjudgment motion for determination of prevailing party and request for attorney fees, the trial court awarded attorney fees in the amount of $19,425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\"> While we recognize the present case differs from <em>Vandermoon </em>in that defendant did not have the burden of proof and did not present witnesses at trial, the record supports the conclusion that the trial court considered the merits of the case before ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1062.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
