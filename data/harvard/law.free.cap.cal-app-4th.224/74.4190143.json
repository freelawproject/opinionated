The trial court held \u201cno\u201d in a wrongful death negligence lawsuit brought by the child\u2019s mother, plaintiff Melina Johnson. The trial court also found no triable issues of fact with respect to breach of any duty and causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">We reverse the judgment as to the homeowners. We hold as a matter of law that the homeowners here, who knowingly rented a home with a maintained pool, owed a duty of reasonable care to the four-year-old boy to protect him from drowning in the pool. We further hold there are triable issues of fact as to whether, one, the homeowners breached that duty by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>failing to install a fence around the perimeter of the pool or a self-closing or self-latching mechanism on the only door leading from the house to the pool and, two, whether any such breach was a substantial factor in bringing about the child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We affirm the judgment as to Century 21. Plaintiff\u2019s only allegation in her complaint against the property management company was that it negligently \u201cfailed to ensure that the premises met safety code prior to renting the premises to the public.\u201d And on appeal, plaintiff admits that defendants were exempt from complying with the only \u201csafety code\u201d anyone has identified because of the time the pool was built.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The homeowners bought a house with an in-ground backyard swimming pool in 2000. The pool was built in 1976 or 1977 and complied with state and local ordinances at that time. The homeowners did not alter the pool. Around the perimeter of the property was a six-foot wooden fence that prevented access to the backyard. The only direct access from the house to the pool was through the kitchen. That access was through a sliding glass door with a security gate over it. The security gate did not have a self-closing mechanism. Since 2009, the house was managed for the homeowners by Century 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In June 2009, Tomica Johnson and her son Brandon Johnson (both of whom are unrelated to plaintiff) rented the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">On June 28, 2009, Allen\u2019s grandmother (Michelle Volpi, who was named as a defendant in the trial court) and the grandmother\u2019s husband took Allen to a get-together at the house. When they got there, Allen\u2019s father (Andre Soucy, who was Volpi\u2019s son, and who was also named as a defendant in the trial court) was already there, as were a number of other people, including children. They all went in the pool. Eventually, everyone' got out. The grandmother went inside the house and did not close the security gate or the sliding glass door behind her because others were still coming in. Allen also went inside the house. At some point, the grandmother lost track of Allen. As it turns out, Allen had gone outside the house to the backyard. When he was discovered, he was at the bottom of the pool. Allen was kept alive on a ventilator for 19 days and then died.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Allen\u2019s mother filed a lawsuit for wrongful death, alleging the grandmother and father were negligent in supervising Allen, the homeowners were negligent in failing to properly fence the pool or otherwise protect a child from accidently falling into the pool, and Century 21 was negligent in \u201cfailing] to ensure that the premises met safety code prior to renting the premises to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The homeowners and Century 21 answered and later moved for summary judgment. As to Century 21, defendants argued that \u201cthe allegations that the swimming pool does not conform to the applicable swimming pool safety code provisions fail as a matter of law. The evidence is that the property and the swimming pool fully . . . complied with the applicable statutes and ordinances.\u201d Moreover, they argue they did not owe a duty to Allen and his mother to exercise due care, they did not breach any duty because there was no dangerous condition on the property, and even if there was, they had no notice of a dangerous condition, and they did not cause the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The trial court granted the summary judgment motion. The court reasoned that homeowners and Century 21 \u201chad no duty to inspect the premises\u201d; \u201cthere was no reason to expect children to be playing in the pool\u201d; \u201cthe pool was not a \u2018nuisance\u2019 or an unreasonably dangerous condition of property\u201d; \u201cnothing these defendants did or failed to do created any type of dangerous condition or in any way contributed to this accident\u201d; there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the conduct of the homeowners and Century 21 was a cause in fact of the drowning; and \u201c[e]ven the security gate and sliding glass door could not have been involved in this accident, since they were left open on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The trial court then entered judgment in favor of homeowners and Century 21. Plaintiff timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor because defendants owed a duty of care to maintain the pool in a reasonably safe condition and because there were triable issues of fact as to whether defendants breached that duty and were a cause of injury here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u201cThe elements of a cause of action for negligence are duty, breach, causation, and damages.\u201d <em>(Melton v. Boustred </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 529 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 481].) We consider the first three elements in turn, in view of plaintiff\u2019s contentions above and the trial court\u2019s finding that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>matter of law, defendants owed no duty of care to Allen, there was no breach of any duty toward him, and none of defendants\u2019 actions caused injury to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In doing so, we keep in mind the following standard of review: \u201cOn appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted, we review the record de novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained. [Citation.] Under California\u2019s traditional rules, we determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiffs case, or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial, such that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>The Homeowners Owed a Duty of Care to Plaintiff Vis-a-vis Her Son as a Matter of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u201c[T]he basic policy of this state set forth by the Legislature in section 1714 of the Civil Code is that everyone is responsible for an injury caused to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 118-119 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561] <em>(Rowland).) </em>Thus, \u201c[generally, a landowner has a duty to maintain the land in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d <em>(Sturgeon v. Curnutt </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 301, 306 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 498].) \u201cThe existence of the landlord\u2019s duty to others to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Here, the question we must answer as a matter of law is whether the homeowners owed four-year-old Allen a duty of reasonable care to protect him from drowning in a swimming pool at a house they rented to tenants. \u201cIn determining a duty\u2019s existence and scope, our precedents call for consideration of several factors: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Castaneda v. Olsher </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1205, 1213 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 99, 162 P.3d 610], quoting <em>Rowland, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 113.) \u201cForeseeability and the extent of the burden to the defendant are ordinarily the crucial considerations, but in a given case one or more of the other <em>Rowland </em>factors may be determinative of the duty analysis.\u201d <em>(Castaneda, </em>at p. 1213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">We begin, then, with foreseeability of harm to plaintiff vis-a-vis her four-year-old, Allen. In finding no duty, the trial court reasoned, \u201cthere was no reason to expect children to be playing in the pool.\u201d This conclusion ignored the facts of this case and the realities of pools and children. The lease agreement specifically mentioned maintenance of the pool, assigned that burden to the \u201clandlord,\u201d and stated \u201ctenant was to allow access.\u201d Thus, the homeowners knew a maintained pool was included with rental of the house. A reasonable expectation was that people, including children, use a maintained pool. It was also a reasonable expectation that children, especially young children, approach pools, regardless of their capacity to swim, thus' exposing themselves to the danger of drowning. \u201cIt is a matter of common experience that children of tender years are guided in their actions by childish instincts, and are lacking in that discretion which is ordinarily sufficient to enable those of more mature years to appreciate and avoid danger, and in proportion to this lack of judgment on their part, the care which must be observed toward them by others is increased.\u201d <em>(Barrett </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1891) 91 Cal. 296, 302-303 [27 P. 666].) Where the homeowners knew they were renting out a house with a maintained pool, it was foreseeable that children would be on the property. It was also foreseeable that children would approach the pool, regardless of their capacity to swim, thus exposing themselves to the danger of drowning. Thus, the foreseeability of harm to a young child such as Allen weighed in favor of imposing a duty of care on the homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We next discuss the other \u201cordinarily . . . crucial consideration[]\u201d <em>(Castaneda </em>v. <em>Olsher, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1213), namely, the \u201cextent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach\u201d <em>(Rowland, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 113). Although this factor was not discussed by the trial court, the trial court did discuss a statute that we find informs this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In holding that defendants were not negligent per se in failing to fence the pool or install a self-closing or self-latching mechanism on the door, the trial court noted that defendants did not violate the Swimming Pool Safety Act as codified in Health and Safety Code section 115922 (added by Stats. 1996, ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>925, \u00a7 3, p. 5265). The statute requires (subject to certain exceptions) that a new or remodeled pool or spa at a private, single-family home be equipped with at least one of seven enumerated drowning prevention safety features.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute applies only to the <em>\u201cconstruction of a new </em>swimming pool or spa, or any building permit [that] is issued for <em>remodeling </em>of an existing pool or spa, at a private, single-family home.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 115922, subd. (a), italics added.) Here, the homeowners bought the house with the pool in 2000 and had not \u201crepaired, rebuilt, remodeled, or otherwise altered the pool\u201d since then. Although these facts make it such that the homeowners were exempt from complying with the statute, the existence of this statute informs the extent of burden to the homeowners and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">By requiring at least one drowning prevention safety feature on newly constructed or remodeled pools and spas in single-family homes, the Swimming Pool Safety Act reflects the policy of this state to impose some responsibility on certain homeowners to prevent swimming pool drowning. The extent of the burdens on these homeowners is money and time to add the safety feature or retrofit with the feature. The benefit to the community is saved lives. .</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">This burden and benefit reflected by enactment of the Swimming Pool Safety Act is similar to the way we see things here regarding the \u201cextent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach.\u201d <em>(Rowland, supra, </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Cal.2d at p. 113.) The burden on the homeowners was time and money to add a safety feature that might prevent the drowning of a child. This burden was somewhat mitigated by the different drowning prevention safety features available to the homeowners. In the trial court, the features discussed were a fence around the perimeter of the pool or something more simple, such as a self-closing or self-latching mechanism on the door from the only available route from the house to the pool. The \u201cconsequence^ to the community\u201d was the possibility of a saved life. We find this factor weighed in favor of imposing a duty on the homeowners here.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We next consider the other <em>Rowland </em>factors to see whether they are \u201cdeterminative of the duty analysis.\u201d <em>(Castaneda </em>v. <em>Olsher, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1213.) The remaining factors are \u201cthe degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm . . . , and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d <em>(Rowland, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 113.) As even defendants state, \u201c[t]here is no question that the plaintiff suffered injury as her child died as a result of this tragic accident.\u201d As to the closeness of connection between the homeowners\u2019 conduct and plaintiff\u2019s injury, if there was a fence around the perimeter of the pool or a self-closing or self-latching mechanism on the door, Allen may not have been able to access the pool at all. In evaluating the closeness of the connection, we are mindful that there was the added factor that Allen\u2019s grandmother and father failed to prevent him from going back outside unsupervised. Still, the opportunity for Allen to drown in the pool may have been diminished had the pool\u2019s access been limited by one of the drowning prevention safety features discussed in the trial court. Thus, there was also some degree of moral blame on the homeowners for failing to adequately protect a young child such as Allen from drowning. Finally, considering the last <em>Rowland </em>factor, homeowners insurance is typically available to cover the risk that eventuated here. (See <em>Salinas v. Martin </em>(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 404, 416 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 735] [making a similar observation about insurance available to homeowners where a gardener\u2019s dog attacked an employee of a contractor who was working at the property owner\u2019s house].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In sum, we have considered all the <em>Rowland </em>factors. In our consideration, all weighed in favor of imposing a duty of care on the homeowners to protect four-year-old Allen from drowning in the swimming pool. The trial court erred in finding the opposite as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>There Are Triable Issues of Fact on Whether the Homeowners Breached Their Duty of Care and Whether Their Actions Were a Substantial Factor in Bringing About the Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The second and third elements of a cause of action for negligence are breach of the duty of care and causation. <em>(Melton v. Boustred, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 529.) \u201c \u2018[T]he elements of breach of that duty and causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury\u2019s determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McGarry </em>v. <em>Sax </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 983, 994 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 519].) As to these elements here, the trial court found as a matter of law \u201cnothing these defendants did or failed to do created any type of dangerous condition or in any way contributed to this accident\u201d; there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the conduct of the homeowners and Century 21 was a cause in fact of the drowning; and \u201c[e]ven the security gate and sliding glass door could not have been involved in this accident, since they were left open on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The question to be resolved is whether the homeowners breached the duty of care to Allen by failing to install a fence around the perimeter of the pool or a self-closing or self-latching mechanism on the door. The homeowners argue that since there was a perimeter fence around the property that \u201cw[as] essentially \u2018childproof,\u2019 \u201d they cannot be required to add a fence around the perimeter of the swimming pool or locks or latches on the kitchen door leading to the pool.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether a reasonably prudent homeowner was or was not required to add further precautions is not one for us to decide as a matter of law. A jury could conclude a reasonably prudent homeowner should have taken further precautions because it was foreseeable that a child could still access the pool and could drown or be injured. Or it could decide the opposite. Where reasonable minds could differ, it was error for the trial court to decide that question as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The question to be resolved as to causation is whether \u201cdefendant\u2019s act or omission was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.\u201d <em>(Padilla </em>v. <em>Rodas </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 742, 752 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 114], citing <em>Saelzler v. Advanced Group </em>400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 778 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].) In <em>Padilla, </em>the appellate court found no causation as a matter of law because \u201ceven [assuming] that the gate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>defective for lack of a self-latching mechanism, [the plaintiff] cannot- establish the element of causation.\u201d <em>(Padilla, </em>at p. 752.) There, \u201c[t]he probabilities [we]re evenly balanced as to whether [the two year old who drowned] gained entrance to the pool through the side yard gate, the \u2018door\u2019 on the other side of the house, or the sliding glass doors of the house.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 752-753; see <em>id. </em>at p. 742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Homeowners here argue this case is analogous to <em>Padilla </em>because Allen\u2019s death \u201cwas not a result of an accidental fall into the pool. . . . Rather, the injury occurred solely due to the responsible adults\u2019 failure to supervise their child.\u201d <em>Padilla </em>does not apply for two reasons. One, unlike <em>Padilla, </em>there was no dispute that Allen got out of the house through the only door from the house that led to the pool\u2014a door that did not have a self-closing, self-latching mechanism. And two, the issue of the grandmother\u2019s negligence or the father\u2019s negligence in failing to supervise Allen is separate from defendants\u2019 negligence. Plaintiff must be allowed to show that the homeowners\u2019 negligence was \u201ca substantial factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries . . . .\u201d <em>(Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 772.) Contributory negligence questions are for the jury <em>(Wigodsky v. Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 51, 57 [75 Cal.Rptr. 419]) and made it such that the causation issue here was not amenable for summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>There Was No Triable Issue of Fact with Respect to the Specific Allegation of Liability in the Complaint Against Century 21</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">As to the homeowners, the judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to vacate its order granting the motion for summary judgment and enter a new order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">As to Century 21, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
