McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 554 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 414] <em>(PCRM I), </em>the trial court sustained demurrers without leave to amend and dismissed second amended complaints alleging that various chain restaurants serving grilled chicken were in violation of Proposition 65. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">1. <em>The McDonald\u2019s complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">As we described in <em>PCRM </em>/, in January 2008 appellant Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), self-described as a nonprofit organization \u201c \u2018committed to promoting a safe and healthful diet and to protecting consumers from food and drink that are dangerous or unhealthful,\u2019 \u201d filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and civil penalties against seven chain restaurant corporations (the McDonald\u2019s complaint), including respondents Applebee\u2019s International, Inc. (Applebee\u2019s), McDonald\u2019s Corporation (McDonald\u2019s), OSI Restaurant Partners, Inc. (the owner of Outback Steakhouse) (OSI), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Chick-fil-A, Inc. (Chick-fil-A) (collectively, the McDonald\u2019s defendants). <em>(PCRM I, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at pp. 559-560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">PCRM alleged that the restaurants sold grilled chicken products to consumers in California and that the grilling process created a chemical called PhIP,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which appeared on California\u2019s list of carcinogenic chemicals and required the restaurants to give a \u201c \u2018clear and reasonable warning\u2019 \u201d to individuals under California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, Health and Safety Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 25249.5 et seq. (Proposition 65). <em>(PCRM I, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at p. 560.) The complaint alleged: \u201cNone of the locations where Defendants^] grilled chicken products were purchased for purposes of testing had posted clear and reasonable warnings that food sold on the premises contained a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.\u201d The complaint also stated that in order to comply with Proposition 65, the restaurants \u201cmust conspicuously post specific warnings with respect to the carcinogenic dangers of the grilled chicken they offer for sale,\u201d and requested a declaratory judgment declaring that any warning not specifically mentioning the carcinogenic effects of grilled chicken is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The trial court granted the McDonald\u2019s defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, concluding that three specific warnings proposed by PCRM were barred by federal conflict preemption. The trial court also concluded that the Proposition 65 \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d warning was presumptively clear and reasonable, and the restaurants could not be required to provide any different warning in a restaurant already providing the Safe Harbor warning. <em>(PCRM I, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at pp. 562-563.) The Safe Harbor warning states: \u201cWARNING: Chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold or served here.\u201d (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, \u00a7 25603.3, subd. (a).) Although PCRM also identified the Safe Harbor warning as a proposed warning, the trial court in <em>PCRM I </em>declined to require the posting of the warning in restaurants that did not already post it, noting that although the Safe Harbor warning did not say anything about grilled chicken, \u201c \u2018the context in which a Safe Harbor Warning, or any other warning, would be posted cannot be ignored.\u2019 \u201d <em>(PCRM I, </em>at pp. 563-564.) Any order that the restaurants post the Safe Harbor warning would therefore constitute a finding that grilled chicken contained carcinogens sufficient to require a Proposition 65 warning, a finding the court concluded would conflict with federal law and policy and was therefore preempted. <em>(PCRM I, </em>at pp. 563-564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>On appeal, we reversed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment orders, concluding that the Safe Harbor warning was presumptively clear and reasonable and was not preempted. <em>(PCRM I, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at p. 571.) \u201cAs the language of the Safe Harbor Warning is presumptively clear and reasonable, the Restaurants already providing the Safe Harbor Warning would not be required to provide the warnings with the more targeted language that PCRM suggests. The \u2018 \u201csafe harbor\u201d \u2019 warning specified in the regulations is \u2018so called because [its] use constitutes compliance with [Proposition 65] without the necessity of a case-by-case factual determination.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] . . . [f] As the clear and reasonable language of the Safe Harbor Warning does not create any conflict with any federal policy regarding the thorough cooking of chicken, the trial court erred in finding that the Safe Harbor Warning was preempted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We also specifically declined to address the method by which the restaurants posted the Safe Harbor warning, as the method was not in issue before the trial court. Only the wording of the warning was in issue, and therefore \u201c[w]hether the Restaurants utilize a method specified in the regulation [(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, \u00a7 25603.1)] is not before us on this appeal.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">2. <em>The KFC complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">After <em>PCRM I </em>was decided in August 2010, PCRM filed a complaint on March 15, 2011, against KFC Corporation and its parent company, Yum! Brands (the KFC complaint), requesting the same injunctive relief, statutory civil penalties, and declaratory relief as in the McDonald\u2019s complaint, and alleging that KFC posted the Safe Harbor warning but failed to warn customers about the PhIP in its grilled chicken, and did not properly post the Safe Harbor warning: \u201cAlthough Defendant does post the food and beverage notice set out in the Proposition 65 regulations, this warning does not relate to Defendant\u2019s sale of grilled chicken and is not clear and reasonable as required by the statute because a reasonable consumer would not know that Defendant\u2019s grilled chicken products contain a known carcinogen. <em>This warning is also not displayed in a manner calculated to render it as likely to be read and understood by an ordinary individual.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Like the McDonald\u2019s complaint, the KFC complaint also stated that the restaurants \u201cmust conspicuously post specific warnings with respect to the carcinogenic dangers of the grilled chicken they offer for sale,\u201d and requested a declaratory judgment declaring that any warning not specifically mentioning the carcinogenic effects of grilled chicken is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">After the McDonald\u2019s and KFC cases were ordered related in August 2011, PCRM filed an unopposed motion to formally consolidate the cases, but no formal consolidation order ever issued, although the cases were considered together thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>3. <em>The joint challenge to the initial complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In a joint pleading, the McDonald\u2019s defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the cause of action for a declaratory judgment, on the ground that the McDonald\u2019s complaint sought relief inconsistent with <em>PCRM I\u2019s </em>conclusion that the Safe Harbor warning was clear and reasonable as a matter of law, so that PCRM was not entitled to a warning specifically identifying carcinogens in grilled chicken. The KFC defendants filed a demurrer on the same grounds to all three causes of action in the KFC complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">At the hearing on the motions on January 17, 2012, the trial court noted that the KFC complaint included an admission that KFC gave Safe Harbor warnings, and \u201cabsent allegations\u2014and then, ultimately, proof\u2014that no warning meeting the requirements of the Safe Harbor provisions have been given, the complaint would fail to state a cause of action.\u201d PCRM admitted, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the slightest idea what KFC does with its warnings and how it handles them,\u201d and offered to \u201cextend that sentence [(stating that KFC restaurants gave the warnings)] to say\u2014well, I\u2019ll have to ask the people who saw it exactly what they saw; but presumably, what they saw was not the safe harbor warning. They saw this longer\u2014I don\u2019t know what they saw. I\u2019ll go back, and I\u2019ll ask them what they saw\u2014\u201d The court rejoined: \u201cNo, no. Listen. You don\u2019t get to file a complaint unless you have a reasonable belief that there is a violation .... If you don\u2019t have any example of a violation, you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d PCRM offered to amend the complaint to state that KFC failed to post any Safe Harbor warnings without additional language about acrylamide, another chemical found in french fries. The court observed: \u201cI think you [(PCRM)] have to do a little investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The trial court pointed out that the McDonald\u2019s complaint alleged that no warnings at all were given, but the request in PCRM\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action (that warnings specifically mention grilled chicken) was not in conformance with the law\u2019s requirements. The McDonald\u2019s defendants stated that they intended to file for summary judgment \u201cdirected quite specifically at the question of whether the signs are posted and the burden of proof for that.\u201d The motion would state that interrogatory responses from PCRM indicated that PCRM did not have evidence that the McDonald\u2019s defendants did not post the Safe Harbor warnings, and that the McDonald\u2019s defendants did not believe PCRM could show that no clear and reasonable warnings were posted. \u201c[W]e believe that Proposition 65 is quite clear that they need evidence of that before they, honestly, can send a 60-day notice, much less file a complaint, much less move forward in the litigation. [][] We think that\u2019s part of their prima facie case. They must show . . . that we knowingly and intentionally failed to provide a warning.\u201d PCRM was now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>seeking discovery about the posting of the warnings, but at the initiation of the lawsuit PCRM \u201cneed[ed] to have those facts before they proceed.\u201d PCRM argued that the McDonald\u2019s defendants had not responded to its 60-day notice \u201cto say \u2018No, no. Just go look at our stores. You\u2019ll see we\u2019re fine,\u2019 \u201d and PCRM was now entitled to discovery. The court responded: \u201cI have to say this again: we\u2019re two years into the case, and you tell me you don\u2019t have the foggiest idea of what they do.\u201d PCRM replied that the issue was what the McDonald\u2019s defendants were doing during the one-year period before PCRM filed suit: \u201c[W]hat were they doing in the one-year period from 2007 to 2008?\u201d and up until now in 2012, and that would require extensive discovery. PCRM needed to know what warning signs the McDonald\u2019s defendants posted in 2007 and how they were posted, if at all, and intended to file motions to compel. The McDonald\u2019s defendants\u2019 counsel reiterated that PCRM had to have a sufficient basis for alleging that Safe Harbor or other warnings were not posted in 2008: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they had that basis back then, and we certainly don\u2019t believe they have the basis now. . . . [W]e don\u2019t bear the burden of proof on it. We think the plaintiffs do. We think they had an inadequate investigation from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The trial court granted the motions with leave to amend, concluding as to KFC that the Safe Harbor warning was presumptively \u201c \u2018clear and reasonable\u2019 and therefore complies with the law.\u201d The KFC complaint conceded that KFC restaurants provided compliant warnings, so that \u201cto amend its complaint in good faith, Plaintiff must possess sufficient facts to support allegations of conduct contrary to these findings.\u201d As to the McDonald\u2019s defendants, the court concluded that PCRM could not seek to require the posting of specific grilled chicken warnings, as that was not required by Proposition 65 (although additional language could be provided voluntarily or as part of a settlement). The court allowed PCRM to file amended complaints \u201cif it can do so in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">4. <em>The first amended complaints and sustained demurrers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">PCRM then filed first amended complaints (FACs) against the McDonald\u2019s defendants and KFC in February 2012. The McDonald\u2019s FAC omitted any allegation (as had appeared in the original complaint) that the McDonald\u2019s defendants did not post any clear and reasonable warnings, instead alleging that Proposition 65 required that in restaurants \u201cclear and reasonable warnings must be placed in conspicuous locations in a manner reasonably calculated to make the warnings likely to be observed by all patrons,\u201d and \u201cDefendants have failed to post clear and reasonable warnings in accordance with the statutory requirements of Proposition 65.\u201d PCRM alleged that in 2006, when a PCRM employee purchased grilled chicken \u201cfrom retail establishments owned and operated by all Defendants in the Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>area,\u201d the employee \u201cdid not see the Proposition 65 Safe Harbor Warning posted in the entry, lobby or purchase area\u201d of 18 restaurants. The complaint also alleged that even if \u201ccertain\u201d restaurants posted the Safe Harbor warning, the warning was not \u201cclear and reasonable\u201d because it did not relate to the sale of grilled chicken. PCRM alleged that the McDonald\u2019s defendants \u201chave not posted the Safe Harbor Warning in every purchase area, such as the outdoor \u2018drive-thru\u2019 order and pick-up areas or the take-out entrance.\u201d In February 2012, PCRM members visited 21 restaurants and their findings \u201cdemonstrate that Defendants do not currently post the Safe Harbor Warning in all of the purchase areas of all of their retail establishments,\u201d as the PCRM members \u201cdid not see the Proposition 65 Safe Harbor Warning posted in at least one purchase area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The KFC FAC, like the McDonald\u2019s FAC, alleged that Proposition 65 required that \u201cclear and reasonable warnings must be placed in conspicuous locations in a manner reasonably calculated to make the warnings likely to be observed by .all patrons.\u201d PCRM admitted that \u201ccertain\u201d KFC restaurants posted the Safe Harbor warning, but that warning was not clear and reasonable because it did not relate to the sale of grilled chicken. Further, KFC had not posted the warning \u201cin every purchase area, such as its outdoor \u2018drive-thru\u2019 order and pick-up area,\u201d of its retail establishments. In February 2012, PCRM members visited 13 KFC restaurants and \u201cdid not see the Proposition 65 Safe Harbor Warning posted in at least one purchase area.\u201d In contrast to its allegation in the original KFC complaint, PCRM alleged that KFC \u201cfailed to post any Proposition 65 warning in one or more of its retail establishments during the period covered by this lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The McDonald\u2019s defendants and KFC filed demurrers and motions to strike. At the hearing on the demurrers, PCRM raised an issue that did not appear in its KFC FAC, and asserted as to KFC that if the court allowed amendment, it intended to allege that the Safe Harbor warnings in the restaurants were not in compliance with Proposition 65, because they included language warning about \u201cacrylamide in potatoes\u201d as required by an earlier consent decree. The court pointed out that PCRM still did not allege that any person did an investigation and saw that a KFC restaurant failed to post the Safe Harbor warning (and PCRM conceded this), only that the warning did not appear in all purchase areas. The court observed: \u201cI don\u2019t think you get to drag a defendant into a lawsuit if you haven\u2019t even gone into one store where there wasn\u2019t a sign posted, and you didn\u2019t allege that.\u201d The McDonald\u2019s defendants pointed out that they \u201chad a dog in the fight,\u201d because McDonald\u2019s was also subject to a consent decree requiring the same language about acrylamide. The court stated that PCRM had not alleged that supplementing the Safe Harbor warning rendered it not clear and reasonable, but \u201cthat gives you something you can allege, which keeps you from sustained without leave to amend.\u201d As to the allegation that KFC did not post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>warnings in all service areas, \u201cThis is not what you reported to the Attorney General. This is a new theory because you were trying to get out from under what ... I thought . . . was the pure plain vanilla safe harbor warning,\u201d although the court now understood \u201call of them reference acrylamide.\u201d The court confirmed that PCRM\u2019s notice to the Attorney General did not contain an allegation that there were no signs in all service areas. PCRM argued that no such specificity was required. The court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think that \u2018not in every service area\u2019 is an issue here,\u201d to which PCRM replied, \u201cAll right. We have no problem.\u201d Counsel for the McDonald\u2019s defendants and counsel for KFC indicated that if amendment was allowed on the supplementation issue, they would argue that the statutory notice was not sufficient to support the complaint. The court reiterated that it would not allow amendment as to posting in every service area \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t give proper notice on that to the Attorney General.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The trial court sustained the demurrers as to McDonald\u2019s, Chick-fil-A, and OSI as well as KFC and Yum! Brands, because the Safe Harbor warning was \u201c \u2018clear and reasonable\u2019 \u201d in compliance with Proposition 65, and both FACs \u201cfail[ed] to sufficiently allege based on adequate investigation that Defendants have failed to provide the \u2018safe harbor\u2019 language in at least one location at Defendants\u2019 restaurants within the relevant statute of limitations periods; . . . Defendants are not required to provide warnings in multiple locations, such as additional warnings in drive-thru, carry-out or other takeaway areas; and ... in light of the years of litigation of these cases, and Plaintiff\u2019s changing theories of liability, Plaintiff may amend the [FACs], if it can do so in good faith, to allege that Defendants failed within the statute of limitations period to provide a warning that was \u2018clear and reasonable\u2019 due to the warning sign being supplemented with language specific to acrylamide.\u201d The demurrers were sustained regarding PCRM\u2019s claim that warnings were required specifically mentioning grilled chicken even where the Safe Harbor warnings were posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Further, the court sustained the McDonald\u2019s defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend as to Applebee\u2019s, because Applebee\u2019s was already subject to a consent judgment in an earlier case. (The demurrer was also sustained without leave to amend as to two other restaurant corporations, Brinker International, Inc., and Carlson Restaurants Worldwide, Inc., which are not parties to this appeal.) The remaining defendants were McDonald\u2019s, Chick-fil-A, OSI, KFC, and Yum! Brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">5. <em>The second amended complaints, sustained demurrers, and dismissals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">PCRM, undaunted, quickly filed second amended complaints (SACs) against the remaining McDonald\u2019s defendants and KFC in June 2012. PCRM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>alleged in the McDonald\u2019s SAC that McDonald\u2019s posted an \u201cAcrylamide Potato Warning, and not the Safe Harbor Warning, near the main ordering counter\u201d of nine restaurants, \u201cdoes not post any Proposition 65 warning\u201d at three restaurants, and did not post a Proposition 65 warning in the drive-through ordering area of seven others. PCRM also alleged that Chick-fil-A did not post any Proposition 65 warning in four restaurants and in the drive-through ordering area of one restaurant and that OSI did not post any warnings at one restaurant and in the takeout order area of another. Further, PCRM alleged that in one Chick-fil-A restaurant, the Safe Harbor warning posted by the main ordering counter contained an additional sentence referring to a nutritional guide, which contained information regarding acrylamide found in potatoes. PCRM alleged that the Safe Harbor warning posted by McDonald\u2019s was not clear and reasonable under Proposition 65, because it contained \u201csurplus text\u201d related to acrylamide, and the Safe Harbor warning posted by Chick-fil-A was not clear and reasonable because \u201cit contains an additional sentence that references a separate \u2018nutritional guide.\u2019 \u201d \u201cDue to the surplus text, the [McDonald\u2019s warning] is not presumptively clear and reasonable under Proposition 65\u2019s regulations,\u201d because the warning would lead consumers to believe that acrylamide was the only carcinogen present.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">PCRM alleged in the KFC SAC that KFC \u201cposts the Acrylamide Potato Warning, and not the Safe Harbor Warning, via a combination of the sign and brochure near the main ordering counter\u201d of 10 restaurants. Photographs (which PCRM stated were taken in Feb. 2012, showed posters containing the following warning: \u201cWARNING: Chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold or served here. For more specific information, see the nutrition brochure.\u201d The KFC SAC also alleged that KFC did not post a Proposition 65 warning in the drive-through ordering area of 13 restaurants. KFC failed to post \u201cclear and reasonable warnings in the manner and the method prescribed by Proposition 65,\u201d and a reasonable consumer would understand the posted warnings to relate solely to acrylamide.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendants filed demurrers and motions to strike the SACs, asking the court to deny leave to amend. The court held a hearing on August 15, 2012. The McDonald\u2019s defendants argued that PCRM did not have a basis to certify in November 2007 that they had a reasonable and meritorious case as to all the elements of their original action. The court agreed that PCRM\u2019s counsel at the previous hearing \u201csaid that there hadn\u2019t been an investigation with respect to the signage,\u201d and although the court had allowed an investigation, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s sufficient.\u201d Because \u201cyou didn\u2019t do any investigation within the statutory period of time with respect to the 60-day notice,\u201d the court suggested PCRM would have to file a new lawsuit. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do the investigation you were supposed to do. I think that would gut . . . the statute completely if someone could just file an action whenever they wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>without going out and taking a look at what the signage was, in at least one outlet, which you didn\u2019t do within the statutory period,\u201d and here the only investigatipn was during the course of the lawsuit. The allegation that some restaurants did not post warnings at all went outside the leave to amend. KFC also argued that there was no allegation that there were any KFC locations that did not post a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend (and granted the motions to strike without leave to amend, although they were moot). The court took judicial notice of various documents, including consent judgments. As to the McDonald\u2019s defendants, the court\u2019s written order concluded that PCRM\u2019s 60-day notice under Proposition 65, issued November 5, 2007, was invalid because PCRM did not conduct a timely investigation of whether those defendants were providing warnings in their restaurants, and therefore PCRM\u2019s certificate of merit was defective at the time that it issued the notice, and at the time it first sued the McDonald\u2019s defendants in 2008. This required that the demurrers as to all McDonald\u2019s defendants and all causes of action be sustained without leave to amend. The court also held that Chick-fil-A\u2019s Safe Harbor warning containing additional language referring customers to a nutrition brochure was in compliance with Proposition 65. Although the sustaining of the demurrer disposed of the entire SAC, the court struck the allegations regarding takeout and drive-through areas because defendants were not required to provide warnings in multiple locations, and stmck the allegations regarding restaurants providing no warnings as attempts to add a new theory of liability that was outside the scope of the leave to amend the court had granted when sustaining the demurrer to the FACs.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As to KFC, the trial court\u2019s order concluded that the KFC complaints were sham pleadings \u201cclearly inconsistent with each other\u201d in their descriptions of what warnings KFC posted and why they were insufficient, so that KFC\u2019s SAC was \u201ca \u2018sham\u2019 Complaint designed to \u2018breathe fife into the complaint\u2019 so as to avoid a demurrer and keep the lawsuit alive.\u201d PCRM\u2019s initial complaint alleged that KFC posted the Safe Harbor warning; the FAC alleged that only certain restaurants posted the warning; and the SAC alleged that KFC posted an acrylamide potato warning, and not the Safe Harbor warning. The SAC, therefore, attempted to omit relevant facts that made the previous complaints defective. The court also concluded that KFC\u2019s warnings using the Safe Harbor language and \u201cmaking reference to the nutrition guide for more \u2018specific information\u2019 \u201d were sufficient under Proposition 65. Finally, the certificate of merit PCRM filed in 2009 to accompany its presuit notice as required under Proposition 65 was defective and did not demonstrate that the notice was supported by sufficient evidence, as the SAC made clear that PCRM did not visit the KFC restaurants until February 2012, long after filing the initial complaint against KFC in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>PCRM filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgments.

The certificate of merit must state that the person executing it has consulted with one or more experts \u201c \u2018who ha[ve] reviewed facts, studies, or other data regarding the exposure to the listed chemical [that is the subject of the action,] and that, based on that information, the [person executing the certificate] believes there is a reasonable and meritorious case for the private action.\u2019 . . . \u2018[F]actual information sufficient to establish the basis of the certificate of merit\u2019 must be included with the certificate served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>on the Attorney General.

The required notice \u201cis a mandatory precondition to bringing a citizen enforcement suit\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1554) and the accompanying certificate of merit \u201coperates as a brake on improvident citizen enforcement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1551).

The notice stated that the McDonald\u2019s defendants \u201chave knowingly and intentionally failed to warn consumers that they are being exposed to the chemical compound \u2018PhIP\u2019 . . . through ingestion of grilled chicken consumed from the . . . Defendants\u2019 [restaurants,] without . . . giving clear and reasonable warning to consumers of the significant health risk that these consumer^] face.\u201d The notice stated that the McDonald\u2019s defendants failed to provide clear and reasonable warnings at all their California locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The attached certificate of merit was signed by PCRM\u2019s counsel, and stated that counsel had consulted with one or more experts regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>alleged exposure to PhIP. Based on that information \u201cand all other information in my possession,\u201d there was a reasonable and meritorious case for the lawsuit, \u201cmeaning] that the information provides a credible basis that all elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 case can be established and the information did not prove that the alleged violator will be able to establish any of the affirmative defenses set forth in the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The McDonald\u2019s defendants contend that when PCRM\u2019s counsel admitted during the hearing on the demurrer to the original complaint that PCRM did not have information regarding whether and how the McDonald\u2019s defendants posted warnings (and therefore needed discovery regarding what the McDonald\u2019s defendants were doing from 2007 to 2008, when PCRM filed its complaint), that was a binding admission that PCRM had not conducted a factual investigation regarding warnings before filing the lawsuit. This demonstrates that at the time counsel signed the certificate of merit, counsel did not have a credible basis for believing that the McDonald\u2019s defendants had failed to warn. Under the requirements of the statute and regulations, the 60-day notice requires that a plaintiff have sufficient information <em>at the time of filing suit </em>to provide a reasonable basis for concluding that there is merit to each element of the action on which the plaintiff will have the burden of proof, which includes whether a defendant posts clear and reasonable warnings. PCRM did not have the required information to support its notice and its filing of the lawsuit, and therefore the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the McDonald\u2019s SAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u201c[A]n oral statement by counsel in the same action is a binding judicial admission if the statement was an unambiguous concession of a matter then at issue and was not made improvidently or unguardedly.

In sustaining a demurrer, the trial court may take into account as admissions against interest statements made in argument, and may rely on concessions made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel during oral argument to show there was no basis for a cause of action. <em>(Brandwein </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1485, 1515, fn. 19 [161 Cal.Rptr.3d 728]; <em>DeRose </em>v. <em>Carswell </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1019 [242 Cal.Rptr. 368], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>Ramona v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 107, 112, fn. 6 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 766].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">PCRM\u2019s statements during oral argument, made repeatedly under close questioning by the trial court, were that it needed to conduct discovery in 2012 to determine \u201cwhat were [the McDonald\u2019s defendants] doing in the one-year period from 2007-2008,\u201d and PCRM conceded that <em>when PCRM\u2019s counsel executed the certificate of merit before filing suit in 2008, </em>PCRM did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>not know what warning signs were posted and how they were posted in 2007. These statements constitute admissions that PCRM did not have information to support the essential element of a Proposition 65 claim that the McDonald\u2019s defendants failed to give \u201cclear and reasonable warning\u201d that its customers were being exposed to a carcinogenic chemical. (\u00a7 25249.6.) PCRM cannot cure this defect in its notice and certificate of merit by later conducting discovery into the warnings given before the filing of the lawsuit. (See <em>DiPirro </em>v. <em>American Isuzu Motors Inc., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 974-975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">PCRM argues that consideration of the basis of the certificate of merit must be postponed until the end of the lawsuit because the statute provides that the factual basis for the certificate is not discoverable unless, at the conclusion of the lawsuit, the trial court determines that there was no actual or threatened exposure to a listed chemical, at which time the court may \u201creview the basis for the belief of the person executing the certificate of merit . . . that an exposure to a listed chemical had occurred or was threatened,\u201d and shall deem the action frivolous if the court finds \u201cno credible factual basis for the certifier\u2019s belief . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 25249.7, subd. (h)(1), (2).) In this case, however, defendants did not seek discovery into the basis for PCRM\u2019s factual basis for believing that the McDonald\u2019s defendants\u2019 customers were exposed to PbTP in grilled chicken, and did not argue that the complaint was frivolous. Instead, PCRM admitted before trial that it did not have a credible factual belief to support its allegation that the McDonald\u2019s defendants did not provide clear and reasonable warnings. The trial court was not required to ignore that admission as it determined whether to sustain the demurrers and whether to grant leave to amend the SAC, and we will not ignore it on appeal. (See <em>Yeroushalmi </em>v. <em>Miramar Sheraton </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 738, 740 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 332]; <em>In re Vaccine Cases, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 459 [affirming the sustaining of demurrers without leave to amend on the ground of failure to comply with Prop. 65 notice requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">B. <em>PCRM\u2019s certificate of merit regarding KFC was also defective.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">PCRM filed a 60-day notice on June 2, 2009, as to the KFC defendants, alleging that since April 2009, KFC\u2019s California establishments had sold grilled chicken products exposing consumers to PhIP while \u201cknowingly and intentionally failing to provide clear, reasonable and conspicuous warnings\u201d of the health risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The attached certificate of merit was signed by PCRM\u2019s counsel on June 2, 2009, and stated that counsel had consulted with one or more experts regarding the alleged exposure to PhIP. Based on that information \u201cand all other information in my possession,\u201d there was a reasonable and meritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>case for the lawsuit, which \u201cmeans that the information provides a credible basis that all elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 case can be established and the information did not prove that the alleged violator will be able to establish any of the affirmative defenses set forth in the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">At the January 17, 2012 hearing on the demurrer to the original KFC complaint filed in March 2011, PCRM\u2019s counsel stated that PCRM saw warnings at KFC restaurants but \u201cwe did not check that the methods that were used were compliant,\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t have the slightest idea what KFC does with its warnings and how it handles them.\u201d Counsel continued that he would have to ask those who saw the warnings what they saw, and although he \u201cpresumed\u201d it was not the Safe Harbor warning, \u201cI don\u2019t know what they saw.\u201d PCRM\u2019s counsel \u201cinferred from [KFC\u2019s] lack of response [to the 60-day notice] that. . . they were denying that they had any obligation to post the signs,\u201d and \u201cthey could have sent me some kind of exhaustive factual finding . . . affidavits and depositions and pictures and exemplars. Then I think that might have put the burden on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">This 2012 statement by PCRM\u2019s counsel that in 2011 when it filed its complaint, PCRM did not know what warnings KFC posted and \u201cwe did not check\u201d what methods it used in posting them, is an admission that PCRM did not have that information in 2009 when counsel signed the certificate of merit. At the relevant time, PCRM did not have the factual basis to support its notice or the certificate of merit. Although PCRM\u2019s initial complaint stated that KFC did post the warnings, the complaint also stated that the warnings were not displayed in a manner calculated to render them likely to be read and understood by an ordinary individual, and the notice stated that KFC failed to provide \u201cclear, reasonable, and <em>conspicuous </em>warnings.\u201d (Italics added.) If (as counsel admitted) PCRM did not check the methods by which KFC posted its warnings, the statement in the notice that the warnings were not conspicuous also was not supported by the certificate of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">PCRM\u2019s notice and certificate of merit were not supported by facts sufficient to provide a basis for PCRM to believe that it could support the elements of its Proposition 65 claim. A notice that is unsupported by adequate investigation and information is equivalent to no notice at all, as PCRM could not give defendants or the Attorney General (just as it later failed to provide the court) any allegation of how KFC violated the Proposition 65 warning requirement. As we stated above, PCRM cannot cure its defective certificate and notice by later conducting discovery to fill in the gaps in what it knew when counsel executed the certificate and filed the notice. <em>(DiPirro </em>v. <em>American Isuzu Motors, Inc., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 974-975.) \u201c \u2018Neither settlement nor an official investigation is likely to result from a pro forma notice that the citizen intends to sue in 60 days for any violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>relating to [the identified carcinogen] that discovery might turn up.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 953, 965 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A Proposition 65 lawsuit filed without adequate investigation into whether and how defendants post clear and reasonable warnings is susceptible to endless mutations and amendments, leaving defendants like those in this case to answer conflicting and contradictory allegations in each successive iteration of the complaint. The statutory requirements of notice and a supporting certificate of merit are intended to prevent such improvident lawsuits. When the trial court learns from the plaintiff that it did not know what warnings were displayed and how, the requirement of notice is not met, and no further amendment to the complaints can cure that defect. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers without leave to amend.
