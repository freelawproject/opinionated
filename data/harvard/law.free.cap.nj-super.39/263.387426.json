A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AYd\"> Can an unemancipated infant recover damages against her father\u2019s employer when she suffers injuries through the negligence of the father while he is pursuing the activities of the employment ? The trial court concluded that the right does not exist and so dismissed the action after counsel had opened to the jury. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>legal propriety of that determination is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The precise question has not been decided previously in this State. It is a subject about which in earlier days there was a substantial contrariety of opinion around the country. However, the trend is definitely in the direction of recognition of the cause of action and it may be said with assurance that at the present time the weight of authority is opposed to the view that the employer of a parent shares the immunity of the parent from liability to a child for personal injuries caused by negligent conduct. <em>Annotations, </em>68 <em>A.

L. Rev. </em>148 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Prosser puts the majority doctrine this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201c* * * But as to liability which is purely vicarious, such as that of an employer of a husband or father, for injury to the wife or child, the courts were for a long time divided. The older, but now less favored view denied recovery in such a case, arguing first that since the master\u2019s liability is founded on the servant\u2019s tort, he should not be liable where the servant is not, and second, that the master\u2019s right of indemnity against the servant would defeat the domestic immunity by throwing the ultimate loss upon the servant. The first argument confuses immunity from suit with lack of responsibility \u2014 the servant has committed a tort which bv ordinary rules of law should make the master liable, and there is no reason to include the latter within the purely personal immunity of the family. The second misses the point that the master\u2019s recovery over against the servant is not based upon any continuation of the original domestic claim, but upon the servant\u2019s independent duty of care for the protection of the master\u2019s interests; and that if protection of the servant is still the <em>sine qua </em>non, it may be accomplished merely by denying the indemnity. Accordingly the overwhelming majority of the courts now hold that the employer is liable even though the servant is not. * * (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The path of decision in New Jersey was pointed by the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Hudson v. Gas Consumers' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>252 (1939), not only by the principle espoused but by specific <em>dicium </em>as well. In that ease the husband\u2019s freedom from responsibility for injuries sustained by his wife through his negligence was recognized. However, the immunity was not extended to the employer who was declared liable under ordinary rules of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In the course of the opinion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cThe reason behind the rule that husband or wife may not hold the other civilly liable is that such actions would tend to destroy peace in the family relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Parenthetically, we observe that likewise an unemancipated child may not have such an action against its parent, <em>Cf. Reingold v. </em>Reingold, 115 <em>N. J. L. </em>532 [1935] ; <em>Cafaro v. Cafaro, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>123 [1937] ; and this upon the sound public policy of preserving domestic quiet in the family. But to extend that freedom from liability to a third person charged as principal is quite another matter. The plaintiff\u2019s right to sue an employer [under circumstances like these,] is an independent, primary right and not subordinate to or dependent upon the right to sue the servant.\" 123 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">See also <em>Clement v. Atlantic Casualty Ins. Co., </em>13 N. <em>J. </em>439, 445 (1953); <em>Klinger v. Steffens, </em>17 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>118, 6 <em>A. 2d </em>217 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); <em>Cerruti v. Simone, </em>13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>466, 179 <em>A. </em>257 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">We recognize, of course, that the reference to the child\u2019s action against the parent\u2019s employer is <em>dicium. </em>However, manifestly the underlying philosophy which defendant advances as the basis for non-liability of the third party in such cases, is the same whether the negligent actor occupies the status of husband or father. Under the circumstances, no sound reason exists for permitting the employer to share the immunity which ought to be confined within the family orbit. <em>Cf. Kennedy v. Camp, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>390 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Defendant argues also that the three-year-old plaintiff was not an invitee on his premises at the time of the mishap. The trial court felt that the opening presented a factual issue on the point. Although the problem was not as fully developed as it will be at the trial, in our judgment sufficient was said to warrant this conclusion. Summary disposition of a case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>such grounds on the opening of counsel ought not to be made unless the facts are undisputed and the law involved free from doubt. <em>Liberatori v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>470, 474 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
