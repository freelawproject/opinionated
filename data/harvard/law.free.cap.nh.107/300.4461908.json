From the time it was opened, until the death of the depositor on May 28, 1965, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>account stood in his name. In the interim he alone made deposits and withdrawals, and at his death the account stood at $16,568.31. At some time between August 1, 1960, and August 5, 1963, at the depositor\u2019s request, an employee of the bank typed upon its ledger card for the account: \u201c payable on death to Lucille Robinson, 478 Hillsboro St., Berlin, N. H. \u201d A similar notation was made upon the signature card, which bore the depositor\u2019s signature. The defendant Robinson was not present when the notations were arranged for, nor did she sign a signature card until May 28, 1965, following the death of the depositor on that day. The account book remained in the possession of the depositor at all times until his death. It also bore the same notation of \u201c payable on death to Lucille Robinson. \u201d The defendant Robinson learned of the existence of the account by means of a notice from the bank examiners requesting presentation of the book for verification. Following the depositor\u2019s death, she took possession of the book upon finding it in the depositor\u2019s apartment on the day of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The defendant claims ownership of the account by virtue of the provisions of RSA 384:28-32, enacted in 1953, <em>c. </em>162. RSA 384:28 under the subtitle Distribution of Joint Accounts, provides in part as follows: \u201cOn death of depositor. Whenever any account shall be maintained in any bank doing business in this state in ihe names of two persons payable to either of such persons, and payable to the survivor of them, the said account shall upon the death of either of said persons become the property of and be paid in accordance with its terms to the survivor. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The statute was enacted as an act \u201c relating to joint accounts and distribution thereof, \u201d following a long series of cases dealing with such accounts, commencing with <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Nolette, </em>83 N. H. 489, and ending with <em>Nashua Trust Co. </em>v. Mosgofian, 97 N. H. 17. See also, <em>Cournoyer </em>v. Bank, 98 N. H. 385; <em>Chretien </em>v. <em>Duhaime, </em>100 N. H. 254; <em>Brennan </em>v. Timmins, 104 N. H. 384; 105 N. H. 464. It was \u201c designed to eliminate any question of the right of the survivor of two persons named upon [a joint account] to ownership and payment of the account \u2018upon the death of either of said persons. \u2019 \u201d <em>Cournoyer </em>v. <em>Bank, supra. </em>98 N. H. 385, 393; <em>Parenteau </em>v. Gaillardetz, 103 N. H. 92; 1 N. H. B. J. 40, 43. As was pointed out by Kepner in an article \u201cJoint Bank Account Muddle,\u201d in 26 U. Chi. L. Rev. 376, 381, the statute creates \u201ca new technique for transmitting property. . . . Unless there is fraud or undue influence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>making of the deposit in statutory form is all that is required to effectuate the gift. \u201d <em>Id., </em>395-396.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The difficulty with the defendant\u2019s position is that the account in question in this case was not an account such as the statute describes. It was not an account \u201c maintained ... in the names of two persons payable to either of such persons, and payable to the survivor of them, \u201d within the meaning of the statute. Rather it was an account maintained in the name of the depositor alone, payable to him alone during his lifetime, and at his death to another. To use the language of the commentator in the note \u201cThe Poor Man\u2019s Will, \u201d in 53 Colum. L. Rev. 103, 116, 117 the account falls into the third category of the \u201c five types of accounts \u201d (<em>Cournoyer </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>98 N. H. 385, 393, <em>supra</em>) as to which the writer recommended that statutory provision be made: an account \u201c in the name of the depositor, payable on death to a named individual \u2014 for testamentary purposes. \u201d See also, Jones, The Use of Joint Bank Accounts, 17 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 42, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Since the account as maintained by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate did not meet the requirements of the statute, the statute was not effective to vest title in the defendant Robinson. The Trial Court correctly ruled that \u201cno effective joint account [was] created\u201d (see <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Genesee Merchants Bank, </em>371 Mich. 89), and that the notation endorsed upon the ledger, the signature card, and the passbook, was an invalid \u201c attempt to make a testamentary disposition.\u201d RSA 551:1, 2. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Nolette, </em>83 N. H. 489, 492; <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>60 N. H. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-7\">Kenison, C. J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b342-8\">Kenison, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APk\"><em>dissenting: </em>If the literal construction of RSA 384:28-32 by the majority is permissible taken by itself, it overlooks the over-all intent of the Legislature to make the poor man\u2019s will effective and not an illegal exercise of frustrated intention. RSA 384-A:1-4 (supp); Laws 1955, 319:1-4, legalizing trust deposits in banks, although primarily for the protection of the bank, indicate an intention to make the deposits valid and effective. Independently of the statutes, the transaction in this case can be sustained on contract principles or as a Totten trust. 1 Scott, Trusts (2d ed.) <em>s. </em>58.3 1 Bogert, Trusts &amp; Trustees (2d <em>ed. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>1965) <em>s. </em>47; Restatement (Second), Trusts, <em>s. </em>58, <em>comment </em>b; <em>Matter of </em>Totten, 179 N.

In the meantime the \u201c only successful surviving depositor is very apt to be the one that this court does not get its hands on.\u201d <em>Nashua Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mosgo</em>fian, 97 N.
