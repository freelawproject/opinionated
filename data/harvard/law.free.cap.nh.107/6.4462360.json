Porter </em>v. <em>Dziura, </em>104 N. H. 89. They urge however that the Trial Court erred because the causes alleged do not meet the standard for the consolidation of actions laid down by <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 N. H. 111 as to \u201cwhat on the whole justice requires,\u201d and because the distinct issues presented by the new counts would unduly complicate the issues and confuse a jury, to the prejudice of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The record indicates that the counts presented by amendment relate to the same contracts which give rise to the original actions. The record permits no determination of the extent to which evidence with respect to the alleged windstorm loss would be material upon trial of the counts alleging wrongful cancellation of the policies, the terms of which are not before us. The order of the Court to which exception was taken did not purport to determine the extent to which the issues between the parties should be decided in a single trial. So far as appears, it merely determined that justice does not require that the plaintiffs be required to bring new suits to present their additional causes of action. See Annot. 68 A.L.R. 2d 1372, 1375-1376. In this determination we see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The defendant however regards the order granting the motion to amend as a determination that the \u201cseveral actions ... be tried together\u201d; and in oral argument stated that this issue was argued before the Trial Court at the hearing on the motion to amend. If in fact the order on the motion was understood by the Court and the parties to require consolidation of the counts for trial, the record before us, which contains no transcript of the hearing, affords no basis for holding such an order erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>101 N. H. 314. See <em>Allbee </em>v. <em>Elms, </em>93 N. H. 202, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
