H. 166, 168. We conclude that the Trial Court correcdy denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the defendants\u2019 exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Summary judgment (RSA 491:8-a (supp)) is \u201can excellent device to make possible the prompt disposition of controversies on their merits without a trial, if in essence there is no real dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>as to the salient facts or if only a question of law is involved.\u201d 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, <em>s. </em>1231, <em>p. </em>96 (Wright <em>ed. </em>1958). \u201cTo take a simple example, if in an action on a promissory note, the defendant in his answer denies the making of the note; the plaintiff makes a motion for summary judgment, accompanying it by an affidavit of a person who swears that he saw the defendant sign the note; and the defendant does not file an opposing affidavit, summary judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff. On the other hand, if the defendant files an affidavit to the effect that his purported signature is a forgery or that it was affixed by a person not authorized to do so, a genuine issue as to a material fact is created, and the case must go to trial.\u201d 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In the present case the defendants, moving for summary judgment, had the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue and the material and pleadings on file are viewed in the light most favorable to the adversary. James, Civil Procedure, <em>s. </em>6.18, <em>p. </em>235 (1965). The defendants\u2019 affidavit that it had paid all sums due the prime contractor on April 7, 1965 is contradicted by the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavits state that the defendants acknowledged on May 10 and May 14, 1965 that the prime contractor had not been paid in full and that there was money enough \u201cto cover\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s bill. This created a genuine issue of material fact which required a trial. <em>Salitan </em>v. <em>Tinkham, </em>103 N. H. 100; <em>Community Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>105 N. H. 320. It is not the purpose of summary judgment procedure to deny a litigant a right of trial where there is a genuine issue of material fact to be litigated. <em>Community Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Welch, supra, </em>322.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The plaintiff has submitted alternative arguments in support of its position that summary judgment should not be entered in this case. Guiher, Summary Judgments \u2014 Tactical Problem of the Trial Lawyer, 48 Va. L. Rev. 1263 ( 1962 ). Inasmuch as the pleadings and affidavits disclose a genuine issue of material fact between the parties, it is unnecessary to consider the plaintiff\u2019s alternative contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Defendants\u2019 <em>exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b265-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
