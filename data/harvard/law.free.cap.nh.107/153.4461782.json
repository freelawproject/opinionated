The roads were dry, the weather was clear, and the crossing was protected by flashers and a bell. The automobile was traveling at about fifteen to twenty miles per hour, and the train was going at approximately the same speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Counsel for the plaintiff called the defendant to the stand and was cross-examining him, as was proper' under RSA 516:24. He brought out the fact that the defendant was an experienced driver, used to a great-variety of situations and conditions, and that he had operated this particular automobile for about a year. During his years of driving, he had occasion to stop \u201cunder all sorts of circumstances,\u201d including the making of \u201csudden stops.\u201d The brakes of his 1959 model car were in excellent condition. Just before the accident, the defendant had seen a flashing red light, and he was approaching the crossing on an up grade. Having developed these circumstances, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the witness for his \u201cbest estimate\u201d as to the distance within which he could have stopped his car. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI object unless there is some evidence here this man is an expert.\u201d Upon his objection being overruled, he said \u201cException,\u201d which the Court granted. The witness then replied to the question: \u201cI think I could have stopped it within four or five feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Our rule that the admissibility of opinion evidence depends on whether, within the discretion of the Presiding Justice, it may aid the jury in their search for truth, has been dwelt upon too often and at too great lengths to require extensive review here. <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>91 N. H. 234; <em>Sigel </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R. R., </em>107 N. H. 8. Counsel\u2019s objection to the testimony was on the sole.and specific ground that the witness was not qualified as an expert. No other grounds, if any should exist, are now open to him. <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>83 N. H. 57, 59. In view of the defendant\u2019s experience in operating this particular automobile we believe the court could find that his testimony might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>aid the jury. <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Shattuck, supra; </em>See <em>Mittersill Ski Lift Corp. </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 N. H. 219, 222. The exception to its admission is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">As relevant to the question whether the verdict was so excessive that a remittitur should have been ordered, the jury could have found the following facts: The plaintiff\u2019s out of pocket expenses, including hospital, medical and lost wages, amounted to $4,052.28. Up to the time of the accident the plaintiff, who was then fifty-five years of age, had been in good health, very active, \u201craring to go\u201d and able to carry on his work and other affairs normally, free from pain. On being struck by the train, he was rendered unconscious, and upon recovering his faculties he found himself in a snow bank. He was feeling intense pain in his right arm and leg. He also had a \u201cbig gash\u201d on the back of his head and a sizable wound in his right arm caused by flying glass. He had chest pains, \u201cterrific headaches,\u201d which persisted up to the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The worst injury was to his right ankle. His physician, Dr. Donald J. Flanagan, diagnosed this as an inversion ankle injury resulting from many torn ligaments and tendons and ruptured blood vessels in the ankle. The doctor described this injury as \u201calmost invariably a severe type of injury . . . almost invariably it can be very much worse than a bone fracture.\u201d He felt that it would continue to plague the plaintiff \u201cindefinitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">As a result of his injuries, the plaintiff was bedridden for some two weeks, on crutches for about three months, and forced to use a cane for several months afterward. His ankle continued to swell and pain him, and he had to soak it in Epsom salts practically every night nearly up to the time of the trial and until another illness forced him off his feet. As a result of the accident, he became depressed, worried, tense and fatigued. If he went out in the evening, lie had to remove his shoe often on account of the pain and swelling in his ankle. He ran a \u201crather high\u201d blood pressure due, as his doctor testified, to \u201cworries and the continual pain ...\u201d caused by his injuries. While there was some contradictory evidence, to a degree , at least, to be gathered, among other sources, from his hospital record, no physician appeared for the defendant to dispute Dr. Flanagan. Such conflicts as did exist were plainly for the jury. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Nees, </em>100 N. H. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We need not further detail the injuries and their effects upon the plaintiff. In this state of the evidence, it cannot be said as a matter of law, upon the record before us, that error was committed by the Court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict or to order a remittitur. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Hood &amp; Sons, </em>104 N. H. 207. We are unable to accept the defendant\u2019s argument that what the Court said some twenty-five years ago on January 7, 1941, about the size of the verdict in <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>91 N. H. 234, constitutes \u201ca relevant comparison of verdicts.\u201d In upholding the $7,000 award, the Court observed: \u201cIt is large but we cannot say it is excessive as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>243. Such mild whispers of inflation, if any, as may have been audible in January, 1941, hardly compare with the sounds which we hear today. The emaciated value of the dollar when the jury returned its verdict for the plaintiff Gauthier, contrasted with its value in 1941, nearly a year prior to World War II, is an indisputable fact, both relevant and significant. <em>Lamontagne </em>v. <em>Lamontagne, </em>100 N. H. 237, 239; 12 A.L.R. 2d 611, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions are overruled, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
