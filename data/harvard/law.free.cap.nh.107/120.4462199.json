H. 356, 358.\u201d <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>100 N. H. 220, 221. See <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>64 N. H. 315, 320. But it is familiar law that the clauses in a will are not read in isolation and their meaning is to be determined from the language of the will as a whole. <em>Athorne </em>v. <em>Athorne, </em>100 N. H. 413, 415; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Nelson, supra; Fowler </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>83 N. H. 453, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Although the will contains some ambiguity and opacity, this is not cause for despair by this court. The general approach in this jurisdiction was summarized by <em>In re Lathrop Estate, </em>100 N. H. 393, 395 as follows: \u201cArbitrary canons of construction give way to a single broad rule of construction that always favors rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>than opposes the testamentary disposition and, whenever consistent with the terms of the will as a whole, adopts that construction that gives the maximum validity to the testamentary disposition .... This constructional preference for the maximum validity of the testator\u2019s dispositive plan applies to all wills. No distinction is made whether the will is \u2018crudely drawn\u2019 <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Hospital, </em>82 N. H. 260, 261) ... or whether the will is drawn with legal assistance with some ambiguity (<em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tamworth, </em>96 N. H. 223), or without legal assistance with some ambiguity (<em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Miltimore, </em>95 N. H. 17, 18).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Clause 1 of the will gave the widow all of her husband\u2019s estate for her use forever. There may be cases where the will discloses that a gift of the use of property is a direct gift of the property itself. <em>Ruel </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>90 N. H. 240, 242; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Miltimore, </em>95 N. H. 17, 19. But in the present case it is evident that if clause 1 is construed as passing a fee simple interest to the widow, the remaining clauses of the will are ignored. This militates against construing clause 1 in that manner^ On the other hand clause 1 indicates that the widow\u2019s interest was not limited to a conventional life estate. Construing clause 1 in the light of the whole testamentary plan, here as in <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>100 N. H. 220, 222, the \u201cwill . . . disclosed an intention that she should have the power to dispose of the estate without restriction during her lifetime.\u201d Simes &amp; Smith, Future Interests, <em>s. </em>1489, <em>pp. </em>390-391; Annot. 17 A.L.R. 2d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The widow\u2019s \u201cinterest was more than a conventional life estate but less than an absolute fee simple interest.\u201d <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>104 N. H. 1, 3. Consequently it follows that the widow had the authority to convey the \u201creal estate numbered 105 and 107 Market Street, Portsmouth\u201d equally to her six children, including the daughter Ruth Kovnit. <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>84 N. H. 517; <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>Colburn, </em>98 N. H. 406, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
