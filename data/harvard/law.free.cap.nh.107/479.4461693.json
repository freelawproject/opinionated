H. 384, 385; <em>Beausoleil </em>v. <em>United Furniture Workers, </em>107 N. H. 437. furthermore a court has the power to examine and determine on its own motion whether it has jurisdiction of a matter presented to it. 20 Am. Jur. 2d, Courts, <em>s. </em>92, <em>p. </em>453.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The documents presented by the plaintiff apparently relate mainly to grievances arising out of matters pertaining to the armed forces of the United States and related services which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. U. S. Const., <em>Art. </em>1, <em>s. </em>8; <em>Art. </em>II, <em>s. </em>1; <em>Art. </em>III, <em>ss. </em>1, 2. The Superior Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of plaintiff\u2019s complaints and could not properly entertain them. <em>Pokigo </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, supra. </em>Furthermore the Court lacked jurisdiction over most of the numerous parties, several of whom were federal officials, against whom plaintiff sought relief.
