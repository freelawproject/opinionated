The statute has been so construed in the ordinary case. <em>In re Moulton, </em>96 N. H. 370; <em>In re Craft, </em>99 N. H. 287. <em>Cf. In re Mason, </em>101 N. H. 335; RSA 173:4-a. It is clear that the statute does not permit the alleged sexual psychopath to originate such a petition. Swanson, Sexual Psychopath Statutes: Summary and Analysis, 51 J. Crim. L., C. &amp; P. S. 215, 216, 228-235 (column 4) (1960). This would mean that if a person was without doubt a sexual psychopath, the \u201cremedial, therapeutic and preventive\u201d objective of the statute would be unavailable to the person most needing it in any case that a county attorney refuses to file a petition under RSA 173:3 II (1). <em>In re Moulton, </em>96 N. H. 370, 373; 24 A.L.R. 2d 350. Considering that the determinati\u00f3n of whether a person is a sexual psychopath is one that \u201cis based primarily on medical evidence\u201d <em>(In re Miller, </em>98 N. H. 107, 108), it is reasonable to expect that State prosecuting officials will be guided in part by their own State experts. See <em>In re Craft, </em>99 N. H. 287, 288; RSA 173:4-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">In the present case no one questions the good faith of the county attorney and his position finds support in general language of the statute. However in no previous case do we find such a strong recommendation that a person be examined under the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>of RSA ch. 173. While this recommendation is not required to be accepted by a court or a county attorney <em>(In re Farnsworth, </em>99 N. H. 396), in some cases the interests of justice may require a re-examination of the matter. Rubin, The Law of Criminal Correction 530 (1963). In the present case it appears that the purposes of RSA 173:1 \u201cto protect society,\u201d the rights of the plaintiff, and the interest of the State will be served if the question of an inquiry and medical examination (RSA 173:3, 4) is reconsidered. The case is remanded for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
