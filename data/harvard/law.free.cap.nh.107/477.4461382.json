It alleges failure and refusal to support them over a period of twelve years from February 1954 to July 1966. At the hearing on probable cause it appeared that the defendant and the complainant were divorced prior to 1954; that the defendant had been living in California, and that a case was pending in California against the defendant under the Uniform Reciprocal Support Act. The defendant was arrested in New Hampshire a day or two before the hearing, the complainant had been awarded custody in the divorce proceedings, and she and the children of the parties have lived in this state since April 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">The questions of law raised by the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion to dismiss were certified to this court by Romprey, justice of the Salem district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s person was obtained by his arrest within this state. He maintains that since he was not resident in this state during the period when the crime of nonsupport is alleged to have been committed, \u201cno obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>could arise under the laws of [this state] so as to make [him] subject to our criminal laws, \u201d citing <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Betz, </em>105 N. H. 169. The weight of authority elsewhere is opposed to the defendant\u2019s contention. In the <em>Hardy </em>case the defendant was under no obligation to furnish support to his alleged child under the laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">However, the laws of this state do impose an obligation of support upon this defendant, both by RSA 571:2 under which the proceedings are brought, and by RSA 460:23 (supp). See <em>Healy </em>v. <em>McQuaid, </em>89 N. H. 117. The defendant\u2019s obligation to support his children thus arose under the law of this state, where the support was needed. This is where he \u201chas neglected to provide for their maintenance and where an action should lie.\u201d <em>State ex rel Brito </em>v. <em>Warrick, </em>176 Neb. 211, 216. \u201cThe offence is committed by violation of the duty existing here.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>266 Mass. 80, 84. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>104 N. H. 345, 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">It has been so held upon comparable facts in the following cases: <em>State ex rel Brito </em>v. <em>Warrick, supra; State </em>v. <em>Tickle, </em>238 N. C. 206; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>115 Utah 204; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>102 Kan. 503. See also, Annot. 44 A.L.R. 2d 886, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
