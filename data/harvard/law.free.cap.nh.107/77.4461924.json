J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFL\">The plaintiff\u2019s petition for a divorce from his wife upon the grounds of abandonment and refusal to cohabit (RSA 458:7 IX (supp); Laws 1957, 67:1) was dismissed after hearing in January 1965. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal to this court. <em>Salito </em>v. <em>Salito, </em>107 N. H. 53, decided this day. On March 5, 1965 the defendant filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees stating that \u201cshe is poor and unable to afford to pay for further legal services which are required to properly defend her further in the New Hampshire Supreme Court. \u201d It appears from the reserved case transferred by <em>Leahy, </em>C. J. that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion was granted in the discretion of the Court after full hearing\u201d on June 23, 1965 to the extent that the plaintiff was \u201cordered to pay $125.00 as attorney fees to counsel for Anne Salito forthwith.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s exception to this order was reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">In this state there is no express statutory provision allowing attorney\u2019s fees to the wife in divorce litigation. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>75 N. H. 217; Annot. 56 A.L.R. 2d 13. The statute which authorizes the court to make temporary allowances for support has been given a limited construction. RSA 458:16; <em>Guay </em>v. <em>Association, </em>87 N. H. 216, 222. Unlike the rule in many jurisdictions the wife cannot demand a shifting galaxy of legal talent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>at her husband\u2019s expense. Nevertheless from an early date the right of the court to order the husband to pay the wife an attorney\u2019s fee to defend a divorce proceeding by her husband has been preserved. <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>10 N. H. 272; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>39 N. H. 123, 128; Reporter\u2019s note, 49 N. H. vii; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Adden, </em>50 N. H. 82, 84. \u201cWhere the husband applies for a divorce, under certain circumstances, small sums have been ordered to be paid to the wife to enable her to make her defense.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>42 N. H. 478, 482. See also, <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>75 N. H. 217, 218; Comment, Counsel Fees in Matrimonial Actions, 38 Neb. L. Rev. 761 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The circumstances of the present litigation make a persuasive case for sustaining the Trial Court\u2019s order. The wife has prevailed on the merits in the divorce proceedings at the trial level. While the husband has every right to appeal this decision, it necessarily subjects the wife to additional expense. The husband contends that the attorney\u2019s fee of $125 allowed by the Court, \u201cwhile not unreasonable in terms of the legal services required to defend the appeal, is. unreasonable and an abuse of discretion in terms of the libelant\u2019s income, obligations and ability to pay.\u201d In the absence of any transcript of the hearing on the motion to grant the wife an attorney\u2019s fee, we cannot say that the Court\u2019s ruling had no support in the evidence received at the full hearing. The Court\u2019s order necessarily implied a finding of need on the part of the wife and ability to pay on the part of the husband. The attorney\u2019s fee awarded in defense of appellate proceedings was modest in amount, consistent with prior practice and presumptively valid. 3 Nelson, Divorce and Annulment (2d ed.) <em>ss. </em>29.05 and 29.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>Plaintiffs exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
