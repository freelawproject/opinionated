Roy H. Stewart, the majority stockholder in the defendant company, Northeast Handling Systems, Inc. with its place of business in Manchester, signed the contract as \u201c Salesman. \u201d The plaintiff delivered to Stewart on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>that date a check for $600 and on June 30 a second check for $2,500 constituting the $3,100 sought to be recovered by the plaintiff from Northeast. Plaintiff was to forward another payment of $1,600 in the last week of July and on September 31, 1961 furnish a bank guarantee of the balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In that summer the plaintiff was recalled to military service which disrupted his business plans and he so notified Northeast and Dempster. Stewart informed the plaintiff on behall of Dempster that it would rather sell the ordered equipment and accessories than to store them and have their payments held up due to plaintiff\u2019s military obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The Trial Court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c(3) By virtue of subsequent correspondence and conferences between the Plaintiff and Mr. Stewart, representing the Defendant, and the Dempster Company, agreement was reached which substantially cleared the way for the resale of the subject equipment, occasioned by the Plaintiff\u2019s unexpected recall to Military Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c(4) The Plaintiff authorized Mr. Stewart to sell his interest in the unit to Downing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201c(5) The sale to a third party took place sometime in January 1962, and the Plaintiff at that time did not request the return of any monies paid in on account, nor were there any conversations regarding refund until the Plaintiff made such request sometime in August 1962, at the time of his discharge from Military Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c(6) The plaintiff voluntarily participated in the agreements surrounding the resale of the subject unit. In addition, he distinctly stipulated that his truck be sold with the unit for which he would and did receive full payment from the Downing Container Service, the same company that purchased the subject Dempster - Dumpmaster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201c(7) The Plaintiff\u2019s various correspondence and conferences with Mr. Stewart and Dempster Brothers, Inc. subsequent to the signing of the contract did not effectuate a valid cancellation ... or modification of the original contractual obligations but resulted in a resale of the subject equipment during which time the Defendant, Mr. Stewart and the Dempster Company were acting more in the nature of accommodation parties upon request, without ever consenting to the variance ... or modification of the terms of the contract which carried with it the Plaintiff\u2019s unconditional guarantee to make full payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201c(8) The Dempster was sold to the Lovard Company at the Dempster Brothers\u2019 cost. In turn Lovard sold to the Downing Company. \u201d The Court also ruled that \u201c no accord or satisfaction took place between the parties. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">The plaintiff maintains that the finding and ruling of the Trial Court that the contract between him and Dempster was still in force are completely against the weight of the evidence. As stated in his brief \u201cthe plaintiff contends that the only reasonable conclusion from the evidence in this case is that there was a termination of the original contract between the plaintiff and Dempster, whether such termination be labelled a cancellation, discharge, rescission, accord and satisfaction, novation, or the like. \u201d He argues further that because of the termination of the contract, coupled with the fact that Dempster was a disclosed principal, so that neither Stewart nor Northeast acquired any independent right to the deposit (Restatement (Second), Agency, <em>s. </em>320), a verdict should have been directed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Having admitted entering in a contract with Dempster, the plaintiff had the burden of proving that his obligations thereunder had been terminated in such a way as to entitle him to the return of his deposit. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>99 N. H. 463; 6 Corbin, Contracts, <em>s. </em>1280, <em>p. </em>134 (1962); Simpson, Contracts (2d ed.) <em>ss. </em>205-208, <em>pp. </em>414-421 (1965). The Trial Court having found against him, the plaintiff now has the burden of showing in this court that the evidence was so conclusively in his favor that no reasonable man coikld fail to find for him. <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Com</em>pany, 95 N. H. 404, 406; <em>Condiles </em>v. <em>Waumbec Mills, </em>95 N. H. 127, 128; <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>93 N. H. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Plaintiff testified that he was activated in military service about August 25, 1961 and that in November his truck to which the Dumpmaster body had been attached was \u201csitting\u201d in Knoxville as he had told Dempster \u201cnot to ship it, to see what would happen. \u201d Later he was informed by Dempster, through Stewart acting for Northeast, its franchise dealer \u201cthat they had a chance to get rid of it for me, and that I could reorder it when I got out of the Service which would mean I would not be left with an old piece of equipment a year old when I got out.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s truck and the disposal unit were sold with his consent. He was paid directly for the truck, the unit was sold to another dealer at Northeast\u2019s cost so that it made no profit or commission on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Plaintiff also testified that he intended to resume his original plans to enter into the disposal business when he was released. He did not demand the $3,100 \u201cbecause I had hoped to start up again after my release from active duty, and I felt that if I left the money on deposit I would show good faith and I would have an easier time financing or getting going when I got out. \u201d He also testified that he knew that Dempster and Northeast had a commission arrangement. Plaintiff further testified that he never heard from Dempster as to whether he was still bound on the agreement or whether he owed it any \u201c money or anything. \u201d After he was discharged from military, service August 20, 1962, Stewart contacted him \u201c as to what I wanted to do. At that time I still didn\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t have the financing. I think a little later on we discussed the agreement . . . and I asked, I think around October ... for the return of my deposit. \u201d Plaintiff never had any understanding that Dempster would return his original down payment. It is agreed that there was never any agreement between plaintiff and Stewart to return the $3,100 or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Stewart testified that after plaintiff\u2019s truck and equipment were sold in January 1962, because Duane wanted to be protected, he entered an order for the same equipment so that plaintiff would not have to pay a higher price when he returned from service. Stewart also testified that while Duane was in the service, he received \u201c a letter indicating he could not get out soon enough, that he was just waiting for the time when he could go back into this business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">An examination of the evidence fails to reveal that it was so preponderant that the plaintiff\u2019s contract had been terminated that we must conclude that the Trial Court\u2019s finding and ruling that the contract had not terminated resulted from a failure of the Court to act properly or intelligently in its consideration of the evidence or that it was misled in arriving at an unreasonable conclusion from it. <em>Romano </em>v. Company, 95 N. H. 404, 406; <em>Condiles </em>v. <em>Waumbec Mills, </em>95 N. H. 127, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Stewart testified that Northeast\u2019s normal profit on the sale of this equipment was 20% of $14,355.38, the price of the body, and of $11,930 the price of the containers. This commission would be far in excess of the $3,100 deposit made by the plaintiff. The record does not compel a finding or ruling that the plaintiff has conclusively proved that the Court\u2019s denial of his right to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>his down payment will allow the defendant to retain an amount in excess of the damage it has suffered by plaintiff\u2019s failure to perform his contract. 5A Corbin, Contracts, <em>s. </em>1124, <em>pp. </em>13, 16; Restatement, Contracts, <em>s. </em>357 (1), <em>comments </em>a, g. <em>Cf.
