The pictures portrayed Williams and Perkins posing with a spread of money in similar denominations to those stolen from White during the robbery and Perkins posing individually with money. In one of the photos, White identified Perkins as the man \"that hit me with the gun and robbed me\" and Williams as \"the other guy that hit me <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"326\" href=\"#p326\" id=\"p326\">**326</a>and help[ed] Mooney rob me.\" Commonwealth's Ex. 1a (altering capitalization). Williams, Perkins's 15-year-old co-conspirator, also confirmed in a statement to police that he and Perkins were portrayed in the pictures and that the money came from the robbery of White.

Maiming and disfiguring are different concepts. At common law, maiming was defined as \"violently depriving another of the use of such of his members as may render him the less able, in fighting, either to defend himself or to annoy his adversary.\" 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *205. Blackstone gives several examples of maims, such as \"cutting off or disabling or weakening a man's hand or finger, or striking out his eye or foretooth,\" but \"cutting off his ear or nose, or the like, are not held to be [maims] at common law, because they do not weaken but only disfigure him.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645815\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/493/#p499\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> ; <em>see also</em> 1 William Hawkins &amp; John Curwood, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown 107 (8th ed. 1824). After a member of Parliament was attacked on the street by individuals who \"slit his nose in revenge for obnoxious words uttered by him in Parliament,\" an early English statute (the \"Coventry Act\") expanded the common-law offense of mayhem to include disfiguring a victim for the reason that \"cutting off [an] ear or nose did not constitute mayhem ... because it did not result in permanent disablement.\" Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, Criminal Law 238-40 (3d ed. 1982) (noting that \" '[m]aim' is the modern equivalent of the old word 'mayhem,' \" and further clarifying that the Coventry Act \"did not displace the English common law of mayhem (malicious maiming) but ... for the first time extended the crime to include disfigurement (if intentional)\" (footnotes omitted) ). The traditional definitions of maim, disfigure, and disable illustrate the differences between them. <em>See, e.g.</em> , Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (3d rev. ed. 1768) (defining maim as the \"[privation of some essential part\" or \"lameness, produced by a wound or amputation\"; disfigure as \"chang[ing] any thing to a worse form; to deform; to mangle\"; and disable as \"depriv[ing] of natural force,\" \"usefulness or efficacy\" or \"[t]o impair; to diminish[;] ...

Intending to rob White, Perkins and Williams were engaged in a concert of action. <em>See, e.g.</em> , Trial Tr. at 63 (stating that Williams \"continually\" told the detective that Perkins \"set[ ] up the robbery,\" which is \"where the money came from,\" and that he \"got a hundred dollars for his role\" in the crime); Commonwealth's Ex. 1a (depicting Williams and Perkins posing with a spread of money in similar denominations to those stolen from White, in which White identified Perkins as the man \"that hit me with the gun and robbed me\" and Williams as \"the other guy that hit me and help[ed] Mooney rob me\" (altering capitalization) ).

White had known her for 35 years, but he had only known Perkins<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for 3 to 4 months. At the time of his visit, White had \"a little over five thousand dollars\" in his pants pocket that he had received as \"back payment from social security disability\" and a \"wallet with [his] ID, Social Security Card,\" and a debit card that he used to cash his monthly benefits. J.A. at 8-9, 33. Perkins's mother, Perkins, Justin Williams, and \"another young lady\" were at the home when White arrived. <em>Id.</em> at 9-11. Perkins's mother was cooking, and Perkins, Williams, and the young lady were in a back room.</p><p id=\"p-10\">After speaking briefly with Perkins's mother, White went to the back room and talked to Perkins. They discussed Perkins's dog, and Perkins asked White for $20 to buy a dog bowl. White agreed, and he \"tried to reach in [his] pocket just to pull a twenty out because [he] didn't want everybody to see how much money [he] had.\" <em>Id.</em> at 12. The money in his pocket was \"folded like a wallet\" with \"hundreds on the outside and fifties and twenties on the inside,\" and when he \"was pulling the twenty out, some of it came over top of [his] pocket.\" <em>Id.</em> at 12-13. Williams saw the money come out of White's pocket and then left the room for \"five to ten <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"215\" href=\"#p215\" id=\"p215\">*215</a>minutes.\" <em>Id.</em> at 13. When Williams returned, he called Perkins out of the room, and they both went to the living room. About five minutes later, White left the back room to talk to Perkins's mother again, and he saw Perkins and Williams talking in the living room. When he passed them, \"they stopped talking until [he] got past them\" and then \"started back talking again.\" <em>Id.</em> at 13-14.</p><p id=\"p-11\">Shortly thereafter, Perkins's mother and White left to buy something at the nearby convenience store. Before leaving, White moved his money into his jacket pocket. \"It was getting dusk,\" and <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"325\" href=\"#p325\" id=\"p325\">**325</a>there was still some light outside. <em>Id.</em> at 16. At the edge of the apartment complex's parking lot, White \"felt somebody walking behind [him],\" and he turned around. <em>Id.</em> at 14. He saw Perkins \"holding a pistol up in the air like he was about to hit [White],\" and White smiled at Perkins who smiled back. <em>Id.</em> White did not think Perkins would do anything to him because he was walking with Perkins's mother. \"Within five to ten seconds\" after White turned back around and started walking again, Williams \"hit [him] from the right on the side of [his] face.\" <em>Id.</em> at 15. \"At the same time\" that Williams hit White, White \"got hit in the back of the head\" with what he believed to be the pistol that he had just seen Perkins carrying. <em>Id.</em> White testified that Perkins \"was on the left side\" with Williams \"on the right side\" and that the hit to the back of his head \"came from the direction\" of where Perkins was standing. <em>Id.</em> White did not recall how many more times he was hit because he lost consciousness. When White woke up, it was dark outside, and he discovered that his money and wallet were gone. Perkins's mother, Perkins, and Williams also were gone. White was in pain. His eye had swollen shut, his ear was bleeding, and his lips were swollen. He walked to the convenience store and asked the cashier to call an ambulance.</p><p id=\"p-12\">The ambulance came and took White to the hospital, and a report from the emergency room documented his injuries. White's \"right eye [was] swollen shut\" with \"slightly blurry\" vision and a \"small laceration on [the] eye lid,\" his \"upper and bottom lip[s] [were] swollen\" with \"bleeding controlled,\" and he had a \"small laceration by [his] right ear lobe\" with bleeding controlled. Def.'s Ex. 1, at 3 (Jan. 29, 2015). White reported being \"ass[a]ulted with [a] fist\" and \"hit in the occipital portion of his head with an unknown object.\" <em>Id.</em> at 2-3. He complained of \"facial pain, eye pain, [a] tooth feeling loose and not fitting together normally for him,\" and \"pain on [the] right side of [his] head.\" <em>Id.</em></p><p id=\"p-14\">Following a bench trial, the trial court stated that it found White's testimony \"extremely compelling and credible,\" J.A. at 52, and that it found the evidence sufficient to convict Perkins of malicious wounding based on White's testimony and the medical records submitted. The trial court also found the evidence sufficient to convict Perkins of robbery, conspiracy to commit a felony, use of a firearm during the commission of a robbery, and use of a firearm during the commission of a malicious wounding. The trial court sentenced Perkins to a total of 48 years of incarceration with 31 years suspended.</p><p id=\"p-15\">Perkins appealed to the Court of Appeals, which initially denied his petition in a one-judge, per curiam order, but a three-judge panel later granted his appeal. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed Perkins's convictions for robbery, conspiracy to commit a felony, and use of a firearm during the commission of a robbery but reversed his convictions for malicious wounding <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"216\" href=\"#p216\" id=\"p216\">*216</a>and use of a firearm during the commission of a malicious wounding. The Court of Appeals found that the trial court could not \"infer[ ] an intent to cause permanent disability\" and could not find \"an inference of malice on the part of [Perkins] ... from the extent of White's injuries\" because Williams also struck White \"when he was rendered unconscious.\" <em>Perkins v.

Thus, \"[i]t is proper for a court to consider not only the method by which a victim is wounded, but also the circumstances under which that injury was inflicted in determining whether there is sufficient evidence to prove an intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill.\" <em>Burkeen</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20Va.%20255\">286 Va. at 260-61</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20S.E.2d%20172\">749 S.E.2d at 175</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-26\">On appeal, Perkins argues only that the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to infer the requisite intent or mens rea of malicious wounding. He makes no argument on appeal concerning the actus reus of the crime-whether Perkins caused bodily injury to White by any means. Perkins's sufficiency argument on appeal, to the extent that it addresses the specific circumstances of this case, consists of a single paragraph:</p><p id=\"p-27\">In the case at bar, Perkins contends that the evidence failed to prove he acted with the requisite intent to be found guilty of malicious wounding. Perkins further contends that the evidence is insufficient to find him guilty of using a firearm in the commission of that offense. The evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Perkins committed malicious wounding. The trial court found credible White's testimony that Perkins struck White in the head with a gun. Although the force of this blow was sufficient to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"331\" href=\"#p331\" id=\"p331\">**331</a>injure White, one cannot say that this record contains sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have inferred an intent to cause permanent disability. Because White was also struck by Williams and fell to the ground when he was rendered unconscious, an inference of malice on the part of Perkins may not be drawn from the extent of White's injuries.</p><p id=\"p-28\">Appellee's Br. at 10-11. Perkins's counsel conceded on brief and at oral argument that the trial court found the evidence credible to support the finding that Perkins had struck White with a firearm and injured him. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 11; Oral Argument Audio at 10:13 to 10:29 (\"What we have is evidence from behind, the blow from the back of the head, presumably with the gun that knocks out the victim. There is no other evidence that my client did anything other than inflict this blow from behind.\"). Therefore, the only issue on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence as to the trial court's finding of malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill.</p><p id=\"p-29\">Intent can, and often must, be inferred from the act itself. \"The color of the act determines the complexion of the intent only in those situations where common experience has found a reliable correlation between a particular act and a corresponding intent.\" <em>Banovitch v. Commonwealth</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337918\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/196/210/#p217\">196 Va. 210</extracted-citation>, 217, <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20S.E.2d%20369\">83 S.E.2d 369</extracted-citation>, 373 (1954). In the judgment of a rational factfinder, whether that \"reliable correlation,\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20S.E.2d%20369\">id.</extracted-citation></em> , exists is purely a question of fact. In <em>Burkeen</em> , for example, we found that a rational factfinder could infer the intent to maliciously wound from a single blow to the face with a fist because \"the victim did nothing to provoke the attack, and he was hit with extreme force in a vulnerable area of his body while he was defenseless and not expecting such a blow.\" <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20Va.%20255\">286 Va. at 261</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20S.E.2d%20172\">749 S.E.2d at </extracted-citation>175 ;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see also</em> <em>Dominguez v. Pruett</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20Va.%20434\">287 Va. 434</extracted-citation>, 444-45, <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20S.E.2d%20911\">756 S.E.2d 911</extracted-citation>, 916-17 (2014).</p><p id=\"p-30\">Here, sitting as factfinder, the trial court made a similar inference about Perkins's intent. Unprovoked, Perkins struck White in a vulnerable area (the occipital region of his skull on the back of his head) with a firearm. Perkins delivered the blow while White <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"332\" href=\"#p332\" id=\"p332\">**332</a>was defenseless with his back turned <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"219\" href=\"#p219\" id=\"p219\">*219</a>to Perkins. White was knocked to the ground and rendered unconscious. His \"right eye [was] swollen shut\" with \"slightly blurry\" vision and a \"small laceration on [the] eye lid,\" his \"upper and bottom lip[s] [were] swollen,\" and he had a \"small laceration by [his] right ear lobe.\" Def.'s Ex. 1, at 3 (Jan. 29, 2015). He also complained of \"facial pain, eye pain, [a] tooth feeling loose and not fitting together normally for him,\" and \"pain on [the] right side of [his] head.\" <em>Id.</em> at 2-3.</p><p id=\"p-31\">What was true in <em>Burkeen</em> is true here. Given the circumstances of Perkins's attack on White, the trial court's inference that Perkins acted with a malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill cannot be considered arbitrary or unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under our standard of review, a \"factfinder may 'draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,' \" and those inferences cannot be upended on appeal unless we deem them \"so attenuated that they 'push \"into the realm of <em>non sequitur</em> .\" ' \" <em>Bowman</em> , 290 Va. at 500, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643881\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/851/#p494\">777 S.E.2d at 857</extracted-citation> (citations omitted). The trial court's inference in this case falls securely within the \"bell-shaped curve of reasonability.\" <em>Du v. Commonwealth</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20Va.%20555\">292 Va. 555</extracted-citation>, 564, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645815\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/493/#p499\">790 S.E.2d 493</extracted-citation>, 499 (2016) (citation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-33\">In sum, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that no rational factfinder could infer that Perkins attacked White with a malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill him. Violently striking an unsuspecting, defenseless victim, without provocation, in the back of the head with a firearm-with or without the combined violence of another acting in concert of action-supports the reasonable inference that the attacker had the intent to maliciously wound the victim in cases where, as here, the attack actually injured the victim.</p><p id=\"p-34\">We thus reverse and vacate, in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to Perkins's convictions for malicious wounding and use of a firearm during the commission of a malicious wounding, and we correspondingly enter final judgment reinstating those two convictions.</p><p id=\"p-35\">This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports and certified to the Court of Appeals of Virginia and the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
