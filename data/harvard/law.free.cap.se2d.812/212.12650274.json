The pictures portrayed Williams and Perkins posing with a spread of money in similar denominations to those stolen from White during the robbery and Perkins posing individually with money.

Maiming and disfiguring are different concepts. At common law, maiming was defined as \"violently depriving another of the use of such of his members as may render him the less able, in fighting, either to defend himself or to annoy his adversary.\" 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *205. Blackstone gives several examples of maims, such as \"cutting off or disabling or weakening a man's hand or finger, or striking out his eye or foretooth,\" but \"cutting off his ear or nose, or the like, are not held to be [maims] at common law, because they do not weaken but only disfigure him.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645815\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/493/#p499\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       ;\n       <em>\n        see also\n       </em>\n       1 William Hawkins &amp; John Curwood, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown 107 (8th ed. 1824). After a member of Parliament was attacked on the street by individuals who \"slit his nose in revenge for obnoxious words uttered by him in Parliament,\" an early English statute (the \"Coventry Act\") expanded the common-law offense of mayhem to include disfiguring a victim for the reason that \"cutting off [an] ear or nose did not constitute mayhem ... because it did not result in permanent disablement.\" Rollin M.

At the time of his visit, White had \"a little over five thousand dollars\" in his pants pocket that he had received as \"back payment from social security disability\" and a \"wallet with [his] ID, Social Security Card,\" and a debit card that he used to cash his monthly benefits. J.A. at 8-9, 33. Perkins's mother, Perkins, Justin Williams, and \"another young lady\" were at the home when White arrived.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 9-11. Perkins's mother was cooking, and Perkins, Williams, and the young lady were in a back room.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-10\">\n       After speaking briefly with Perkins's mother, White went to the back room and talked to Perkins. They discussed Perkins's dog, and Perkins asked White for $20 to buy a dog bowl. White agreed, and he \"tried to reach in [his] pocket just to pull a twenty out because [he] didn't want everybody to see how much money [he] had.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 12. The money in his pocket was \"folded like a wallet\" with \"hundreds on the outside and fifties and twenties on the inside,\" and when he \"was pulling the twenty out, some of it came over top of [his] pocket.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 12-13.

When Williams returned, he called Perkins out of the room, and they both went to the living room. About five minutes later, White left the back room to talk to Perkins's mother again, and he saw Perkins and Williams talking in the living room. When he passed them, \"they stopped talking until [he] got past them\" and then \"started back talking again.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 13-14.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-11\">\n       Shortly thereafter, Perkins's mother and White left to buy something at the nearby convenience store.

When White woke up, it was dark outside, and he discovered that his money and wallet were gone. Perkins's mother, Perkins, and Williams also were gone. White was in pain. His eye had swollen shut, his ear was bleeding, and his lips were swollen. He walked to the convenience store and asked the cashier to call an ambulance.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-12\">\n       The ambulance came and took White to the hospital, and a report from the emergency room documented his injuries.

The trial court also found the evidence sufficient to convict Perkins of robbery, conspiracy to commit a felony, use of a firearm during the commission of a robbery, and use of a firearm during the commission of a malicious wounding. The trial court sentenced Perkins to a total of 48 years of incarceration with 31 years suspended.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-15\">\n       Perkins appealed to the Court of Appeals, which initially denied his petition in a one-judge, per curiam order, but a three-judge panel later granted his appeal.

The Court of Appeals found that the trial court could not \"infer[ ] an intent to cause permanent disability\" and could not find \"an inference of malice on the part of [Perkins] ... from the extent of White's injuries\" because Williams also struck White \"when he was rendered unconscious.\"\n       <em>\n        Perkins v.

Perkins delivered the blow while White\n      was defenseless with his back turned\n      to Perkins. White was knocked to the ground and rendered unconscious. His \"right eye [was] swollen shut\" with \"slightly blurry\" vision and a \"small laceration on [the] eye lid,\" his \"upper and bottom lip[s] [were] swollen,\" and he had a \"small laceration by [his] right ear lobe.\" Def.'s Ex. 1, at 3 (Jan. 29, 2015). He also complained of \"facial pain, eye pain, [a] tooth feeling loose and not fitting together normally for him,\" and \"pain on [the] right side of [his] head.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 2-3.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-31\">\n       What was true in\n       <em>\n        Burkeen\n       </em>\n       is true here. Given the circumstances of Perkins's attack on White, the trial court's inference that Perkins acted with a malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill cannot be considered arbitrary or unreasonable.\n       <footnotemark>\n        5\n       </footnotemark>\n       Under our standard of review, a \"factfinder may 'draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,' \" and those inferences cannot be upended on appeal unless we deem them \"so attenuated that they 'push \"into the realm of\n       <em>\n        non sequitur\n       </em>\n       .\" ' \"\n       <em>\n        Bowman\n       </em>\n       , 290 Va. at 500,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643881\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/851/#p494\">\n        777 S.E.2d at 857\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (citations omitted). The trial court's inference in this case falls securely within the \"bell-shaped curve of reasonability.\"\n       <em>\n        Du v. Commonwealth\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20Va.%20555\">\n        292 Va. 555\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , 564,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645815\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/493/#p499\">\n        790 S.E.2d 493\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , 499 (2016) (citation omitted).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-33\">\n       In sum, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that no rational factfinder could infer that Perkins attacked White with a malicious intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill him. Violently striking an unsuspecting, defenseless victim, without provocation, in the back of the head with a firearm-with or without the combined violence of another acting in concert of action-supports the reasonable inference that the attacker had the intent to maliciously wound the victim in cases where, as here, the attack actually injured the victim.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-34\">\n       We thus reverse and vacate, in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to Perkins's convictions for malicious wounding and use of a firearm during the commission of a malicious wounding, and we correspondingly enter final judgment reinstating those two convictions.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-35\">\n       This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports and certified to the Court of Appeals of Virginia and the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News.\n      </p>\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
