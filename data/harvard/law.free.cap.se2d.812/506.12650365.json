In this case, the undisputed facts found in the pleadings do not establish that the bank was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, because they do not demonstrate all of the essential elements of the bank's claim.

The deed secured a loan to Pamela Delpiano, and the parties to that deed were Pamela Delpiano and the bank's predecessor in interest. \"Upon [the bank's] information and belief, as the result of a clerical error and mutual mistake that was unknown to and/or inadvertently overlooked by the parties at the time that the [s]ecurity [d]eed was signed, the signature line for the unofficial witness to P[amela] Del[p]iano's signature was left blank.\" Other documents signed at the same time contained the signature of an unofficial witness. \"Upon [the bank's] information and belief, [Pamela] Del[p]iano and [the bank's predecessor in interest] intended for the [s]ecurity [d]eed to\n     secure the [l]oan and to provide [the bank's predecessor in interest] with a first priority security interest in the\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Daniel Delpiano, the opposing party in this case, filed a verified answer and an amended answer.

He either denied the remaining allegations of the bank's complaint outright or stated that he could neither admit nor deny those allegations. He also asserted numerous affirmative defenses, including that the statute of limitation barred the bank's claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      At this stage of the proceedings, the bank has \"failed to show that [it is] clearly entitled to judgment,\"\n      <em>\n       Sherman v.

To prevail, the bank bears the burden of showing \"by clear, unequivocal and decisive evidence that both [parties to the security deed] made a mutual mistake in preparation of the instrument and that the [bank] was not so negligent in executing the instrument or discovering any mistake appearing therein as to be estopped to ask for reformation.\"\n      <em>\n       Cox v.
