According to the evidence taken in the light most favorable to Defendant, there was a path between the house and Bones that permitted the drive to be conducted without travelling on any public roadways. At approximately midnight, Heather decided she wanted to leave Bones. Defendant went outside while Heather went to the restroom, and an altercation occurred between Defendant and some men in the Bones parking lot (the \"parking lot\"). When Heather walked out of Bones and onto the parking lot, she witnessed the altercation. The situation escalated and one of the men drew a handgun and threatened Defendant, causing Defendant and Heather to get into the golf cart, and Defendant then drove away from the parking lot.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  Wake County Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Legan (\"Deputy Legan\") was on patrol shortly after midnight on 2 March 2014, when he observed the golf cart heading toward him. Deputy Legan testified that the golf cart was being driven without lights and was straddling the center line on Old U.S. Highway 1. Deputy Legan immediately turned around and drove to intercept the golf cart. By the time Deputy Legan activated his lights and caught up to the golf cart, it had turned off of the highway onto a dirt path. Deputy Legan noticed the odor of alcohol emanating from Defendant and that Defendant's speech was slurred and his eyes were \"red and bloodshot[.]\" Additional deputies arrived at the scene. Defendant was administered tests for impairment and, based upon all the factors Deputy Legan observed, Defendant was arrested for driving while impaired and driving left of the center line.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  Defendant was found guilty of driving while impaired and responsible for driving left of center in district court on 11 June 2015, and he appealed to superior court. Defendant was tried before a jury at the 6 April 2016 session of Wake County Superior Court, and was again found guilty of driving while impaired and responsible for driving left of center.

However, the elements in\n   <em>\n    Hudgins\n   </em>\n   do not track the language in N.C.P.I. Crim. 310.10, the pattern jury instruction for duress. The State argued the required elements as follows: \"That it first must be a reasonable act taken to ... protect the life, limb, or health of a person. .... And to the third action, that [there] must be no other acceptable choices available.\" The State then suggested that this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Cooke\n   </em>\n   recognized a fourth element: \"That [D]efendant [continued to face] threatening conduct of any kind at the time the officer saw him while driving while intoxicated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Despite the fact that the elements discussed by the parties at the hearing were those for necessity, the trial court, clearly relying on language from N.C.P.I. Crim. 310.10, denied Defendant's request to instruct the jury on the defense of necessity based upon its determination that no evidence had been presented demonstrating that Defendant was in actual \"fear\" at the time he drove the golf cart on the highway:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [THE COURT:] While the issue appears on it sure to be quite detailed and involved really,\n   <em>\n    a look at the instruction\n   </em>\n   makes it fairly simple in terms of the resolution here.

Unquote.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Of course there is reasonable dispute concerning the length of time that was involved here in terms of when\n   that fear still is recognized by the law to be present and existent in terms of the length of time or the length of participation as to where there was a fear that began as opposed to the point where it was still considered to be ongoing until such time as the deputy effected the stop here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   There's also the aspect as to whether or not, as the [S]tate argues as well, whether there was such a serious threat that would connote immediate death or serious bodily injury being a potential outcome but for [ ] [D]efendant's actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    But all of that presupposes something that's not even in evidence, and that is, in terms of looking at the plain language of the instruction, [ ] [D]efendant will not be guilty of this crime if his actions were caused by reasonable fear.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    There is no evidence that [ ] [D]efendant was in fear.\n   </em>\n   There's evidence that the testimony was his wife was in fear, but there's\n   <em>\n    no evidence that [ ] [D]efendant was in fear\n   </em>\n   for me to consider over this instruction being given, so as to instruction about that, this point 310.30 will not be given because there is no evidence that [ ] [D]efendant had a reasonable fear which would have him to commit the alleged crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL:] To say that the only way that [Defendant] can mount the defense is to actually hear from [him] would be a violation of his right against self-incrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: I didn't say that [Defendant] had to testify that he was in fear. I said there is\n   <em>\n    no evidence that he was in fear\n   </em>\n   , whether that would come from him or anybody else that he was in fear. But you can make your statements for the record,\n   but I've made the decision. (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court clearly considered there to be an additional element requiring that Defendant was motivated by emotional \"fear\" to drive the golf cart on the highway. Our case law does not include fear as an element of the defense of necessity. \"A defendant must prove three elements to establish the defense of necessity: (1) reasonable action, (2) taken to protect life, limb, or health of a person, and (3) no other acceptable\n   choices available.\"\n   <em>\n    Hudgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8413594\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/167/705/#p710\">\n    167 N.C.

The elements of necessity are that the defendant engaged in \"(1) reasonable [though illegal] action, (2) taken to protect life, limb, or health of a person, and (3) no other acceptable choices [were] available[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hudgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8413594\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/167/705/#p710\">\n    167 N.C.

The elements of duress are (1) that a defendant's illegal \" 'actions were caused by [the defendant's] reasonable fear that [the defendant or another] would suffer' \" (2) \" 'immediate death or serious bodily injury[,]' \" (3) \" 'if [the defendant had] not so act[ed][,]' \" and (4) the defendant had no \"reasonable opportunity to avoid doing the [illegal] act without undue exposure to death or serious bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Smarr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353786\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/146/44/#p54\">\n    146 N.C.

In potential contrast, the first element of duress, as established by precedent and as presented in N.C.P.I. Crim. 310.10, suggests a\n   subjective standard-that the defendant acted based upon\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   \"reasonable fear that [he or another] would suffer immediate death or serious bodily injury\" absent his actions.\n   <em>\n    Smarr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11353786\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/146/44/#p54\">\n    146 N.C.

During the extended course of the crimes against Oxendine, defendant had several opportunities to report that he had been\n   <em>\n    forced by duress\n   </em>\n   to commit these crimes and to seek help.

Additional Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Defendant was as follows: Defendant and Heather lived in close proximity to Bones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There were \"paths\" that connected the house with Bones, and it was possible to travel between the house and Bones without ever travelling on any public roadway. Defendant and Heather had utilized the paths on\n   multiple prior occasions, either by walking or by driving the golf cart. The purpose of utilizing the golf cart and the paths was to avoid driving a car, and further to avoid the use of public roadways, after consuming alcohol. Bones attracted varied clientele, and had become \"kind of a rough place\" where there could be \"fights and it was just very unpredictable.\" Deputy Legan testified that he had known Bones \"to be an establishment that serves the biker crowd.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant and Heather arrived at Bones' parking lot in the golf cart at approximately 9:30 p.m. on 1 March 2014. Heather testified that they planned on returning home \"[t]he same way we came. I knew I probably would be driving the golf cart home, but just the same we came through the back path.\" Heather testified that she would probably drive home because it was likely that Defendant would drink more alcohol than she. According to Heather, as the night progressed the atmosphere at Bones \"became intense; it became kind of mean. It just wasn't a place I wanted to be in anymore.\" Heather testified that while at Bones-a period of less than three hours-she consumed \"more than four, less than seven\" alcoholic drinks, and that she did not eat anything during that time because she had eaten dinner before leaving the house that evening. Defendant and Heather decided to leave shortly after midnight, 2 March 2014, and Heather went to the restroom while Defendant went outside to wait for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When Heather walked out of Bones, she noticed Defendant was in the parking lot arguing with \"several guys\" that she did not know. There were at least three men with whom Defendant was arguing, and there may have been as many as five. The arguing was intense, involving shouting and cursing, and Defendant eventually punched one of the men (\"the man\"), who was in his \"late 20s, maybe early 30s[,]\" causing the man to fall to the ground. Defendant later described the man to Deputy Legan as \"the baddest motherf_cker in the bar[.]\" Heather further testified that when the man \"got up he was extremely red-faced and he pulled a gun from his waistband\" and \"[r]aised it in the air.\" Heather testified that Defendant did not have a gun and, that as far as she knew, Bones did not have security guards or bouncers. Heather testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   It got very, very chaotic at that point. There was a woman [who] was next to me who was-she said \"you need to get out of here. He's crazy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Defendant] had turned around\n   and was screaming at me \"go, go, go, go, go.\" We got going. When [the man] pulled the gun I just wanted to get out of there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Heather further testified that, after the man raised the gun, she started screaming and just \"wanted to get out.\" When she saw the gun she wanted \"[j]ust to get away. To get-to get away. That's all I wanted.\" Heather testified that she was \"not a runner\" because she had \"broken [her] leg area\" at some time in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At trial, the following colloquy transpired between Heather and Defendant's attorney:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Are you aware of what [sic] he was going to shoot at you, or anyone else for that matter, do you recognize at this point that [Defendant] was sort of the target of this guy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. What did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. I got in the golf cart and we left.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant still had the keys to the golf cart, so he got behind the wheel and Heather got in the passenger seat. The parking lot was packed with vehicles and people, which prevented Defendant from driving around the back of Bones toward the path they had taken from the house earlier that evening. Heather was not really thinking about what direction they should drive because she was still focused on the \"altercation\" that had just taken place; however, she saw that the way to the back path was blocked and therefore \"was not the fastest out.\" Defendant \"pulled out of the parking lot the only way we could in the golf cart.\" When asked on cross-examination whether she believed it was safer for them to drive the golf cart through the parking lot and onto the road instead of running away, Heather stated: \"The golf cart can go\n   faster than I can go. It was a split-second decision and it seemed the only option.\" Heather was asked the following, and then answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. ... Do you have any doubt that had you not taken the actions that [Defendant] and you took that evening in getting into that golf cart and fleeing through the open area of the parking lot, that you might have been hurt or killed by that person who pulled the gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. I have no doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Heather testified that she did not notice Deputy Legan until after they had turned off the road and onto the dirt path to head home. She stated: \"We went along the road along the clump of trees and then on to the dirt path and that's where we were pulled over.\" Where they had turned onto the dirt path was a short distance from Bones' parking lot, and Heather first saw Deputy Legan \"within minutes\" of the altercation in the parking lot. Although she did not know, Heather assumed they had been pulled over initially because of the altercation in the Bones' parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Deputy Legan testified that he passed Defendant driving the golf cart on Old U.S. 1, turned around in the Bones parking lot, which was crowded, then pulled up behind Defendant after Defendant had turned the golf cart off the highway and onto a dirt path that connected Old U.S. 1 to Friendship Road. Deputy Legan testified that the distance from Bones parking lot to where Defendant stopped \"was no more than point two-tenths of a mile[,]\" and that Defendant was stopped \"maybe fifty to a hundred feet\" down the dirt path connecting Old U.S. 1 highway to Friendship Road. A map of the relevant area, introduced for illustrative purposes, shows that the distance from the north end of the parking lot to the dirt path was just over 500 feet, or approximately one-tenth of a mile, and the spot marked on the map as the place Deputy Legan first contacted Defendant was approximately fifty feet down the dirt path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Heather testified that after being pulled over:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   It was all happening so fast. It was just very chaotic. I was telling the deputy what I was thinking. I told him everything that just happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. When you say \"everything\" what does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. The fight, the gun, the chaos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Did you think that there was any other reasonable solution to what you and [Defendant] did in fleeing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. No, I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Had you been able to get back through that grass,-was that your intention, to drive through the night, you know, either have you drive or [Defendant] drive on a grass path?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. The way we came, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. You have cars, actual cars?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. Vehicles, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. Why did you choose to drive basically a glorified golf cart on that evening?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Because it was not far. It's, you know, a close drive and if we're going to be drinking it's probably the smarter thing to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Heather testified that she did not talk much to the deputies because she \"was crying and was upset[.]\" Heather did not know if Defendant discussed the gun with the deputies, but she clearly heard Defendant tell them about the fight. Deputy Legan testified Defendant stated he had been in an altercation and that Deputy Legan would probably be receiving a call about it. Deputy Legan testified that Defendant had referred to the man as \"the baddest motherf_cker in the bar[,]\" and \"seemed a bit agitated\" at the time. Defendant exercised his right not to testify at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   C. Elements of Necessity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Action Taken to Protect Life, Limb, or Health\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We address the first two elements of the defense of necessity-(1) reasonable action\n   (2) taken to protect life, limb, or health of a person-together. Defendant did not testify at trial; therefore, all evidence relating to the reasonableness of the actions he took, and the legitimacy of his concerns that people's lives were in jeopardy, was introduced through the testimony of Heather and Deputy Legan. When viewed in the light most favorable to Defendant, this testimony indicated the following: Bones attracted a potentially rough clientele, including, according to Deputy Legan, \"the biker crowd.\" It was not unusual for fights to break out between patrons, but Bones employed no obvious security. While Defendant was at Bones for close to three hours on the evening of 1 March 2014 and into the early morning of 2 March 2014, the atmosphere in Bones became increasingly \"intense\" and \"mean\" to a degree that Heather testified she wanted to leave, and Defendant agreed that they should do so. Defendant got into an argument with between three and five men in the Bones' parking lot which escalated from arguing to shouting and cursing. The main individual with whom Defendant was arguing, \"the man,\" was in his late twenties to early thirties, and Defendant described him as \"the baddest motherf_cker in the bar[.]\" This altercation escalated to the point that Defendant punched the man,\n   knocking him to the ground. The man got back up, \"extremely red-faced,\" drew a handgun from his waistband, and threatened Defendant.

For example, the State argues that Defendant (and Heather) were capable of running and that the golf cart could not travel much more than five miles-per-hour. Based upon this evidence favorable to the State, the State argues that Defendant and Heather should have run away instead of having Defendant drive, or that, if Defendant was going to drive, he should have taken a route that did not involve the highway. However, Heather testified they would have driven the golf cart back the way they had come had that had been an option-and thereby would have avoided driving on the highway-but the route that would have allowed them to avoid driving on the highway was blocked by automobiles and people. Heather testified she did not believe there \"was any other reasonable solution to what [she and Defendant] did in fleeing[.]\" Heather also testified that Defendant \"pulled out of the parking lot\n   <em>\n    the only way we could\n   </em>\n   in the golf cart.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In support of another argument, the State improperly quotes Deputy Legan's testimony that Heather did not appear to have been intoxicated. The State argues that even if it was reasonable to use the golf cart to get away, and even if the only available open route was onto the highway for at least a brief period, it should have been the more sober Heather, not Defendant, who did the driving. However, there was evidence presented strongly suggesting Heather would have been intoxicated at the relevant time, and it was for the jury, not the trial court, to weigh that evidence. Heather testified that while at Bones-a period of less than three hours-she consumed \"more than four, less than seven\" alcoholic drinks, and that she did not eat anything during that time because she had \"eaten dinner before leaving the house that evening.\" The jury could use their common sense and lay knowledge to determine\n   that Heather was also likely intoxicated at the time of the incident. Defendant's evidence was that he had the keys to the golf cart; that he was a military veteran trained to make quick, reasoned decisions in a crisis; that Heather was panicking, as evidenced by her testimony that she was screaming and not really focusing on anything other than the desire to get away; that Defendant instigated their departure from the scene by yelling at Heather \"go, go, go, go, go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   At the charge conference, the State argued the following in support of denying the necessity instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Well, [Defendant's] witness[ ] has stated there was nothing else we could do. It's still in the [trial c]ourt's view to\n   analyze the circumstances and come to that same conclusion. In this case it's not been shown why it was not simply available to these individuals who their own witness testified we can both run. The bar was still-that they could have gone back into the bar or simply run and disperse into this crowd of people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   It was not the province of the trial court to analyze the evidence and come to a conclusion concerning whether driving away in the golf cart constituted a reasonable option for Defendant, or whether running into the crowd, or back into Bones, constituted viable alternatives to driving away in the golf cart. Those decisions, based on credibility analysis and weighing of the evidence, were the sole province of the jury. The only role of the trial court at that point was to determine whether sufficient evidence had been admitted upon which\n   <em>\n    the jury\n   </em>\n   could decide in favor of Defendant on those contested issues. Though the jury\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have rejected some or all of the testimony favorable to Defendant, it was the province of the jury to make those determinations. Just like the trial court in this instance, this Court cannot make any determinations concerning the weight to be given Defendant's evidence, or the credibility of any witness. After reviewing the facts before us in the light most favorable to Defendant, we hold that Defendant met his burden of introducing \"evidence that a reasonable person would find sufficient to support\" the \"no other acceptable choices\" element.\n   <em>\n    Hudgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8413594\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/167/705/#p710\">\n    167 N.C.

I note the other evidence which strongly suggests that Defendant was not in fear; however, it is not our job to weigh the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   I do find some merit in the State's argument that driving the golf cart in the direction of and then past the gunman to escape was not the only acceptable means of escape, but that Defendant and his wife could have simply run in the other direction. However, the evidence also showed that Defendant's wife was not a strong runner, that they both had been drinking, and that the gunman was much younger (around 30 years old) than Defendant (who was 43). Based on this evidence, I must again conclude that it is reasonably possible that a juror could have concluded that Defendant reasonably determined that running was not a reasonable alternative to driving the golf cart in their quest to reach a safe location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In conclusion, I agree with the majority's determination that the trial court should have given the requested instruction and that its failure to do so warrants a new trial.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
