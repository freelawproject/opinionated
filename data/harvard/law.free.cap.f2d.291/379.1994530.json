Vermont claims that the federal court had no power to remove the case from the state court and that therefore its injunction was a nullity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">The Rutland Railway was shut down on September 16, 1960 when its employees went out on strike. On the seventeenth of October, the State of Vermont, alleging that further interruption of railroad service would wreak havoc with the economic welfare, the health and comfort of the state and its citizens, brought an action against the railroad asking the Rutland Chancery Court to appoint a receiver until \u201cthe Railway * * * resume [s] operations under the direction of its own officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">On the following day, the railroad successfully petitioned the district court for \u201cremoval\u201d of the receivership from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the state to the federal court and, after the case had been removed, sought and obtained, on October 19 and October 27, a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction against \u201cany conduct in execution of the purported receivership.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order stated that the receivership, and the procedure by which it was granted, deprived the railway of property without due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action was taken despite Vermont\u2019s vigorous attack upon the jurisdiction of the district court, which attack was formally presented by a motion made on October 25 to remand the case to the state court. At a hearing the following day, October 26, the district court denied the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">It is clear that the district court should have granted the motion to remand and that it was without jurisdiction to take any action in the case. The parties were not of diverse citizenship and the case did not arise under \u201cthe Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States\u201d as the removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, required. Cf. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Under the removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b), where there is no diversity, a defendant\u2019s power to remove turns upon whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim arises under federal law within the meaning of \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 216, particularly at 233-234 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Defendant\u2019s petition for removal stated that the receivership took its property without due process of law and interfered with the allegedly exclusive federal power over railway labor disputes created by the Railroad Labor Act. Both the constitutional and the statutory defense could of course be pressed in the state courts and ultimately perhaps might be decided by the United States Supreme Court which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 if federal law has been \u201cdrawn in question.\u201d Cf. In re Winn, 1909, 213 U.S. 458, 465, 29 S.Ct. 515, 53 L.Ed. 873. But the claims could be asserted only as a defense to Vermont\u2019s petition for the receivership and thus their existence does not meet the requirement of \u00a7 1441 that the plaintiff\u2019s claim be one \u201carising under\u201d federal law. It is well settled that the likelihood \u2014 even the certainty \u2014 that federal law will enter a case by way of defense does not confer jurisdiction upon the district courts. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Mottley, 1908, 211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126; In re Winn, supra; see generally Mishkin, The Federal \u201cQuestion\u201d in the District Courts, 53 Col.L.Rev. 157 (1953); Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, pp. 748-777.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Defendants also claimed that Vermont\u2019s receivership petition disclosed \u201cthat the action in the State Court arose under * * * the Interstate Commerce Act [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq.].\u201d It did not; although the petition did reveal that the Rutland was an interstate railway, Vermont did not rely upon a right created by the federal statute but rather it asserted its own sovereignty.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Since the district court had no jurisdiction all proceedings taken in it were a nullity, the injunction must be vacated and the case remanded to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Rutland County Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Rutland County Court of Chancery.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">. The railroad never filed an answer to Vermont\u2019s receivership petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Immediately following issuance of the permanent injunction against the receivership, Judge Gibson enjoined the strike and referred the dispute between the railroad and the striking unions to the National Railroad Adjustment Board. Rutland Ry. Corp. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng., D.C.D.Vt.1960, 188 F.Supp. 721. Suing under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq. the railroad had sought to enjoin the strike; the union in reply asked for an injunction directing the railroad to preserve the status quo with respect to certain proposed changes in working conditions, which proposals had precipitated the strike. An appeal from this decision is now pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-12\">.
