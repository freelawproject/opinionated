The Secretary of Labor brought this action, under Section 17, to obtain such injunctive relief. This court has jurisdiction over the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Appellees operate a \u201cletter shop.\u201d Theirs is a service enterprise which involves the addressing, stuffing and mailing of letters for various business establishments. The court below found that appellees\u2019 business operation comes under the Fair Labor Standards Act since its employees (who do their work at home) produce goods for interstate commerce. The issue was whether appellees\u2019 business is taken out of the Act by the exemption provisions of Section 13(a) (2) (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (2)). To qualify for the exemption under Section 13(a), as amended in 1949, appellees must meet three tests:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">1. Fifty per cent of the annual dollar volume of sales (of goods and/or services) must be made within the state. It is conceded that this test has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">2. Seventy-five per cent of the sales volume must <em>not </em>be for resale. This test, concededly, has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">3. Seventy-five per cent of the sales must be recognized, within the industry, as retail sales. On this issue there is dispute, and the court resolved that dispute adversely to the Secretary of Labor,</p>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">The trial court recognized, however, that this determination did not dispose of the case. The Secretary of Labor contended, and the trial court agreed, that some businesses are \u201cby their nature \u2018outside the retail concept.\u2019 \u201d With respect to such businesses the court does not reach the point of applying the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>mentioned tests; even if such a business meets those tests it cannot qualify for the Section 13 exemption. This \u201coutside the retail concept\u201d is recognized in Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., 1959, 359 U.S. 290, 79 S.Ct. 756, 3 L.Ed.2d 815. The court below, however, held that appellees\u2019 business is not outside \u201cthe retail concept.\u201d Thus appellees\u2019 business qualified for the exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act and the court gave judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">There are, then, two issues before this court on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">One \u2014 Is appellees\u2019 business, by nature, outside the retail concept?</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Two \u2014 Are seventy-five per cent of appellees\u2019 sales recognized as retail in the letter shop industry?</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\n<em>1. The \u201cretail concept.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The precise holding in Kentucky Finance does not control this case. The court there held only that credit companies do not qualify for the Section 13 exemption. We are dealing here with a \u201cletter shop,\u201d and, of course, letter shops are not credit companies. But the Court in Kentucky Finance did set forth the principles which guided its determination, and those principles are applicable here. The trial court correctly summarized the controlling principle established by Kentucky Finance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201c[I]ts holding is that where it has been established by pre-amendment [i. e., pre-1949] interpretation that an industry is not retail, unless that classification was due to an application of the business use test, that industry is not now exempt.\u201d Mitchell v. Roberts, D.C.S.D.Cal.1959, 179 F.Supp. 247, 249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">The crucial question in the case at bar, then, is the pre-1949 status of letter shops. The court below held, without explanation that the \u201cpre-amendment [i. e., pre-1849] status of letter shops -\u00bb * * (joes noj; indicate that they are not retail.\u201d (Ibid.) In this we find error. This determination does not, as appellees apparently suggest, raise a factual question to be determined by the weighing and evaluation of testimonial evidence. The characterization of appellees\u2019 business as a letter shop does involve factual considerations, but once this determination is made, as it was by the trial court, the issue is one of law: Were letter shops, by pre-1949 standards (other than the \u201cconsumer use\u201d standard) considered to be retail businesses ?</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">In reaching its conclusion regarding the pre-1949 status of credit companies, the Supreme Court in Kentucky Finance relied upon a ruling in the 1942 Wage and Hour Manual, p. 326, 29-31 (see 359 U.S. 292, n. 1, 79 S.Ct. 758).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The very same paragraphs of the pre-1949 rulings to which the Supreme Court referred in Kentucky Finance establish that mailing and addressing establishments are not retail businesses. These regulations were, prior to 1949, applied by a New York court to hold that a mail service enterprise comparable to appellees\u2019 was not a retail business. Hanzely v. Hooven Letters, City Ct., 44 N.Y.S.2d 398, 400. Appellees attempt to distinguish the case because in it the employee\u2019s complaint (for overtime compensation) was dismissed on the merits. It is true that the court rejected the employee\u2019s claim on the ground that the employee had failed to prove that he had not been compensated for his overtime work. But on the issue relevant here\u2014 whether a mail service establishment is outside the act \u2014 the case is directly in point, and decided favorably to appellant. It is also somewhat significant that a later case held the addressing of envelopes for mailing to be subject to the requirements of the Act, although the opinion makes no reference to a possible Section 13 exemption. Walling v. Sieving, d. b. a. Accurate Addressing Service, N.D.Ill.1946, 11 Labor Cases \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>63,098, 5 W.H. Cases 1009 (not officially-reported) .</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In our opinion, then, the trial court erred in characterizing the pre1949 status of mailing shops to be \u201cretail.\u201d There is no indication that the pre-1949 classification of letter shops was based on the ground that such shops sell their services to businesses rather than to individuals for personal consumption. Thus the pre-1949 classification of letter shops has not been shown to be founded upon the \u201cbusiness use test,\u201d which Congress specifically rejected in 1949 (see Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., supra at pages 293-294, 79 S.Ct. at page 758). If this view of the case is accepted, no further investigation is required. Appellees\u2019 business is subject to regulation under the Fair Labor Standards Act unless it is excepted by Section 13(a) (2), and, if by its nature appellees\u2019 business is \u201coutside the retail concept,\u201d the Section 13 exception cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Because of our views on this first issue, we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\">. This ruling, the Court noted, (ibid.) has been carried over, under the amended version of Section 13, as a part of the current regulations, 29 C.F.R. 1961 Supp. \u00a7 779.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
