The action pleaded by appellants is essentially to establish the right of the United States and those with whom it deals to be relieved from an unconstitutionally discriminatory tax and to assert the constitutional immunity of the United States from taxation by the state. The United States is the proper party to prosecute an action to protect its sov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ereign rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is the real party in interest. If immunity from the state tax exists, it is in behalf of the United States. The exaction of the tax can only be resisted on such ground by the government or one who stands in its shoes. If the taxpayer has any right to assert the government\u2019s immunity, it is a \u201cderivative one\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"> The United States is not foreclosed from prosecuting this kind of action by Section 1341 of Title 28 U.S.C. A. While this section provides in substance that the district courts shall not enjoin the assessment of any tax under state law where \u201ca plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State\u201d, we find no case construing this section to bar the United States from applying to her own courts for protection against an unconstitutional state tax. Application of the established rule that the sovereign is not bound by its legislative restrictions against the exercise of remedial rights unless such an intent is clearly expressed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> buttressed by a consideration of the legislative history of the Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has persuaded uniform decision that it was not intended to apply to the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The refusal of the district court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction was a clear abuse of discretion. \u201cThe doctrine of abstention, under which a District Court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction, is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it. Abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest.\u201d Allegheny County v. Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185, 188, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1063, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163. \u201cWhen the validity of a state statute, challenged under the United States Constitution, is properly for adjudication before a United States District Court, reference to the state courts for construction of the statute should not automatically be made.\u201d N. A. A. C. P. v. Bennett, 360 U.S. 471, 79 S.Ct. 1192, 3 L.Ed.2d 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">If the state statute was fairly open to interpretation that would moot the constitutional question or even change the nature of the problem as in Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152, the postponement to await state court litigation would be warranted and perhaps even required. But this is not our case. The New Mexico statute in express terms makes the tax applicable to sales of metalliferous mineral ores to the United States, its departments or agencies, and exempts any such sales made to the State of New Mexico and to societies, hospitals, fraternal or religious organizations not organized for profit. The statute is unambiguous and leaves no room for construction. The rule of abstention on grounds of comity with the states does not permit the federal district courts to defer to the state courts for decision of federal constitutional questions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not find here any .exceptional circumstances justifying dismissal of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>to abide the outcome of present or proposed litigation in the state courts of New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Reversed with directions to entertain the suit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">.

Other grounds were stated by the Court as a basis for its conclusions that jurisdiction was lacking, but such grounds are conceded to be without merit by appellees. Indeed, the appellees suggest that the only real question presented here is whether the Court abused its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of comity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">.
