S. District Judge for the Northern and Southern Districts of West Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">This is a petition under 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended (61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.) for enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Respondent employed two men in the manufacture of instrument cases at a Brooklyn plant and two others at a second plant nearby. A representation election was won by the union (Seafarers International) by a vote of three to one. Bennett, president of respondent, immediately discharged the two employees at the second plant, Washington and Harvin. After the union was certified, Bennett asked for a copy of a union contract, but declined to sit down and bargain with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Respondent\u2019s attack is upon the findings of discharge for union activity and of refusal to bargain. The attack must fail. There was testimony by the discharged employees that Bennett had, prior to the election, urged the workers to \u201cvote no and we will get rid of the bums\u201d; that immediately after the adverse result of the election, Bennett had employees Harvin and Washington \u201clock up\u201d and go home; and that he told <em>them </em>at that time if they wanted to work: they would have to \u201cdrop the union.\u2019\u201d There was further testimony that after the election, but before formal certification, Bennett said he would not sit down with the union \u201cthen or any other time.\u201d Seafarers\u2019 organizer Quinnonez stated that a later telephone request to bargain, after certification, was turned down flatly by Bennett. A letter sent that same day reiterating the union\u2019s request for a bargaining conference was answered thus: \u201cWe are always anxious to improve working conditions in our plant. If you have suggestions please advise us.\u201d Quinnonez testified that in response to still further union requests; a few months later Bennett, though friendlier, was evasive and unwilling definitely to commit himself to the bargaining table. Although Bennett himself sharply controverts much of this evidence, the recommendations of the trial examiner, adopted by the Board, were founded upon sufficient evidence of eye-witnesses, if believed, to establish the discriminatory purpose of the discharges and to establish the lack of good faith intent to bargain in Bennett\u2019s procrastination in meeting with the union. On the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the findings. This is enough. \u00a7 10(e), National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456; N. L. R. B. v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc., 2 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 696. The terms of the order are justified by the findings. The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
