Here proof of criminal knowledge and intent was crucial. But there was ample evidence to convict, including defendant\u2019s specific notice of the repossession, his knowledge that the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>had <em>been </em>repaired from its smashed-up condition in his hands, his attempts to repurchase or \u201credeem\u201d it, and so on. And the issue was carefully formulated for the jury in the court\u2019s meticulous charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The defendant also makes an attack on the conditional vendor\u2019s title, claiming that the sale was made on a Sunday and that blanks in the contract were not properly filled \u2014 all in violation of Connecticut state law. But the prosecution claimed and presented evidence supporting the conclusion that the contract was \u25a0completed, but not until the next day, Monday; and again the judge carefully \u2022presented the issue to the jury. Its verdict of guilt makes unnecessary consideration of the question whether defendant could thus attack the transfer he himself had made and acted upon, particularly where there had been a later transfer to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">We are indebted to assigned counsel for their able representation of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
