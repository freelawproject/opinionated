The complaint alleged that such sum was due the United States on account of overpayments made to appellant\u2019s mother as a Class E Voluntary Allotment for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>no deduction was made from appellant\u2019s pay. Appellant denied that he owed such sum and that he refused to pay it. In addition to his answer containing denials and affirmative defenses, he filed a counterclaim against the United States alleging that he was damaged in the amount of $31,176.00 because he had been wrongfully, illegally and improperly discharged from the postal service on August 31, 1953. This claim was subsequently reduced to $10,000.00 by the amended answer, presumably for the purpose of bringing the amount of the counterclaim within the limitations of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346. His answer and counterclaim were filed on December 17, 1959. The United States replied to the counterclaim and alleged, inter alia, that the court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the counterclaim. The government\u2019s subsequent motion for summary judgment was granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The issues to be decided in this appeal are whether the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate appellant\u2019s counterclaim and whether that question was properly raised by appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A motion for summary judgment lies whenever there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. It is not a substitute for a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. If the court lacks jurisdiction it cannot render a judgment but must enter an order dismissing the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not dwell on the improper manner in which the jurisdictional issue was invoked. It is elementary that the court\u2019s first duty is to determine its jurisdiction to entertain and decide a case on its merits. It must make this determination regardless of the impropriety of appellee\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Appellant did not satisfy Rule 8 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. He made no concise or plain statement of the grounds upon which the jurisdiction of the district court depends. He need not, of course, have recited the particular law upon which he based his claim, but he should have been sufficiently acute in the development of his claim to apprise the court of the grounds upon which he contends he is entitled to relief. This is not, however, the principal infirmity in appellant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Applying the standard pronounced in United States v. Martin, 10 Cir., 267 F.2d 764, at page 769, appellant\u2019s counterclaim may not be permissively adjudicated even had it contained the essential jurisdictional requirements independent of the original action. It is indisputable that an action to recover damages for an alleged unlawful discharge from civil service employment is not \u201cgermane or reasonably incident to\u201d the original suit by the Government to recover allotment payments. Neither do these actions \u201cpresent common questions of law and fact\u201d requisite to allow a permissive counterclaim against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">If the appellant, as a discharged civil servant and a veteran has any judicable rights under any of the statutes which he argued in his brief, he must pursue them in an independent action and conform to the procedures set out therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">We are in accord with the decision of the lower court but we are of the opinion that an order of dismissal, not a summary judgment, is the proper manner in which to dispose of the counterclaim. The judgment of the District Court with respect to the counterclaim of appellant will be vacated and the case remanded with directions to enter a judgment dismissing the counterclaim for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">.
