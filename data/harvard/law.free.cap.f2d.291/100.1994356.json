Appealing therefrom, he relies on the failure of the court to grant his motion to suppress evidence. The court held a hearing on the motion. We state the salient parts of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">A former roommate of defendant reported in April of 1956 that a suit had been stolen. On March 3, 1960, Milwaukee police officers Franklin and Marx were ordered to talk to defendant about the theft of the suit and certain bed clothing. The officers testified that they entered the building in which defendant\u2019s rooms were located and were then directed to his door. In response to their knock, defendant, while partially clad, opened the door. The officers identified themselves, and defendant said he was Ziemer. He then put on his trousers in the doorway and talked about the stolen suit of clothes. Defendant became very nervous. When the officers asked if they could come into the room, he answered \u201cI would rather not.\u201d Defendant asked why the officers seemed so interested in coming into the room, to which they replied they had asked for permission to look for the clothing, and that, if he had no knowledge of it, he would have nothing to hide. Thereupon defendant said \u201cyou may enter my room and you may look.\u201d He thereupon moved to one side of the door from the center where he had been standing. The door was open as far as the furniture in the room would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Defendant testified that, when the officers asked, \u201cYou seem awfully interested in keeping us out; what have you got in there?\u201d, he said \u201cWell, you can see what\u2019s here; there\u2019s a bed, television set and a dresser, and that\u2019s all there is in here.\u201d Then one of the officers said \u201cYou really don\u2019t mind if we come in, do you ?\u201d and defendant said \u201cI certainly do mind.\u201d According to defendant, the officers came in and he \u201chad to back up and * * * they were in the room\u201d. Defendant opened the door to an adjoining room to turn off a red photographic bulb burning there and the officers followed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Officer Franklin\u2019s testimony, covering events occurring after defendant said the officers could look for the clothing mentioned in the theft complaint, we set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cOfficer Marx proceeded first; I followed. In Mr. Ziemer\u2019s presence we moved to the closet which is a large walk-in type, and Officer Marx proceeded first in the closet. Mr. Ziemer followed Mr. \u2014 Officer Marx and I followed Mr. Ziemer, so Mr. Ziemer was between us. Officer Marx and I observed a pair of trousers which was lying on a book which covered a pan. Officer Marx picked up the pair of trousers and, in doing so, the book fell to the floor. In looking into the pan, about that far under the solution (indicating) there was what appeared to be a negative of a ten-dollar bill. Officer Marx moved to the doorway and into the bedroom proper. Lying on the floor was a flashlight. He picked this flashlight up, stepped back into the closet, shown its beam onto the tray, and at that time we did identify it as a negative of a ten-dollar bill and placed Mr. Ziemer under arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">After he was placed under arrest, Ziemer was asked if he had any more negatives or counterfeiting equipment in the room and he said, \u201cYes. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He walked from the closet to the bed from under which he pulled a suitcase, opened it and showed the officers partially completed notes and some copper engraved plates. Pictures were taken of the equipment seized from Ziemer, and of the bed, two presses, a camera, a whirler, various chemicals, copper plates and counterfeit United States currency notes, as well as a belt worn by Ziemer, containing two places of concealment where he had $300 of legitimate money.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Defendant also testified that he requested Betty Koepsel to testify that she overheard him tell the detectives that they couldn\u2019t come into his room. However, she testified that Ziemer came to her apartment and requested her to testify that she overheard Ziemer tell the detectives that they couldn\u2019t come into his room, and that she told him she couldn\u2019t so testify because she didn\u2019t see or hear anything, whereupon Ziemer told her that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t matter because nobody could prove that you weren\u2019t telling the truth\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Defendant testified that in 1941 he was convicted of a felony, possession of counterfeit material.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">After hearing the testimony of all witnesses for both the government and the defendant and having an opportunity to observe their demeanor, the district court made this finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">\u201cBelieving the testimony of the police officers and disbelieving that of the defendant, the court finds that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search for the clothing and that while the officers were there with permission for that purpose, they saw the counterfeiting material and thereafter placed defendant under arrest. Defendant\u2019s motion for the return of seized property and suppression of evidence is hereby denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">In United States v. MacLeod, 7 Cir., 207 F.2d 853, at page 854, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-15\">\u201c* * * The District Court, after hearing testimony upon this disputed factual issue, made the findings above noted. In reality, the only question for our consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>is whether the record furnishes substantial support for such finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Even without the testimony of the witness Betty Koepsel, we would not feel justified in setting aside the finding of the district court that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search in question. However, the correctness of the court\u2019s finding is emphasized by the dubious credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony, revealed by both his effort to induce Betty Koepsel to commit perjury on his behalf and his admission of prior conviction of a felony, a well-established method of impeachment. United States v. Senior, 7 Cir., 274 F.2d 613, 616. We cannot say as a matter of law that the finding of the district court was erroneous. Davis v. United States, 328 U.S. 582, 593, 66 S.Ct. 1256, 90 L.Ed. 1453.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Such evidence as defendant relies on to prove the opposite conclusion was obviously not believed by the trial judge. As a reviewing court we have no right to weigh the evidence and determine which witnesses told the truth. The trial judge\u2019s decision on a matter of fact, which was supported by evidence which he deemed credible, should not be set aside by this court even though from a reading of the entire record we might (although we do not) come to an opposite conclusion. As was said in Roberts v. United States, 5 Cir., 151 F.2d 664, 665:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u201cWhat we said in Hargrove v. United States, 5 Cir., 139 F.2d 1014, is appropriate here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201c \u2018We are not triers of fact. The law, in its wisdom, does not authorize this court to substitute the reactions as to the facts which it gains from a perusal of the cold, printed type for those of the lower court which saw and heard the witnesses, observed their demeanor on the stand, and thus was placed in far better position to know the true and false than this court ;***.' \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">In United States v. Arrington, 7 Cir., 215 F.2d 630, 634, we recognized that the protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment may be waived by consent, provided it is freely, voluntarily and understandingly given. However, in a majority opinion this court held that a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction was required. That action was based upon a factual situation dissimilar to that in the case at bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">A defendant cannot claim that his constitutional rights were invaded where an entry and search of his premises was made with his consent and there is no evidence of coercion or mental force. Milyonico v. United States, 7 Cir., 53 F.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The relevant test is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable; that criterion in turn depends upon the facts and circumstances \u2014 the total atmosphere of the case. United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We accept the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search of his premises and no error was committed in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for the return of seized property and suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Accordingly, the judgment from which defendant appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. In that case it appeared that about <em>4 </em>A.M. January 5, 1953 (four or five hours prior to the time defendant was interviewed in the county jail by the postal inspectors), Delaney and other city officers, <em>without defendant\u2019s consent, </em>entered his home without a warrant either for the arrest of defendant or for the search of his home. These officers, after looking around, took defendant into custody and to the county-jail where he was held without charge until the postal inspectors arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Between 8 and 9 A.M. on the same day, while defendant was under arrest and in jail with no charge against him, a postal inspector testified that he told defendant he had information certain parcel post merchandise was in the defendant\u2019s apartment and asked defendant if it was all right with him if he went to defendant\u2019s apartment and looked for the stolen goods; that defendant said, \u201cYes\u201d, that they could take anything in his apartment which they could identify as stolen property. Inspector Dilley testified to substantially the same conversation. Following this, the three officers, armed with guns and accompanied by defendant, went to his home, where his wife opened the door and permitted the officers to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The postal inspectors testified that defendant, after they had entered his home, told them, \u201cGo ahead, look around.\u201d The officers proceeded to search the home, discovered and seized the alleged stolen property described in the indictment, the admission of which as evidence was sought to be suppressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b151-7\">HASTINGS, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"As\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Because I feel that the record in this case conclusively indicates a violation of defendant\u2019s right to be secure in his home from an unwarranted search, I must dissent from the majority opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The search of defendant\u2019s apartment was carried out without a warrant. It is axiomatic that a \u201csearch and seizure may be made without a search warrant if the individual freely and intelligently gives his unequivocal and specific consent to the search, uncontaminated by any duress or coercion, actual or implied. The Government has the burden of proving by clear and positive evidence that such consent was given.\u201d Channel v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 285 F.2d 217, 219-220.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">At the outset, I feel that the court has taken an over-narrow view of our function in reviewing a case which raises important constitutional issues. The central question here is defendant\u2019s alleged waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights. The majority characterizes the issue of \u201cconsent,\u201d and the \u201cvoluntary\u201d nature thereof, as a mere \u201cmatter of fact\u201d which must be supported by substantial evidence. Reliance is placed on the trial court\u2019s unique opportunity to observe and judge the credibility of defendant and other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">This description of a constrained scope of review is consistent with that enunciated in the dissent in United States v. Arrington, 7 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 630, 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">However, I feel that this and other courts have stated that a legal judgment is here involved. It is not so much what the facts are but their significance that is at issue. The majority opinion in Arrington confirms that this is the proper standard: granted that defendant and his witnesses were totally impeached, that the trial court disbelieved them, and that we must entirely disregard their testimony, nevertheless, we must independently determine whether the Government has produced evidence of the nature required to demonstrate defendant\u2019s consent to a waiver of his constitutional rights. See, United States v. Arrington, supra, 215 F.2d at page 637. For other recent concurring authority, see Channel v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 285 F.2d 217, 220; Judd v. United States, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 190 F.2d 649, 652; United States v. De Vivo, D.C.E.D.N.Y. 1961, 190 F.Supp. 483, 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">The issue is whether the Government\u2019s evidence, taken at its full value, is sufficient to support the constitutional and legal conclusion that defendant consented to a search. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting in Davis v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 582, 599, 66 S.Ct. 1256, 1264, 90 L.Ed. 1453, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s finding that Davis voluntarily surrendered the documents is not one of those findings of facts which appropriately calls for our acceptance. When such a finding involves conflicting evidence or the credibility of a witness, the advantage of having seen or heard a witness may be decisive. But here the issue is not as to what took place but as to the significance of what took place. And when a district court\u2019s finding of a so-called fact is as interwoven as it is here with constitutional consequences, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>cannot accept a finding whereby the constitutional issue is predetermined. We are not bound by findings that operate as cryptic constitutional determinations * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In examining the record in this case, assuming the truth of the statements of the police officers, the Government has failed to show the requisite \u201cfree and intelligent\u201d consent, uninfluenced by implied coercion, given by defendant to waive his Fourth Amendment rights. Officer Franklin indicated that he and Officer Marx went at night time without a warrant to Ziemer\u2019s apartment to question him about a four-year old theft of a suit and bedclothes. After being summoned by the policeman\u2019s knock, Ziemer appeared at his doorway, clad in underwear shorts and a T-shirt. The officers immediately displayed their badges and identified themselves as Milwaukee city police officers. Defendant stood in his open doorway and blocked entry to his room; he then slipped on a pair of trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At the beginning of the conversation defendant objected to the officers coming into his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The police commenced interrogation regarding defendant\u2019s relationship with Stegman, the complainant in the theft charge. Defendant said that he knew him and formerly roomed with him but that he knew nothing about the clothes alleged to have been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">After Officer Franklin asked defendant if he knew whether Stegman had any relatives in the city, defendant answered that he knew of one person, but that he did not live in the neighborhood. Defendant said, \u201cI will show you how to get there,\u201d but the officers refused, citing police regulations against making a trip of that sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Officer Franklin said defendant then \u201cbecame very nervous.\u201d When asked how he observed this, the officer answered, \u201cBy his actions. His body was shaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Officer Marx confirmed that defendant was nervous, and this fact aroused the officer\u2019s suspicions. \u201cWe were there looking for this clothing; we were talking to him about it, and all of a sudden the man is very nervous. In our work, I mean when you see somebody nervous \u2014we are questioning him regarding the theft of a suit and bed clothing \u2014 we figured it was probably in the room, and that\u2019s why we asked for permission to search his room, and he gave it to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">For the second time the officers asked defendant for permission to enter. Defendant asked them why they seemed so interested in <em>coming </em>into his room. Officer Franklin replied that they were asking \u201chis permission to look for the clothing; if he had no knowledge of it, he would have nothing to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">At this point, defendant moved to one side and said, \u201cYou may enter my room and you may look.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">These facts indicate that defendant expressly told the police to enter. But such consent was given not voluntarily, but under the implied coercion of the police officers. The Government\u2019s evidence shows defendant first objected to entry, tried to lead the officers away from his apartment, became so nervous that he shook, then finally acquiesced in the request that the police enter to search his room. As stated in the case of Amos v. United States, 1921, 255 U.S. 313, 317, 41 S.Ct. 266, 268, 65 L.Ed. 654, \u201cit is perfectly clear that under the implied coercion here presented, no such waiver was intended or effected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">As Chief Judge Major said in Arrington, supra, 215 F.2d at page 637:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">\u201cIt is high time that courts place their stamp of disapproval upon this increasing practice of federal officers searching a home without a warrant on the theory of consent, particularly where no reason is shown why a search warrant was not obtained. The protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment should not be made dependent upon the probity of an officer attempting to justify a search on consent. Otherwise, the rights guaranteed to the citizen by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the Amendment will be impaired so as to become little more than an empty gesture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">With deference to the able trial judge who found that defendant voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search of his premises, I would find such holding to be in error and would reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
