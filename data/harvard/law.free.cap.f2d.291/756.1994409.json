Registration is opposed by appellant on the basis of prior use and registration of \u201cBufferin\u2019\u2019 for \u201cAntacid Aspirin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-25\">Opposer is concededly the prior user. As described in the application and registration, the goods have the same antacid and analgesic characteristics and are likely to be sold to the same class of purchasers for therapeutic purposes. We are, of course, primarily concerned with the coverage of the competing application and registration rather than with specimen labels which might or might not subsequently vary. General Shoe Corp. v. Lerner Bros. Mfg. Co., Inc., 254 F.2d 154, 45 CCPA 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-26\">The sole issue is whether concurrent use of the respective marks would be likely to result in confusion, mistake, or deception within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In dismissing the opposition the Trademark Trial and Appeal board stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201c \u2018Buffer\u2019 is a word in use in the pharmaceutical trade and is descriptive of the antacid characteristics of the products of opposer and applicant. The similarities which exist between the marks of the parties are due to the inclusion of that word in opposer\u2019s mark and the use of substantially the phonetic equivalent thereof, viz., \u2018Buffa\u2019 in applicant\u2019s mark. The marks otherwise differ substantially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">\u201cConsidering the nature of the term \u2018Buffer\u2019 as applied to the goods of the parties and the differences between the marks, it is concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We accept without question the board\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018Buffer\u2019 is a word in use in the pharmaceutical trade and is descriptive of the antacid characteristics of the products of opposer and applicant.\u201d Doubtless those in the \u201cpharmaceutical trade\u201d would attach the technical meaning to \u201cBuffer,\u201d but we have grave doubts that the average purchaser in what is presumably a mass market would be aware of the technical meaning of that term. Absent such an interpretation, we think it more likely than not that the average purchaser would attach more trademark significance to \u201cBuffer\u201d and \u201cBuffa\u201d than the board seems to have contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">It seems to us that the goods and marks have substantially more, rather than less, in common. As the board points out, both products have the same antacid characteristics. In addition, they are inexpensive, non-prescription items sold over the same counters to mass purchasers. The marks contain the .same number of letters as well as syllables with the first syllable, \u201cBuff\u201d identical to both marks. Although \u201cgum\u201d has no similarity with anything in \u201cBufferin,\u201d still it is wholly descriptive of the goods to which it is applied, thus has no trademark significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">While we appreciate the reasoning of the board, we are unable to agree that concurrent use of \u201cBufferin\u201d and \u201cBuffagum\u201d on the respective goods would not be likely to result in confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d). We think the opposition should have been sustained and must <em>reverse </em>the decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-17\">. Sec. 2. Trademarks registrable on the principal register</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-18\">\u201cNo trade-mark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-28\">\u2756 * * <em>&lt;-\u2022 </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-29\">\u201c(d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers: * * \u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b805-12\">SMITH, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AcX\">dissenting, with whom KIRKPATRICK, Judge, joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">This dissent is based on my opinion that there is not such similarity between the marks \u201cBufferin\u201d and \u201cBuffagum\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers. Similarity is found in the identical initial syllables of the marks. I agree with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that such similarity does not warrant sustaining the opposition where the marks are otherwise so different.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">In addition to the differences in the names, the goods are specifically different. \u201cBufferin\u201d is a medicinal tablet and \u201cBuffagum\u201d is a medicinal chewing gum. Opposer\u2019s registration asserts use of its name \u201cBufferin\u201d for \u201cantacid asprin [sic].\u201d The stipulation of fact herein further describes the product as a \u201cpreparation\u201d which is \u201cin the form of tablets containing aspirin and certain antacid ingredients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">Applicant asserts use of its mark \u201cBuffagum\u201d for \u201ca chewing gum containing analgesics and antacids.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The specimen label which applicant filed with its application describes \u201cBuffagum\u201d as being \u201cfor upset stomach, gas, heartburn\u2014 due to acid indigestion.\u201d It is, according to this label \u201cA <em>stomach remedy </em>in mint-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>flavored <em>chewing gum, form, </em>for increased effectiveness and ease of taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We are, therefore, dealing not only with different names but also with different goods each of which is specifically employed by the user for a particular medicinal purpose. The use of aspirin for the relief of pain is so well known that I cannot conceive of a user or purchaser being so confused or mistaken or deceived that he would accept an antacid chewing gum \u201cfor upset stomach, gas and heartburn\u201d instead of the desired aspirin tablet because of applicant\u2019s use of its mark \u201cBuffagum\u201d on its medicinal chewing gum. Neither do I think the presence of the common syllable \u201cBuff\u201d in the two names would be likely to cause such user or purchaser to associate the source or origin of applicant\u2019s goods with opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. General Aluminum Window Co., Inc., 275 F.2d 947, 47 CCPA 833. I agreed with the majority in finding likelihood of confusion between the marks \u201cTherm-O-Lite\u201d and \u201cThermopane.\u201d As pointed out in the majority opinion the word \u201clite,\u201d is a corrupted form of the word light which has the dictionary meaning of \u201cpane.\u201d Thus, the names taken as wholes conveyed the same meaning, while here the names as wholes convey different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cBuffer\u201d when applied to medicinal preparations is a descriptive term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Op-poser\u2019s \u201cbuffered\" aspirin suggests its name \u201cBufferin.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \u201cbuffered\u201d antacid chewing gum likewise suggests its name \u201cBuffagum.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">I think, therefore, on these facts that the rationale expressed by this court in May Department Stores Co. v. Kenya Corp., 234 F.2d 870, 872, 43 CCPA 940, is applicable here. There the names \u201cAristocrat\u201d and \u201cAristosheen\u201d were in issue. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\">\u201cIt is evident that the final syllables \u2018crat\u2019 and \u2018sheen\u2019 are entirely distinct in sound, meaning and appearance, and that the similarity between the marks under consideration is therefore confined to the \u2018Aristo\u2019 portion. That portion is the combining form of the Greek word \u2018aristos,\u2019 meaning \u2018the best,\u2019 and its inclusion in a mark is therefore generally suggestive of high quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\">\u201cIt is well settled that marks cannot be dissected for purposes of comparison, but must be considered in their entireties. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. Spiegel, Inc., 132 F.2d 144, 30 C.C.P.A., Patents, 721; [56 USPQ 185] Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Foley &amp; Co., 144 F.2d 888, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 714; [63 USPQ 64] Schering &amp; Glatz v. Sharpe &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 827, [64 USPQ 394]. Nevertheless, it is proper to note that it has frequently been held that marks whose initial syllable or syllables are the same will not be regarded as confusingly similar if the syllable or syllables in question have a descriptive or suggestive connotation and the remaining portions of the marks are clearly distinct. Examples of such cases, with the marks involved, are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">\u201cAlumatone Corp. v. Vita-Var Corp., 183 F.2d 612, 37 C.C.P.A. Patents, 1151, [86 USPQ 359] (Alumatone and Alumikote); Kraft Walker Cheese Co., v. Kingsland, D.C., 75 F.Supp. 105, [75 USPQ 318] (Vegemite and Vegex); Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Foley &amp; Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>144 F.2d 888, 32 C.C.P.A. Patents, 714, [63 USPQ 64] (Vitamiles and Vitabuild); Solventol Chemical Products, Inc. v. Langfield, 6 Cir., 134 F.2d 899, [57 USPQ 210] (Solventol and Solvite); Steem-Electric Corp. v. Herzfeld-Phillipson Co., 7 Cir., 118 F.2d 122, [48 USPQ 93] (Steam-O-Matic and Steem-Electric); Vick Chemical Co. v. Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd., 80 F.2d 73, 23 C.C.P.A. Patents, 752, [27 USPQ 393] (Vapex and Vaporub); Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd., v. Louis K. Liggett Co., 1 Cir., 67 F.2d 214 (Vapure and Vapex).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The court there, as I think it should here, found the involved marks distinguishable as entireties.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">I think there also is persuasive similarity between the marks here and the marks \u201cDuro-Style Fabrics\u201d and \u201cDurosheen\u201d which were involved in May Department Stores Co. v. Schloss Bros. &amp; Co. Inc., 234 F.2d 879, 881, 43 CCPA 980. There, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cIt is obvious that the only similarity between the marks resides in the word \u2018Duro\u2019. That word suggests durability, and there are of record copies of registrations of over thirty trademarks for fabrics or wearing apparel which either consist solely of the word \u2018duro,\u2019 or contain it as a part of the mark. It is well settled that combinations of letters which are descriptive of the goods or properties thereof will not be accorded as great weight in considering whether marks are confusingly similar, as words or combinations of letters which are purely arbitrary. North Star Manufacturing Co. v. Wells Lamont Corporation, 193 F.2d 204, 39 C.C.P.A. Patents, 764, [92 USPQ 128]; West Disinfecting Company v. Lan-O-Sheen Company, 163 F.2d 566, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents, 706, [75 USPQ 77]; Rite-Rite Mfg. Co. v. Rite-Craft Company, 181 F.2d 226, 37 C.C.P.A. Patents, 963, [85 USPQ 268] ; Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Pepsodent Co., 104 F.2d 205, 26 C.C.P.A. Patents, 1272, [41 USPQ 738]; and Franco-Italian Packing Corp. v. Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., 142 F.2d 274, 31 C.C.P.A. Patents, 1029, [61 USPQ 369].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOO\">Since the names \u201cBufferin\u2019\u2019 and \u201cBuffagum\u201d taken as wholes are distinct in sound, meaning and appearance, and since the goods to which they are applied are specifically different, I do not think the similarity of the names predicated on the common use of the syllable \u201cBuff\u201d is a sufficient basis upon which to sustain the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Where the only similarity between the marks resides in the initial syllable \u201cBuff,\u201d I find my position well stated in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">\u201c * * * We recognize that in some situations the presence of a common first syllable in two marks may be sufficient to render the marks, as a whole, confusingly similar. As the Examiner has stated, this more frequently happens when the common syllable is at the beginning of each mark. However, there is certainly no general rule that all marks which begin with the same syllable are confusingly similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">\u201cWe submit that in the present case the common syllable \u201cBuff\u201d has a suggestive significance in relation to the goods in that it implies that the product has been buffered against either an alkaline or acid condition. Because of this the syllable \u201cBuff\u201d appears in a number of marks registered in Class 6. In addition to the two registrations cited, it is present in Reg. No. 418,-640 \u201cBuff-caps\u201d, in Reg. No. 364,337 \u201cBufosal\u201d and in Reg. No. 351,083 \u201cBufox\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">\u201cBecause of the presence of \u201cBuff\u201d or \u201cBuf\u201d in a number of trademarks and particularly because of the suggestive significance of the syllable, the public recognizes that it must look to more than this first syllable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>to identify a particular source. The mark as a whole must be considered and when this is done, there is no real similarity between applicant\u2019s three-syllabled trademark \u2018Bufferin\u2019 and the registrant\u2019s two-syllabled: trademarks \u2018Bufflac\u2019 and \u2018Buffate\u2019.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIP\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the Trademark Trial and Appeal: Board in dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-16\">. The specimen label filed with the application lists the medicinal ingredients in \u201cBuffagum\u201d but does not list any which are commonly recognized as \u201canalgesics.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. Hackh\u2019s Chemical Dictionary, 3rd Edition (1944 ed.) defines \u201cbuffer\u201d as, \u201cany substance which, when added to a solution, resists any change in hydrogen ion concentration on addition of acid or alkali.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">. That \u201cBuff\u201d should be given little trademark significance also seems clear to me from the third party registrations for medicinal preparations which have not been considered in the majority opinion. These include such names as \u201cBufflac\u201d; \u201cBuffate\u201d; \u201cBonobuff\u201d; \u201cBufosal\u201d; \u201cBuffecillin\u201d; \u201cBuff-caps\u201d; \u201cBufOpto\u201d; and \u201cBufos.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-4\">.
