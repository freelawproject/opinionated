Sorey entered a plea of not guilty and was represented by counsel upon his trial. The jury returned a verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>guilty. The United States Attorney filed an information setting forth a prior conviction under Sections 4744(a) and 4755 of Title 26, United States Code, relating to marihuana, which Sorey admitted. The district court sentenced him to imprisonment for ten years stating, \u201cI will give him what I understand to be the minimum sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We find no merit in the contentions ably and vigorously urged by appointed counsel for Sorey to the effect that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict of guilty, or that as a matter of law Sorey was a victim of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\"> We think, however, that counsel correctly points out that the minimum sentence under this judgment of conviction was five years instead of ten years. The significant language in Title 26, Section 7237(a), supra, is \u201c * * * for which no specific penalty is otherwise provided.\u201d Title 21, Section 174 specifically provides a minimum sentence of ten years for a second offense. Title 26, Section 7237(b) makes like specific provision for a second offense as to Section 4705(a) of Title 26. On the other hand, no specific penalty is provided for a second offense as to Section 4704(a), footnote 2, supra. The jury\u2019s belief that Sorey conspired to violate Section 4704 (a) would support the general verdict of guilty under the present indictment. It results that, while the sentence of ten years was permitted by Section 7237(a), the <em>minimum </em>was five years. Compare United States v. Shackelford, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1957, 180 F.Supp. 857, 861. The apparent misapprehension by the district court of what constituted the minimum sentence does not, however, necessitate a reversal, since the district court has the power either to leave the ten-year sentence in effect or to reduce the sentence within sixty (60) days after receipt of the mandate issued upon affirmance. Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. \u201c(a) <em>Where no specific penalty is othenoise provided. </em>\u2014 Whoever commits an offense, or conspires to commit an offense, described in part I or part II of subchapter A of chapter 39 for which no specific penalty is otherwise provided, shall be imprisoned not less than 2 or more than 10 years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.
