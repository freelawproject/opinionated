The marks otherwise differ as to sound and appearance and create different commercial impressions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-22\">\u201cConsidering the nature of the term \u2018fold\u2019 as applied to the goods of the parties and the difference between the marks, it is concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-23\">Opposer alleges error in that conclusion, contending that the issue should not be decided merely on a side-by-side comparison of \u201cMagna-Fold\u201d with \u201cModern-fold,\u201d but rather,by carefully weighing all the relevant facts. In support thereof, opposer argues in the main that its \u201cModernfold\u201d mark is a coined or fanciful word; that it is the leading brand name as a result of extensive advertising and promotion; and is, therefore, entitled to an added degree of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Opposer is correct in arguing that all relevant facts should be considered, but we have no reason to believe that the board failed to do so. On the contrary, opposer\u2019s own witness testified that \u201c \u2018Fold\u2019 is a descriptive term which categorizes a whole industry of folding doors.\u201d As such it obviously has no trademark significance when used on folding doors. Other than that single feature the marks are so dissimilar in sound, appearance, spelling and meaning as to preclude a likelihood of confusion. Finding none of the errors urged by appellant, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-24\">. Reg.
