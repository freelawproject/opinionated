United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b994-8\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">This appeal is from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissing an opposition by appellant, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, to an application of appellee, Winter Seal Corporation, for registration of \u201cJal-Master\u201d as a trademark for jalousie doors and windows. The opposition is based on op-poser\u2019s prior registration and use of the following trademarks: \u201cJalloy\u201d for metal in bar form, metal wire and metal structural shapes; \u201cJal-Duet\u201d for steel pipe; \u201cJal-Dor\u201d for doors; \u201cJalten\u201d for sheet metal and plates; and \u201cJalZinc\u201d for zinc coated steel sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">The only issue is whether concurrent use of the marks by the parties on their respective goods would be likely to result in confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">The board held, and we think correctly, that apart from the mark \u201cJal-Dor,\u201d the goods to which opposer\u2019s marks are applied are so different from applicant\u2019s jalousie doors and windows that confusion would be unlikely. However, op-poser\u2019s \u201cJal-Dor\u201d mark is applied to the same type of goods, particularly jalousie doors, as applicant\u2019s \u201cJal-Master,\u201d thus the question is whether the marks themselves are so similar as to make confusion likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">The only component common to the marks is \u201cJal.\u201d The board was of the opinion that the \u201cJal\u201d prefix \u201cwould readily suggest to purchasers that the goods of the parties comprise jalousies.\u201d We think that is a reasonable conclusion even though \u201cJal,\u201d which represents the first letters of Jones and Laughlin, originally had no descriptive significance and is used on other products in a non-descriptive fashion. But when \u201cJal\u201d is coupled with \u201cDor,\u201d an obvious misspelling of \u201cdoor,\u201d the suggestive nature of both words weakens their trademark strength. While it is also true that the \u201cJal\u201d in \u201cJal-Master\u201d suggests the nature of the goods and to that extent weakens its trademark strength, the word \u201cMaster\u201d has no descriptive connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">Viewing the marks as a whole, as they are viewed in the market place, we think there are sufficient differences in sound, appearance, spelling and meaning to preclude a likelihood of purchaser confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">Full consideration has been given appellant\u2019s arguments, including its claim to \u201cJal\u201d as a part of a family of marks, the testimony of its witnesses, and various citations, but we are not persuaded that the board erred in dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-19\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
