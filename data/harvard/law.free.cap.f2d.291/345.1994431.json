His appointment was \u201climited to four years or need of employee\u2019s services, whichever is less\u201d and was subject to a two-year probationary period. After serving some eleven months as a cultural affairs officer in Manila, Philippines, he was re-assigned, without change in grade or salary, to Washington as an instructor in the French language. Thereafter, on August 5, 1957, he received a letter from the U.S.I.A. Director of Personnel notifying him that it would be necessary \u201cto terminate [his] probationary appointment\u201d within thirty days because of \u201cthe severe cut in the Agency\u2019s appropriation for fiscal year 1958\u201d and the Agency\u2019s inability to relocate him. Dr. Born\u2019s employment was terminated on September 5, 1957. The reasons recorded on his personnel record were variously stated as \u201cServices no longer required\u201d and \u201cExpiration of Appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">By letter dated September 3, 1957, Dr. Born appealed to the Civil Service Commission claiming that his removal was accomplished in violation of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944. 58 Stat. 387, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 851-869 (1958). He prevailed at both the initial and appellate levels, and the Commission recommended his reinstatement. Although compliance with such Commission determinations is \u201cmandatory,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.I.A. refused to reinstate appellant on the ground that Foreign Service Staff Officers in the U.S.I.A. are not covered by the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and hence Dr. Born\u2019s employment was not within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission. Cf. Casman v. Dulles, D.C.D.C.1955, 129 F.Supp. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Appellant thereupon instituted this suit for declaratory judgment and mandamus. From an order granting summary judgment to the U.S.I.A., Dr. Born brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, which codifies, strengthens and broadens the various strands of pro-veteran legislation that have been woven into the fabric of our civil service system since the early days of .the Republic,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> declares in the most sweeping terms that \u201cpreference shall be given\u201d to veterans, \u201cin all establishments, agencies, bureaus, administrations, projects, and departments of the Government.\u201d 58 Stat. 387 (1944), as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only exclusions from the Act\u2019s coverage are that it shall not apply to the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>or judicial branches or to persons appointed to the executive branch by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Appellee concedes, as he must, that the U.S.I.A., an \u201cagency\u201d in the executive branch, is within the scope of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But he contends that the Foreign Service Act of 1946, under which appellant was hired, is so inconsistent with the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act that Congress could not have intended that an employee be subject to both. In short, appellee argues that the Foreign Service Act implicitly repeals the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act pro tanto.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">To support this position, appellee makes this three-fold argument: (1) If the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act applied to persons hired under the Foreign Service Act, the conduct of our foreign relations would be severely hampered. (2) The Foreign Service Act established personnel procedures which are wholly independent of Civil Service Commission control. (3) Procedures authorized by the Foreign Service Act are inconsistent with the application of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> While these contentions are not implausible, we think that, individually and collectively, they are insufficient to conclude that Congress implicitly repealed the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. Repeals by implication are not favored. See Casman v. United States, 1958, 143 Ct.Cl. 16, 181 F.Supp. 404; Casman v. Dulles, D.C.D.C.1955, 129 F.Supp. 428 (both holding that the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act requires the Department of State to hire veterans whose positions-have been transferred from other agencies to the Foreign Service). Cf. Casman v. Herter, D.C.D.C.1959, 177 F.Supp. 285; Feldman v. Herter, 1960, 107 U.S. App.D.C. 239, 276 F.2d 485. This is-especially true where the allegedly repealed statute is not an obscure bit of antiquated legislation, but a sweeping declaration of congressional policy concerning the employment of returning veterans. We cannot lightly assume that Congress, when completely revising the personnel procedures in the State Department only two years later, overlooked this most conspicuous statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Appellee\u2019s principal argument is that. \u201c[t]he Foreign Service performs unique and vital functions within the Executive Branch of our Government. So unique and important are these functions that our Government can ill afford to have the Service hampered by interference from other independent agencies within, the Government, particularly where such agencies are not charged with the responsibility of conducting foreign affairs.\u201d From this it is concluded that \u201cIt is * * * inconceivable that Congress should have attempted such a restriction upon the authority of those charged with the conduct of our Foreign Affairs * *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">But this argument confuses the Foreign Service, the diplomatic arm of the State Department, with the U.S.I.A. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>also tends to confuse Foreign Service Officers \u2014 the career diplomats in the Foreign Service who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and thus exempt from the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 869) \u2014 with Foreign Service Staff Officers, the cadre of experts and specialists who assist in the conduct of foreign affairs. See H.R.Rep. No. 2508, 79th Gong., 2d Sess. 6 (1946). Although appellant was hired under the same Act that governs the Foreign Service, his functions and responsibilities are different. The U.S.I.A. is not responsible for formulating foreign policy, for negotiating with foreign governments, or for reporting events abroad to the State Department. Rather its purpose is to arrange cultural and educational exchanges of United States and foreign citizens, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1446; to assist libraries and demonstration centers abroad, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1448; and to disseminate \u201cinformation about the United States, its people, and its policies, through press, publications, radio, motion pictures, and other information media, and through information centers and instructors abroad,\u201d 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1461.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is not to say that the functions of U.S.I.A. are not important to the successful conduct of United States foreign policy. But there is nothing in the record before us to show that its functions require the degree of discipline and control over personnel which is said to be essential to the Foreign Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Indeed, Congress saw no inconsistency between the functions now performed by the U.S.I.A. and requirements of the application of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. The Act originally establishing the information and exchange program authorized the Secretary of State to hire persons on a temporary basis \u201cwithout regard to the civil-service and classification laws * * * \u201d 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1471(5). But it explicitly stated that \u201cNo provision of this chapter shall be construed to modify, or to repeal the provisions of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944.\u201d 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1438. In 1953 the U.S.I.A. was created and the authority of the Secretary of State with respect to the exchange and information program \u2014 including the authority to hire temporary personnel \u2014 was transferred to the Director of the newly established agency. Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953, 67 Stat. 642, as amended, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1461 note (Supp.1960). But the Director also obtained concurrent authority to hire persons under the Foreign Service Act of 1946. Executive Order No. 10477, Aug. 3, 1953, 18 F.R. 4540, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 811a note.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The appellee concedes that persons hired under the original Information Act are, by explicit direction of 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1438, subject to the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. But he contends that persons hired under the Foreign Service Act are immune from the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. Yet appellee does not explain whether functions performed by one group of employees differ from those performed by the other, and does not tell us the basis upon which the Agency determines to employ under one authority or the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is therefore no basis for finding that Congress meant to bifurcate the Agency, and make some employees subject to the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act and not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The appellee alleges certain inconsistencies between the Foreign Service Act and the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act as evidence of such congressional intent. The Foreign Service Act, he points out, establishes personnel procedures inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>pendent of the Civil Service classification laws. Appointments (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1082); performance ratings (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 986); promotions (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1016); sick and annual leave computations (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1148 et seq.); salary scales (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 870); classifications (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 886); and discharges of Foreign Service staff personnel (22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1021, 1022) are all conducted \u201cunder such regulations as * * * [the Secretary] may prescribe\u201d and, from all that appears, free from the control or supervision of the Civil Service Commission. Appellee also makes much of the fact that prior to the creation, in 1946, of the class known as Foreign Service Staff Officers, analogous positions in the State Department were in large part subject to the Civil Service Commission. But we think the absence of <em>independent </em>authority in the Commission to supervise or control hiring, promotions and firing within the Foreign Service does not compel the conclusion that the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act does not apply to these employees as it does to other civil servants appointed to the unclassified service.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Finally, the appellee relies upon a provision of the Foreign Service Act making the personnel records of officers and employees of the Foreign Service confidential and subject to inspection only by the President, congressional committees, the Secretary and various functionaries in the Department of State. 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 987.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellee argues that the Veterans\u2019 Preference system, which is administered by the Civil Service Commission, could not apply to the Foreign Service Staff Officers without breach of this confidentiality. This case demonstrates, however, that under prevailing administrative interpretation and practice, the confidentiality provision is not deemed applicable to Foreign Service Staff Officers in the U.S.I.A. In the instant case the Commission had access to the records of appellant in reaching its determination. Moreover, Dr. Born\u2019s employment records, prepared by the appellee, state that he is entitled to a five-point veterans\u2019 preference, that his retirement coverage is under the Civil Service Commission (and not the Foreign Service) and that the action taken (both hiring and discharge) \u201cmay be subject to investigation and approval by the United States Civil Service Commission or the Agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">One other point requires discussion. The Civil Service Commission found Dr. Born\u2019s dismissal to be in violation of \u00a7 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. That section establishes various procedural safeguards to discharges for \u201ccause\u201d of any \u201cpermanent or indefinite preference eligible, who has completed a probationary or trial period.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellee did not apply this section to the present case. He viewed appellant\u2019s appointment for \u201cfour years or as need<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ed whichever is less,\u201d as not \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14. The District Court followed this view and awarded summary judgment on the ground that \u201cthe Veterans\u2019 Preference Act * * * obviously does not apply to a person who received an\" appointment limited to a specific term.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The terms \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cindefinite\u201d are not defined by the Act and the parties have not cited, nor has our search revealed, any helpful judicial interpretation. In the context of this statute, we are willing to assume that \u201cpermanent\u201d refers only to an appointment with no limit fixed by specific date or contingency. Dr. Born\u2019s appointment is clearly not that.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">But we think the term \u201cindefinite,\u201d in the present context, is subject to at least two reasonable constructions: One, that it refers to an appointment of no fixed maximum duration; in which event it would be synonymous with \u201cpermanent\u201d and therefore superfluous. And the other, that it refers to an appointment of uncertain duration, even though a maximum be fixed, in which event it would apply to appellant\u2019s case where termination may occur any time within a four-year period when his services are no longer needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> We think that, since the latter construction is also a reasonable one, it should govern for two reasons: First, because it avoids a result which makes the term \u201cindefinite\u201d surplusage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And second, because it is consistent with the view of the Civil Service Commission, the agency charged with the administration of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This view is reflected in the Regulations which the Commission promulgated under the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Part 21 of 5 C.F.R. concerns the application of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act to \u201call positions * * * in the * * * Federal Government excepted from the competitive service.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.1 (Supp.1960). Subsection 21.10 which defines the right of such employees with respect to removals, suspensions, and demotions, is, by its own terms, applicable only to \u201cpermanent or indefinite employees.\u201d But this subsection goes on to say that it \u201cshall not apply to (a) employees during their first year of current continuous Federal or District of Columbia service, [or] (b) employees appointed for periods specifically limited to one year or less * * 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.10 (Supp.1960). This express exclusion suggests that persons appointed for more than one year have \u201cindefinite\u201d appointments. Otherwise there would have been no need to exclude such employees from the class of \u201cpermanent or indefinite employees.\u201d This implication is reinforced by regulations in Part 22, dealing with the appeals of preference eligibles under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, which provide that Part 22 \u201cshall apply to * * * any employee who has completed one year of current continuous employment * * * outside the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>petitive </em>service.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.102(a) (Supp.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We do not decide, as the Civil Service Commission has contended in an amicus memorandum, that <em>all </em>appointments for more than one year are \u201cpermanent or indefinite.\u201d The possibility of an appointment for a long but fixed term, such as five or ten years, may present difficulties which we need not reach here. We say only (1) that the term \u201cindefinite\u201d can reasonably be read, as the Commission has, to include appointments actually held in excess of one year whose terminal date is uncertain; and (2) that appellant has such an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Another question which lurks in the application of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act to the instant case relates to \u00a7 14\u2019s requirement that permanent or indefinite preference eligibles complete \u201ca probationary or trial period * * Appellant served approximately 18 months of an appointment that was probationary for two years. The Commission ruled<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that under its regulations, made pursuant to \u00a7 11 of the Act, \u00a7 14 applies to \u201cany employee who has completed one year of current continuous employment * * * outside the competitive service.\u201d See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.102(a), quoted supra. We think the Commission had authority to promulgate regulations which, in effect, refuse to honor probationary periods of over one year for the purposes of \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Accordingly we hold that the Commission did not exceed its powers in holding appellant\u2019s position subject to \u00a7 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Appellee finally contends that, even if the Veterans' Preference Act as a whole applies to appellant, his rights were determined by \u00a7 12, dealing with reductions in force,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and not \u00a7 14 which applies only to dismissals for cause. Whatever the force of this contention, we do not reach it. The sole ground upon which the appellee refused to comply with the Commission\u2019s recommendation was its contention that the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act does not apply to it. All we hold is that it cannot refuse on that ground. Cf. Perkins v. Elg, 1939, 307 U.S. 325, 349-350, 59 S.Ct. 884, 83 L.Ed. 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\">.

Appellee contends in his brief that clauses (a) and (b) of \u00a7 851 (quoted at note 4, supra) limit the scope of that section to persons in either the classified or unclassified civil service. Armed with various Civil Service Commission regulations, he goes on to argue that appellant was not in the civil service, either classified or unclassified. We find no merit in this argument. Assuming that his reading of the Act is correct and that there are some jobs in the executive branch which are in neither the classified nor unclassified civil service, appellant\u2019s position is in the excepted or unclassified civil service. The excepted service includes \u201call civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Oivil Service Act * * 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.102 (k).

Although the appellee made this argument before the Commission, he did not renew it in this court, nor, so far as we can tell from the record before us, in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">. \u201cIf there were no limit upon the length of a probationary appointment in positions in the non-competitive service, an agency could frustrate the application of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act by making appointments probationary for two, five or ten years. Significantly, in the hearings upon the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act a representative of a major veterans organization raised this possibility and suggested that \u00a7 14 be amended to limit probationary periods to ninety days. The Senate Committee on Civil Service declined to accept this suggestion upon representation of the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission that \u201cthe practice of the Commission over a period of years has been never to extend the trial period beyond one year.\u201d Hearings on Preference in Employment of Veterans Before the Senate Committee on Civil Service, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Moreover, by refusing to honor probationary periods of more than one year for positions in the unclassified service, the Commission is able to extend egual treatment under \u00a7 14 to veterans in the classified and unclassified services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">.

The limiting adjectives are notable when other sections of the Act are read. Section 5 treats \u201cpreference eligibles\u201d; Section 6 does the same, as does Section 7. Section 8 says \u201ca veteran eligible\u201d. Section 12 says \u201cpreference employees\u201d; Sections 13, 15, 16, 18 and 19 say \u201cany preference eligible\u201d. In sum, every section of the Act which mentions the subject uses an unqualified general expression, save only Section 14. That section by its explicit terms applies only to \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d eligibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Born\u2019s appointment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for \u201cfour years or the need for employee\u2019s services whichever is less\u201d was neither permanent nor indefinite. It was certainly not permanent; and it was indefinite only in the sense that it was uncertain within a matter of months. \u201cIndefinite\u201d in the nomenclature of civil service laws and rules does not mean briefly uncertain; it means a prolonged tenure without specified termination, akin to a permanent appointment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">My brethren rely upon Section 22.102 (a) of the Civil Service Regulations. But this section deals with procedure for appeals. It is a procedural regulation. It does not, and could not, expand the substantive rights conferred by the Act itself, which are the subject matter of the prescribed appellate procedure. A preceding section of the Regulations (Section 21.10) deals with the substantive rights of non-competitive preference employees in respect to removals, and it is phrased in language almost identical to Section 14, repeating <em>in haec verba, </em>the \u201cpermanent or indefinite\u201d qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">My brethren also rely upon Congressional intention and legislative history. These are indeed useful considerations when statutory language is ambiguous. But I find no ambiguity in the phrase \u201cpermanent or indefinite preference eligible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">So I conclude that Born was not within Section 14 of the Act. In this view I agree with the District Court and would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. Born was a veteran. Whether he was a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d depends upon whether a Foreign Service Staff appointment to the U. S. Information Agency is within the scope of Section 1 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. I do not reach that question, assuming for the sake of the argument that he is a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-14\">. Although the Civil Service Rules and Regulations do not explicitly define the terms \u201cpermanent\u201d, \u201cindefinite\u201d and \u201ctemporary\u201d, as applied to the non-competitive- or unclassified service, the three terms are used throughout as referring to different modes of tenure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
