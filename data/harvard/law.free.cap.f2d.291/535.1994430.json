The evidence establishes that the relationship of prostitute and panderer existed between the girl and the defendant George Chrisos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">* # # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cThe Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Denise Shayne Berry went from East St. Louis, Illinois, to Terre Haute, Indiana, as charged in the indictment, and that she did so because of the defendant George Chrisos\u2019 express desire and inducement. * * * The evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant George Chrisos induced her to go to Terre Haute for the purpose of prostitution as charged in the indictment and furnished the money therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Defendant makes no contention that such findings are not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The Government\u2019s case was largely based upon the testimony of the prosecuting witness, Denise Shayne Berry. Her story of defendant\u2019s participation in preparing and arranging for her trip to Terre Haute was in sharp conflict with defendant\u2019s version. Defendant strongly attacked the veracity and credibility of the prosecuting witness by an examination of her background, which most charitably described, was unsavory. In these circumstances, the defendant contends it was reversible error for the trial court to read and examine a presentence report compiled by federal probation officers dealing with the witness\u2019s background and character. Defendant argues that reading this report must have unfairly swayed the trial judge in his assessment of the credibility of the prosecuting witness. This report came into the hands of the court after the-prosecuting witness had been found guilty <em>in a separate case </em>in which she was. charged with unlawfully transporting a forged check in interstate commerce. The report was filed with the court while-the instant case was under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">Rule 32(c) (1), F.R.Cr.P., 18 U.S.C.A., which deals with pre-sentence reports,, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-14\">\u201cThe probation service of the court shall make a presentence in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>vestigation and report to the court before the imposition of sentence or the granting of probation unless the court otherwise directs. The report shall not be submitted to the court or its contents disclosed to anyone unless the defendant has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In a recent concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Clark in Smith v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 1, 11, 79 S.Ct. 991, 1001, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041, stated that the presentation to the trial court of a pre-sentence report concerning a <em>defendant </em>\u201cmust be \u2022deemed presumptively prejudicial where, in violation of Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 32 (c) (1), it was conducted prior to the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Defendant attempts to extend the reasoning of this concurring opinion to a situation where, as here, a pre-sentence report dealing with a <em>witness </em>came into the possession of the trial court pursuant to its responsibilities in a totally separate case. We have been cited no \u2022cases which state that, as a matter of law, such inspection and examination must be deemed presumptively prejudicial. This rule is properly limited to .a report dealing with the defendant, for a premature presentation there might influence the controlling determination \u2022of the guilt of the defendant. Further, defendant\u2019s attempt to show some semblance of prejudice in fact was totally unsuccessful. We have carefully read defendant\u2019s argument before the trial court and in his briefs in this court and fail to find any possible connection between the facts he states might hypothetically be contained in the confidential report and the trial court\u2019s assessment of the veracity of the prosecuting witness. Since there was no showing of any actual prejudice, we shall not presume as a matter of law that it did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Defendant next contends that the provisions of the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500, were not complied with in the case below because the court failed to order production of a certain FBI report. During the course of cross-examination of the prosecuting witness, it was revealed that she had made certain statements to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation assigned to the case. Tier testimony was ambiguous as to the number of oral and written statements she had made<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s counsel properly moved for the production of all statements made by this witness to any agency of the United States. The trial court then noted, \u201cLet the record show the handing of such statements to counsel for the defense by the United States Attorney.\u201d Defense counsel next moved for production of any memorandum made by any FBI agent as a result of conversations with the prosecuting witness. The government attorney replied that \u201c[t]o my knowledge, that\u2019s the only statement we have * * * taken from this witness referring to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">In order to determine whether or not the prosecuting witness had made subsequent statements to the FBI, defense counsel, <em>at the suggestion of government counsel, </em>called Agent Hafen who was in charge of the investigation of the case. This conversation clearly indicates that on one occasion a statement signed by the prosecuting witness was taken by Agent Hafen. <em>This statement, or a copy of it, was the one furnished defense counsel pursuant to his \u201cJencks\u201d request, supra. </em>The testimony further indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>that an FBI report was made by Agent Hafen based on this discussion, but that it contained only a copy of the written statement and, in addition, a description of the prosecuting witness and the location of the discussion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus it is apparent from the extrinsic testimony that there was but a single statement of the prosecuting witness and that it had already been furnished to counsel. The trial court confirmed this fact when it stated during the argument on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial that \u201cthe testimony shows there was no other statement.\u201d This conclusion is reaffirmed by the fact that defense counsel made no request for additional statements at the conclusion of the testimony of the agent who had been called to determine if \u201cany other statements\u201d had been made. On the contrary, the prosecuting witness was immediately recalled, and defense counsel continued his cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">If the testimony had revealed that additional statements had been made by the prosecuting witness or that agents\u2019 memoranda had been compiled on the basis of additional conversations, then production should have been ordered if the document met the requirements of a \u201cstatement\u201d within 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500 (e). Such further determination was not necessary here since the single statement that existed was already in the hands of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">In its proper use of extrinsic testimony to determine the existence of additional statements, the trial court has here complied with the statutory mandate of Section 3500 which, as the Supreme Court has said, \u201cimplies the duty in the trial judge affirmatively to administer the statute in such way as can best secure relevant and available evidence necessary to decide between the directly opposed interests protected by the statute \u2014 the interest of the government in safeguarding government papers from disclosure, and the interest of the accused in having the government produce \u2018statements\u2019 which the statute requires to be produced.\u201d Campbell v. United States, 1961, 365 U.S. 85, 95, 181 S.Ct. 421, 427, 5 L.Ed.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The final three arguments of defendant can be treated summarily. Alleged improper cross-examination of defendant was not objected to by trial counsel. Our examination of the record indicates there was no \u201cplain error\u201d in this respect within the terms of Rule 52(b), F.R. Cr.P. The record discloses no indication that defendant was prejudicially limited in cross-examining the prosecuting witness. Finally, the court\u2019s general findings of guilt, in the absence of any request by defendant for special findings, are ample to support the court\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">The judgment of the district court is.</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">. \u201c\u00a7 2422.
