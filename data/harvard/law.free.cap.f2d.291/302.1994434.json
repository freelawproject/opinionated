Defendant, with knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 prior use, opened a restaurant called \u201cWolfies\u201d in Brooklyn, New York. Plaintiffs brought suit to protect their common law right to their trade name. Judge Byers below enjoined defendant\u2019s use of the name, the plaintiffs having waived all claim to damages, and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-27\">Defendant\u2019s principal <em>argument </em>here is that there was no proof that plaintiffs had established a secondary meaning or likelihood of confusion in the Brooklyn area and that therefore plaintiffs failed to present a ease. It is true that Judge Byers made no express finding on secondary meaning. This does not, however, require reversal. Plaintiffs\u2019 restaurants are exceedingly well known in the Miami <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Beach area. They are each of approximately the same size and each display an enormous electric sign. There was evidence that prior to the complaint they did an aggregate gross business of $2,500,-000 per annum, paid rent of upwards of $95,000 per annum, and spent about $25,-000 annually for advertising on buses, taxicabs, and in several newspapers mostly in the Miami area. They had a combined payroll of $10,000 weekly. Together, in the tourist season they served 11,000 persons a day. It was conceded that at least 5,000 Brooklynites visit Miami Beach every year. The president of one of the plaintiffs testified that periodic polls at the door of his restaurant showed that 50 to 60 per cent of his daily patronage was from Brooklyn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A popular television personality, on a national program emanating from New York and seen in many cities, mentioned that \u201cmany prominent theatrical people and sports people usually go to Wolfies after their show and entertainment\u201d when in Miami Beach. This was not a paid-for commercial message, but a spontaneous remark apparently connected with a factual description of Miami Beach life. There was also testimony that Wolfies had been mentioned by a New York night club entertainer and another television personality. The president of one of the plaintiffs testified that when he attended a meeting of the National Boxing Association in New York, most of those present knew of and spoke of the\u2019plaintiffs\u2019 restaurants, although they came from all parts of the nation. From evidence such as this, the inference seems proper that \u201cWolfies\u201d means the Florida restaurants, even to residents of Brooklyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"> But even if we assume that a secondary meaning was not established, the order still should be affirmed. Although after plaintiffs objected to defendant\u2019s use of the name defendant added a legend \u2014 \u201cnot connected with any other establishment\u201d \u2014 to its menu, it did little if anything else to dispel the possible belief of its customers that they were eating in a Brooklyn branch of plaintiffs\u2019 enterprises. Indeed, such a belief was apparently encouraged, by a menu .similar in color and format to that of plaintiffs\u2019, which featured such items as \u201cWolfie\u2019s Floridian Style French Toast,\u201d \u201cWolfie\u2019s Floridian Style Fountain Creations,\u201d and \u201cWolfie\u2019s Floridian Style Sundae Delights.\u201d All this evidence lends solid support to Judge Byers\u2019 finding that defendant\u2019s adoption of the name \u201cWolfies\u201d is compatible with nothing but \u201ca purpose to capitalize in. Brooklyn upon the trade name \u2018Wolfies\u2019 first adopted by the plaintiffs in Miami Beach.\u201d Thus intent to trade on plaintiffs\u2019 reputation and plaintiffs\u2019 name was specifically found, and we see no distinction between this and ordinary \u201cpalming off\u201d in a products case. As this court has recently recognized, \u201ca court of equity will restrain such practices as constitute palming off, actual deception or appropriation of another\u2019s property\u201d even absent proof of secondary meaning. Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 2 Cir., 271 F.2d 569, 571, certiorari denied 362 U.S. 919, 80 S.Ct. 671, 4 L.Ed.2d 739. See Santa\u2019s Workshop, Inc. v. Sterling, 3rd Dep\u2019t, 2 A.D.2d 262, 153 N.Y.S.2d 839; Upjohn Co. v. Schwartz, 2 Cir., 246 F.2d 254. Cf. Yale Elec. Corp. v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972. That plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s restaurants are far apart is not necessarily a decisive fact. See, e. g., Ambassador East, Inc. v. Orsatti, Inc., 3 Cir., 257 F.2d 79 (Chicago \u201cPump Room\u201d obtains injunction against Philadelphia restaurant); Stork Restaurant, Inc. v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 166 F.2d 348 (New York \u201cStork Club\u201d obtains injunction against San Francisco tavern); Vaudable v. Montmartre, Inc., 20 Misc.2d 757, 193 N.Y.S.2d 332 (Paris \u201cMaxim\u2019s\u201d obtains injunction against New York restaurant) .</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\"> Appellant also claims that the dismissal of an application by appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>for an injunction pursuant to New York Penal Law McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 40, \u00a7 964, which makes it a misdemeanor for one with intent to deceive the public to assume the corporate, assumed, or trade name of another and provides for injunctive relief, is <em>res judicata </em>here. There is no substance to this contention. Section 964 requires proof by affidavit and such absence of a factual issue that the case would be appropriate for summary judgment under New York practice. An unsuccessful \u00a7 964 petitioner, \u201cof course, may be entitled to the relief it seeks in a plenary action * * * The two remedies are not to be confused.\u201d Industrial Plants Corp. v.

Had he been named Edward Cohen, Samuel Cohen, Gerald Cohen or Joseph Cohen, he, if nickname minded, would doubtless have considered such distinctive names as \u201cEddie\u2019s,\u201d \u201cSam\u2019s,\u201d \u201cJerry\u2019s,\u201d and \u201cJoe\u2019s\u201d for his restaurant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If endowed with the not too uncommon name \u201cSmith,\u201d he would have used \u201cSmitty\u2019s\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, for some reason, every \u201cMoore\u201d in the restaurant business must be a \u201cDinty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">The restaurant, apparently of the-glorified sandwich and ice cream type, achieved popularity with certain elements. Subsequently some 1,400 miles away in Brooklyn, New York, opposite the campus of Brooklyn College (some 25,000 students) appeared a similar type-restaurant also using the name \u201cWolfies.\u201d' It not only took the name \u201cWolfies\u201d but. imitated the menu format and presumed' to confuse the international situation by-offering in Brooklyn Floridian French. Toast. Upon the trial instead of saying,. \u201cI copied Wolfies of Miami; what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d, defendant indulged: in a series of fantastic explanations. First, the father of a friend was named\u2019 Wolf Pollack. Second, an officer of defendant, was a \u201cwolf,\u201d meaning thereby a person whose vaunted attraction for the opposite sex met with a fair degree of success and reciprocity. Third, the-electric sign which had borne the previous name \u201cJackies\u201d could be easily and cheaply altered by substituting \u201cWolf\u201d' for \u201cJack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">Were the underlying principles of the law of unfair competition not of paramount importance here, defendant\u2019s explanatory efforts could well merit the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>award of affirmance. But the case is not thus easily to be disposed of. A restaurateur in the southeastern part of the country takes unto himself a not too unique nickname for a restaurant and straightway obtains without statutory sanction a permanent monopoly to the exclusion of every other inhabitant of our fifty states. This result will not withstand analysis. To the trial court, \u201cThis is an unfair competition case * * * \u201d yet he finds \u201cthat the parties are not in direct competition.\u201d This circumstance is considered- \u201cunusual\u201d as indeed it is. On appeal the suit is \u201cto protect their [plaintiffs\u2019] common law right to their trade name.\u201d Plaintiffs advance the theory that the trade name \u201cWolfies\u201d is a valuable asset and that priority of use gives to the prior user the exclusive right to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">I cannot but believe that unfair competition should mean (1) competition and (2) that it is unfair. Obviously, there is no competition between Wolfies (Miami) and Wolfies (Brooklyn). If the Brooklyn College student who seeks physical rehabilitation from his mental debilitation caused by a two-hour examination believes that he is walking across the street into Wolfies of Miami, he would truly be in a state of post-examination shock. Nor is it possible that a family from the midwest, anxious to visit Wolfies, would find itself in Brooklyn instead of Miami. Everyone gets lost in Brooklyn \u2014 but not that lost. The trial court itself has found \u201cthat the plaintiffs do not claim to have suffered any financial loss to be traced to the use of the name \u2018Wolfies,\u2019 which eliminates any such aspect of the controversy.\u201d 185 F.Supp. 454, 456. The court, however, was greatly influenced by defendant\u2019s flagrant appropriation of the name. But intent is not controlling. A trade name implies trade. If trade is not affected, there is no loss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no \u201cchance that this [the use of the name \u201cWolfies\u201d] will deflect buyers who would otherwise buy of the putative other source * * * [which would cancel] the second comer\u2019s privilege of reproducing the original, which he has in common with the public at large (Judge Learned Hand in American-Marietta Co. v. Krigsman, 2 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 287). Furthermore, there is no proof or even claim that plaintiffs\u2019 name, credit, reputation for quality, or kindred assets are being tarnished by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Recognition must be given to the many cases in which the restaurant name is quite unique such as the \u201cStork Club,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the \u201cPump Room,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cCock \u2019N Bull\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cRuby Foo.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All these cases can be put into the deception category because of the unusual name. The courts, unfortunately, can never avoid the task of making distinctions or drawing border lines. If the courts are to look for legislative guidance as to national policy relating to monopoly, the statutes (buttressed by Supreme Court decisions) disclose a tendency to grant monopolies in a most restrictive manner limited in time and bestowed only upon a showing of merit. It may well be that a \u201cStork Club\u201d or a \u201cPump Room\u201d should qualify for exclusionary protection as against an ordinary citizen named \u201cJoe\u201d but quaere whether a restaurant operator using a soubriquet in its familiar or diminutive form \u201cWolfie\u201d can in this day and age claim such uniqueness whether it emanates from a name or from a characteristic. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>my opinion, such a holding disregards the principles of unfair competition recently declared in this Circuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">I therefore would reverse and dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. See the comment of Judge Clark in Ms dissent in American Safety Table Company, Inc. v. Schreiber v. Goldberg, 2 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 255, 277, certiorari denied 1959, 361 U.S. 915, 80 S.Ct. 259, 4 L.Ed.2d 185, \u201cThe all but wholly obscured truth is that the well-known concept of unfair competition is being employed to fashion and shelter a monopoly * * * \u201d. The dangers to which Judge Clark adverted were heeded in the second opinion, 287 F.2d 417, 419 (decided February 28, 1961), wherein the court said, referring to a perpetual monopoly established via unfair competition, \u201cWe certainly never intended any such result. On the contrary, as indicated in the opinion again and again, we intended no departure from the basic principles of the law of unfair competition as stated in this Circuit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-15\">.
