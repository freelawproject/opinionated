Recognizing the limitations upon the scope of our review of an order denying a new trial, United States v. Johnson, 1946, 327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562, we think nevertheless that under all the circumstances the denial here was erroneous. The new trial will, of course, include Count 1 of the indictment, the conviction on which was previously held to be subject to reversal for failure to furnish defendant with a copy of the grand jury minutes, 282 F.2d 551-552.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-19\">The judgment of conviction and the order denying a new trial are reversed and a new trial ordered. The appeal <em>from </em>the order denying a reduction in sentence is thereby rendered moot and the appeal therefrom is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
