This Court held that [273 F.2d 703]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201c * * * the record does support the Board\u2019s finding that such fees were coerced in that there was present an implicit threat of loss of job if those fees were not paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">\u201c * * * reimbursement of fees to be a proper and appropriate remedy to restore employees to the position they would have enjoyed but for the illegal practices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">and directed enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. 273 F.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The Supreme Court granted Writ of Certiorari [363 U.S. 837, 80 S.Ct. 1610, 4 L.Ed.2d 1723] in which the refund provision alone was challenged. The majority of the Supreme Court held that [365 U.S. 651, 81 S.Ct. 877]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">\u201cWhere no membership in the union was shown to be influenced or compelled by reason of any unfair practice, no \u2018consequences of violation\u2019 are removed by the order compelling the union to return all dues and fees collected from the members; and no \u2018dissipation\u2019 of the effects of the prohibited action is achieved. * * * The order in those circumstances becomes punitive and beyond the power of the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">The judgment of this Court was reversed, and the cause remanded to this Court for proceedings in conformity with the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">Accordingly, this Court hereby revokes that part of its prior judgment which granted the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its Order with respect to the provision for refund of fees, dues, and assessments collected from members.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
