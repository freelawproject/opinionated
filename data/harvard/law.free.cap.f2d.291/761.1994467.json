Appellant is trustee for the creditors and stockholders of Pacific Refiners, Ltd., a dissolved corporation, hereinafter referred to as Refiners. Two questions are presented: (1) whether Refiners was entitled to carry forward as a consolidated net operating loss to 1953 the net operating loss suffered in 1950 by its subsidiary, Hilo Gas Company, Ltd., hereinafter referred to as Hilo Gas; and (2) whether Refiners was entitled to deduct in 1955 Territory of Hawaii income taxes allocable to capital gains from sales in liquidation of Refiners, the gain not being recognized for federal income tax purposes by reason of Section 337, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 337. Both questions were decided adversely to appellant by the trial court. See 178 F.Supp. 637. The case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">\n<em>Was Taxpayer Entitled to Deduct Loss Carry-over in 1953 Consolidated Return?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The facts pertinent to a determination of the first issue may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">Refiners, a corporation organized under the laws of Hawaii on May 31, 1949, and dissolved on November 19, 1956, was engaged in the manufacture and sale of petroleum products and the distribution of butane in Hawaii. It was not a public utility and none of its business was subject to regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Hawaii. Honolulu Gas Company, Ltd., hereinafter referred to as Honolulu Gas, was a public utility operating a manufacturing gas business in Oahu. Subsequent to the incorporation of Refiners, Honolulu Gas purchased its gas from Refiners. The initial stock issue of Refiners was purchased by Honolulu Gas and distributed to its stockholders as a dividend. Hilo Gas, organized in 1927, was engaged as a public utility in the manufacture and distribution of gas in the City of Hilo and in the non-utility business of distributing bottled liquefied petroleum gas outside of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">In August, 1949, Refiners entered into a contract with Standard Oil Company of California, hereinafter called Standard, for the purchase of petroleum oil and butane for a period of ten years, the contract specifying a substantial minimum purchase each year. Standard supplied Refiners a heavy gas oil blended with butane. Refiners separated the butane from the gas oil at its refinery. The liquefied butane was stored and sold by Refiners. The gas oil was sold to Honolulu Gas for its use in the manufacture of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">In 1948 and 1949 Hilo Gas lost money and was in financial difficulties. In the spring of 1950, Orlando Lyman, its president and largest stockholder, approached A. E. Englebright, the general manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>of Refiners, for assistance in solving the problems of Hilo Gas. It was first proposed that Hilo Gas should cease the manufacture of gas and buy butane from Refiners, thus saving manufacturing costs. Further negotiations, in which alternative plans were considered, proved unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">About the middle of September, 1950, Lyman oifered to sell his shares of Hilo Gas to Refiners or Honolulu Gas. With his stock and that of another stockholder who was willing to sell, Refiners could acquire in excess of 75% of Hilo\u2019s stock. On October 3, 1950, Refiners secured options to purchase 84% of the stock of Hilo Gas. The purchase was consummated October 6, 1950, and by October 25, 1950, Refiners had acquired 96% of the stock of Hilo Gas at a total cost of $63,-897.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On September 27, 1950, the directors of Honolulu Gas authorized the acquisition of the assets of Hilo Gas at a price not to exceed $75,000.00, subject to the approval of the Public Utilities Commission. On October 20, 1950, Hilo Gas filed a petition with the Public Utilities Commission for approval to sell its assets to Honolulu Gas. The Commission entered an order on November 15, 1950, approving the sale for approximately $64,000.-00, $46,000.00 in cash and the balance through the assumption by Honolulu of the liabilities of Hilo. Under Hawaiian law, the sale of substantially all the property of a corporation required the affirmative vote of. three-fourths of the stock. On October 31, 1950, Hilo Gas (with Refiners holding more than three-fourths of the stock) authorized the sale of the utility assets to Honolulu Gas, and the sale to Refiners of the other assets for $18,500.00. Hilo Gas retained merchandise parts inventory amounting to $1,010.64, certain accounts receivable, and the lease of an office building in Hilo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">The stock of Hilo Gas was purchased by Refiners, rather than by Honolulu Gas, because Refiners as the distributor of butane had the primary interest in securing the Hilo market. Honolulu Gas was interested in the utility business of distributing gas through the city mains, but was not interested in the distribution of bottled butane. In addition, an order of the Public Utilities Commission would have been necessary before Honolulu Gas could purchase the stock, whereas no such order was required in the case of Refiners; and in the view of Refiners\u2019 management, quick action was necessary. Moreover, the purchase of Hilo Gas stock by Honolulu Gas would have made it a public utility holding company under federal law, a situation which Honolulu Gas wished to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">On October 31, 1950, Hilo Gas sold assets having a basis for tax purposes of $211,684.90 to Honolulu Gas and Refiners for a total consideration of $88,754.32. The utility assets were sold to Honolulu Gas for $122,930.58 less than their net book value. The utility assets consisted of \u201cproperty used in the trade or business\u201d as defined in Section 117(j) (1), Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 117 (j) (1). As a result of the sale of the utility assets to Honolulu for $122,-930.58 less than their net book value, Hilo Gas claimed a net operating loss of $117.-792.50 for 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">The tax year of both Refiners and Hilo Gas was the calendar year. Consolidated federal income tax returns were filed for 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and separate returns for 1954 and 1955. Both companies filed separate territorial income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>returns for the years 1950 to 1955 inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">In 1950 Refiners suffered a loss of $93,-092.00. In 1951 it had a net income of $17,445.00 and in 1952, $39,147.00. It did not have to pay any federal income taxes in those years. In 1953 it had a net income before income taxes of $206,-397.20 and after income taxes (as reported) of $167,229.00. In 1954 it had a net income before income taxes of $215,735.-66 and after income taxes (as reported) of $104,977.00. These figures are on an unconsolidated basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The original plan of Refiners as controlling stockholder of Hilo Gas had been to sell the utility assets to Honolulu Gas and dissolve Hilo Gas at such a time as the directors determined to be convenient. Actually, Hilo Gas did not sell and distribute all its assets in 1950 and continued its corporate existence until September 18,1956, when it was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">From 1950 until its dissolution, Hilo Gas continued to file the annual reports required by Hawaiian law, hold meetings of stockholders and directors, and file federal and territorial income tax returns. While other possible uses of Hilo Gas were considered, its specific activities during this pexfiod consisted of leasing property, which it sublet to Honolulu Gas and to the taxpayer. Hilo Gas received rental, interest and merchandising income and paid expenses for office supplies, janitor service, directors\u2019 fees, pensions to retired employees and federal and territorial taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Corporation exhibits filed by Hilo Gas as required by territorial law show total income of $19,294.16 in 1951, expenses of $18,324.96, for a net income before taxes of $969.20. Comparable figures for succeeding years were: 1952, $10,732.76, less $10,273.26, for a net income of $469.-50; 1953, $8,600.00, less $5,830.71, for a net income of $2,769.29 ; 1954, $8,600.00, less $6,009.25, for a net income of $2,-590.75; 1955, $8,700.00, less $6,063.04, for a net income of $2,636.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">At the time of the acquisition of the stock of Messrs. Lyman and Hutchinson on October 6, 1950, no consideration was given by Refiners to the tax aspects of the transaction. The officials of Refiners, did not know what the book value of the Hilo Gas assets was, and the Hilo Gas. books were not made available to Refiners-until after the decision had been made to purchase the Lyman and Hutchinson stock. Mr. Lyman has stated that the principal purpose on taking over Hilo Gas was to sell butane not then used by Hito Gas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">In November, 1950, Refiners obtained advice on the tax aspects of the transaction and was advised that the book toss on the sale to Honolulu Gas would be an allowable deduction in a consolidated return filed by Refiners and Hilo Gas, but that this would not be an immediate benefit because Refiners did not have any net income. Honolulu Gas was advised that it could not acquire the Hilo Gas assets at their book value in order to take advantage of the loss sustained on the abandonment of the manufacturing plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">The net toss from the sale in October, 1950, of the utility assets of Hilo Gas to Honolulu Gas was included in computing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the net operating loss carry-over to subsequent years,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the consolidated income tax returns timely filed for Refiners and Hilo Gas. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed this item, resulting in a deficiency for the year 1953 of $58,472.39, plus interest of $11,301.-99, which taxpayer has paid and is suing to recover.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The trial court held that the Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of the \u201closs carryover\u201d was correct, but sustained the dis-allowance on the ground that the taxpayer \u201chas not established that \u2018the principal purpose for\u2019 the acquisition of Hilo Gas was not for \u2018evasion or avoidance of Federal income * * * tax\u2019 \u201d, [178 F.Supp. 643] relying primarily upon Section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AcL\">To sustain the disallowance under Section 129, it must appear that the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the acquisition of the stock of Hilo Gas by Refiners was \u201cevasion or avoidance\u201d of the tax. It is clear from the legislative history <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and regulations <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that to constitute the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d the tax avoidance purpose must exceed in importance any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">The rule is well summarized in 7A Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 42.228: \u201cThe prohibited purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>of tax evasion must be the \u2018principal\u2019 purpose, and the principal purpose of a transaction does not become tax evasion merely because its tax consequences are considered by the parties to the transaction. Presence of the requisite purpose \u25a0of tax evasion has been said to be chiefly .an issue of fact.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">If the facts were in dispute, this court would accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. Here, however, the facts are stipulated, and the agreed facts in our opinion preclude a finding that tax avoidance was the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the acquisition. The parties have stipulated that at the time of the acquisition \u2022of the stock on October 6, 1950, \u201cno consideration was given by Refiners to the tax aspects of the transaction\u201d; that \u201cthe officials of Refiners did not know what the book value of the Hilo Gas assets was and the Hilo Gas books were not made available to Refiners until after the decision had been made to purchase\u201d the stock; that \u201cMr. Lyman has stated that the principal purpose on taking over Hilo Gas was to sell butane not then used by Hilo Gas\u201d; that \u201cit was not until November, 1950, that Refiners obtained advice on the tax aspects of the transaction.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">It is further stipulated that the general manager of Refiners, in presenting the proposal to the executive committee \u25a0on September 16, 1950, \u201creviewed the advantages of the purchase of the Hilo Gas stock to provide an assured outlet for butane on the Island of Hawaii\u201d. In view of Refiners\u2019 commitment to Standard, it was \u201cnecessary or highly desirable\u201d to obtain Hilo\u2019s outlet, plus the non-utility business of Hilo Gas^ \u2014 -the distribution of liquefied petroleum gas in tanks to rural customers. Refiners\u2019 new refinery was scheduled for completion in the fall of 1950 (it was actually completed in December, 1950), and it was necessary to find outlets for its butane products. \u201cPurchase of the stock would also assure Refiners of control of the nonutility (\u201crock gas\u201d) business of Hilo Gas in the outlying districts of the Island of Hawaii.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Refiners and Hilo Gas became affiliated corporations prior to October 25, 1950. It is true, as appellee contends, that prior to acquisition of the Hilo Gas stock Refiners knew that Hilo Gas was in financial difficulties in 1948 and 1949. At the time of acquisition, however, Refiners did not know the book value of the assets of Hilo Gas (a corporation organized in 1927) or to what extent the assets might have been depreciated. Taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a loss which occurred after affiliation, on October 31, 1950, when Hilo Gas sold the utility assets to Honolulu Gas. No claim is made for any loss sustained prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Moreover, Refiners itself sustained a loss of $93,092.00 in 1950, the year of the acquisition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and was not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>pay any Federal or territorial income taxes for the years 1950, 1951 or 1952.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Under the foregoing facts, which must be accepted as true, it cannot be said that any purpose of tax evasion or avoidance \u201cexceeds in importance any other purpose\u201d. Moreover, there was here no determination by the Commissioner that the principal purpose of the acquisition was tax avoidance or that the acquisition served no business purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The Government argues that when taxpayer decided to treat Hilo Gas as a newly acquired affiliate, Hilo Gas \u201cwas practically a defunct corporation\u201d and \u201cripe for dissolution\u201d. Hilo Gas, however, was not a wholly inactive corporation subsequent to the sale of its assets. The parties have stipulated that until September, 1951 \u201cHilo Gas maintained the payroll, paid the office rent, and provided various other services for Refiners and Honolulu Gas on a cost-plus basis\u201d; maintained a separate bank account until its dissolution; in 1951 entered into a two-year lease of an office building with option to renew for five years for a rental of $500 per month; in 1952 entered into a five-year lease of another office building for a rental of $275 per month; in 1955 entered into a ten-year lease of a butane distribution site; and until its dissolution, subleased office space to Honolulu Gas and Refiners, received income, filed returns and held stockholders\u2019 and directors\u2019 meetings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Neither the statutes nor regulations require corporate activity for continued affiliation. \u201cIf conditions necessary to affiliation exist, the status will not be denied merely because one of the affiliated corporations is inactive; there is nothing in the statute which indicates that activity is essential to affiliation\u201d. 8 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 46.08.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">The Government concedes that the \u201cfacts of business purpose\u201d justified the acquisition by the taxpayer of the <em>assets </em>of Hilo Gas and the liquidation of HiloGas as a corporate entity. It is argued that this is what the taxpayer intended' when it purchased the stock of Hilo Gas; that it had arranged for the sale of the assets of Hilo Gas prior to purchase of the stock; that the taxpayer continued to carry out its plan of liquidation; and that the \u201clater revival of Hilo Gas in November, 1950, to continue in existence as an affiliate of the taxpayer was admittedly prompted by tax considerations\u201d and had no business purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">Neither the stipulated facts nor the provisions of the statute support these-conclusions. The parties have agreed that the original plan of Refiners as the-new controlling stockholder of Hilo Gas \u201chad been to sell the utility assets to-Honolulu Gas, to sell the remaining assets to Refiners and to dissolve the corporation at such time as the directors of that company determined in their discretion to be convenient\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The parties have agreed also that Refiners first considered the tax aspects of the transaction <em>after </em>the acquisition of the stock and <em>after </em>the sale of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>In effect, the Government is saying that even though, at the time of acquisition, Refiners had a business and not a tax evasion purpose, when it <em>subsequently </em>ascertained the tax consequences it revived or kept Hilo Gas alive in order to take advantage of a possible loss carryover. The determining factor, however, is the intention or purpose of Refiners <em>\u2022at the time of acquisition. </em>Refiners having acquired control of Hilo Gas for business reasons alone and without considering the tax aspects of the transaction, the intention or purpose \u201cfor which (such) acquisition was made\u201d would not be changed from a business into a tax evasion purpose when it subsequently ascertained the tax consequences of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In support of its contentions that the primary purpose of the acquisition of Hilo Gas as an affiliate was to evade taxes under Section 129 and that taxpayer may not treat Hilo Gas as a \u201ccontinuing affiliate in order to deduct the loss carryover\u201d, the Government relies upon Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. British Motor Car Distributors, Ltd., 9 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 392, reversing 31 T.C. 437, Elko Realty Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 949, affirming 29 T.C. 1012, and American Pipe &amp; Steel Corp. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 125, affirming 25 T.C. 351. All are distinguishable. In British Motor Car Distributors, Ltd., it was not claimed that there was any business purpose in the acquisition and it was \u201cclear that the principal purpose * * * was to avoid taxes\u201d [278 F.2d 393]. In Elko and American Pipe &amp; .Steel Corp. the Commissioner had determined that the principal purpose of the acquisition was the avoidance of Federal income taxes. The Tax Court, in each case, sustained the Commissioner\u2019s determination, and the Court of Appeals held that the findings of the Tax Court were supported by substantial evidence. Not only is there an absence in the instant case of a determination by the Commissioner that the principal purpose of the transaction was tax avoidance; but there is also a stipulation of facts which precludes that determination. It is the purpose of the <em>acquisition </em>which is controlling under Section 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The Government contends further that, apart from Section 129, the deduction is prohibited by \u201cother specific provisions and basic principles of the revenue laws\u201d. It is argued (1) that the taxpayer was not entitled to the privilege of filing a consolidated return under Section 141; and (2) that if the privilege were allowed, the Commissioner had ample authority under Sections 141 (i) and 45 <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to disallow the deduction by allocating the sales to Hilo Gas in order to prevent a distortion of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Section 141 itself \u201cprescribed no test of affiliation other than stock ownership\u201d. <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, Refiners owned in excess of 95% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Hilo Gas, the prerequisite of an \u201caffiliated group\u201d under Section 141 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Section 141(b) gives the Secretary (now the Commissioner or his delegate) power to prescribe \u201csuch regulations as he may deem necessary in order that the tax liability of any affiliated group of corporations\u201d may be determined in such manner as to clearly reflect income and in order to prevent avoidance of tax liability. No regulation has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>cited to justify appellee\u2019s conclusion that the taxpayer here was not entitled to the privilege of filing a consolidated return or that the claimed deduction should not be allowed. The consolidated return regulations enacted pursuant to Section 141(b) and here applicable are Regulations 129, effective for taxable years subsequent to December 31, 1949.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We find nothing in these regulations which would extend Section 129 or deny the privilege of filing a consolidated return in any case where it does not appear that the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d for which the acquisition is made was evasion or avoidance of federal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Presumably Section 129 was intended to prevent tax schemes designed to avoid taxes in contravention of the basic policies of Section 141 and other sections. Where no tax avoidance purpose is shown to exist, however, losses of the type here involved are deductible, not being within the prohibited purview of either Section 129, Section 141, or the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Subsequent amendments to Section 129 and the legislative history with respect thereto tend to confirm this conclusion. Section 269 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 269), the successor to Section 129, provides in subsection (c) for \u201ca presumption creating prima facie evidence of a principal purpose of tax evasion or avoidance where the consideration paid by any person or corporation upon an acquisition (to which Section 269(a) otherwise applies) is \u2018substantially disproportionate\u2019 to the aggregate of (1) the adjusted basis of the property directly or indirectly acquired, and (2) of the additional tax benefits also acquired which were not otherwise available\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Without departing from the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d test of Section 129, Congress, in the enactment of Section 269(c) has provided a more objective method of determining the existence of a primary purpose of tax evasion or avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The Government argues that J. D. and A. B. Spreckels Co. v. Commissioner, 1940, 41 B.T.A. 370, is on \u201call fours\u201d with the instant case. There, the \u201cacquiring\u201d corporation and the \u201cacquired\u201d corporation were held not to be \u201caffiliates\u201d within the meaning of Section 141 because there was no \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d in the acquisition. It was simply a case where the court found that there was no business purpose, only a tax purpose. That case arose before the enactment of Section 129, but in effect the criteria of business purpose and tax evasion of Section 129 were applied. Where there is in fact no business purpose and the sole or principal purpose is tax evasion, the benefits of a consolidated return may be denied under either Section 129 or the Spreckels rule. Neither is applicable where the acquisition has a business purpose and tax evasion or avoidance is not the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">More nearly in point is Bishop Trust Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner, 1937, 36 B.T.A. 1173, where the Tax Court found a \u201cbona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>fide business motive\u201d, and held that affiliation was proper and a loss of a subsidiary after acquisition could be deducted in a consolidated return under Section 141, even though the shares of the subsidiary had been acquired when the subsidiary was in financial difficulty, its liabilities exceeded its assets, and a plan of liquidation was in contemplation.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We find no merit in the Government\u2019s contention that the Commissioner had authority to disallow the deduction by allocating it solely to Hilo Gas \u201cin order to prevent a distortion of income\u201d pursuant to Sections 141 (i) and 45. The fact remains that the Commissioner did not \u201cdistribute, apportion, or allocate * * * deductions * * * between or among\u201d Refiners and Hilo Gas. He disallowed the deduction entirely, as part of the consolidated net loss on the consolidated return filed by Refiners and Hilo Gas, for the reason that the loss \u201cwas sustained in, or was allocable to, the period prior to affiliation and before the consolidation became effective\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Clearly, Section 45 was not applied, nor <em>may it now </em>be relied upon to sustain the Commissioner. In Hypotheek Land Co. v. Commissioner, 1952, 200 F.2d 390, 396, this court said: \u201cIn connection with section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code, it should be pointed out that whatever his view of the close association between petitioner and the Dutch banks, this clearly disclosed fact did not lead the Commissioner to make any attempt to \u2018allocate, distribute or apportion\u2019 income between the corporations. He merely <em>disallowed </em>the deduction. Section 45 nowhere permits disallowance of a <em>deduction, </em>the action herein taken by him. General Industries Corp. v. Commissioner, 35 B.T.A. 615, 617.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">It cannot be denied that the taxpayer is the beneficiary of an unexpected tax windfall. This, in itself, however, will not justify the disallowance of the deduction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under the applicable statutes and regulations, the propriety of disallowing the \u201closs carry-over\u201d depends upon whether the principal purpose of the acquisition of Hilo Gas by Refiners was tax evasion or avoidance. We must conclude from the agreed facts that tax evasion was not the principal purpose of the acquisition. The claimed deduction accordingly must be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">\n<em>Was Taxpayer Entitled to Deduct Taxes Paid Territory of Hawaii in 1955 Return?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AdO\">Pursuant to a plan of liquidation adopted by the stockholders on November 25, 1955, Refiners sold its refining facilities to Standard on December 6,1955, and the Isle-Gas business and related assets to Honolulu Gas on December 31, 1955. Thereafter all of the assets (less assets retained to meet claims) were distributed in complete liquidation, and the corporation was dissolved by order of the Treasurer of the Territory of Hawaii on November 16,1956, within twelve months of the adoption of the plan of liquidation. No gain or loss to Refiners was recognized on the sale of the assets pursuant to the provisions of Section 337, Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>In its 1955 income tax return, Refiners claimed a deduction for income taxes paid the Territory of Hawaii, which included $61,061.59 allocated by the Commissioner to gains from the sale of Refiners\u2019 assets. This amount was disallowed, the Commissioner assigning as the reason for the disallowance that Section 265 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 \u201cprohibits the deduction of expenses allocable to income exempt from federal income tax.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The district court, in sustaining the Commissioner, concluded that inasmuch as no gain or loss to Refiners was recognized on the sale of the assets under the provisions of Section 837, \u201cthis nontaxable gain qualified as exempt income under Section 265(1)\u201d and Refiners accordingly was not entitled to the claimed deduction of $61,061.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Appellant contends (1) that \u201cnonrecognized\u201d gains under Section 337 are not income \u201cwholly exempt\u201d under Section 265; and (2) that the territorial taxes paid are not \u201cexpenses\u201d within the meaning of Section 265(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Section 337 was enacted to avoid double taxation at <em>both </em>the <em>corporate </em>and <em>shareholder </em>levels where a corporation sells its assets at a profit and completely liquidates within one year. In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court Holding Co., 1945, 324 U.S. 331, 65 S.Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981, it was found that the corporation itself had negotiated the sale of its assets, followed by liquidation and transfer of legal title by the shareholders. This resulted in a taxable gain to the corporation on the sale and a taxable gain to the shareholders on the liquidation. In United States v. Cumberland Public Service Co., 1950, 338 U.S. 451, 70 S.Ct. 280, 94 L.Ed. 251, it was found that the sale was made by the shareholders rather than the corporation, so that only one tax, on the liquidation, was incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">It is clear from the legislative history of Section 337 that the purpose of this legislation was to provide \u201ca definitive rule which will eliminate any uncertainty\u201d in determining whether the sale was in fact made by the corporation or the shareholders. The House Report, after referring to the decisions in Court Holding and Cumberland, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-13\">\u201cIn order to eliminate questions resulting only from formalities, your committee has provided that if a corporation in process of liquidation sells assets there will be no tax at the corporate level, but any gain realized will be taxed to the distributeeshareholder, as ordinary income or capital gain depending on the character of the asset sold.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-14\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-15\">\u201c * * * under present law, the tax consequences arising from sales made in the course of liquidation depend primarily upon the formal manner in which transactions are arranged. The possibility that double taxation may occur in such cases results in causing the problem to be a trap for the unwary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">\u201c \u2018Subsection (a) accordingly permits the imposition of a single tax at the shareholder level upon property sold during the course of a liquidation irrespective of whether the corporation or the shareholder in fact effected the sale provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>other provisions of this subsection are met. * * * \u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A96\">Section 265(1) relates to income which is \u201cwholly exempt\u201d from the imposition of taxes. Section 1.265-1 of the Regulations refers more specifically to the meaning of the terms \u201cwholly exempt\u201d and \u201cnonexempt income\u201d, reading in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">\u201c(b) Exempt income and nonexempt income. (1) As used in this section, the term \u2018class of exempt income\u2019 means any class of income (whether or not any amount of income of such class is received or accrued) wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. For purposes of this section, a class of income which is considered as wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by subtitle A includes any class of income which is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">\u201c(i) Wholly excluded from gross income under any provision of subtitle A, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201c(ii) Wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by subtitle A under the provisions of any other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201c(2) As used in this section the term \u2018nonexempt income\u2019 means any income which is required to be included in gross income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Section 337 does not provide that the gain shall not be included in gross income or that it shall be exempt from the tax, but rather that \u201cno gain or loss shall be recognized\u201d to the corporation under the conditions therein specified.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Income which is not includable in gross income obviously is \u201cwholly exempt\u201d. The Government argues that income which is includable in gross income but is not \u201crecognized\u201d by reason of Sec. 337 is also \u201cwholly exempt\u201d, since no tax is imposed on the <em>corporation </em>on any capital gain. Neither the statutes nor regulations support this conclusion. The purpose of Section 265 was to prevent a deduction from income which is never to be taxed. It was not the intention of Congress, in enacting Section 337, to \u201cexempt\u201d any gain from the tax, but rather to provide that the gain should not be taxed twice, both at the corporate and shareholder levels, where the taxpayer complies with the provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Apparently this is the first case involving the application of Section 265 (1) to a Section 337 liquidation. Under a different factual situation, however, the Tax Court in Cotton States Fertilizer Co. v. Commissioner, 1957, 28 T.C. 1169 (acq., 1958-1 Cum.Bul. 4) recognized the distinction between \u201cnonrecognized gains\u201d and \u201cwholly exempt income\u201d. It was there held that gains not recognized by virtue of Section 112(f), I.R.C.1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(f), were not \u201cwholly exempt\u201d within the meaning of Section 24(a) (5), I.R.C.1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 24(a) (5) (the predecessor of Section 265(1), I.R.C.1954). Section 112(f) provides that no gain shall be recognized if property is involuntarily converted into other property. Two of the taxpayer\u2019s plants were destroyed by fire. In connection with a claim for fire insurance, the taxpayer employed architects and contractors in estimating the replacement costs. As a result of the claims, the taxpayer recovered insurance exceeding the cost basis for the destroyed property. The proceeds were used to replace the property and no gain was reported in accordance with Section 112(f). A deduction claimed for the amounts paid the architect and contractor was disallowed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>tended that \u201cbecause petitioner was not required under Section 112(f) (3) (A) to recognize any gain, such gain must be considered as \u2018income * * * wholly exempt\u2019 as that term is used in Section 24(a) (5)\u201d. The Tax Court rejected this contention and held, \u201cThe insurance proceeds did not become \u2018income * * * wholly exempt\u2019 by reason of petitioner\u2019s election under Section 112(f)\u201d. The court pointed out that if the new property were sold in a subsequent year, any gain realized on the involuntary conversion would be reflected in the income reported in the year of sale; that Section 112(f) did not result in giving a \u201cwholly exempt\u201d classification to income received on an involuntary conversion, but at best provided for the postponement of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Appellee attempts to distinguish the Cotton States Fertilizer case on the ground that Section 337 does not effect a postponement of the tax, as far as the corporation is concerned, but effects a complete exemption because the corporation is never taxed on the nonreeognized gain. It is true of course that under a Section 337 liquidation the corporation itself will not be taxed on the capital gain, where the liquidation is completed within twelve months. While the corporation is not taxed, however, the shareholders to whom the proceeds of the liquidation are distributed are taxed on the capital gain, although on a different basis than the gain to the corporation. Section 337 does not <em>eliminate </em>entirely the tax on the gains realized from sale and liquidation, but rather <em>limits </em>the tax to that paid by the shareholders on liquidation and further limits to a period of twelve months the nonrecognition of the gain to the corporation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">It is true also that Cotton States Fertilizer Co. refers to a \u201cpostponement\u201d of the tax by reason of the fact that if the new property is sold at a profit in a subsequent year, any gain would be reflected in the income reported in the year of sale. This is not, however, the sole basis of the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the deduction was allowable. The primary basis of the holding is the fact that nonreeognized gains are not exempt income within the meaning of Section 24 (a) (5), I.R.C.1939 (the predecessor of Section 265(1), I.R.C.1954).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">There is a valid distinction between \u201cwholly exempt\u201d income and income on which \u201cno gain or loss is recognized\u201d. Wholly exempt income is never taxed. Nonreeognized gains are not taxed in the particular transaction that qualifies for nonrecognition treatment. They may be taxed, however, if the transaction fails to meet the nonrecognition requirements and may also be taxed at another time. In other words, they are not \u201cwholly exempt\u201d from the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">We conclude accordingly that Section 265(1) is not here applicable for the reason that the gains involved, which are nonreeognized under Section 337, are not allocable to income \u201cwholly exempt\u201d from tax, and that appellant is entitled to the claimed deduction of $61,061.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Having reached this conclusion it is unnecessary to pass upon appellant\u2019s contention that Section 265 is also inapplicable because state income taxes are not deductions as \u201cexpenses\u201d within the meaning of Section 265.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Judgment reversed.

Accordingly, the net loss, if any, sustained as the result of the sale of the utility assets of Hilo Gas Company, Ltd., to Honolulu Gas Company, Ltd., in the year 1950 may not be claimed as a part of the net operating loss deduction against the income of Pacific Refiners, Ltd., in the year 1953.
