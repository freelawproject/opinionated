At sea, and in a school of tuna, appellee, regularly the cook, left his post to aid in bringing in fish. He was standing on a rack at the stern of the boat; one of the chains holding the rack gave way as he was bringing in a fish. The fish hit the-deck, the barbless hook on his line left, the fish and struck appellee in his right eye, destroying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">The sole question involved before us is-whether the dropping of the rack was or was not the proximate cause of the fishhook striking appellee\u2019s eye. Appelleeurges it was; appellants that there could be no proximate cause, because the dropping of the rack could only have lowered the appellee and his pole and thus caused a slack in the line and not a tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">It is undisputed that the fish caught on appellee\u2019s line was lifted from the-ocean and hit the boat\u2019s deck. The fall of the platform took place while the fish was in the air. Appellants urge that appellee must have jerked the fish toward him, and that this tension on the line-caused the hook to fly toward him. Appellee urges that the rack gave way <em>while </em>the fish was being landed, that appellee\u2019s, off-balance fall and the fact another fisherman fell against him, <em>before </em>appellee\u2019s, pole was taken from his fisherman\u2019s pad put tension on the line and prevented a release from the tension normally experienced when the pole is taken from the pad; thus enabling the fisherman to-seize the theatre line (wire leader) and' bring the fish toward the fisherman, so-that the hook may be removed by hand,, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">The court below carefully went into the rapid sequence of events which led up to. the injury. In comment, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-22\">\u201cThe Court finds that as this thing happened all of a sudden in a moment or second or so the giving away of the rack caused the situation where increased tension was put on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the line, the hook jerked out of the mouth of the fish, plaintiff\u2019s face was turned toward the rear, and the hook caught him in the right eye. I don\u2019t think that those findings are inconsistent with what the witnesses have said here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cA man engaged in a hazardous occupation knows what he is about, but more the reason that he should be given a safe place to work and not have the hazard of an insecure footing added to the hazards of his occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cWithin this five-second interval it is not possible for the Court to say exactly when that rack gave way. But obviously there was insecure footing from the time the rack gave way. Nor do we know whether this rack gave way suddenly or whether it took a second or two for the bolt to pull out of the stern of the ship and allow the rack to settle. At any rate, here is a man, with a fish that he landed, on an insecure footing. It could well have been that as he attempted to pull the fish forward the ordinary shifting of weight in attempting to take another motion brought about the situation where he no longer had the secure footing to stand upon and the tension was put upon the line. This matter of hooking a fish, swinging it back and all is almost like a golf stroke \u2014 there is a rhythm of motion, and it requires a safe place for a man to stand who engages in this activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The only matter in agreement is that: \u201cit all happened so fast\u201d (Tr. p. 192)\u2014 \u201cinstantaneously\u201d \u2014 \u201ctogether\u201d (Tr. p. 192) \u2014 \u201call mixed together\u201d (Tr. p. 56)\u2014 \u201call at once\u201d \u2014 \u201csimultaneously\u201d\u2014\u201cjust whoom!\u201d (Tr. p. 231). Appellants divide the process of catching tuna into three steps \u2014 appellee likens it to one continuous golf swing. Isolated excerpts from the testimony (largely from appellee himself) lend support to each side\u2019s theory of how the accident happened (Tr. pp. 192-194; 207-209; 217; 220; 222; 229).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">From the evidence the court found (Tr. p. 17, #8) the eye bolt holding the chain supporting the rack broke, that the rack suddenly dropped, that the appellee was thrown off-balance; that he partially fell, that another seaman fell against him, that the whole interval of time from hooking of the fish to the hooking of appellee\u2019s eye was two or three seconds; that <em>the unusual tension on the fish line was caused by appellee\u2019s shift in position, in turn caused by the dropping of the fishing rack </em>\u2014 that the unsafe rack proximately caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">There was more than a scintilla of evidence (Hawley v. Alaska Steamship Co., 9 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 307); there is some evidence, and not mere speculation to support the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">From the record we cannot say as a matter of law the findings of fact were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
