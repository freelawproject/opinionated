All of these procedures are employed to implement petitioner\u2019s appeal from an order of District Judge Ralph M. Freeman entered April 21, 1961, dismissing petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Subsequent to the order denying petitioner\u2019s application for habeas corpus and on May 8, 1961, said District Judge denied petitioner\u2019s application for certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Petitioner is a prisoner in one of the state prisons of Michigan, having been convicted after a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Genesee County, Michigan, of the offense of breaking and entering. He attacked the validity of his conviction by various proceedings in the Circuit Court of Genesee County, and his application for leave to appeal was denied by the Michigan Supreme Court. Certiorari to that court was denied by the United States Supreme Court, 358 U.S. 856, 79 S.Ct. 88, 3 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Subsequent to such state court proceedings, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court at Detroit, Michigan. On January 26, 1959, said petition for habeas corpus was denied and his action therefor was dismissed. On March 17, 1959, petitioner\u2019s application for rehearing of Judge Levin\u2019s ruling on his petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied by District Judge Levin. An appeal was taken to this court from the aforesaid denial of petitioner\u2019s application for writ of habeas corpus and on February 20, 1960, the order of Judge Levin was affirmed. Worth v. Bannan, 277 F.2d 457. On April 12, 1961, the present habeas corpus proceeding was instituted in the District Court at Detroit. A review of the papers before us discloses that the last mentioned habeas corpus proceeding contained substantially the same grounds for relief as were contained in the habeas corpus proceedings concluded by Judge Levin\u2019s denial thereof and this court\u2019s affirmance of such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">Without reference, however, to whether or not this court\u2019s decision in Worth v. Bannan, supra, concluded the matters involved in the present proceeding, our review of the latter papers persuades us that they contain no allegations or evidence of any facts concerning the petitioner\u2019s trial in the Genesee County Circuit Court to indicate that he was there deprived of any federally granted constitutional rights. We cannot on such habeas corpus proceeding act as a court of appeals to review matters within the jurisdiction of the state of Michigan. Hicks v. People of State of Michigan, 6 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 645; United States ex rel. Weber v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 579; Gay v. Graham, 10 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 482. It has been held, also, that the laws of Michigan provide adequate procedural processes to enable .a convicted prisoner to review errors or irregularities in a trial result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ing in his conviction. Whalen v. Frisbie, 6 Cir., 185 F.2d 607; Quicksall v. People of State of Michigan, 339 U.S. 660, 70 S.Ct. 910, 94 L.Ed. 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">This court is of the opinion that petitioner\u2019s application to this court for certificate of probable cause should be denied. Being of that opinion, the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis should likewise be denied. (No application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis appears to have been made to the district court). Such application would normally be required. Waterman v. McMillan, 1943, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 135 F.2d 807; Smith v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 1940, 109 F.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Because of our view thus expressed, we do not think that petitioner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel should be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Now, therefore, It Is Ordered that petitioner\u2019s motion for certificate of probable cause, motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and motion for appointment of counsel be, and they are, hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Approved for entry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
