Having waived a jury trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant was tried before the court without a jury. The court entered a judgment of acquittal on Counts 7 and 9, and a judgment of conviction on the other seven counts. On each of the first six counts the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years, the sentences to run concurrently with each other. On Count 8, the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for an additional five years, the sentence to run consecutively to the sentences on the first six counts. In support of the judgment of conviction, the district court entered its findings of fact<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The defendant, through his counsel, filed his notice of appeal on March 31, 1960. Various extensions of time for the filing of the record were granted. On October 12, 1960, on the motion of the appellant, he was granted permission to present his appeal on a certified typewritten transcript of the record 'and on typed briefs, and the time for filing the record was further extended to October 29, 1960. At long last on April 27, 1961, more than a year after the filing of the notice of appeal, this Court took submission of the case on briefs, two typed briefs for the appellant being filed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">On the next day, April 28, 1961, there was filed by the appellant pro se a \u201cMotion asking leave of the court to proceed in forma pauperis, respectfully requesting the court to appoint counsel for appellant and to continue the scheduled hearing of April 27, 1961 to a later date to allow counsel time to properly prepare appeal.\u201d Upon consideration, after studying the record and briefs, and in view of the lack of any reasonable excuse for the extremely late filing of that motion, the same is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"> The burden of the appellant\u2019s contention is that there was no substantial evidence to prove that his intent was fraudulent, and thus to support his conviction. It is not this Court\u2019s function to re-try the appellant, or to substitute our judgment as to his guilt or innocence for that of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, but simply to find, whether or not, taking the view most favorable to the Government, there is substantial evidence to support the judgment of <em>guilt. Riggs v. </em>United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 949. A reading of the record in the light of the briefs discloses such substantial evidence. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-16\">. Rule 23(a) Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.O.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-17\">. \u201cFindings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">\u201c1.
