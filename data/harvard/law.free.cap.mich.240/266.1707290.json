As the case was disposed of, and as we conclude properly disposed of, on the defense of accord and satisfaction, we shall only state such facts as may be necessary to an understanding of that question. Plaintiff had signed a paper in which it was. stated that he was to be paid <em>at the rate </em>of $65 a week. Whether there was a valid written agreement we need not decide. He claims to have had a verbal contract to work for that figure per week. Business became slack and he did not put in full time. He was tendered a pay check at the rate fixed but declined to accept it, claiming he was entitled to full pay whether he worked full' time or not. Seven checks in all were drawn payable to him for the time he actually worked but were not accepted by him; they were kept in its safe by the company. Before the expiration of a full week\u2019s work plaintiff was discharged. He went to the office of the company, and, after discussion between him and an agent of the company, the details of which are disputed, he was given the checks already drawn and an additional check for $2,44.40, upon the back of which appeared the words \u201cIn full settlement of all services and claims,\u201d or this in substance. He took the checks to the bank, where, without reading the indorsement on the check, as he claims, he so effectually obliterated it that it can not now be read. He testifies.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Why did you rub it out?</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Didn\u2019t look good to me. I didn\u2019t think it had any business to be anything there. It didn\u2019t look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>good to me, so I rubbed it out. I seen the words, I don\u2019t remember; I couldn\u2019t read them, I wouldn\u2019t know a 'half an hour later what those words read. I couldn\u2019t say. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to them. I worked on this until you couldn\u2019t read it. I didn\u2019t tell anybody I did this.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">After obliterating the indorsement he cashed the checks and some time later brought suit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-6\">Fellows, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_m\"><em>(after stating the facts). </em>Plaintiff\u2019s counsel insists that the language used in the indorsement is not established beyond dispute. Plaintiff did not read it and does not undertake to testify on the subject. \u2022 Having destroyed the documentary evidence an unfavorable presumption arose against him. <em>Pitcher </em>v. <em>Rogers\u2019 Estate, </em>199 Mich. 114. The witnesses who testified on the subject were of course obliged to speak from memory and, while they did not at all times use the precise words quoted above in \u25a0giving their testimony, the substance of the indorsement is established beyond question. Nor can it be questioned that there was a <em>bona fide </em>dispute. The company had in its possession a writing which, whether it possessed the elements of a binding contract or not, fixed the wage at the rate of $85 a week and pursuant to it defendant tendered him payment for the time actually put in. He, insisting that he was to receive $65 a week whether he put in full time or not, declined to accept the payments tendered. He had been discharged, and, if the contract of employment was as claimed by him, it was breached when he accepted the checks. It is idle to claim there was not a <em>bona fide </em>dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Upon the main question the case is controlled by <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>United Motors Products Co., </em>239 Mich. 194, handed down since this case was submitted. It was there pointed out by Mr. Justice Wiest, who wrote for the court, that to effectuate accord and satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>a prior agreement is not necessary. It was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\">\u201cIt is evident the circuit judge applied the rule relative to acceptance under an agreement and not an acceptance of a condition. The governing rule in the case at bar is based upon the condition accompanying the tender and consequent acceptance of the condition in retaining the money. This required no previous agreement, but rests upon a dispute as to the amount due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Nor does it avail plaintiff that, after accepting and before cashing the check, he, without the knowledge or consent of defendant, obliterated from it the statement of the conditions upon which it was given. In the case of <em>In re Cunningham\u2019s Estate, </em>311 Ill. 311. 315 (142 N. E. 740), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cThe fact that the words \u2018in full\u2019 are erased from the check or receipt by the creditor does not affect the question whether the proffer and acceptance of the check constitute an accord and satisfaction, where the erasure is without the knowledge or authority of the debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">See, also, <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Co., </em>22 R. I. 66 (46 Atl. 182); <em>Beck Electric Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Contracting Co., </em>143 Minn. 190 (173 N. W. 413); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Publishing Co., </em>16 Ga. App. 83 (84 S. E. 834); 1 C.
