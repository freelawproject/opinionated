Set-off\u2014of judgments between different parties\u2014whether set off at law, or only in equity. Judgments not between the same parties can not be set off at law, and. it devolves upon the party seeking to set off a judgment in his favor against A and B, as to a judgment by A for the use of 0, against such party complainant, to \u00a7how some equitable ground for being protected against the judgment so held by A. It is not enough that complainant may have shown his rights are equal to those of C, the beneficial plaintiff in that judgment. Unless the complainant can show they were superior to any equitable claim which could be urged in favor of the beneficial plaintiff, he can not succeed.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-15\" pgmap=\"461(157) 462(57)\">2. Assignee of contract\u2014whether chargeable with notice of equities between his assignor and the other party to the contract. A contract was made between a machine company for the closing up of the business between it and A and B, in which the company agreed to pay A two dollars for each sewing machine sold by him, or upon a lease in certain territory, provided A should devote his time and best energies to the sale of such-machines, and A assigned and sold to 0 all his rights and demands under the contract. It was held, on a bill by the machine company to have a judgment recovered by A for the use of 0 set off against a judgment recovered by the company against A and B for a larger sum in a different State, that 0, the assignee of A, was only required to know the terms of the contract of A assigned to him, and the rights of the parties thereunder, but was not bound to take notice of the equities of the company against A and B, or of the judgment against them, thus treating the agreement between the company and A and B as constituting two distinct contracts, one with A and B, and the other with A.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-6\" pgmap=\"462\">3.

A machine company entered into a written agreement with A and B, which provided for the closing up of an existing business arrangement between the company and A and B, and the carrying on of a new business by A for the company. It was held, that there were two distinct contracts, the one between the company and both A and B, and the other with A, as much so as if written on separate papers, and that the one had no connection with the other, and that A might assign his demands on the company under his contract, unaffected by the equities of the company against A and B, when the assignee had no notice in fact of such equities.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\" pgmap=\"462\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Hickox and Joel M. Hickox, upon which execution was issued immediately, and returned nulla bona; that the judgment has never been paid, and that both said judgment debtors have been, since the rendition of the judgment, insolvent; that at the October term, 1878, of the Cook circuit court, a suit was commenced on the law side, by William C. Hickox, for the use of I. B. Hickox, against complainant, claiming that there was due William C. Hickox from complainant $2300, under the following contract:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\" pgmap=\"463\">\u201cMemorandum of agreement made this 3d day of March, A.

W. Bumble, Fuller &amp; Wood, Brooklyn office and Williamsburgh office; also J. M. Hickox account, which releases him from future liability for the same. In the closing of their business by the party of the second part, it is agreed by the party of the first part to allow the party of the second part the office desk room they now occupy, free. The closing of the business is to be conducted at the expense of the party of the second part, with the exception that the party of the first part are to let the collectors which make collections in Brooklyn and Williamsburgh, make what collections they may in said Brooklyn and Williamsburg for the party of the second part, without charge to the party of the second part herein. While the parties of the second part are closing out their business, which is to be limited to the first of May, 1875, the party of the first part is to allow W. C. Hickox, one of the parties of the second part, two (2) dollars on each and every Elias or A. B. Howe sewing machine sold, either for cash or upon a lease, in the territory now controlled by the parties of the second part, (provided W. C. Hickox, one of the parties of the second part, shall devote his time and best energies to the sale of said machines,) which territory includes New York City, Brooklyn, Williams-burgh, Staten Island, and the tract they now control for South America, and all other sales for that section that do not go to a regular agent of the Howe Machine Company, and all sales at retail going to whatever section, which amount is due W. C. Hickox, one of the parties of the second part, when there has been ten or more dollars paid on said sale or lease, except on machines that are lost before the second payment has been made; in all such eases the two (2) dollars are to be paid back to the party of the first part.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464\">\u201cThe above in no way refers to machines sold by the Howe Machine Company going to agents outside of the territory above mentioned, and to be sold outside.

Hickox, individually, and which services, it is claimed, were adjudicated in the suit resulting in said judgment; sets out and repeats the clause beginning with the words, \u201cwhile the parties of the second part are closing out their business, \u201d and ending with the words, \u201cnor be compelled to keep any that are objectionable to the parties of the second part;\u201d that the contract was entered into and the services performed by the said William C. Hickox in the State of New York, and while he was a resident of that State; that neither William C. nor Joel M. Hickox is a resident of Illinois, and can not be served with summons; that until the commencement of the suit at law at the October term, 1878, complainant did not know of any claim asserted by William C. Hickox under said clause, but believed that the same had been adjusted and settled, and were represented by and merged in said judgment; that I. B. Hickox, at the time he took said assignment, had full notice of said judgment, and that the same was unpaid, and that said William C. and Joel M. Hickox were insolvent; that complainant plead a set-off of said judgment in said action' at law, which plea was held bad on demurrer, on account of said judgment having been rendered jointly against said William C. Hickox, and another, a stranger to said suit at law; that knowing the hopeless insolvency of said William C, and Joel M. Hickox, offers to allow said claim of $2300, provided an equal portion of the said judgment may be received and allowed as a set-off thereto; prays that William 0. and I. B. Hickox be forever enjoined from prosecuting said suit at law, and that the claim of said William C. Hickox be set off and allowed pro tanto in satisfaction of said judgment, and that thereupon the claim of said William C. and 1. B.

Hickox are not indebted to complainant in any sum whatever; admits that judgment is unpaid; admits bringing of suit at law by William C. Hickox for use of I. B. Hickox, as alleged in the bill ; admits the assignment, as alleged; denies that William C. and Joel M. Hickox were non-residents at the time of filing the amended bill; denies that I. B. Hickox, at the time of taking the said assignment, had any notice of said judgment, or that the same was unsatisfied, or that he knew of the insolvency of William C. and JoelM. Hickox; admits the plea of set-off at law, and that it was adjudged bad on demurrer ; avers that the actual consideration of said assignment was $2200 in cash, loaned by said I. B. Hickox to said William G. Hickox before the rendition of said judgment, all of which was due and unpaid prior to the time of the rendition of said judgment. To this answer there was a general replication.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\" pgmap=\"466(42) 467(91)\">Upon the hearing appellant gave in evidence the judgment roll of the Supreme Court of New York, for the city and county of New York, in a case wherein the Howe Machine Company was plaintiff, and William C. Hickox and Joel M. Hickox were defendants. It sets out, among other things, the contract of March 3, 1874, before set out in the amended bill of complaint; referee\u2019s report finding due $31,077.99, and interest from April 13, 1875, and costs, and judgment thereon. It was then admitted by appellees\u2019 attorneys, as evidence on behalf of appellant, that William C. Hickox and Joel M. Hickox, defendants in said judgment and appellees here, were, at the time of the rendition of said judgment in the Supreme Court of New York, and ever since have been, insolvent.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">On behalf of appellees, William C. Hickox, one of the appel-. lees, testified that he signed the assignment indorsed on- the back of the agreement set out in the bill, on or about the day of its date, at the office of E. A. Sherburne, Esq., attorney for I. B. Hickox, and delivered the same to said Sherburne, as such attorney; that at that time I. B. Hickox did not know of any judgment recovered against witness and Joel M. Hickox by the Howe Machine Company, in New York; that said assignment was made pursuant to an agreement before then made in regard to the matter between witness and I. B. Hickox, and that I. B. Hickox knew nothing whatever of there being any indebtedness or claims of indebtedness in favor of complainant against William C. and Joel M. Hickox, or either of them; that, said assignment was in consideration of the sum of $1100, of which $650 had been paid prior to said assignment, and the remainder has since been paid; that witness and Joel M. Hickox both resided in Chicago at the time this suit was brought, and have ever since resided there.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467\">The foregoing was all the evidence heard or offered on the hearing. The court thereupon decreed that appellant\u2019s bill be dismissed. Appeal was prosecuted from that decree to the Appellate Court for the First District. That court affirmed the decree of the circuit court, and the present appeal is from that judgment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">Mr. Jesse B. Barton, for the appellant :</attorneys><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">As the judgment in New York against William C. and Joel M. Hickox, and the claim on which this suit was brought, arose under the same contract, the one demand was properly the subject of set-off against the other. But the court held that the judgment being joint, could not be set off against the claim, which was several. Equity widens the rule of law, and on account of the insolvency of Joel M. Hickox should have considered that from the date of the judgment it was a several liability of William C. Hickox, which would create that mutuality necessary in cases of set-off.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-7\" pgmap=\"468\">Had the company sued in Cook county on the New York judgment either William C.

Sherburne, for the appellees:</attorneys><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-11\" pgmap=\"468(34) 469(30)\">We admit, as is said in Greene v. Darling, 5 Mason, 214, that when a chose in action is assigned, the assignee takes it subject to all the equities existing between the original parties as to that very chose in action so assigned, hut not that he takes it subject to all equities existing between the parties as to other debts and transactions.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469\">The right of William C. Hickox in the contract set out in the bill to be paid individually for his services, was as distinct and separate from the joint rights of William C. and Joel M. thereunder, as if they had been put upon different papers.

(1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading, 11.) And when a joint covenantee may sue alone, he must sue alone. (Ibid. 9, note y; Foley v. Addenbrook, 4 Q. B. 197.) And a bona fide assignment of this covenant cut off any right to set off this judgment against it. Howe v. Sheppard, 2 Sum. 418; Ullman v. Crane &amp; Kline, 87 Ill. 268; Hughes v. Trahern, 64 id. 48.</p> <opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b469-8\" pgmap=\"469\">Mr. Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"AaJ\" pgmap=\"469\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b469-9\" pgmap=\"469(162) 470(104)\">Since the judgments sought to be set off are not between the same parties, it is clear there could be no set-off at law, and it devolves upon appellant, therefore, to show some equitable ground for being protected against the judgment of William C. Hickox. (Raleigh et al. v. Raleigh, 35 Ill. 512.) It is not enough, here, that appellant may have shown its rights were equal to those of I. B. Hickox; unless it has shown they were superior to any equitable claim which can be urged in his favor, appellant can not succeed. (Holbrook v. Receivers, 6 Paige, 231; Hannon v. Williams, (7 Stew.) 34 N. J. Eq. 255.) The allegation of the bill that I. B. Hickox had notice of the existence of appellant\u2019s judgment when William C. Hickox assigned his interest in the contract to him, is not only unsustained by the proof, but the reverse was affirmatively proven. William C. Hickox expressly testified that I. B. Hickox had no such notice, and there was no other evidence- upon the question. The question of whether I. B. Hickox was a purchaser for value, in the sense entitling him to protection as against any equities in favor of appellant, is also put at rest by the evidence of William C. Hickox, no countervailing evidence having been given. He testified that the assignment was made pursuant to a previous agreement, whereby I. B. Hickox agreed to pay him (William C.) $1100 therefor, and-that of this amount $650 was paid before the assignment was made, and the balance was paid afterwards.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">But was I. B. Hickox put upon notice of the equities of appellant by virtue of the terms of the contract assigned' to him ? At most that could but require him to know the terms of - that contract, and the rights of the parties thereunder. It could not require him to know the terms of a different contract with other parties, and the rights of the respective parties thereunder. As was observed in Greene v. Darling, 5 Mason, 214: \u201cWhere a chose in action is assigned, it may be admitted that the assignee takes it subject to all the equities existing between the original parties as to that very chose in action so assigned. But that is very different from admitting that he takes it subject to all equities subsisting between the parties as to other debts and transactions.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470(130) 471(78)\">It is quite true that the judgment obtained by appellant in the Supreme Court of New York was under a contract evidenced by a writing on the same piece of paper as that on which the contract assigned by William C. to I. B. Hickox, and under which the judgment obtained in the Cook circuit court was written; but it is not true that both judgments are under the same contract. In construing instruments of \u2022 this character the question is, what interest was intended to be vested in the respective parties ? And hence, \u201cwhere the language of the covenant is capable of being so construed, it shall be taken to be joint or several, according to the interest of the covenantees.\u201d (Chitty on Contracts, (11th Am. ed.) 1343.) \u201cThe result of the cases, \u201d observed Lord Denman, Ch. J., in Foley v. Addenbrook, 4 Ad. &amp; El. (N. S.) 197, (45 Eng. C. L. 197,) \u201cappears to be, that where the legal interest and cause of action of the covenantees are several, they should sue separately, though the covenant be in joint terms.\u201d See note v, Chitty on Contracts, ubi supra. See, also, to like effect, 1 William\u2019s Saunders, 155; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pleading, *11, 10.</p> <p id=\"b471-4\" pgmap=\"471\">The contract under which the judgment in favor of appellant in the Supreme Court of New York was obtained, was with William C. Hickox and Joel M. Hickox, and it related entirely \u201cto the closing of the business now existing between the Howe Machine Company, * * * and W. C. Hickox and J. M. Hickox. \u201d But the contract assigned by William C. to I. B. Hickox, and under which the judgment in the Cook circuit court was obtained, had nothing to do with the \u201cclosing of the business between the Howe Machine Company and W. C. and J. M. Hickox, \u201d but related exclusively to the employment of W. C. Hickox by the Howe Machine Company to sell machines within a designated territory, and during a stipulated time. There is not the slightest pretense for contending that J. M. Hickox was in anywise responsible for the conduct of W. C. Hickox in this regard, or entitled to participate in the profits he might thereby make. Two separate and wholly distinct subject matters were agreed to,\u2014 one, the closing up of an existing business, and the other, the carrying oil .of a new business. Had the agreements been written on separate papers, and separately signed, their disconnection would have been obvious to every intelligent apprehension. And yet the fact they are written on one piece of paper can make no difference.- If, in the minds of the parties, they are separate and distinct in the one case,\u2014 and this is apparent from the language employed,\u2014they must be so in the other. The only real difficulty is in arriv,ing at the intention of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b472-5\" pgmap=\"472\">We see no cause to disturb the decree below. The case is not brought within any of the exceptions laid down in Hughes v. Trahern, Admx. 64 Ill. 48. See, also, Ullman v.
