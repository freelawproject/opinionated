Assignee with notice\u2014measure of recovery on a note given as an indemnity. A principal maker of a note gave to his surety thereon a note for $2000, secured by a second mortgage on land, to indemnify him against loss in respect to his suretyship, upon which the surety indorsed, \u201cThis note is made to secure me against any and all loss that I may sustain from having signed notes, as security, with said principal, \u201d and signed his name thereto. The surety, after judgment against him and his principal, indorsed such indemnifying note, before maturity, to a prior mortgagee, who paid to the creditor in the judgment $1600, and the surety paid the balance of the judgment against him and his principal: Held, in a suit by the assignee against the maker of the indemnifying note, that the former, having notice from the memorandum on the note that it was given only to secure the payee for all moneys he might pay for the maker, could only recover the amount paid by the assignor as surety, with the right first to retain the $1600 advanced by him on the judgment, and interest thereon, and hold the residue of the collection to make the assignor whole for the balance of the payment made by him as surety of the maker of the note.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">2. Principal and surety\u2014assignment by the latter of collateral paper held as indemnity\u2014right of action in the former. In such case the maker of the note so assigned is not damaged by the assignment when he has not paid the note, and can not be damaged thereby, for the reason that on payment of the sum advanced by the assignee, and to the assignor the money paid by him as surety in discharge of the judgment, the note given as indemnity would be satisfied, notwithstanding its assignment.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\" pgmap=\"258\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Second District; \u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Carroll county; the Hon. John V. Eustace, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\" pgmap=\"258\">This is an action of assumpsit, brought by Hammond, against Puterbaugh, in the circuit court of Carroll county, to the January term, 1881. The declaration consisted of the common counts, for goods sold and delivered; for money lent and advanced to defendant; for moneys paid, laid out and expended for defendant; for money had and received; for money due for interest; for work and labor done and materials furnished, and upon an account stated. The defendant pleaded non assumpsit, payment, and set-off. Upon these pleas issues were formed, which, upon trial by jury, were, on April 16, 1881, found for plaintiff, and his damages assessed at $1177.85. A motion for a new trial, by defendant, was overruled, and judgment was entered upon the verdict. This judgment was affirmed in the Appellate Court, on appeal, and Puterbaugh appeals to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\" pgmap=\"258(20) 259(149)\">The bill of exceptions shows that the testimony offered by plaintiff tended to prove that plaintiff held the note of defendant for the sum of $7,\u2014due March 2, 1878, $8.30; that on December 27, 1878, plaintiff paid for defendant, costs, to police magistrate, $10.20; that at the June term, 1878, of the circuit court of the county of Carroll, a judgment was entered against Puterbaugh and Hammond, for the sum of $2102.25, in favor of Bent &amp; Cottrell, upon a note given by defendants, on which Hammond was merely security for Puterbaugh. This note was given February 5, 1877, for $2000, payable in one year from date, with interest at the rate of ten per cent, and at the. same time, or soon after, Puterbaugh gave to Hammond his note for $2000, payable two years from date, and at the same rate of interest. This latter note was secured by mortgage on what was called the Wicks farm. On this note was a memorandum, signed by Hammond, saying:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\" pgmap=\"259\">\u201cThis note is made to secure me against any and all loss that I may sustain from having signed notes, as security, with said Puterbaugh.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\" pgmap=\"259\">\u201cFeb 16 \u201977 Charles Hammond. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\" pgmap=\"259(153) 260(185)\">On December 27, 1878, Hammond, and the judgment creditors, Bent &amp; Cottrell, and one Samuel W. Treat, who held a prior mortgage on the Wicks farm, at the instance of Hammond made an arrangement by which Treat paid to Bent &amp; Cottrell $1600 upon their judgment against Puterbaugh, and Hammond, in addition, paid $630.80, (by giving a promissory note to them, which was accepted as payment, and which was soon after this paid,) and thereupon Hammond assigned to Treat the note by Puterbaugh, given to Hammond as above stated. Afterwards Treat sued out an execution upon the Bent &amp; Cottrell judgment, against Puterbaugh and Hammond. They united in a bill for an injunction to stay this execution, upon the ground that the same was fully paid, and obtained a decree against Treat, making such injunction perpetual. In prosecuting this suit counsel were employed in behalf of complainants, and Hammond paid $70 for their professional services. In this action, Hammond, on the trial, claimed to recover, with interest to the time of trial, the sums paid by him on the small judgments, and the $630.80 paid on the large judgment, the moneys paid by him for attorney\u2019s fees in the chancery suit, and also some small amounts for services performed by him for Puterbaugh, in and about his business, at his request. About these services the testimony was contradictory. The chief defence set up was, that Hammond had sacrificed the $2000 note given to him by Puterbaugh, by selling the same for less than its value, viz., for $1600, to Treat, without special authority or the consent of Puterbaugh. It was claimed by the defendant, at the trial, that he should have credit for the difference between $1600 and the amount due upon the face of the $2000 note, and evidence was given on the trial tending to show that the Wicks farm was of value sufficient to secure the prior mortgage of Treat, and also this $2000 note assigned by Hammond to Treat.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260\">Mr. James Shaw, for the appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\" pgmap=\"260\">Commercial paper held as collateral security can not be sold by the holder, but must be collected, and the proceeds applied on the debt it secures.

We do not see how this position can be sustained. It is true the note was not due when it was assigned to Treat, but it is equally true that there was a memorandum on the back of the note, signed by Hammond, which gave Treat notice that the note was not given for an existing debt, but merely to secure Hammond for all moneys he might pay for Puterbaugh, as his security on notes signed with Puterbaugh, by Hammond. Under these circumstances, the only amount which could, in any event, be recovered from Puterbaugh on this $2000 note, would be the amount paid by Hammond as such security, and not refunded by Puterbaugh; and the only effect of the assignment of the note to Treat by Hammond was, to enable that amount to be recovered upon the note in the name of' Treat, and to give Treat a preference, authorizing him to apply the first moneys arising from collection on that note to repayment to him of the $1600 advanced by him, and interest thereon, and requiring him to apply the residue of such collections to making Hammond whole for payments made by him other than the $1600. Puterbaugh has paid nothing on this note, and has not been damaged by its assignment to Treat, and it is not perceived that he can hereafter be damaged. Should he pay to Treat the $1600 advanced by him when this note was assigned to him, and pay to Hammond, with interest, the other moneys paid by him in payment of these judgments, it will operate as a full satisfaction of this note held by Treat.</p> <p id=\"b263-6\" pgmap=\"263\">We find no cause to disturb the judgment of the Appellate Court, and it is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b263-7\" pgmap=\"263\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
