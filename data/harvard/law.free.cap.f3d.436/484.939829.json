As we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Singh\u2019s two motions, we deny Singh\u2019s petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Singh, a citizen of India, entered the United States without inspection on May 13, 2000. That same day, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served Singh with a Notice to Appear, charging him with being removable under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) as \u201c[a]n alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrive[d] in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Singh and his counsel appeared before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) in Dallas, Texas, for an initial hearing on August 15, 2000. At that hearing, Singh admitted the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear, admitted his removability as a matter of law, and stated his intention to seek asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ scheduled Singh\u2019s removal hearing for November 20, 2000. Singh failed to appear at the November 20th hearing, so <em>in absentia </em>the IJ ordered Singh\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On <em>January </em>21, 2001, Singh timely filed a motion with the IJ to reopen his removal proceedings and have the <em>in absentia </em>removal order rescinded. The IJ denied his motion, and Singh appealed to the Board. On November 21, 2001, the Board dismissed Singh\u2019s appeal, upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Nothing transpired in this matter for almost three years, when, on November 16 of <em>2001, </em>Singh filed a \u201cMotion to Vacate In Absentia Order and Reopen Proceedings.\u201d The Board denied this motion as untimely on February 4, 2005. It reasoned that under its regulations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201ca motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of the decision.\u201d Singh then petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">After petitioning us for review, Singh returned to the Board on March 4, 2005, with a motion for it to reconsider its denial of his motion to reopen. Singh contended that his 2004 motion to reopen was not subject to the general 90-day time limit of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Rather, according to Singh, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) governed the timeliness of his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet again, the Board rejected Singh\u2019s argument and denied his motion to reconsider. The Board reasoned that, as to the motion to reopen and rescind a removal order entered <em>in absentia </em>authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an alien may file only <em>with the IJ. </em>The Board thus construed Singh\u2019s 2004 motion to reopen <em>not </em>as a motion to reopen and rescind the <em>in absen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>tia </em>removal order entered against Singh by the IJ in 2001, but as a motion to reopen <em>the Board\u2019s dismissal of Singh\u2019s appeal </em>from the IJ\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s January 21, 2001, motion to reopen and rescind the <em>in absentia </em>removal order. Such a motion to reopen is subject to the 90-day time limit contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C)(I) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(c)(2). Accordingly, the Board denied Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider. Singh then filed a second petition for review with this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AKT\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of both a motion to reopen and a motion for reconsideration \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[S]o long as [the Board\u2019s decision] is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach,\u201d we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our review of the Board\u2019s legal conclusions is less obsequious, though: We review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>unless a conclusion embodies the Board\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a statute that it administers<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; a conclusion of the latter type is entitled to the deference prescribed by <em>Chevron U.SA Inc. v. Nat-viral Resources Defense </em>Council.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similar deference is owed to the Board\u2019s interpretations of its own regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">\n<em>B. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">\n<em>1. Motions to Reopen Distinguished From Motions to Reconsider Removal Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">The INA affords an alien who has been adjudicated to be removable with the statutory right to file two different types of motions aimed at having an adverse decision overturned: (1) a motion to <em>reopen </em>his proceedings,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) a motion to <em>reconsider </em>the removal decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Substantively, a motion to reopen a removal order must \u201cstate ... new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and [must] be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>material.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[0]ne motion to reopen\u201d is all that the INA permits<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; and, generally, that one motion must be filed \u201cwithin 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This general 90-day time limit does not apply, though, if, instead of filing a motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6), the alien files a motion to reopen under <em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12290(b)(5).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Section 1229a(b)(5) sets forth the \u201cMon-sequences [to an alien] of [his] failure to appear\u201d for his removal proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 1229a(b)(5), an alien who fails to appear for his removal proceeding (such as Singh) \u201cshall be ordered removed <em>in ab-sentia </em>if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that\u201d the alien received notice of his hearing and that he is in fact removable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In contrast with other non-m <em>absentia </em>removal orders \u2014 which may be overturned through a motion to reopen filed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6) \u2014 an <em>in absentia </em>removal order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">may be <em>rescinded </em>only\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">(i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances ..., or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">(ii) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice [of his removal hearing].<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">Such a \u00a7 1229(b)(5)(C) motion to <em>reopen </em>is what Singh purported to file with the Board in 2004. The Board, however, interpreted his filing as a \u00a7 1229(c)(6) motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Motions to reconsider removal decisions are governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(5). An alien is allotted just \u201cone motion to reconsider.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That motion must \u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order ... and be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">\n<em>2. Regulatory Implementation of the INA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">On the INA\u2019s statutory foundation, the Attorney General has constructed an administrative dichotomy that divides the review of removal orders between two fora: (1) the IJ, who can hear motions to reopen and motions to reconsider his removal orders<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>; and (2) the Board, which hears appeals from orders of IJs, as well as motions to reopen and to reconsider its own appellate decisions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The INA itself, however, does not envision the use of such a bifurcated review process: The Board is purely an administrative creation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The INA merely establishes the two types of motions to reopen (a \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order and a \u00a7 1229a(c)(6) general motion to reopen) and the motion to reconsider; because the INA does not create the Board, it does not specify <em>to which </em>adjudicator\u2014 the Board or the IJ \u2014 a \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order (which is the type of motion Singh purported to file in 2004) must be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The Board has endeavored to fill this lacuna through its implementing regulations. The Board\u2019s regulations are not a model of clarity, however, for the purpose of determining in which forum (the IJ or the Board) an alien must file a \u00a7 1229(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order. For example, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 titled \u201cReopening or reconsideration <em>before the Immigration Court\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 is the specific regulatory provision that addresses the extended time limits within which motions to reopen <em>in ab-sentia </em>removal orders may be filed. In parallel, a subsection of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 \u2014 titled \u201cReopening or reconsideration <em>before the Board of Immigration Appeals\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 also addresses the extended time limits associated with motions to reopen <em>in absentia </em>removal orders.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Ultimately, it is this duplication that gives rise to the confusion in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Board cut this Gordian knot by ruling as a matter of law that under the INA and the Board\u2019s implementing regulations, motions to reopen <em>in absentia </em>removal orders must be presented to the IJ, not to the Board.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It thus concluded that Singh\u2019s 2004 motion to reopen, which he filed with the Board, was a \u00a7 1229(c)(6) motion to reopen the Board\u2019s 2001 denial of Singh\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his 2001 \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen the <em>in absentia </em>removal order, <em>not </em>a new \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen the <em>in absentia </em>removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">As this is an interpretation of both the INA and the Board\u2019s own regulations, we must accord deference to the Board\u2019s legal conclusion. And, as we cannot find the Board\u2019s conclusion to be unreasonable, we deny Singh\u2019s petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">\n<em>S. The Board Reasonably Interpreted the INA and Its Implementing Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">The Board reasonably concluded that under the INA and its implementing regulations, a \u00a7 1229(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order may be filed only with the IJ. First, the INA makes clear that an <em>in absentia </em>removal \u201corder may be rescinded <em>only\u201d </em>by filing a motion to reopen the removal proceedings.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cThe obvious negative implication\u201d of this language is that <em>in absentia </em>removal orders may <em>not </em>be appealed to the Board.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To challenge an <em>in absentia </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>moval order, then, the alien must do what Singh originally did in this case, <em>viz., </em>file a \u00a7 1229(b)(5)(C) motion to reopen the <em>in absentia </em>order with the IJ.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> But by filing the <em>in absentia </em>motion with the IJ, the alien has exhausted the <em>one </em>class of motions to reopen that the INA permits.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> For such an alien, therefore, there are no more reopen motions available for filing; thus an attempted filing of a second motion to reopen violates the INA. Assuming that it was permissible for the Attorney General to divide the removal order review process between two extra-statutory entities,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it is surely reasonable for the Board to conclude that a motion to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order may only be filed with the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Second, as the Respondent points out in his brief, the rationale undergirding the giving of a more generous period of time in which an alien may move to reopen an <em>in absentia </em>removal order provides no support for giving the alien an extended period of time in which to file such a motion <em>with the Board. </em>It makes sense to give an alien who was not notified of his removal hearing or who was prevented from attending his hearing by exceptional circumstances more time to seek the reopening of his removal order. Under the Board\u2019s own regulations, however, it can only hear motions to reopen in \u201ccase[s] <em>in which it has rendered a decision.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This means that by the time the alien\u2019s <em>in absentia </em>removal order reaches the Board, that alien has already (1) moved for reopening with the IJ, and (2) appealed the IJ\u2019s denial to the Board. After all, only in such circumstances would the Board <em>already have rendered a decision in the alien\u2019s case. </em>At such a late stage in the proceedings, the forgiving rationale behind the extended time periods for motions to reopen <em>in absentia </em>removal orders is just not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">These two justifications more than adequately demonstrate the reasonableness of the Board\u2019s interpretation of the INA and its implementing regulations. We therefore deny Singh\u2019s two petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">For the foregoing reasons, Singh\u2019s petitions for review are</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>.
