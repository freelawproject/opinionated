TRW, Inc., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 727 A.2d 1055 (App.Div.1999) <em>(Roach I). </em>The Supreme Court granted plaintiffs petition for certification, 162 <em>N.J. </em>195, 743 A.2d 847 (1999), and \u201csummarily remanded to the Appellate Division for reconsideration of the appeal in light of <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hospital, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 730 A.2d 327 (1999).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have reconsidered our decision in light of <em>Higgins </em>and reaffirm our judgment in <em>Roach I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\"><em>Roach I </em>contains a detailed explanation of the evidence. Plaintiff contended that he was discharged because he had disclosed to company superiors certain alleged activities of two co-employees, Jim Vrungos and Vern DeBord. We described these activities in <em>Roach I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Roach\u2019s disclosures were threefold: (1) DeBord\u2019s alleged cheating on his expense account regarding a $15.00 lunch; (2) DeBord\u2019s approval of a $4,000 lease of computer equipment from a firm in which he or his son allegedly had an interest; and (3) the alleged [personal] interest of Vrungos and DeBord in TRW\u2019s acquisition of Nations, an acquisition which never occurred. None of these activities attributed to DeBord or Vrungos constitutes an activity of TRW. These activities were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>not remotely on TRW\u2019s behalf and did not advance TRW\u2019s interests. To the <em>contrary, if </em>Roach's allegations <em>were true, </em>TRW was the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\"><em>[Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570, 727 A.2d 1055.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">We held that \u201cthe Legislature in enacting CEPA did not intend that the disclosure of employee activities victimizing the employer would fall within CEPA.\u201d 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570, 727 A.2d 1055. We concluded that \u201can employee\u2019s activities in conflict <em>solely </em>with the employer\u2019s interests cannot constitute an activity, policy or practice of the employer within the meaning of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3a].\u201d 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 571, 727 A.2d 1055 (emphasis added). We so ruled in part because section 3a prohibits retaliation for disclosures of \u201can activity policy or practice of the <em>employer ... </em>[which] is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation ...,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3a, and also because the alleged activities of Vrungos and DeBord threatened no public interest and, if true, victimized only the employer. We recognized that \u201cemployers, of course, act through their employees. But not every employee action connected with the employment is chargeable to the employer under CEPA.\u201d <em>Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570, 727 A.2d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Approximately one month after we filed <em>Roach I, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Higgins, </em>reversing an Appellate Division decision reported at 307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 704 A.2d 988 (App.Div.1998). It involved a claim that plaintiffs employer had retaliated against plaintiff because she had made disclosures to her superior regarding two of her co-employees. Higgins was employed by Pascack Valley Hospital as a nurse assigned to the Mobile Intensive Care Unit. She informed her supervisor that two paramedics had violated state regulations by filing the wrong form regarding a call for assistance. Additionally, Higgins charged one of the paramedics with the theft of medication from another patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The issue in <em>Higgins </em>was \u201cwhether the CEPA imposes liability on an employer for retaliating against a complaining employee when the employer was not complicit in the conduct of co-employees about which the employee complained.\u201d <em>Higgins, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 409, 730 A.2d 327. The Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>An employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">a. Discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy or practice of the employer or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, or, in the case of an employee who is a licensed or certified health care professional, reasonably believes constitutes improper quality of patient care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">b. Provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law by the employer or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, or, in the case of an employee who is a licensed or certified health care professional, provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into the quality of patient care; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">c. Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law or, if the employee is a licensed or certified health care professional, constitutes improper quality of patient care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">(2) is fraudulent or criminal; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">(3) is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:19-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The Court in <em>Higgins </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">A plain reading of the statute suggests that the CEPA covers employees who object to the conduct of co-workers. The term \u201cany\u201d in subsection \u201cc\u201d indicates that the statute applies regardless of the source of the activiiy, policy or practice. Although subsections \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d limit the statute\u2019s application to policies, practices and activities \u201cof\u2019 or \u201cby\u201d \u201cthe employer,\u201d subsection \u201cc\u201d contains no such limitation. The omission of the phrase \u201cof the employer\u201d in subsection \u201cc\u201d is too obvious to ignore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\"><em>[Higgins, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 419, 730 A.2d 327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">It is important to understand that <em>Higgins\u2019 </em>holding involved only subsection \u201cc,\u201d and the Supreme Court addressed the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>that subsection in light of the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cany activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Roach I, </em>we explained that the \u201cjury determined that TRW had violated CEPA by terminating Roach\u2019s employment because Roach had disclosed and objected to \u2018illegal unethical activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 560, 727 A.2d 1055. Thus, according to the jury, TRW violated subsection 3a and subsection 3c(1). We questioned, however, whether 3c \u201capplies because there were no ongoing activities to object to. Plaintiffs disclosures about Vrungos and DeBord were historical.\u201d <em>Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 573, 727 A.2d 1055. Arguably, therefore, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Higgins </em>is not applicable to TRW\u2019s alleged violation of subsection 3a. Nevertheless, due to expansive language in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Higgins, </em>we assume, for the purpose of this analysis, that the Court\u2019s holding applies to a subsection 3a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We conclude that <em>Higgins </em>does not control the present case because of the absence of a public interest in the alleged activities of Vrungos and DeBord. In <em>Roach I, </em>we noted that \u201cCEPA\u2019s objective is the protection of the public interest by encouraging the disclosure of <em>employer </em>activities potentially harmful to that interest,\u201d <em>Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 571, 727 A.2d 1055, and we held that Roach\u2019s disclosure did not further or protect the public interest because the activities he disclosed did not involve the public interest. We distinguished the Appellate Division\u2019s opinion in <em>Higgins </em>because it \u201cinvolved allegations that plaintiffs co-employee[s] had falsified hospital records and had stolen a patient\u2019s drugs. Thus, the public was victimized. In the present case, TRW, the employer, was the only victim.\u201d <em>Roach I, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 572, 727 A.2d 1055. Indeed, the jury made a specific finding under subsection 3c(3) that \u201cthe activities Roach had disclosed were not \u2018incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 727 A.2d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In <em>Higgins, </em>the Court reaffirmed CEPA\u2019s public interest rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The purpose of the CEPA is to \u201cprotect employees who report illegal or unethical work-place activities.\u201d <em>Barratt v. Cushman &amp; Wakefield, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>120, 127, 675 A.2d 1094 (1996). Generally speaking, the CEPA codified the common-law cause of action, first recognized in <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 72, 417 A.2d 505 (1980), which protects at-will employees who have been discharged in violation of a clear mandate of public policy. Thus, the CEPA establishes a statutory exception to the general rule that an employer may terminate an at-will employee with or without cause. <em>See id. </em>at 65, 417 A.2d 505.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">[158 <em>N.J. </em>at 417-18, 730 A.2d 327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The Court repeated the public interest theme acknowledging \u201cthe statute\u2019s purpose, which was to enact \u2018broad protections against employer retaliation\u2019 for employees who act in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 730 A.2d 327 (quoting <em>Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>163, 179, 707 A.2d 1000 (1998)). With regard to the healthcare context of <em>Higgins, </em>the Court observed that \u201c[m]isconduet of employees, like that of employers, can threaten the public health, safety, and welfare____ For example, a paramedic\u2019s theft of patient medication, whether or not condoned by the hospital, could undermine public health.\u201d <em>Higgins, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 730 A.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Moreover, the cases relied on by the Supreme Court in <em>Higgins </em>involved facts imbued with a public interest. For example, <em>Dudewicz v. Norris-Schmid, Inc., </em>443 <em>Mich. </em>68, 503 <em>N.W.</em>2d 645 (1993), involved retaliatory action against an employee because he filed a criminal complaint against a co-employee. <em>Higgins, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 421-22, 730 A.2d 327. There is an obvious public interest in unfettered access to criminal and civil process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">In the present case, Vrungos and DeBord\u2019s alleged activities did not implicate the public interest. Applying the Act to these facts would increase its scope exponentially and well beyond the Legislature\u2019s objective in enacting CEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Thus, we reaffirm our decision in <em>Roach </em>I.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\"> In a prior order, the Supreme Court denied plaintiff's motion for summary reversal of <em>Roach I.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\"> CEPA was adopted in 1986, L.1986, c. 105. It was amended in 1989, L.1989, c. 220, and in 1997, L.1997, <em>c. </em>98. We reproduced the statute in <em>Roach I </em>and in this opinion with the two amendments, though they are not germane to the issue before us. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Higgins </em>reproduces only the original Act, undoubtedly because the 1989 amendment is not germane and the 1997 amendment post-dated the events giving rise to the cause of action. The 1997 amendments added specific protection for health care professionals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\"> In <em>Roach I, </em>we did not reach the sufficiency of proof to establish that TRW terminated Roach in retaliation for his disclosures. 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 573, 727 A.2d 1055. We do not address the issue here because it was not part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in remanding for our reconsideration in light of <em>Higgins.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
