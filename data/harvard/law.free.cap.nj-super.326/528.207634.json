They were performing \u201cconsensual encounters.\u201d These \u201cconsensual encounters\u201d are conducted because of alleged excessive transportation of illegal contraband, including weapons and drugs, on the trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The officers first observed defendants Contreras and Diaz and their companion, L.S., in New York Penn Station. Defendants seemed to be \u201cpaying special attention\u201d to some uniformed Amtrak officers who were patrolling the station.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> L.S. appeared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201cagitated at the fact that the police officers had walked by. He kept looking at them.\u201d Officer Williams claimed that none of the other travelers on the platform \u201cseemed to have this kind of [re]action\u201d to the uniformed officers. Defendants \u201cbegan to talk, whisper, kind of back and forth and turning around and looking at the cops.\u201d The New Jersey Transit officers did not overhear any conversation between defendants, nor did they observe any suspicious activity, such as objects being exchanged between them or discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">There is some discrepancy as to when the decision to attempt a search was made. Officer Williams testified that once he and the other officers were on the train, they intended to stop defendants and seek permission to search them. However, Williams later testified that they did not approach defendants with an intent to search them. He continued, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t approach people with an intent to search them. You know, once we ask questions and we speak with them, ... it maybe [sic] determined that maybe we\u2019ll ask for their consent for a search. But we don\u2019t automatically approach them with the intent on searching them.\u201d The motion judge engaged in a colloquy with the witness regarding this matter. Williams attempted to clarify his testimony by stating that, based on the defendants\u2019 behavior when the Amtrak police were near, he and the other officers were \u201cinterested in speaking with [the defendants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The same issue arose during Sergeant Hestor\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel asked her if she and the other officers had decided before leaving New York Penn Station that they would search defendants in Newark. Hestor replied, \u201cwe made the decision that, yeah, we were going to talk to them and request a consent to search if they agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">When defendants\u2019 train arrived, the undercover officers followed them onto the train. The defendants sat together. The officers sat in the same ear but apart from one another as they observed defendants. Officer Williams believed that L.S. \u201cseemed to be particularly relieved that they were on the train ... because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>was doing things like looking up at the ceiling.\u201d The officers observed the three engage in conversation, but defendants did not do anything \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d during the short train ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">As the train neared Newark, Officer West approached defendants, who were still seated, and identified himself by showing his badge and identification. He also pointed to his fellow officers. West spoke in a low tone of voice so as not to draw attention to the three individuals. West asked the three if they would \u201cmind stepping off the train with [the officers] to speak to [them] for a few moments[,] although they were under no obligation to [do so].\u201d Defendants agreed and accompanied the officers off the train. None of the officers could remember with certainty their exact positioning in relation to the defendants as they exited the train. No weapons were drawn and none of the defendants were handcuffed. Defendants allegedly were free to leave at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">According to defendant Diaz, the officers approached them after the train had come to a complete stop and asked them if they would \u201cplease get off the train.\u201d Diaz claimed that West did not advise them of their right to refuse to get off the train; he did not feel as though he had a choice regarding whether to comply with the request. Diaz felt compelled to exit with the police. Defendants had not intended to get off in Newark because the train would take them directly to Red Bank, their final destination. The officers did not learn of defendants\u2019 destination until the group had exited the train. Once off the train, the officers separated the individuals. West \u201cdealt with\u201d Contreras, Hestor spoke to Diaz, and Williams spoke with L.S. West informed Contreras of the problems with passengers using the trains to transport drugs and weapons. He then asked Contreras \u201cif he would have anything of that type on his person.\u201d Defendant stated that he did not. West asked him if he would consent to a search, to which defendant responded \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have anything on him[,] so he had no problem with [West] taking a look.\u201d West then offered to conduct the search in the police complex, which is located one level down from the platforms, allegedly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>spare defendant the embarrassment of being searched on the crowded platform. Contreras agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Sergeant Hestor testified that she spoke to Diaz. Hestor also informed Diaz of the problems with drugs and contraband being transported on the trains between New York and New Jersey. She asked him if he had anything illegal in his possession, to which he responded that he did not. Hestor then explained what a consent-to-search form is and \u201casked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind signing it____\u201d She told him that he was under no obligation to do so and that, if he agreed to the search, he could stop the search at any time. Diaz agreed to sign the form. He also agreed to go to the police complex to be searched rather than being searched on the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">According to Diaz, it was Officer Williams who primarily spoke with him, not Sergeant Hestor. Diaz stated that none of the officers told him that he was free to leave at any time while they were on the platform. Diaz also claimed that no one informed him that he was free to refuse to be searched. Rather, the officers explained the search procedure and then asked defendants to go down to the police complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Diaz claimed that Officer Williams \u201cescorted\u201d him downstairs by holding onto his sleeve. As soon as they reached the police complex, defendants were patted down. Diaz stated that he did not feel free to leave at any time and he would have left if he had been told he could do so. He also claimed that he was not shown a consent form until after the pat-down.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Upon arrival at the police complex, Contreras and Diaz were taken to the processing room and L.S. was put in another room. They were separated because adults and juveniles are not permitted to be in the same area in the processing room.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">According to the officers, Contreras and Diaz signed consent forms in the processing room before they were searched. Diaz testified, however, that Officer Williams took him to a separate room and questioned him for ten to fifteen minutes. At some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>point, Officer Williams left him for a time. When he returned, he said to Diaz, \u201cwe are having a problem with your boy, he doesn\u2019t want to be searched, he doesn\u2019t want to sign the consent.\u201d Diaz did not know whether Williams was referring to Contreras or L.S. Shortly thereafter, Diaz was told that the officers had found \u201csome substance.\u201d He was then strip-searched and arrested based on the evidence found on Contreras. Later, when he was in a cell, \u201cthey\u201d came to him with a form and told him to sign for his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">When Officer West testified, it was revealed that his police report indicated the consent forms were read to defendants and signed by them on the platform.' However, the testimony at the suppression hearing reflected that the consent forms were in fact produced at the police complex. West indicated that the defendants were told that their persons, property, and baggage would be searched. They also were reminded that they were under no obligation to sign the form, and that they could stop the search at any time or limit it to certain areas. Contreras reviewed the form and signed it in the presence of all three officers without asking any questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The officers testified that defendants were told that they would be permitted to leave when the consensual search was completed. They were told that the officers would put them back on the train to Red Bank \u201cif everything was fine.\u201d West conducted a pat-down of Contreras\u2019 outer- garments and pockets, and a search of his jacket after it was removed. Two clear plastic bags containing crack cocaine were found in the collar of Contreras\u2019 jacket. No contraband was found on Diaz. \u25a0 After the crack cocaine was found, all three defendants were placed under arrest. Although an initial search of L.S. incident to his arrest revealed nothing, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>later search conducted at the youth facility revealed under fifty grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The motion judge found that a stop occurred when the officers made themselves known to defendants and subsequently accompanied them onto the platform and down to the police complex. The judge granted the motion to suppress, finding that the officers did not have a reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct the stop.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Not all encounters between police officers and citizens constitute seizures. <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 497, 517 A.2d 859 (1986). In <em>Davis, </em>our Supreme Court reiterated the principle that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">[t]he police do not violate the fourth amendment by \u201cmerely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, [or] by putting questions to Mm if the person is willing to listen....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\"><em>(Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>491, 497, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1319, 1324, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>229, 236 (1983)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The Court further noted that field interrogation alone \u201cdoes not involve \u2018detention\u2019 in the constitutional sense so long as the officer does not deny the individual the right to move.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at 497, 517 A.2d 859 (quoting <em>State v. Sheffield, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>441, 447, 303 A.2d 68 (1973)). Additionally, reasonable suspicion is not a prerequisite to seeking consent to search. <em>State v. Allen, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 66, 603 A.2d 71 (App.Div.1992) (citing 3 <em>LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>\u00a7 8.1 n. 5.1) (Supp.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">We may conclude that the transit police officers were entitled to approach defendants and request consent to search, <em>see Allen, supra, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 66, 603 A.2d 71; however, we must question whether the encounter with defendants constituted a seizure which required a particularized suspicion before the search was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Brief investigative seizures do not require the traditional probable cause generally associated with formal arrests. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 905-06 (1968); <em>Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 517 A.2d 859. They do, however, require \u201ca \u2018particularized suspicion\u2019 based upon an objective observation that the person stopped has been or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 517 A.2d 859. Nonetheless, street interrogations or field inquiries may be conducted by police without grounds for suspicion. <em>State ex rel. J.G., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 27, 28, 726 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1999) (citing <em>State v. Alexander, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 576, 468 A.2d 713 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>267, 475 A.2d 570 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Seizure is defined in New Jersey as a situation in which, in the totality of the circumstances, \u201c \u2018a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 164, 642 A.2d 401 (1994) (citing <em>Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 517 A.2d 859.) Our Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>characterized the difference between a field inquiry and a <em>Terry-type </em>stop, citing Professor LaFave\u2019s treatise on search and seizure, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201c[T]he critical inquiry would be whether the policeman, although perhaps making inquiries which a private citizen would not be expected to make, has otherwise conducted himself in a manner consistent with what would be viewed as a nonoffensive contact if it occurred between two ordinary citizens.\u201d ... Thus, an officer would not be deemed to have seized another if his questions were put in a conversational manner, if he did not make demands or issue orders, and if his questions were not overbearing or harassing in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\"><em>[Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 497 n. 6, 517 A.2d 859 (quoting <em>LaFave, </em>supra).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">An encounter that begins as consensual \u201ccan be transformed into a seizure ... if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 517 A.2d 859 (citation omitted). Thus, we concluded in <em>J.G. </em>that an encounter that initially began as a field inquiry was transformed into a seizure based on the officer\u2019s statements to the defendant. 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31-32, 726 A.2d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The facts in <em>J.G. </em>are strikingly similar to those presented in this case. In <em>J.G., </em>we concluded that the police officer \u201clacked the requisite reasonable suspicion necessary to stop and interrogate J.G.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 726 A.2d 948. Additionally, we affirmed the trial judge\u2019s declination to address the issues of consent and the search incident to arrest because the trial judge correctly concluded that there was no preliminary reasonable suspicion to detain J.G. <em>Ibid. </em>We further concluded that although the encounter began as a field inquiry, it was elevated to a <em>Terry </em>stop when the officer asked J.G. if there was \u201canything on him that he shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 726 A.2d 948. The effect of these words was to make the defendant \u201caware that he was the subject of a particularized investigation by the questions presupposing the suspicion of criminal conduct. Accordingly, at this point, the field inquiry was automatically converted to a <em>Terry </em>stop which would require a reasonable and articulable suspicion before the search was conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31-32, 726 A.2d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">Although a request for consent to search does not necessarily convert a consensual encounter into a seizure as long as the police \u201cdo not convey a message that compliance with their request is required,\u201d ... we find that by focusing in on J.G.\u2019s backpack, Officer Kelly implied that J.G. was or might be involved in criminal conduct and such focus supports the notion that the juvenile was under investigation and not free to leave. Therefore, we conclude that the encounter with J.G. was not limited to a field inquiry but was expanded into a <em>Terry </em>stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 32, 726 A.2d 948 (quoting <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>429, 435, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2382, 2386, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>389, 398-99 (1991)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Here, although the encounter may have begun as a consensual one, it clearly appears based on the totality of the circumstances that it was elevated to a detention at some point before the defendants were searched. It is not difficult to conceive that defendants possessed an objectively reasonable belief that they were not free to leave or that compliance with the officers\u2019 request was required, despite allegedly having been told numerous times that they were free to leave at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The officers asked the defendants to get off the train in Newark without any question about or regard for defendants\u2019 final destina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tion. The officers proceeded to explain that there are \u201cproblems\u201d with drugs, weapons, and other contraband being transported on the trains between New York and New Jersey. They then asked defendants if they were carrying any such contraband, a question that clearly conveyed to defendants the message that the officers suspected them of criminal activity. They were asked to go to the police complex to be searched, allegedly to save them the embarrassment of being searched on the platform. Finally, they were told that the officers would put them back on the train to Red Bank after the search was completed, assuming that nothing was found during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Although the officers spoke to defendants in a conversational tone and they did not draw their weapons or use handcuffs, <em>see Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 497 n. 6, 517 A.2d 859, their questions became \u201coverbearing or harassing in nature\u201d when they asked defendants whether they had any contraband on them. <em>See J.G., supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31-32, 726 A.2d 948. Thus, the encounter was converted to a seizure requiring a reasonable articulable suspicion before a search was conducted, regardless of any consent given by defendants. <em>See id. </em>at 34, 726 A.2d 948; <em>see also State v. L.F., </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 181, 719 A.2d 1272 (App.Div. 1998) (holding that where police lacked an articulable suspicion to stop defendants, permission given by defendant to search him was inconsequential).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">An objectively reasonable person would not have felt free to leave under such circumstances. The officers\u2019 testimony stressed how many choices defendants were given; for example, defendants allegedly were given the option of whether to remain on the train when it stopped or to get off with the officers, whether to speak to the officers or not, whether to be searched or not, and whether to go to the police complex or be searched on the platform. However, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, none of these choices was truly meaningful. While the State may label the encounter as having been \u201cconsensual,\u201d it effectively was a detention. Even if the officers told defendants that they were free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>leave at any time, their other words and actions communicated to defendants that they were not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The judge essentially reached the same conclusion after hearing the testimony and assessing the credibility of the witnesses. This determination should be given due deference based on the judge\u2019s opportunity to observe \u201cthe character and demean- or of [the] witnesses.\u201d <em>See State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (declaring that appellate courts should defer to trial courts\u2019 credibility findings, which generally are influenced by such matters as \u201cobservations of the character and demeanor of witnesses and common human experience that are not transmitted by the record.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Moreover, once the encounter between the officers and defendants was converted to a seizure, the officers needed at least a reasonable articulable suspicion of some criminal activity to validate the seizure. A search and seizure based on \u201cluck and hunch\u201d is a \u201ccombination of insufficient constitutional ingredients.\u201d <em>State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980); <em>J.G., supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 726 A.2d 948. An investigative detention is justifiable \u201conly if the officer has a \u2018particularized suspicion\u2019 based upon an objective observation that the person stopped has been or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 504, 517 A.2d 859. The <em>Davis </em>Court continued, \u201c[a] seizure cannot-we emphasize cannot-be justified merely by a police officer\u2019s subjective hunch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 517 A.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Here, the officers observed nothing more than defendants \u201cpaying special attention\u201d to one or two uniformed officers in Penn Station. This alone was not sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion. Some circumstances in which courts have found a sufficiently articulable basis to conduct a brief stop include: observation of traffic violations; narcotics, packages, money, or other objects being exchanged; reports of recent nearby crimes; and informant\u2019s tips that a crime or drug transaction was about to occur. <em>State v. Kuhn, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 280, 517 A.2d 162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>(App.Div.1986) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Patterson, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 561, 637 A.2d 593 (Law Div.1993), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 637 A.2d 599 (App.Div.1994) (finding that defendants\u2019 appearance alone, without some conduct evidencing criminal activity, was insufficient to justify a stop). Even running from a police presence cannot alone produce the reasonable articulable suspicion required to validate an investigative detention. <em>State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 169, 642 A.2d 401 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The State contends that the trial court abused its discretion because \u201cit rendered its decision not on the facts in issue but due to the [c]ourt\u2019s personal objection as to the New Jersey Transit policy of conducting consent searches. In faet[,] the record reveals that the court was not even addressing the issue at bar but the New Jersey Transit policy in general.\u201d We have carefully reviewed that contention in light of the entire record, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable law and conclude that the contention is clearly without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Although the judge did express disdain for the New Jersey Transit Police policy of conducting consent searches, the judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law make clear that his final decision was based on the facts of the case as presented through the testimony of the parties involved. Additionally, although the judge did not specifically enunciate his credibility findings, he was not required to do so. <em>See State v. Locurto, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 472-73, 724 A.2d 234.
