Plaintiffs-respondents, Debra and Thomas McKeown, sought to take the depositions of three individuals living in France who either had or have high-ranking employment with LS. LS moved for an order requiring use of the Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (Convention), 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1781. We granted LS leave to appeal from a trial court ruling that declined to apply the Convention. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Thirty nations have acceded to the Convention, including the United States and France. One of its stated purposes is \u201cto improve mutual judicial co-operation in civil or commercial matters.\u201d The Convention\u2019s core mechanism is the \u201cLetter of Request.\u201d Article 1 provides that \u201ca judicial authority of a Contracting State may, in accordance with the provisions of the law of that State, request the competent authority of another Contracting State, by means of a Letter of Request, to obtain evidence, or to perform some other judicial act.\u201d A Letter may be used only to obtain evidence \u201cfor use in judicial proceedings commenced or contemplated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Article 2 of the Convention requires each Contracting State to designate a Central Authority \u201cto receive Letters of Request ... and to transmit them to the authority competent to execute them.\u201d Article 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Article 3 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">A Letter of Request shall specify -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">(a) the authority requesting its execution and the authority requested to execute it, if known to the requesting authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(b) the names and addresses of the parties to the proceedings and their representatives, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">(c) the nature of the proceedings for which the evidence is required, giving all necessary information in regard thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">(f) the questions to be put to the persons to be examined or a statement of the subject-matter about which they are to be examined;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">(g) the documents or other property, real or personal, to be inspected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(h) any requirements that the evidence is to be given on oath or affirmation, and any special form to be used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(i) any special method or procedure to be followed under Article 9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">A Letter may also mention any information necessary for the application of Article 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">No legalization or other like formality may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Under Article 9, the authority executing a Letter of Request \u201cshall apply its own law as to the methods and procedures to be followed,\u201d unless the requesting authority requests that \u201ca special method or procedure be followed, unless this is incompatible with the internal law of the State of execution----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">A Contracting State may refuse a Letter of Request if \u201cits sovereignty or security would be prejudiced\u201d by its execution. Article 12. \u201cExecution may not be refused solely on the ground that under its internal law the State of execution claims exclusive jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action or that its internal law would not admit a right of action on it.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">The Convention is particularly pertinent in this case because of a French \u201cblocking statute.\u201d French Penal Law No. 80-538 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">Subject to international treaties or agreements and laws and regulations in force, it is forbidden for any person to request, seek or communicate, in writing, orally or in any other form, documents or information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature leading to the constitution of evidence with a view to foreign judicial or administrative procedures or in the context of such procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">Without prejudice to such heavier penalties as are provided by law, any violation of the provisions of [this] law shall be punished by imprisonment of from two to six months and/or a fine of from 10,000 to 120,000 francs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">LS contends that use of the Convention would preclude application of the \u201cblocking statute\u201d because LS would be providing discovery pursuant to an international treaty or agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">The United States Supreme Court considered the Convention, and the blocking statute, in <em>Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States District Court, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>522, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2542, 96 L.Ed.2d 461 (1987) (Aerospatiale). Justice Stevens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>writing for the majority of five Justices, analyzed the relationship between the federal discovery rules and the Convention. The majority rejected the arguments that the Convention was the exclusive mechanism to collect evidence abroad for use in an American court, or that litigants must first resort to the Convention before pursuing other discovery alternatives. 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 533-34, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2550-2551, 96 L.Ed 2d at 477-78. The majority held that the Convention\u2019s mechanisms are optional. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on the absence of language mandating the Convention\u2019s use. 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 534, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2551, 96 L.Ed.2d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The majority also rejected the argument that the Convention did not apply to discovery from parties subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, but applied only to the gathering of evidence from nonparty witnesses abroad over whom the court lacked jurisdiction. 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 540-41, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2554, 96 L.Ed.2d at 482. In this regard, the majority found the Court of Appeals to have erred. 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 540, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2554, 96 L.Ed.2d at 482. Justice Stevens stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Thus, it appears clear to us that the optional Convention procedures are available whenever they will facilitate the gathering of evidence by the means authorized in the Convention. Although these procedures are not mandatory, the Hague Convention does \u201capply\u201d to the production of evidence in a litigant\u2019s possession in the sense that it is one method of seeking evidence that a court may elect to employ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">[482 <em>U.S. </em>at 541, 107 S.Cf. at 2554, 96 L.Ed.2d at 482.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Justice Blackmun, writing for the four dissenting justices, criticized the majority\u2019s \u201ccase-by-case inquiry for determining whether to use Convention procedures and its failure to provide lower courts with any meaningful guidance for carrying out that inquiry.\u201d 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 549, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2558, 96 L.Ed.2d at 487. The dissent \u201cwould apply a general presumption that, in most cases, courts should resort first to the Convention.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">We are, of course, bound by the majority\u2019s construction of the Convention in <em>Aerospatiale. </em>Thus, we deem it to be an optional method of evidence gathering. In the present case, however, the choice is between the Convention and New Jersey procedural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>substantive law. Consequently, we perceive no conflict with federal supremacy, if, in exercising the option to resort to the Convention, we are more generous in our use of the Convention\u2019s procedures than the United States\u2019 courts. Moreover, because the present litigation is in a state court, we are not concerned with issues regarding the distribution of power among the three branches of the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We have addressed use of the Convention in two cases: <em>Vincent v. Ateliers de la Motobecane, S.A., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>716, 475 A.2d 686 (App.Div.1984), decided before <em>Aerospatiale, </em>and <em>Moake v. Source Intern. Corp., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 623 A.2d 263 (App.Div. 1993), decided after <em>Aerospatiale. </em>In <em>Vincent, </em>we reversed a trial court order requiring a French defendant to provide discovery in the United States pursuant to New Jersey\u2019s discovery rules. We held that an initial attempt should be made to gather the evidence utilizing the Convention. We noted, however, that if use of the Convention is ineffective in providing reasonable and necessary discovery, then \u201cthe trial court will be free to consider the matter further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723, 475 A.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>Moake, </em>this court affirmed a trial court\u2019s order rejecting a German corporation\u2019s demand that discovery from it proceed under the Convention. In affirming, we relied on <em>Aerospatiale </em>and emphasized \u201cthat the United States has a strong interest generally in assuring that product liability actions are given full attention to protect American consumers.\u201d <em>Moake, supra, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 460, 623 A.2d 263. Finally, it was observed that \u201cthere is no proof\u2019 that the discovery request \u201cwould violate the sovereignty of Germany or that the Hague Convention procedures would be a more effective means of obtaining the information sought than our court rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 623 A.2d 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We observe that the three factors mentioned in <em>Moake </em>as justifying disregard of the Convention probably are present in every case and effectively would abrogate the Convention in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In a Law Division opinion encouraging use of the Convention, Judge Alley noted that after <em>Aerospatiale </em>was decided, and inferentially as a response to <em>Aerospatiale, </em>the United States participated in \u201ca Special Commission of the Hague Conference\u201d in 1989. The Special Commission \u201cencouraged the giving of \u2018priority\u2019 to the procedures of the Convention when evidence located abroad is being sought; as well as the relaxation of existing limitations which numerous countries have placed on the production of documents.\u201d <em>Knight v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 115-16, 615 A.2d 297 (Law <em>Div.1992)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>In what appears to be an understatement, Judge Alley observed that \u201capplication of the result in <em>Aerospatiale, </em>and judicial enthusiasm for the Convention have not been uniform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 615 A.2d 297 (footnote omitted). <em>Compare First Am. Corp. v. Price Waterhouse LLP, </em>154 F.3d 16 (2nd Cir.1998); <em>Belmont Textile Mach. Co. v. Superba, S.A, </em>48 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>521 (W.D.N.C.1999); <em>In re Aircrash Disaster, </em>172 <em>F.R.D. </em>295 (N.D.Ill.1997); <em>Haynes v. Kleinwefers, </em>119 <em>F.R.D. </em>335 (E.D.N.Y.1988); <em>Benton Graphics v. Uddeholm Corp., </em>118 <em>F.R.D. </em>386 (D.N.J.1987), declining to use the Convention, <em>with In re Perrier Bottled Water Litigation, </em>138 <em>F.R.D. </em>348 (D.Conn.1991); <em>Hudson v. Hermann Pfauter GmbH &amp; Co. </em>117 <em>F.R.D. </em>33 (N.D.N.Y.1987), which applied the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We are persuaded that the Convention should be utilized unless it is demonstrated that its use will substantially impair the search for truth, which is at the heart of all litigation, or will cause unduly prejudicial delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Aerospatiale </em>noted that the United States took \u201cthe initiative in proposing that an evidence convention be adopted.\u201d 482 <em>U.S. </em>at 530, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2548, 96 L.Ed.2d at 475. The Convention was supported by the American Bar Association, the Judicial Conference of the United States and the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws. 482 <em>U.S. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>531, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2549, 96 L.Ed.2d at 476. The Court acknowledged that the United States Secretary of State recommended the Convention to the President because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">The substantial increase in litigation with foreign aspects arising, in part, from the unparalleled expansion of international trade and travel in reeent decades had intensified the need for an effective international agreement to set up a model system to bridge differences between the common law and civil law approaches to the taking of evidence abroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting the Secretary of State\u2019s letter submitted to the President).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Since the Senate ratified the Convention in 1972, international trade and transactions have increased substantially, and litigation in New Jersey involving foreign parties is common. New Jersey courts should utilize international agreements which facilitate the conduct of cross-border litigation in the absence of demonstrable prejudice to legitimate interests. Implementation of the Convention will demonstrate our cosmopolitan approach to litigation arising out of the global economy and our sensitivity to the concerns of our trading partners. Though the French \u201cblocking statute\u201d cannot control an American court\u2019s exercise \u201cof the power to order a party subject to its jurisdiction to produce evidence,\u201d <em>Aerospatiale, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 544 n. 29, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2556, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 484, the \u201cblocking statute\u201d is a cogent expression of French concerns which should be accommodated, when possible. As a result, our courts and litigants may harvest reciprocal benefits when in need of the cooperation of foreign tribunals to gather evidence from persons or entities not subject to the jurisdiction of our courts, or in the enforcement of judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We agree with the observation of Chief Judge Munson in <em>Hudson, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">It appears that the major obstacle to the effective use of Convention procedures by litigants and the courts is the fact that we are less familiar with those procedures than with the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules. Consequently, use of Convention procedures will, at least initially, result in greater expenditures of time and money for attorneys pursuing causes of action against foreign parties on behalf of their clients and could require an increased commitment of judicial resources. Nonetheless, these inconveniences alone do not outweigh the important purposes served by the Hague Convention. Further, as judges and lawyers become more familiar with the discovery rules of the Convention, it is quite possible that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>procedures will prove just as effective and eosLefSeient as those of the Federal Rules. To assume that the \u201cAmerican\u201d rales are superior to those procedures agreed upon by the signatories of the Hague Convention without first seeing how effective Convention procedures will be in practice would reflect the same parochial biases that the Convention was designed to overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">[117 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 38-39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In the present case, LS has made representations regarding the effectiveness of Convention procedures, including the representation that use of those procedures will result in \u201cAmeriean-style\u201d depositions. In the event utilization of the Convention proves to be inadequate, the trial court can revisit the discovery issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The trial court\u2019s determination not to use the Convention is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> Judge Alley's opinion is also a reference source of other authorities regarding the Convention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
