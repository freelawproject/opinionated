The insurance policies are a homeowners policy issued by Huron Insurance Company (Huron) to McClure; a comprehensive general liability policy issued by Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company (Atlantic) to his employer Artex Knitting Mills, Inc. (Artex); and a workers\u2019 comperisation/employers\u2019 liability policy issued by New. Jersey Reinsurance Company (New Jersey) to Artex.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Suzanne Miller is the plaintiff in the underlying action. She filed a thirteen-count complaint against McClure, Artex, and others. She seeks relief against McClure in the first eight counts and also in the thirteenth count. The thirteenth count, however, merely incorporates by reference all the allegations in the first twelve counts and seeks relief against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Miller alleges that she was a factory worker employed by Artex beginning in July 1994 and McClure was her immediate supervisor. The core of Miller\u2019s allegations are contained in the first count of her complaint. We now reproduce certain paragraphs of the first count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">9. Over the course of several months, while employed by Defendant Artex, Plaintiff was repeatedly subjected to unwelcomed sexual remarks, lewd behavior, sexual innuendos, requests for sex, including requests stated in the most crude and graphic terms, and unwelcomed touching of a sexual nature by the Defendant McClure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>10. Defendant McClure repeatedly made crude sexual comments to Plaintiff, including, but not limited to, remarking that Plaintiff had: \u201cbedroom eyes\u201d, \u201ca sister\u2019s ass\u201d and a \u201cnice set of tits\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">11. Defendant McClure would repeatedly stare at Plaintiffs body parts, including her breasts, buttocks and crotch, in a sexual manner and say such things as, \u201cI want to eat your pussy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">12. Defendant McClure repeatedly made comments to Plaintiff concerning the size of his penis, often times while grabbing his crotch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">15. While they were both working, Defendant McClure repeatedly and regularly, made unwelcomed sexual advances towards Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">16. While they were both working, Defendant McClure continually groped and grabbed for many of the Plaintiffs body parts, without her permission and in opposition to Plaintiffs implicit and explicit objections, succeeding on many occasions. Specifically, some of these incidents include, but are not limited to, Defendant McClure grabbing Plaintiff between the legs, at the crotch, biting her buttocks, grabbing and slapping her buttocks and grabbing her breasts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">17. Defendant McClure repeatedly and regularly exposed himself, specifically by exposing his genitalia to Plaintiff, and propositioned Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">23. From the beginning of Plaintiffs employment, Defendant McClure attempted to, and did, use his position, power, influence and control, as her immediate Supervisor to harass and discriminate against Plaintiff. For example, Defendant McClure told Plaintiff that he had told Arthur Pottash, an \u201cowner\u201d of the Defendant Artex, to hire Plaintiff after McClure had seen her in the waiting room. Defendant McClure told Plaintiff that he had wanted her to be hired because she was young and pretty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">24. Unbeknownst to Plaintiff at the <em>time, </em>Defendant McClure directed Defendant Artex to hire Plaintiff as a \u201ctoy\u201d for McClure\u2019s sexual amusement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">25. Defendant McClure was not just Plaintiffs supervisor, he was the management representative with the most authority and power at Artex after Artex\u2019s \u201cowners\u201d, Arthur Pottash and Bernard Gerbarg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">43. Plaintiff was constantly in fear of losing her job, which she very much needed, as a result of her not complying with or responding to the sexual remarks, demands, innuendos, requests for sex and unwelcomed touching of a sexual nature, which she suffered at the hands of Defendant McClure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">44. As a result of the aforesaid actions of the Defendants, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, fear and intimidation, stomach problems and headaches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-16\">45. Said actions by Defendant McClure to extort sexual favors from Plaintiff constitute a <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>sexual determination and harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>46. Said actions by Defendant McClure were performed under color of his authority as a supervising employee of Defendant Artex and, therefore, constitute the actions of Defendant Artex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The principles of law governing the interpretation of liability coverage are well established and we summarized them in <em>Sinopoli v.. North River Ins. Co., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 581 A.2d 1368 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>325, 604 A.2d 600 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Our function when construing a policy of insurance, as with any other contract, is to search broadly for the probable intent of the parties in an effort to find a reasonable meaning in keeping with the express general purposes of the policy. <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>561, 567, 178 A.2d 185 (1962); <em>Tooker v. Hartford Acc. and Indemn. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 222-223, 319 A.2d 743 (App.Div.1974). However, the language of liability insurance policies should be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, <em>Sandler v. N.J. Realty Title Ins. Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>471, 479, 178 A.2d 1 (1962); <em>accord Keown v. West Jersey Title and Guaranty Co., </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 27, 390 A.2d 715 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. den, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>405, 396 A.2d 592 (1978), and in such manner as to provide full coverage of the indicated risk rather than to narrow protection. 13 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 7486 at 622. (Buckley ed.1979). Conversely, exclusionary clauses should be strictly construed. <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 485, 382 A.2d 1152 (App.Div.1977), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 405 A.2d 788 (1979); <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527 (1970); <em>Mazzilli v. Acc. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 170 A.2d 800 (1961).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">Nevertheless, the rule of liberal construction cannot operate to authorize a perversion of the language and the intention of the contracting parties. <em>See James v. Federal Insurance Co., </em>5, <em>N.J. </em>21, 24, 73 A.2d 720 (1950); <em>Kampf v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>36, 43, 161 A.2d 717 (1960); <em>accord Scarfi v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 559 A.2d 459 (App.Div.1989). The court cannot rewrite the contract for the parties. <em>See Middle Dept. Insp. Agency v. Home Ins. Co, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 54, 380 A.2d 1165 (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. den. </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>234, 386 A.2d 858 (1978). Nor is a court permitted, even under the guise of good faith and peculiar circumstances, to alter the terms of an otherwise unambiguous contract. If plainly expressed, the insurers are entitled to have liability limitations construed and enforced as expressed. 13 Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7486 at 623. Although a liability policy covers all losses which are fairly within the terms of the policy, it cannot be extended to liabilities or losses which are neither expressly or impliedly within its terms. 6B Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4254 at 26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">If the controlling language of a policy supports two interpretations, one favorable to the insurer and the other favorable to the insured, a court is obligated to apply the interpretation supporting coverage. <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961). The reasonable expectation of the insured should be accorded so far as the language of the policy permits. <em>Allen v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>294, 305, 208 A.2d 638 (1965); <em>Merchants Ind. Corp. v. Eggleston, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>114, 121-122, 179 A.2d 505 (1962). The burden is on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>carrier to bring the case within the exclusion. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 399, 267 A.2d 7 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\"><em>lid, </em>at 250-51, 581 A.2d 1368.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We add that exclusions must be narrowly construed, and the insurer has the burden of establishing that the exclusion applies. <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95, 698 A.2d 9 (1997). \u201cHowever, exclusions are presumptively valid and will be given effect if \u2018specific, plain, clear, prominent, and not contrary to public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 559, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We first address McClure\u2019s demand for coverage under the \u201cworkers compensation and employers liability policy\u201d issued by New Jersey Re-Insurance Company to Artex. The trial court granted New Jersey summary judgment on the ground that the policy provided no coverage to McClure or Artex employees. We affirm. The policy defined an insured as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">You are an insured if you are an employer named in item one of the information page. If that employer is a partnership and if you are one of its partners, you are insured, but only in your capacity as an employer of the partnership\u2019s employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The information page referred to in this section names \u201cArtex Knitting Mills, Inc.\u201d as the insured. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Artex is other than a corporation and, moreover, if it is a partnership, there is nothing in the record to indicate that McClure is a partner. Accordingly, McClure is not an insured under New Jersey\u2019s policy, and we affirm the judgment in favor of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Atlantic issued a commercial general liability policy to Artex. It provided liability coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d under \u201cCoverage A\u201d and for \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under \u201cCoverage B.\u201d The policy defined bodily injury as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death____\u201d It defined personal injury, to the extent relevant to this case, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">injury, other than bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">a. False arrest, detention or imprisonment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">b. Malicious prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>c. The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies by or on behalf of its owners, landlord or lessor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The policy insured Artex and its \u201cexecutive officers and directors ... but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors.\u201d The policy extended coverage to employees other than officers and directors in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">2. Each of the following is also an insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQe\">a. Your employees, other than your executive officers, but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you. However, no employee is an insured for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">(1) \u201cBodily injuiy\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to you or to a co-employee while in the course of his or her employment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The policy\u2019s exclusion of coverage for injury to employees was a major theme of the policy. Thus, the insuring agreement, in Section I 2e(1), excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury to (1) an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured.\u201d Atlantic\u2019s policy contained an endorsement titled, <em>\u201cEmployment-Related Practices Exclusion\u201d. </em>It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">1. The following exclusion is added to COVERAGE A (Section 1):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWHn\">o. \u201cBodily injury\u201d arising out of any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">(1) Refusal to employ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">(2) Termination of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">(3) Coercion, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination or other employment-related practices, policies, acts or omissions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">(4) Consequential \u201cbodily injury\u201d as a result of (1) through (3) above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">This exclusion applies whether the insured may be held liable as an employer or in any other capacity and to any obligation to share damages with or to repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">An identical exclusion applied to personal injury under Coverage B.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">We affirm the judgment in favor of Atlantic. The policy covers McClure as an employee but only for acts within the scope of his employment. Plaintiffs core allegation that she was the victim of sexual harassment constituting sex discrimination under New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (LAD) is dependent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>her employment by Artex and McClure\u2019s position as her supervisor. Consequently, McClure is an insured under the policy regarding those alleged acts. The same facts, however, remove McClure as an insured under that part of the definition of insured providing that \u201cno employee is an insured for bodily injury or personal injury ... to a co-employee while in the course of his or her employment.\u201d <em>See Schmidt v. Smith, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 580, 684 A.2d 66 (App.Div.1996) (acknowledging that comprehensive general liability policy did not cover hostile work environment claim based on sexual harassment because policy excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d), <em>certif. granted, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>461, 690 A.2d 608 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Additionally, under the \u201cEmployment-Related Practices Exclusion,\u201d there is no coverage for \u201charassment, humiliation, discrimination or other employment-related practices, policies, acts or omissions.\u201d In <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>another panel of this court concluded that an almost identical exclusion did not apply to an employer\u2019s vicarious liability for the intentional tort committed by the corporate employer\u2019s executive. <em>Id. </em>at 581-84, 684 A.2d 66. The court ruled that the exclusion did not apply because the employer had not committed an intentional act and its liability was merely vicarious. <em>Ibid. </em>We need not take a position regarding Schmidt\u2019s holding because it is distinguishable from the present case. Here, McClure, the employee who allegedly committed the acts complained of, is seeking coverage. We are persuaded that the Employment-Related Practice Exclusion endorsement also precludes coverage for plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Before we leave the Atlantic policy and address the Huron policy, we reproduce certain additional allegations in the plaintiffs complaint regarding the \u201ccompany party\u201d and related gun incident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">28. Defendant McClure further attempted to intimidate Plaintiff in approximately October of 1994 and coerce her into an unwanted sexual relationship by inviting her to what McClure said was a \u201ccompany party\u201d which he was hosting. McClure told Plaintiff \u201cto keep it quiet, because not everyone\u2019s invited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>29. Plaintiff and a Mend who accompanied her got lost on the way to the \u201cparty.\u201d Plaintiff then called the phone number Defendant McClure had given her for further directions and was told by a woman, claiming to be McClure\u2019s aunt, to wait there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">30. Defendant McClure\u2019s wife then showed up and took Plaintiff to ... McClure\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">31. Defendant McClure\u2019s wife told Plaintiff that she was agitated at her husband upon learning of Plaintiffs presence because she knew that there was <em>not </em>any company party being conducted at her home and that she thought this was another of Defendant McClure\u2019s attempts to cheat on her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">32. Defendant McClure came out of the house with a gun and threatened to shoot Plaintiff and her friend, if they did not leave his property. He then shot the gun into the air. The Plaintiff and her Mend quickly left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">33. Plaintiff and her Mend feared that they might be killed when McClure threatened them with, and fired, his gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">34. Defendant McClure\u2019s invitation to his \u201ccompany party\u201d was just another attempt to persuade and coerce Plaintiff into an unwanted sexual relationship. Defendant McClure did not expect his wife to be home at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">35. The following week, Defendant McClure put a miniature gun on his key chain, which had not been there previously, reminding Plaintiff of the weekend\u2019s \u201ccompany party\u201d in an attempt to intimidate Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">In Count Three of her complaint, plaintiff alleges that McClure assaulted her \u201cby threatening her with a gun and shooting it in the air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">In Count Seven, plaintiff alleges that McClure \u201cfalsely and intentionally held plaintiff against her will on numerous occasions without any just or legal authority.\u201d Count Seven alleges that on one occasion McClure prevented plaintiff from leaving his vehicle \u201cand forced Plaintiff to remain in his vehicle against her will while he then drove her home.\u201d Count Seven also alleges that McClure restrained plaintiff from leaving the bathroom at the factory while he attempted to kiss her. In the final paragraph of Count Seven, plaintiff alleged that \u201c[a]s a result of Defendant McClure intentionally holding and imprisoning Plaintiff against her will, Plaintiff suffered physical, psychological and emotional damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Count Eight is based on an allegation of negligence, incorporates by reference all the allegations in Count One through Seven and alleges that \u201cMcClure negligently subjected Plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of emotional disturbance sufficient to threaten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>illness or bodily harm ... and negligently interfered with Plaintiffs integrity and ability to perform her duties as an employee.\u201d Those acts \u201cactually and proximately resulted in physical illness and other bodily harm to the Plaintiff and interfered with Plaintiffs integrity and ability to perform her duties as an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We are persuaded that the Atlantic policy does not cover McClure for the claims in Counts Three, Seven and Eight. As previously indicated, Atlantic\u2019s policy covered McClure only for acts within the scope of his employment by Artex. If we assume those counts allege acts by McClure within the scope of his employment then the exclusions previously discussed preclude coverage. If McClure were not acting within the scope of his employment then he was not an insured under Atlantic\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The Huron policy insures John J. and Maureen McClure. Characterized as a \u201cHomeowners 91 Policy,\u201d it covers casualty to their property and also provides liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The policy provides coverage for a claim for damages \u201cbecause of bodily injury ... caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies.\u201d The policy defines an occurrence as \u201can accident.\u201d Bodily injury is defined as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease ... and death that results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Excluded from liability coverage is \u201cbodily injury ... which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d Also excluded are claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">b. Arising out of or in connection with a \u201cbusiness\u201d engaged in by an \u201cinsured.\u201d This exclusion applies but is not limited to an act or omission, regardless of its nature or circumstance, involving a service or duty rendered, promised, owed, or implied to be provided because of the nature of the \u201cbusiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">k. Arising out of sexual molestation, corporal punishment or mental abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">The definition section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">2. \u201cBusiness\u201d includes trade, profession or occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">The trial court determined that the Huron policy does not provide coverage because Miller\u2019s claims are excluded under exclusion k. as claims arising out of sexual molestation or mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>abuse. In addition, the court also ruled that the business exclusion also precluded coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We partially agree with the applicability of the business exclusion. We are persuaded that it excludes those of Miller\u2019s claims which are actionable because of her employment relationship with McClure. <em>See Greenman v. Michigan Mutual Ins. Co., </em>173 <em>Mich.App. </em>88, 433 N.W.2d 346, 349-50 (1988) (concluding that business pursuits exclusion in homeowner\u2019s policy precluded coverage for sexual harassment claim, in part because claim not actionable in the absence of an employer-employee relationship); <em>see also Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. v. Ericksen, </em>903 <em>F.Supp. </em>836, 840-41 (M.D.Pa.1995) (holding that claim for libel was excluded from coverage under business pursuits exclusion where defamatory statement consisted of written complaint by defendant, a college teacher, to the Dean complaining of plaintiffs alleged sexual harassment, but defendant\u2019s statement to the press not so excluded). Offensive and vulgar sexual advances by McClure are actionable because Miller was McClure\u2019s co-employee and McClure had an employment position superior to Miller. Those claims, therefore, arose \u201cout of or in connection with a \u2018business\u2019 engaged in by\u201d McClure, since \u201cbusiness\u201d includes an insured\u2019s occupation. Thus, claims of <em>quid pro quo </em>or hostile work environment sexual harassment in violation of New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination are excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Miller\u2019s claims which are not dependent on the employment relationship, <em>i.e., </em>claims which would be actionable even if McClure was not a co-employee, are not excluded as a business claim. For example, if McClure engaged in the unconsented touching of Miller\u2019s intimate parts, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-le, Miller would have an actionable claim against McClure even if they were not co-employees. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3 (providing that uneonsented sexual contact with a victim\u2019s intimate parts is a crime). Similarly, whether the gun episode is actionable does not depend on the parties\u2019 employment relationship. Indeed, Count Four charges McClure with battery because he \u201coffensively touched the Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>in a sexual manner on numerous occasions.\u201d We agree with the trial court, however, that the sexual molestation exclusion applies to the claims based on sexual touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Count Five alleges an invasion of privacy due to McClure\u2019s sexually-oriented comments and questions. As a result, Miller contends that McClure \u201ccaused and continues to cause plaintiff outrage, mental suffering, shame and humiliation,\u201d resulting in \u201cstomach problems and headaches.\u201d We agree with the trial court that this is a claim for \u201cmental abuse\u201d within exclusion k, as are Count Six, Count Seven and Count Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Alternatively, we are persuaded that the exclusion of claims for \u201cinjury ... expect\u00e9d or intended by the insured\u201d applies because of the egregious and reprehensible conduct alleged in the complaint. <em>See Mroz v. Smith, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 138, 617 A.2d 1259 (App.Div.1992) (holding that defendant\u2019s actions, consisting of sexual advances and harassing phone calls, were not covered under homeowner\u2019s policy; \u201cexpected or intended\u201d exclusion applicable because intent to injure presumed); <em>see also Schmidt, supra, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 588, 684 A.2d 66 (holding that defendant\u2019s pre-employment sexual advances were so reprehensible that injury was intended or expected and actions were not covered under defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
