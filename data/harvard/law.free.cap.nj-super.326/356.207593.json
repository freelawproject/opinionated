Relative to this appeal, the judge confirmed the arbitrators\u2019 determination that: (1) defendant Pride Solvents &amp; Chemical Company of New Jersey, Inc. (Pride) breached an August 25,1989 Settlement Agreement between the parties by filing a complaint in the Law Division against High Voltage concerning High Voltage\u2019s duty to remediate an industrial site being purchased by Pride; and (2) High Voltage was entitled to reasonable counsel fees as damages as a result of Pride\u2019s breach. Judge Hamlin referred the matter to a Special Master to fix the fees and costs owed to High Voltage.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The Master awarded High Voltage $84,605.59. By final judgment dated October 9, 1998, Judge Messina adopted the Master\u2019s findings and directed that the counsel fees owed to High Voltage be deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court subject to High Voltage\u2019s satisfaction of terms fixed by the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Pride appeals, arguing that the arbitration award must be vacated because: (1) the arbitrators exceeded their authority in awarding counsel fees in contravention of the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(2) the award of fees was not based on any evidence in the arbitration record; and (3) the award was \u201c[n]either [m]utual, [f]inal [n]or [d]efinite.\u201d We reject the contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Prior to 1978, High Voltage was the owner of an industrial site located in Middlesex County. From the 1930\u2019s through 1978, it conducted manufacturing operations at the site, resulting in contamination of the soil and groundwater. In 1978, High Voltage sold the site to Mellen Chemicals, Inc. (Mellen). After discovering the contamination in 1985, Mellen instituted suit against High Voltage in the United States District Court under the New Jersey Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (ECRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lK-6 to -14. In 1987, Mellen entered into negotiations to sell the site to Pride, subject to ECRA compliance by High Voltage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In order to effectuate the sale to Pride, Mellen and the parties executed a Settlement Agreement on August 25, 1989. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, High Voltage entered into an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the NJDEP under which it assumed responsibility for remediation of the site. The Settlement Agreement provided that High Voltage had the exclusive right- to negotiate with the NJDEP in achieving ECRA compliance. Pertinent here was a provision for arbitration of \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof....\u201d The arbitrators were directed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">interpret the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with New Jersey law, but shall not have the authority or power to modify or alter any condition or provision of this Agreement, or any modification thereof, or to render any award which by its terms has the effect of altering or modifying any express condition or provision of this Agreement or modification thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On March 16, 1993, Pride instituted an action in the Chancery Division demanding injunctive relief and compelling High Voltage to comply with the NJDEP\u2019s ACO as required by the Settlement Agreement. High Voltage counterclaimed, alleging that it was entitled to counsel fees because Pride breached the Settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Agreement by initiating a lawsuit instead of submitting the remediation issue to arbitration. High Voltage also demanded counsel fees as a prevailing party under the New Jersey Environmental Rights Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:35A-10, and the Frivolous Lawsuit Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1. As a result of the litigation, the NJDEP inspected the site and, on September 29, 1993, advised High Voltage that there were a number of remediation steps not yet addressed. It therefore directed High Voltage to submit a revised schedule \u201cthat incorporates the remedial measures set forth below ... with 30 days____\u201d Pride thereupon voluntarily dismissed its complaint without prejudice. High Voltage\u2019s counterclaim for counsel fees was dismissed with prejudice. On High Voltage\u2019s appeal, we affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that High Voltage was entitled to submit the issue of Pride\u2019s breach of the Settlement Agreement to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">After a hearing the arbitrators determined that Pride had breached the Agreement by instituting its action instead of submitting to arbitration. The panel determined that High Voltage was entitled to counsel fees as damages incurred as a result of the lawsuit, but directed that the fees be paid into an escrow account, subject to High Voltage\u2019s compliance with the NJDEP\u2019s cleanup conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">High Voltage filed an action in the Chancery Division seeking to confirm the arbitration award and for a remand to the arbitration panel to determine the amount of counsel fees. Pride filed a separate action in the Law Division seeking to vacate or modify the award. After the matters were consolidated, Judge Hamlin, as noted, confirmed the award and referred the matter to a Special Master to quantify the amount of fees and costs due to High Voltage by order dated September 15, 1997. Upon the Master\u2019s finding that High Voltage was owed $84,605.59, Judge Messina entered a final judgment confirming the Master\u2019s findings on October 9,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">An arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve a dispute is based upon the contract between the parties. <em>Communications Workers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>of Am., Local 1087 v. Monmouth County Bd. of Soc. Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>442, 476 A.2d 777 (1984). \u201cThus, the jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator are circumscribed by and limited to the powers delegated to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 476 A.2d 777 (citing <em>Kearny PBA Local #21 v. Town of Kearny, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>208, 217, 405 A.2d 393 (1979)); <em>Ridgefield Park Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Ridgefield Park Bd. of Educ., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>144, 155, 393 A.2d 278 (1978). Consequently, \u201c[a]ny action taken beyond that authority is impeachable.\u201d <em>In re Arbitration Between Grover and Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>221, 229, 403 A.2d 448 (1979) (holding that arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to carrying out intent that case be decided in accordance with law).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">It is now settled that an arbitration award may be vacated only in cases of fraud, corruption or similar wrongdoing as provided by the arbitration statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8. <em>In re Arbitration Between Tretina Printing, Inc. v. Fitzpatrick &amp; Assocs., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>349, 355-59, 640 A.2d 788 (1994). Under Chief Justice Wilentz\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Perini Corp. v. Create Bay Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>479, 610 A.2d 364 (1992), endorsed in <em>Tretina, </em>an award should not be vacated even though it may be based on a mistake in law. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 610 A.2d 364 (Wilentz, J., concurring); <em>Tretina, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 640 A.2d 788. Chief Justice Wilentz observed in <em>Perini, supra, </em>however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">For those who think the parties are entitled to a greater share of justice, and that such justice exists only in the care of the court, I would hold that the parties are free to expand the scope of judicial review by providing for such expansion in their contract; that they may, for example, specifically provide that the arbitrators shall render their decision only in conformance with New Jersey law, and that such awards may be reversed either for mere errors of New Jersey law, substantial errors, or gross errors of New Jersey law and define therein what they mean by that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[129 <em>N.J. </em>at 548 \u2014 49[, 610 A.2d 364.]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Under this approach, an arbitration award could be vacated based on a mistake in law because the parties specifically provided in the Settlement Agreement that the arbitrators shall render their decision in conformance with New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Pride argues that the award must be vacated because the arbitration panel ignored the provision of the Settlement Agreement that the arbitrators were to be governed by New Jersey law in resolving any dispute. Pride points out that there is no provision in the Settlement Agreement for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the event of a breach, and argues that the award was contrary to the traditional \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that fees shall not be awarded to the prevailing party unless provided by statute or contractually authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Pride misconstrues the contract language. It does not provide that the arbitrators \u201cshall render their decision only in conformance with New Jersey law____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 610 A.2d 364. Rather, the Settlement Agreement provides only that the arbitrators, in resolving any controversy, \u201cshall <em>interpret the provisions of this Agreement </em>in accordance with New Jersey law[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Presumably^ the arbitrators interpreted the contract in accordance with New Jersey law in determining that Pride had breached the Settlement Agreement. Pride does not argue to the contrary before us. The arbitrators not only were required to determine whether there was a breach, but also what appropriate remedy should be given in order to make the party who was harmed, in this case High Voltage, whole as a result of the breach. The Settlement Agreement is entirely silent as to the arbitrators\u2019 power to fashion a remedy. As we stated in <em>Commerce Bank v. DiMaria Constr., Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 19, 692 A.2d 54 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>73, 697 A.2d 546 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>1116, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>1053, 140 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>116 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201carbitrators may conclude that the only way to provide complete relief for a breach of contract \u2014 the only way to actually put the injured party in as good a position as it would have <em>been in </em>if the contract had not been breached \u2014 is to award any counsel fees which had to be incurred to prove the breach____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Here, the \u201conly way to provide complete relief\u2019 to High Voltage was the recoupment of the fees incurred by it as a result of Pride\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Pride next argues that the award of counsel fees should be vacated because it was not based on any evidence produced during the arbitration proceedings. Pride points to the fact that during the proceedings High Voltage \u201cfailed to offer any evidence at the arbitration hearing of the amount of its attorneys fees.\u201d Pride claims that it relied \u201cupon the fact that evidence of High Voltage\u2019s attorneys fees was not submitted to the Arbitration Panel at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">If the arbitrators decide a matter not submitted to them, that matter can be excluded from the award. <em>Tretina, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 358, 640 A.2d 788. However, here it is clear that the arbitrators were to determine whether Pride breached the Settlement Agreement and whether High Voltage was entitled to an award of money damages with regard to the losses it suffered as a result of the breach. One of Pride\u2019s briefs to the panel framed the issue similarly, specifying that the panel would determine whether \u201cHigh Voltage is thereby entitled to legal fees.\u201d The issue presented is exactly the issue the arbitrators decided. Presumably, the parties presented to the arbitrators their competing positions as to the breach issue and, if a breach occurred, what remedy was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Pride also argues that the award was not mutual, final or definite because the award did not determine the quantum of damages, and the conditions established in the award are not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The Court in <em>Tretina, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 363, 640 A.2d 788, noted that \u201cin limited circumstances a court can remand to an arbitrator for reconsideration or clarification.\u201d For example, in <em>Jersey City Police Officers Benevolent Ass\u2019n v. City of Jersey City, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 11, 607 A.2d 1314 (App.Div.1992), we directed the trial court to resubmit one issue to the arbitrator where it \u201chad been neither submitted to nor decided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>arbitrator\u201d in the initial proceedings. Since the arbitrator had not exercised his powers relating to that issue, his authority had never expired. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cLikewise, if the obligations under an award are unclear to the parties, a court may resubmit the question to the arbitrator for clarification.\u201d <em>Tretina, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 363, 640 A.2d 788. Such resubmissions allow the arbitrator to settle the issues without judicial encroachment on the arbitration process, not to explain how the arbitrator arrived at the conclusions contained in the award. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 640 A.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Therefore, Judge Hamlin had the authority to remand the matter to the arbitrators. When the judge considered remand, however, Pride resisted, urging the court to \u201ctake the matter and resolve it in this court.\u201d In view of Pride\u2019s position, Judge Hamlin decided that the arbitrators had concluded their duties as charged under the Settlement Agreement and did everything but fix the amount due High Voltage. This omission was understandable in view of the fact that the arbitrators were experts in environmental matters, not in awarding counsel fees. However, their failure to take testimony and award a bottom-line figure does not mean that their award was reached by \u201cundue means.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8a. Judge Hamlin took the practical and expedient approach by remanding the remaining issue to an experienced member of the bar to quantify the counsel fees due High Voltage. Pride had full opportunity before the Special Master to challenge the reasonableness of the fees demanded by High Voltage.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Pride also argues that the award was \u201cindefinite\u201d because of the conditions imposed by the arbitrators on High Voltage\u2019s entitlement to counsel fees. However, the arbitrators\u2019 award of damages against Pride was unconditional and definite. The conditions imposed by the arbitrators pertained to when and under what circumstances the money should be released to High Voltage. As High Voltage points out in its brief, \u201c[i]t is High Voltage, not Pride, that has additional burdens and less certainty as a result of this conditional remedy. Because Pride is not prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>by this aspect of the award, Pride should not be entitled to raise objections to it.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> Pride ultimately purchased the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
