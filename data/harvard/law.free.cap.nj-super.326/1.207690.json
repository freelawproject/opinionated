In 1995, when a price could not be negotiated, the city instituted a condemnation action against defendants, the Maffuccis, 2910 Wesley Avenue Condominium, and 2825 Wesley Avenue Condominium. Included in the proceeding was a fifty by eighty foot strip of beach in front of 2825 Wesley Avenue in which the Spadaceinos are first floor tenants. As a result of the dune project, the view of the ocean from the Spadaecino\u2019s condominium has been completely obstructed and direct access to the beach has been eliminated by nine foot high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>dune grasses. Beach access must be gained by a pathway 80 feet north of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">On July 22,1997, after a hearing, three commissioners appointed to appraise the value of the easement taken by the City and set just compensation, issued a report declaring just compensation to be $1.00. No reasons were stated for this award. Defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">A jury trial was held<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at which the main issue was whether the defendants were entitled to severance damages. Defendants claimed that the easement damaged the remaining part of their property and diminished its market value by $100,000. The City countered that the easement caused no damage to the property as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">A trial ensued at which Ackley O. Elmer, a real estate appraiser, testified for Ocean City. According to Elmer, because beach view and access rights have no value, loss of riparian (littoral)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights did not devalue the property. Elmer undertook a comparative sales study of property in Ocean City. He testified that there is no difference in value between beachfront property and non-beachfront property. In measuring the current value of the condominium, Elmer did not include in his comparables any beachfront property. He testified that the loss of view suffered by the first floor of the condominium \u201chad no effect at all\u201d on the valuation. In fact, even \u201cif the lower unit devalued, the upper unit increased in value.\u201d Elmer explained that the property must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>considered \u201cas a whole\u201d for appraisal purposes, and not as two individual units in a duplex. Thus, he determined that the value of the easement was $1.00 and that there was no severance damage to the remaining land where the condominium was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Cyril Galvin, a coastal engineering expert, testified for defendants that the dune eliminated any view of or access to the beach from the Spadaccino\u2019s condominium. Galvin explained that the dune continually increased in height and width from the date of taking to the time of trial and that it would continue to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">The dune clearly blocks the line of sight to the water and this obstruction will increase markedly in the coming years because of the vegetation growth and the trapping of the sand from the newly widened beach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In his report, Dr. Galvin also suggested that Elmer\u2019s analysis was skewed because he did not evenly distribute the dates of sales on properties he valued for comparison throughout the sales period he examined. In other words, Elmer examined 44 sales over four years (1986-1990) but not eleven a year*. In 1988 he used nineteen sales, then 9, 6, and 7 in 1987,1989, and 1990 respectively. Thus, according to Dr. Galvin, Elmer\u2019s comparables may have been skewed by fluctuations in the real estate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Chip Collins, a real estate expert, also testified for the defendant. Collins agreed that the value of the easement was $1.00. However, he testified that the severance damages to the defendant were $100,000. Of this amount, $75,000 was damage to the first floor; $25,000 to the second floor. Collins calculated damages two ways: pursuant to the first method, he determined the value of the land taken plus the value of the remaining parcel before the taking, and subtracted the value of the remaining parcel after the taking. That is: $1 + $1,000,000 (1st floor: $425,000; 2nd floor: $575,000) \u2014 $900,000 (1st floor: $850,000; 2nd floor: $550,000) = $100,001. These \u201cbefore and after taking\u201d figures were based on comparable sales. Method two valued the entire parcel before the taking and subtracted the value of the entire parcel after the taking. ($1,000,000 \u2014 $900,000= $100,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Specifically, Collins\u2019 \u201cvalue of the remaining parcel after the taking\u201d calculation was based on four things: loss of view, loss of direct beach access, loss of use, and loss of privacy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">Q: Now ... 2825 Wesley Condominium. Would you explain to us what you did there and what you found?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">A: First of all, in applying the market data approach of before and after, I used the basis of loss in value by analyzing the property with the dune area. My conclusions were that there was loss in value to each of the respective floors individually. I analyzed it from four basic standpoints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">The first stand point was from the loss in value due to the loss of view. My conclusions were that there was a loss in value due to a loss in view from the first floor unit but not the second floor unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">The second area is that I determined that there was a loss in value due to a loss of direct access to the beach and the water. In my opinion that loss was applicable to both the first floor unit and the second floor unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">The third area was also in value due to a loss in the use of that particular area. The open space enjoyment in the area being deprived by use was a loss suffered by the unit owners of both the first floor unit and the second floor unit. And fourth and finally, the loss in value due to the loss in the privacy by the creation of an alleyway with people walking directly in front of each of the units back and forth to the beach was a loss in value that was experienced by both the first floor and the second floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">With these items in mind, the direct data approach was by trying to come up with comparable sales of the first floor unit and the second floor unit before the occurrence of these items and then applying it to the occurrence of these items after they took place, the before and after ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">Collins assigned loss of view 60%; loss of access 20%; loss of use 10%; and loss of privacy 10%. He testified that while it is still possible to smell and hear the ocean from 2825 Wesley Avenue, it is \u201cbarely\u201d visible because of the dune, and \u201cthere is absolutely no view, whatsoever, of the strand as before.\u201d Collins disagreed completely with Elmer regarding the value of visual and physical access to the ocean. Collins, a real estate agent/broker who specializes in beach property, explained that in the \u201cmany years\u201d he has rented, sold, and appraised beachfront property in Ocean City, beachfront makes a difference in value. Collins testified that close to \u201c95%\u201d of all people looking for property in Ocean City \u201cwant to be on the beach.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">They want to be able to see the beach ... they want to be able to see the ocean. They want to be able to use the adjacent lands on the beach. They want to enjoy the beachfront immediately in front of the property that they have. This is what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>determines the value of the property that we handle on the beach. People come to our shore to be able to see and enjoy the beach immediately in front of the property that they get. They do not come to the beach for safety factors. They do not come to the beach for soil control. They come to the beach so they can sit and use it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Collins testified that the \u201cgold coast properties\u201d (beachfront) have riparian rights which makes them valuable: \u201cthe value would be that you not only own the portion of your property that your home is on, but you also own the beach all the way out to the water.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">[T]he value attached to that particular property is determined by the demand by what the people ... are going to use it for. That\u2019s what they want it for. That\u2019s why they buy these things. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll pay so much for property \u2014 so much more for property on the beach____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">As to the loss of direct access to the beach, Collins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">Q. How far is the access to the beach from this unit, the first floor unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">A. Measured from where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">Q. I don\u2019t care, the north property one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">A. 80 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">Q. 80 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">A. 80 feet, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-14\">Q. So isn\u2019t it a fact that although they lost some beach closer to the bulkhead, they\u2019ve gained beach out towards the ocean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-16\">Q. And there\u2019s no net loss is there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-17\">A. Except that the use of the beach directly adjacent to the property is in my opinion, very, very valuable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-18\">A. [The beach] is not adjacent to the property [anymore] is what I\u2019m referring to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-H\">Q. Oh, so it\u2019s a fact they have to walk another 100 feet, that\u2019s a problem for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">A. They lost more than 100 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-19\">Q. 200 feet? How far is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-20\">A. Well, it\u2019s 80 to cross over and then they\u2019ve got to go across the cross over and then they\u2019ve got to go down another 150 feet or so [to reach the beach], Q. That sounds like a problem now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-21\">Concerning loss of use, Collins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-22\">Q. Now, tell me what the second floor unit owners have lost from the beach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">A. They\u2019ve lost the use of the beach directly in front of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Q. But they can get to the ocean, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Q. They can find the beach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Q. They can build sand castles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">Q. They can picnic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">Q. They can play football and they go in the water, all those things, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-15\">A. Except that the use of the beach directly adjacent to the property, is, in my opinion very, very valuable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-16\">Q. Now, if Mr. Spadaccino wants to sit down [in the area between the dune and the porch] and read a book he can do it can\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-18\">Q. And, if he wants to go out there at night and read a book, he can do it, can\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-20\">Q. And, the dune has an effect [on] use and enjoyment of the area, has it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-21\">A. It might be, and it has.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-22\">Finally, concerning loss of privacy Collins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-23\">Q. Now, the fourth area is loss of value due to privacy. People walking up in front and down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-25\">Q. That\u2019s in the trough area, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-27\">Q. And, its your opinion that the second floor is adversely affected by that as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-28\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-29\">Q. The second floor apartments can\u2019t even see anybody walking there, can they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUF\">A. I\u2019m sure\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-30\">Q. Up on the second floor deck of this property, I don\u2019t see people waking down there, do I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-31\">A. Well, why wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-32\">Q. Because you\u2019re elevated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-33\">A. That means you can\u2019t see anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-34\">Q. That\u2019s my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-35\">A. And the answer is, of course you can see people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Q. Okay. And that results in a 10 percent loss of value? That\u2019s the allocation right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">Q. Okay. What statistics did you use to come up with that? How many people walk by there on a given Saturday in July?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">A. I didn\u2019t use statistics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">Q. Well, who did you talk to determine how many people walked by there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\">A. I talked to hundreds of owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\">Q. In the 2800 block?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-15\">Q. How many people did you talk to in the 2800 block?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-16\">A. I guess I talked to about half a dozen owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-17\">Q. And how pervasive is this problem people walking by there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-18\">A. It\u2019s an irritation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-19\">Q. An irritation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-21\">Q. And that irritation resulted in loss of value on the fabulous gold coast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-22\">A. Yes, to this property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-23\">Collins stated that the \u201cthe highest and best use for that easement area would be to provide an open beach so that people could use it, enjoy it, and provide an unobstructed view of the water and the strands in either direction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-24\">Collins compared properties which, in his opinion, were similar in location, size, shape, fashion and demand to the condominium, both before and after the taking. For his \u201cbefore\u201d calculations he used \u201cproperties that were sold with absolutely no loss of view, no loss of access, no loss of use and no loss of privacy to determine the value before the taking.\u201d For his \u201cafter\u201d calculation, he examined similar properties, \u201c[b]ut they suffered from a loss of view, loss of direct access, loss of privacy ... loss of use of the property in front.\u201d He actually used 2827 Wesley Avenue (the second floor condominium) as a comparable because it was sold, at a loss, prior to trial but after the dune had been erected. Regarding the date of his valuation, Collins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-25\">Q. By the way Mr. Collins, what is the date of this valuation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-26\">A. The date of this valuation was May 28,1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-27\">Q. What is the date of taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-28\">A. I\u2019m not entirely sure on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Q. What is the date of taking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">A. I\u2019m not entirely sure on that date of taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">Q. I\u2019m asking you, do you know what a date of taking is in a condemnation proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">A Not exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">Q. Well, what\u2019s your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">Q. Now, your appraisal report is dated May of 1996, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">Q. And your expressing values as of May of 1996?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-15\">Q. Okay. What date are you expressing the value on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-16\">A <em>The </em>figures I gave were the difference <em>between </em>the before and <em>after in case of </em>before the infringement of those loses versus afterward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-17\">Q. I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-18\">A I assumed that happened over a period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-19\">Q. Well, I\u2019m not asking what you assumed. You told these folks that the actions of condemning the easement resulted in $100,000 damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-21\">Q. I want to know as of what date that $100,000 occurred. What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-22\">A. I don\u2019t believe that occurred over one day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-23\">Q. Over what period of time did it occur? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-24\">A I would say that would be over approximately two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-25\">Q. From what date to what date then? \u201994 to \u201996?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-26\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-27\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-28\">A I would say August 1992 until December of 1994. December 1994 was the date that I rendered my first opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-29\">Q. Now getting back to the date, isn\u2019t it a good appraisal practice to identify the date for your evaluation? Isn\u2019t that the way appraisers do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-30\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-31\">Q. Okay. Now we know you\u2019re not an appraiser, so what is the date that you established for this value of $100,000. We have to have a date, don\u2019t we? A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-32\">Q. We don\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-33\">A. I did not have date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-34\">Q. Okay, Now, you don\u2019t have date but don\u2019t good appraisal practices require the expert to say there\u2019s a date on which this damages occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">Q. Okay. So we can agree there should be a date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">A. No, I didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">Q. Okay. There should not be date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">A. I didn\u2019t say that either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">Q. What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">Q. I said, my value was not based on a date. Obviously the occurrence took place over a long period of time. The creation of the dune and problem that I am testifying to as to the loss of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-14\">Q. So you\u2019re not telling us that the $100,000 diminution is of any date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-15\">A. I\u2019m not saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-16\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-17\">A. I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t know what the exact date of that diminution in value is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-18\">Q. Okay, And you don\u2019t know what relevance, if any, it has to a date of taking because you don\u2019t know what a date of taking is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-20\">A. I don\u2019t know what \u201cthe\u201d date of taking is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-21\">Louis Spadaceino<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified regarding the actual riparian grant governing the property which was sold to a predecessor in title, \u201cand to her heirs and assigns forever,\u201d in 1902 by the Governor and other \u201criparian Commissioners.\u201d The grant was for \u201call that parcel of land flowed by the tide water,\u201d and accurately described the plot of land. He also addressed the critical importance of the view of the ocean and access to the beach when he purchased the property. He described the privacy he enjoyed before the dunes were built that was quite distinct from the funneled walkway now directly past his deck. The walkway, built for the public to traverse the dunes, causes a steady stream of \u201cpedestrian\u201d traffic. The Spadaceino\u2019s daughter-in-law testified concerning the importance of the view for a mother; she used to allow her children to play on the sand because she could easily watch them from the deck. She can no longer do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>At the close of the case, the City moved to strike Collins\u2019 testimony because his valuation was not related to a specific date and not connected to the date of the taking, which was January 27, 1993. Thus, the City argued, the condominium presented no testimony on valuation. Judge Callinan denied this motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">I am satisfied [that the] real thrust of [this] motion is that a witness who testifies as to value in a condemnation case must refer that value to the date of taking. That is the operative date of which the values are relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">And if Mr. Corcoran prevails on that motion the jury goes home without deciding the case. Because the only thing that is left without Mr. Collins\u2019 [testimony] is no testimony as to value that\u2019s helpful to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">It is clear to this court that the date of taking, at least as I understand the operative date of taking, is going to be January 27,1993. And the testimony of Mr. Collins as to value was vague as to the date of taking and I don\u2019t think he understood the concept of the filing of the declaration of taking. Nor do I think that he knew the actual date of taking. Whether he knew the concept or not or whether he was not instructed to target his report to a specific date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">But, since the concepts that he relied upon were relevant, at least temporally to the time frame in dispute here. And, since he basically referred his time frame to \u201992, \u201993 area in his testimony and according <em>to my </em>notes, I\u2019m going to allow his testimony not to be stricken, but I will \u2014 and I don\u2019t agree that the remedy where there is no reference to the declaration of taking time is the weight that is attributed to the opinion. I don\u2019t believe it goes to weight. I believe it goes to admissibility. So, I acknowledge that admissibility is the issue here.

On March 24, 1998, this judgment was incorporated into an Order for $37,001 plus accrued interest from January 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The City made a motion for a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the alternative, a new trial. On May 4, 1998, the judge denied this motion and issued a letter opinion. He concluded that, although the defense expert did not key his testimony precisely to the date of taking, his evidence was temporally relevant to that date and satisfied the statutory and common law mandates in light of the continuous changes in the topography of the dunes from the time of taking to trial; that the defense expert\u2019s evidence was not based upon conjecture but on facts sufficient to warrant its admission; that the evidence, in fact, supported a loss of beach view and access; and that such a loss is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The City appeals contending that Collins\u2019 testimony was inadmissible and that, in any event, because reasonable access and view of the beach remained after the taking, defendant did not suffer a compensable loss. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">There was evidence to support the conclusion that defendants lost their ocean view, beach access, and privacy. As to the adequacy and admissibility of that evidence, some comments are in order. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u25a1lust compensation shall be determined as of the date of the earliest of the following events: (a) the date possession of the property being condemned is taken by the condemnor in whole or in part; (b) the date of the commencement of the action; (c) the date on which action is taken by the condemnor which substantially affects the use and enjoyment of the property by the condemnor which substantially affects the use and enjoyment of the property by the condemnee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Professor Nichols has stated in his leading treatise on the law of eminent domain that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">[i]t is critical that the appraisal performed by both parties reflect the date of valuation. Failure to appraise according to the correct date of value may give l\u00e1se to a motion to strike the appraisal, or the reversal of the entire verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">[5 <em>Nichols, Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 18.16 (3d ed.1998) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The City argues on appeal that the trial judge erred by allowing the jury to consider Collins\u2019 testimony because he \u201cdid not know the [statutory] date of taking and, did not relate his opinion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>[statutory] date of taking.\u201d As the City points out, \u201cit is undisputed that the [statutory] date of taking occurred when the condemning authority filed its declaration of taking on January 27, 1993.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-30(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">As of that date, however, work on the beach restoration project, including the construction of dunes within the easement taken, had only just begun. The undisputed evidence of record, including both testimonial and photographic, demonstrates that the size and height of the dune constructed along the front of the subject property, within the easement taken, continued to grow throughout the duration of the beach restoration project from late 1992 until early 1995. Thus, the adverse impact of the dunes on the defendants\u2019 right to an unobstructed view of and access to the ocean and, hence, the amount of the severance damages occurring as a result of the taking, could not be calculated with any degree of accuracy or fairness as of the statutory date of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">As a consequence, Chip Collins related his testimony, not to \u201cbefore and after\u201d the statutory date of taking, but rather to \u201cbefore and after\u201d a period of time roughly corresponding to the beginning and end of the construction of the beach restoration project (approximately August 1992 until December 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The City nevertheless has taken the position that the trial judge was constrained to exclude Collins\u2019 testimony on the ground that he failed to relate his opinion to the statutory date of taking, even though the use of that premature date as the date of valuation would have yielded an inaccurate measure of the severance damages and thereby denied the defendants the just compensation that is their due.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In so arguing, the City fails to acknowledge that use of the statutory date of taking as the date of valuation must yield to constitutional considerations. Thus, as Professor Nichols in his treatise on the law of eminent domain has admonished: \u201cCare must be taken by the parties to ensure that strict adherence to the legal date of value does not create a valuation less or more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>just compensation.\u201d 5 <em>Nichols, supra, </em>\u00a7 18.16. Similarly, it has been observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">[t]his court is not solely bound by the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:3-30 in determining the date of valuation. The benchmarks of eminent domain law are the Just Compensation Clauses of the New Jersey and United States Constitutions. The selection of a valuation date is necessarily a component of just compensation, and that selection must comport with the constitutional mandate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\"><em>[New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Authority v. Giant Realty Associates, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 350, 362 A.2d 1312 (Law Div. 1976) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Thus, as Judge Callinan recognized, arbitrary application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-30 to set the valuation date in this case as of the date the City\u2019s condemnation action was filed \u201cis not required where application of the statute would result in unjust compensation to the property owner.\u201d <em>Uvodich v.

Penobscot County Water Co., </em>348 A.2d 249, 256 (Me.1975) (advocating that there are times when, in the interest of practicality, the valuation need not be as of the date of taking); <em>Utah State Road Comm\u2019n v. Friberg, </em>687 P.2d 821, 829 (Utah 1984) (\u2018When valuation is fixed at a date prior to the actual taking and the value of the property increases during a prolonged condemnation proceeding so that the valuation does not reflect a fair valuation of the property and does not therefore constitute \u2018just compensation,\u2019 the statute fixing the time of valuation is unconstitutional as applied.\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]o comport with constitutional requirements in a particular case, it is necessary ... to consider whether the protraction of judicial proceedings and other circumstances that affect the value of the land have had such an effect as to make a valuation as of a statutorily determine date unfair.\u201d <em>Friberg, supra, </em>687 P.2d at 829. In other words, \u201cthe time as of which the evaluation of the property should be made must comport with the peculiar facts and circumstances of the ease so as to assure the property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>compensation which is just, as contemplated by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Uvodich, supra, </em>453 P.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Here, the undisputed testimony of Cyril Galvin was that the dune increased in height and width throughout the years in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A series of photos recorded that position. Moreover, Collins testified that the condemnation of the easement resulted in $100,000 in severance damages on the basis of \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparable sales studies, that, as Judge Callinan found, \u201cshow a dramatic decrease in surrounding property values between the beginning and end of the beach restoration project.\u201d Indeed, Collins testified on cross-examination that \u201c[t]he figures I gave were the difference between the before and after in the case of before the infringement of those losses versus afterward\u201d and that he \u201cassumed that that happened over a period of time.\u201d In addition, Collins testified on cross-examination that the occurrence of the severance damages could not be pinpointed to a single day, but rather occurred over a \u201clong\u201d period, approximately two years in length, extending from August 1992 until December 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In view of this evidence, Judge Callinan specifically found that \u201cthe market analysis and pictures presented by the defense show that the full effect of the City\u2019s taking on the defendant\u2019s property could not be determined with great accuracy until the restoration project was completed.\u201d He also noted that the beach replenishment project \u201cinvolved a construction enterprise of some duration.\u201d Finally, he recognized that Collins \u201ctook the view that the damage was ongoing during the construction timespan and the effect was to be judged on the completed project, that is, the elevation of the dunes ultimately constructed by plaintiff and the access to the beach eventually afforded defendant by plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In view of these peculiar facts and circumstances, we are satisfied that Judge Callinan\u2019s determination that Collins\u2019 testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ny was admissible because it was temporally relevant to the statutory valuation date is legally unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We also agree with Judge Callinan\u2019s conclusion that loss of ocean view and access are elements for which severance damages may be awarded. While no New Jersey case has had occasion to expressly render such a ruling, the application of the standards governing partial takings leads inevitably to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">When the State takes private property for a public purpose under the provisions of the Eminent Domain Act of 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 to -50, the property owner is entitled to just compensation. <em>State, by Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513, 457 A.2d 463 (1983) (citing <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 1120). Where the whole of a property is taken, the measure of damages is the fair market value of the property as of the date of the taking, determined by what a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to, neither being under any compulsion to act. <em>Village of S. Orange v. Alden Corp., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>362, 368, 365 A.2d 469 (1976). However, where only a portion of a property is condemned, the measure of damages includes both the value of the portion of land actually taken and the value by which the remaining land has been diminished as a consequence of the partial taking. <em>Silver, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 457 A.2d 463. The diminution in value of the remaining property constitutes the \u201cseverance damages.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">New Jersey cases have expressed the computation [of severance damages] in either of two ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">In one group of cases it has been held that the measure of damages is the market value of the land taken plus the difference before and after the taking in market value of the remainder area. This concept of the measure of damages may be graphically illustrated by the following equation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">Value of land taken + (value of remainder area before taking \u2014 value of remainder area after taking) = just compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">The second rule enunciated by some courts is the so-called \u201cbefore and after rule,\u201d wherein the damages to the condemnee are computed as the difference between the value of the entire tract before the taking and the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>remainder area after the taking. This approach is embodied in the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Value of entire parcel before taking \u2014 value of remainder area after taking = just compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citing 4A <em>Nichols, Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 14.23 (3d ed.1975)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In valuing the property remaining after a partial taking</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">an examination of all of the characteristics of such remaining property after the time of the taking, as opposed solely to facts in existence at or immediately before condemnation, is inescapable. <em>Therefore, in the case of a partial taking, the market value of property remaining after a taking should be ascertained by a wide factual inquiry into all material facts and circumstances </em>\u2014 both <em>past and prospective </em>\u2014 that <em>would influence a buyer or seller interested in consummating a sale of the property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 515, 457 A.2d 463 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Obviously, flexibility is the hallmark of such an inquiry because just compensation in a given case will depend on the character and use of the property involved. <em>See State, by Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. St. John\u2019s Church, 142 N.J.Super. 568, 574, </em>362 A.2d 574 (App. Div.) (\u201cIn partial taking cases ... the landowner is entitled to be paid the value of the land taken, together with the diminution in value of the part that remains (severance value). Upon a taking of property the owner is only entitled to be paid for what he has lost.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>531, 366 A.2d 686 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Here, the City argues that the jury based its award on noncompensable considerations, namely, loss of ocean view, beach access and privacy. We disagree. If a \u201cwide factual inquiry into all material facts and circumstances \u2014 both past and prospective\u2014 that would influence a buyer or seller interested in consummating a sale of the property\u201d is the standard, ocean view, beach access, use and privacy are fundamental considerations in valuing beachfront property.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Indeed every other jurisdiction which has considered this issue has held that loss of view, loss of access, loss of privacy and loss of use are compensable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Pierpont Inn, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Inc. v.

Like the City here, the appellant in <em>Pierpont </em>contended that the trial judge \u201cerred in permitting the jury to consider the property\u2019s loss of view and relatively unrestricted access to the beach in determining severance damages.\u201d The California Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Where the property taken constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the owner is entitled to recover, inter alia, the difference in the fair market value of his property in its \u2018before\u2019 condition and the fair market value of the remaining portion thereof after the construction of the improvement on the portion taken. <em>Items such as mew, access to beach property, freedom from noise, etc. are unquestionably matters which a willing buyer in the open market would, consider in determining the price he would pay for any given piece of real property. </em>Concededly such advantages are not absolute rights, <em>but to the extent that the reasonable expectation of their continuance is destroyed by the construction placed upon the part taken, the owner suffers damages for which compensation must be paid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">These elements of damages mentioned by the witnesses are not claimed by respondents as special damages, but are merely the reasons given by the experts for their opinions that the market value of the portion of the tract not taken would be diminished by reason of the taking of the 1/10-acre strip in front____ All of the matters mentioned were proper reasons to be advanced by the experts as bases for their opinions as to value....
