The circuit court certified the class, determined that Allstate\u2019s insurance policy was ambiguous, and submitted the case to a jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Allstate.</p> <p id=\"b1017-5\" pgmap=\"1017\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to construe the insurance policy; that the circuit court abused its discretion in allowing Allstate to present evidence regarding its unilateral subjective intent; that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury regarding ambiguity, the burden of proof, and the principle of contra proferentem; that, as a matter of law, the insurance policy\u2019s limit-of-liability provision was ambiguous and therefore covered the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for a loss of value; and that Allstate improperly attacked the ethics and integrity of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. We affirm on other grounds.</p> <p id=\"b1017-6\" pgmap=\"1017\">FACTS</p> <p id=\"b1017-7\" pgmap=\"1017\">The plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles were damaged while insured by Allstate. Allstate paid the cost to repair each vehicle but did not compensate the plaintiffs for its diminished value (a repaired vehicle\u2019s loss in market value resulting from the fact that it suffered property damage). The plaintiffs initiated this class action, alleging that by failing to compensate them for their damaged but repaired vehicle\u2019s diminished value, Allstate breached its contract.</p> <p id=\"b1017-8\" pgmap=\"1017\">Allstate\u2019s collision and comprehensive coverages for an insured\u2019s automobile are governed by section six of its insurance policy. Section six is entitled \u201cProtection Against Loss To The Auto,\u201d is substantially the same in each class state, and states as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1017-9\" pgmap=\"1017\">\u201cCOVERAGE DD</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-10\" pgmap=\"1017\">A\u00fato Collision Insurance</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-11\" pgmap=\"1017\">ALLSTATE will pay for direct and accidental loss to YOUR insured AUTO *** (including insured loss to an attached trailer) from a collision with another object or by upset of that AUTO or trailer. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-12\" pgmap=\"1017\">* * &gt;:&lt;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-13\" pgmap=\"1017\">COVERAGE HH</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-14\" pgmap=\"1017\">Auto Comprehensive Insurance</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-15\" pgmap=\"1017\">ALLSTATE will pay for direct and accidental loss to YOUR</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-16\" pgmap=\"1017\">insured AUTO *** not caused by collision. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-17\" pgmap=\"1017\">* &gt;;&lt;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-18\" pgmap=\"1017\">Payment Of Loss By Allstate</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-19\" pgmap=\"1017\">ALLSTATE may pay for the loss in money, or may repair or replace the damaged or stolen property. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-20\" pgmap=\"1017\">Limits of Liability</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1017-21\" pgmap=\"1017(24) 1018(44)\">ALLSTATE\u2019S limit of liability is the actual cash value of the property or damaged part of the property at the time of loss. The actual cash value will be reduced by the deductible for each coverage as shown on the declarations page. However, OUR liability will not exceed what it would cost to repair or replace the property or part with other of like kind and quality.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b1018-3\" pgmap=\"1018\">Prior to the trial, Allstate moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the basis that the \u201cPayment of Loss\u201d and \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d provisions of the policy did not require Allstate to pay for diminished value. The circuit court determined that the insurance policy was ambiguous, and the court denied Allstate\u2019s motion to dismiss. The case was tried before a jury, and the jury rendered a general verdict in favor of Allstate. The circuit court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 posttrial motion, and the plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.</p> <p id=\"b1018-4\" pgmap=\"1018\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b1018-5\" pgmap=\"1018\">The plaintiffs argue that the diminished value of an adequately repaired vehicle is a \u201cdirect and accidental loss\u201d that Allstate is required to compensate under the policy\u2019s insuring provision. Allstate does not dispute that the term \u201closs\u201d could encompass a vehicle\u2019s diminished value, but it contends that the insuring language must be construed in light of the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d and \u201cPayment of Loss\u201d sections. Allstate argues that these provisions are clear and unambiguous and preclude an insured\u2019s recovery for a vehicle\u2019s diminished value.</p> <p id=\"b1018-6\" pgmap=\"1018\">The plaintiffs counter that the phrase \u201crepair or replace *** with other of like kind and quality\u201d in the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d section encompasses an inherent concept of value, is at the least ambiguous, and therefore requires Allstate to compensate the plaintiffs for their vehicles\u2019 diminution in value. The plaintiffs argue that because the policy requires that a repair or replacement be of \u201clike kind and quality,\u201d the vehicle must be repaired so that there is no remaining physical damage and no loss in value and that, otherwise, Allstate must pay to compensate its insured for the vehicle\u2019s diminished value.</p> <p id=\"b1018-7\" pgmap=\"1018\">While a vehicle\u2019s diminished value may be a \u201closs\u201d under the policy\u2019s insuring provision, we agree with Allstate that its obligation to compensate the insured for that loss is circumscribed by the plain language of the policy\u2019s \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d and \u201cPayment of Loss\u201d sections.</p> <p id=\"b1018-8\" pgmap=\"1018(81) 1019(80)\"> \u201cThe construction of an insurance policy is a question of law.\u201d Pekin Insurance Co. v. Estate of Goben, 303 Ill. App. 3d 639, 642 (1999). \u201cWhen construing the language of an insurance policy, the court\u2019s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in their agreement.\u201d Pekin Insurance Co., 303 Ill. App. 3d at 642. When determining the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in the contract, the court must construe the policy as a whole, giving effect to every part. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Case Foundation Co., 10 Ill. App. 3d 115, 121 (1973); Miller v. Madison County Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 46 Ill. App. 2d 413, 417 (1964). An insurance policy must be construed according to the sense and the meaning of the terms, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, it must be given its plain, ordinary, and popular sense. Pekin Insurance Co., 303 Ill. App. 3d at 642.</p> <p id=\"b1019-5\" pgmap=\"1019\">\u20222 \u201cAlthough it is true that limitations on an insurer\u2019s liability must be construed liberally in favor of the policyholder [citation], the rule comes into play only where there is an ambiguity.\u201d Menke v. Country Mutual Insurance Co., 78 Ill. 2d 420, 424 (1980). \u201cA provision in an insurance policy is deemed ambiguous if it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d Economy Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Bassett, 170 Ill. App. 3d 765, 769 (1988). A contract provision is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties do not agree on its meaning. Johnstowne Centre Partnership v. Chin, 99 Ill. 2d 284, 288 (1983). \u201cWhile it is highly important that ambiguous clauses should not be permitted to serve as traps for policy! ]holders, it is equally important to the policy! ]holders, as well as to the insurer, that definite and clear provisions, upon which the calculations of the company are based, should be maintained unimpaired by loose or ill-considered interpretations.\u201d Coons v. Home Life Insurance Co. of New York, 368 Ill. 231, 238 (1938). The touchstone in determining whether an ambiguity exists is whether the relevant portion of the policy is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, not whether creative possibilities can be suggested. Bruder v. Country Mutual Insurance Co., 156 Ill. 2d 179, 193 (1993). \u201c[T]he rule construing ambiguous provisions strictly against the insurer will not permit perversions of plain language to create an ambiguity where none in fact exists.\u201d Miller, 46 Ill. App. 2d at 418; see also Hobbs v. Hartford Insurance Co. of the Midwest, 214 Ill. 2d 11, 17 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b1019-6\" pgmap=\"1019(134) 1020(386)\">The \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d section of the policy states that Allstate\u2019s liability \u201cwill not exceed what it would cost to repair or replace the property or part with other of like kind and quality.\u201d Allstate has promised \u201cto repair or replace the property or part with other of like kind and quality,\u201d but there is no promise to restore the value of the vehicle. See Allgood v. Meridian Security Insurance Co., 836 N.E.2d 243, 247 (Ind. 2005). The plain and ordinary meanings of \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creplace\u201d connote the remedying of tangible, physical damage. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1923 (1993) (\u201crepair\u201d means \u201cto restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1298 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201crepair\u201d means \u201c[t]o mend, remedy, restore, renovate\u201d or \u201c[t]o restore to a sound or good state after decay, injury, dilapidation, or partial destruction\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1925 (1993) (\u201creplace\u201d means to \u201crestore to a former place, position, or condition\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1299 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201creplace\u201d means \u201cto restore to a former condition\u201d). By their definitions and the common understanding of the terms, \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creplace\u201d mean to restore something to its former condition, not to its former value. See Allgood, 836 N.E.2d at 247 (\u201c[diminution in value can be compensated, but it cannot be \u2018repaired\u2019 or \u2018replaced\u2019 \u201d); Culhane v. Western National Mutual Insurance Co., 2005 SD 97, 1124, 704 N.W.2d 287, 295 (\u201cthe ordinary meaning of the words \u2018repair\u2019 and \u2018replace\u2019 indicate something physical and tangible\u201d); Given v. Commerce Insurance Co., 440 Mass. 207, 212-13, 796 N.E.2d 1275, 1280 (2003) (the plain meaning of the terms \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creplace\u201d do not encompass \u201crepair\u201d or \u201creplace[ment]\u201d of damage caused by stigma, a form of damage that, by definition, defies a remedy by way of \u201crepair\u201d or \u2018 \u2018replace[ment] \u201d); American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2003) (the term \u201crepair\u201d with regard to a vehicle connotes something tangible, like removing dents or fixing parts, not value); Hall v. Acadia Insurance Co., 2002 ME 110, 117, 801 A.2d 993, 995 (\u201c[t]he act of repairing an object typically focuses upon restoring the object\u2019s function and purpose, and not upon returning the object to its earlier worth or value\u201d); see also Townsend v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 34,901, p. 9 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/22/01); 793 So. 2d 473, 478 (2001) (general prevailing meaning of \u201crepair\u201d is to fix, restore, or mend physical damage and does not encompass the restoration of value, an item of damage that cannot be physically repaired); Carlton v. Trinity Universal Insurance Co., 32 S.W.3d 454, 464 (Tex. App. 2000) (there is no concept of value in the ordinary meanings of \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creplace\u201d). \u201cAscribing to the words \u2018repair or replace\u2019 an obligation to compensate the insured for things [i.e., diminished market value] which, by their very nature, cannot be \u2018repaired\u2019 or \u2018replaced\u2019 would violate the most fundamental rules of contract construction.\u201d Carlton, 32 S.W.3d at 464; see also O\u2019Brien v. Progressive Northern Insurance Co., 785 A.2d 281, 290-91 (Del. 2001).</p> <p id=\"b1020-3\" pgmap=\"1020(79) 1021(22)\">To expand the ordinary meaning of \u201crepair or replace *** with other of like kind and quality\u201d to include an intangible, diminished-value element would be ignoring the policy\u2019s language or giving the policy\u2019s text a meaning never intended. Siegle v. Progressive Consumers Insurance Co., 819 So. 2d 732, 739 (Fla. 2002); see also Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d at 160 (to require the insurer, who elects to repair, to additionally pay cash for the market\u2019s diminished perception incorporates an intangible-value element into the repair provision that simply does not exist in the policy\u2019s language). The Indiana Supreme Court has explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1021-5\" pgmap=\"1021\">\u201c \u2018[L]ike kind and quality\u2019 refers to \u2018replace,\u2019 not \u2018repair!,]\u2019 which encompasses the notion of restoring property to its former condition. Only to the extent parts are replaced does a \u2018repair\u2019 entail \u2018property of like kind or quality.\u2019 To say one would repair an item with goods of like kind or quality is simply not correct English. An item of property (or a part of that item) is \u2018replaced\u2019 with other property, but it is \u2018repaired\u2019 with tools and labor. *** \u2018[L]ike kind and quality\u2019 unambiguously refers only to replacement, not to repairs, and the verb \u2018restore\u2019 appears nowhere in the policy.\u201d All-good, 836 N.E.2d at 247-48.</blockquote> <p id=\"b1021-6\" pgmap=\"1021\">If an insurer elects to repair a vehicle and must replace parts in doing so, it must use parts of \u201clike kind and quality,\u201d and if an insurer elects to replace the vehicle, it must do so with a vehicle of \u201clike kind and quality.\u201d See Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d at 160. The limit-of-liability provision includes no reference to diminished value or the restoration of value, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the provision\u2019s language precludes an insured\u2019s recovery for the diminished market value of a damaged but repaired vehicle.</p> <p id=\"b1021-7\" pgmap=\"1021(269) 1022(15)\">Additionally, the language of the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d provision demonstrates that Allstate knew how to say \u201cvalue\u201d when it meant \u201cvalue.\u201d See Townsend, 34,901, p. 10; 793 So. 2d at 479. Allstate\u2019s limit of liability is \u201cthe actual cash value of the property or damaged part of the property at the time of loss,\u201d but Allstate\u2019s liability \u201cwill not exceed what it would cost to repair or replace the property or part with other of like kind and quality.\u201d Allstate therefore has the option to pay the actual cash value of the property or part at the time of the loss or to pay the cost to repair the property or to replace the property or part with one of like kind and quality. If Allstate\u2019s policy provision was intended to guarantee the market value of the automobile after an election to repair, Allstate would have used the phrase \u201cactual cash value\u201d instead of \u201clike kind and quality.\u201d See Ray v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 200 Cal. App. 3d 1411, 246 Cal. Rptr. 593 (1988); see also Camden v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 66 S.W.3d 78, 82 (Mo. App. 2001) (the term \u201crepair,\u201d particularly considering that it is the option contrary to cash value, does not inherently include the concept of value). The policy\u2019s language allows the insurer to choose to pay either the actual cash value of the vehicle or the amount necessary to repair, not some combination of the two. If a combination of the two were allowed, the insurer\u2019s obligation to compensate the loss would be cumulative \u2014 repair or replace and pay diminished value, and the language does not so provide. See Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d at 159.</p> <p id=\"b1022-3\" pgmap=\"1022\">In addition to applying the plain meaning of the policy\u2019s language, we must also read the policy as a whole, giving effect to the \u201cPayment of Loss\u201d provision. See Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., 10 Ill. App. 3d at 121. Pursuant to this section of the policy, the insurer has an option to \u201cpay for the loss in money, or may repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.\u201d Including diminished value in the terms \u201crepair or replace\u201d would force an insurer that chooses to compensate a loss by exercising the \u201crepair or replace\u201d option to also pay money, ignoring the clause\u2019s disjunctive language and rendering the clause meaningless. See Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d at 160. Although the plaintiffs argue that the trial testimony demonstrated that Allstate generally declined to utilize its right to repair the vehicle, because it would be assuming the duty of having the repairs made with due care, the policy as a whole is facially unambiguous; therefore, we interpret the policy as a matter of law, without resorting to extrinsic evidence. See Air Safety, Inc. v. Teachers Realty Corp., 185 Ill. 2d 457, 462 (1999). The policy does not contemplate the repair or replacement of property or parts plus an additional payment of money for unrepairable diminished value. See Culhane, 2005 SD at 1123, 704 N.W.2d at 295.</p> <p id=\"b1022-4\" pgmap=\"1022(249) 1023(236)\">We find no ambiguity in the contractual terms of Allstate\u2019s automobile insurance policy. The policy clearly does not allow an insured to recover for a diminution in value. See Allgood, 836 N.E.2d 243 (the phrase \u201crepair or replace the property with other property of like kind and quality\u201d is not ambiguous and does not allow the insured to recover for the repaired vehicle\u2019s diminished value); Culhane, 2005 SD 97, 704 N.W2d 287 (an unambiguous policy requires the insurer to restore the vehicle to its preloss physical and operating condition, not to compensate for its loss of value); Given, 440 Mass. 207, 796 N.E.2d 1275 (no objectively reasonable insured would conclude that \u201crepair\u201d or \u201creplace\u201d includes compensation for a diminution in market value or for anything else beyond the restoration of the vehicle\u2019s precollision physical condition); Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154 (the phrase \u201crepair or replace the property with other of like kind and quality\u201d clearly requires the insurer to restore the vehicle to its preloss physical and operating condition, not its preloss value); Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 353 S.C. 491, 579 S.E.2d 132 (2003) (there was no concept of value in the policy\u2019s \u201crepair or replacement\u201d terminology); Hall, 2002 ME 110, 801 A.2d 993 (the unambiguous \u201crepair\u201d language of the policy precludes a recovery for a diminution in value, a loss that cannot be repaired); Siegle, 819 So. 2d 732 (the phrase \u201crepair or replace the property with other of the like kind and quality\u201d clearly limited the insurer\u2019s liability to a monetary amount necessary to repair the car\u2019s function and appearance, not value); O\u2019Brien, 785 A.2d 281 (under the unambiguous \u201crepair or replace\u201d limitations in the policy, the insurer was obligated to repair or replace vehicle parts only to the extent necessary to return the automobile to substantially the same physical, operating, and mechanical condition, but not the value it had before the accident); see also Pritchett v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 834 So. 2d 785 (Ala. Civ. App. 2002) (the words \u201crepair\u201d and \u201cwith like kind and quality\u201d do not connote a return to market value); Camden, 66 S.W.3d 78 (diminished value is not a covered loss pursuant to the unambiguous language of the policy); Townsend, 34,901, p. 13; 793 So. 2d at 480 (the insurer\u2019s liability was limited to the cost of restoring the damaged automobile \u201cto substantially the same physical condition [not value] as before the accident\u201d); Johnson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 157 Ariz. 1, 754 P.2d 330 (App. 1988) (the phrase \u201cpay to repair or replace the property or part with like kind and quality\u201d contemplates the restoration of physical condition, rather than the restoration of value); Ray, 200 Cal. App. 3d 1411, 246 Cal. Rptr. 593 (the policy language unambiguously required the insurer to restore the automobile to its precollision condition, but not to its precollision value).</p> <p id=\"b1023-5\" pgmap=\"1023(258) 1024(25)\">We recognize that some jurisdictions have reached the opposite conclusion regarding similar policy provisions. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Mabry, 274 Ga. 498, 556 S.E.2d 114 (2001) (the provision affording the insurer the option to repair serves only to abate, not eliminate, the insurer\u2019s liability for a diminution in value); Venable v. Import Volkswagen, Inc., 214 Kan. 43, 519 P.2d 667 (1974) (when the insurer elects to repair or rebuild, the insurer is obligated to put the vehicle in substantially the same condition as it was prior to the collision, to render it as valuable and as serviceable as before); Potomac Insurance Co. v. Wilkinson, 213 Miss. 520, 57 So. 2d 158 (1952) (if, despite repairs, there remains a loss in actual market value, that deficiency is added to the cost of the repairs); Dunmire Motor Co. v. Oregon Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 166 Or. 690, 114 P.2d 1005 (1941) (a replacement means the restoration of the property to its preinjury condition, and a restoration is not complete unless there is no diminution of value after the repair of the vehicle); see also By den v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 20 P.3d 1222 (Colo. App. 2000) (the phrase \u201cof like kind and quality\u201d is ambiguous so that when the insurer promises to provide a vehicle \u201cof like kind and quality,\u201d the insurer must provide the insured, through repair, replacement, and/or compensation, the means of acquiring a vehicle substantially similar in function and value to that which the insured had prior to the accident). We respectfully decline to join the opposing jurisdictions that have ignored the policy\u2019s clear and unambiguous language to give the policy\u2019s text a meaning never intended.</p> <p id=\"b1024-3\" pgmap=\"1024\"> We conclude, as a matter of law, that the language of this policy, when read as a whole, is clear and unambiguous, requires Allstate to restore the insured\u2019s vehicle to preaccident mechanical function and condition, and does not require Allstate to compensate its insured for a repaired vehicle\u2019s loss in market value due to the fact that it suffered damage. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in finding that the policy language was ambiguous and sending the case to a trial before a jury. We find in favor of Allstate, as a matter of law, and we need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments on appeal.</p> <p id=\"b1024-4\" pgmap=\"1024\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b1024-5\" pgmap=\"1024\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County in favor of Allstate, for reasons other than those relied on by the circuit court.</p> <p id=\"b1024-6\" pgmap=\"1024\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b1024-7\" pgmap=\"1024\">SPOMER, PJ., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b1024-8\" pgmap=\"1024\">JUSTICE WELCH,</author> <p id=\"Akq\" pgmap=\"1024\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b1024-9\" pgmap=\"1024(224) 1025(15)\">I respectfully dissent. As set forth in the majority opinion, the insurance policy provides that Allstate will \u201cpay for direct and accidental loss to YOUR insured AUTO\u201d (collision coverage) and that Allstate will \u201cpay for direct and accidental loss to YOUR insured AUTO *** not caused by collision\u201d (comprehensive coverage). Allstate does not dispute that the term \u201closs\u201d could include a vehicle\u2019s diminished value. In addition, there is no dispute that the policy fails to explicitly exclude from coverage, after the vehicle\u2019s repair, the loss sustained because of the vehicle\u2019s diminished value. Because the provisions in the policy do not exclude the loss sustained by a repaired vehicle\u2019s diminished value, I believe there is an ambiguity in the policy that must be construed against Allstate as the drafter. If Allstate, the drafter of the insurance policy, did not want its insureds to reasonably believe that they would be compensated for the entire loss, including the diminished value of the vehicle, Allstate should have specifically so stated in the policy. The policy could have stated, \u201cThe term \u2018loss\u2019 in this policy does not include the diminished value of an insured vehicle,\u201d to avoid any ambiguity regarding this coverage. Because I believe that a reasonable person, after reviewing the policy, would believe that the coverage would return him or her to the same financial position he or she was in immediately prior to the accident, I must respectfully dissent.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
