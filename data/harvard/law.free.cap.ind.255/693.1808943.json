Evidence introduced at the trial reveals that the defendant concealed a man\u2019s sweater in her dress and that she left Shoppers Fair Discount Department Store of Indianapolis without paying for the sweater. A witness to the theft, Willie Wells, testified that he saw Doris Owens in the dress department of the store and that he saw her put a man\u2019s sweater underneath her clothing. He watched her until she went to the front of the store and then he called a security officer. The store\u2019s security officer, Michael Beaver, testified that he followed the defendant out of the store and asked her if she had anything that she had failed to pay for as she came through the store\u2019s check-out counter. The witness testified that the defendant answered, \u201cYes, I have this blouse.\u201d Thereafter, she was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Defendant first argues that during the trial, the judge followed a persistent course of judcial misconduct, over repeated objections, with results that were demeaning to the court, the judiciary, and the bar, and which were contrary to law. For example, the following colloquy took place during the trial between the court and the opposing counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>\u201cTHE COURT: </em>State ought to raise this fellow Beaver\u2019s salary. Are you still with them? Here I was going to try to raise your salary, you did such a good job here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\"><em>MR. CARTER: </em>State will recall Mr. Wells.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Come on, Mr. Carter. You\u2019ve had all week to prepare this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\"><em>MR. CARTER: </em>I understand that, but we thought we would try the other case first, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\"><em>THE COURT: </em>We can\u2019t try the other case first this is an earlier number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\"><em>MR. CARTER: </em>As you may understand, we have some problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\"><em>THE COURT: </em>I don\u2019t see why. You\u2019ve got so many witnesses in the courtroom. You have no problem. All you got to do is use your own little head a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\"><em>MR. CARTER: </em>That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-12\"><em>THE COURT: </em>You\u2019ve got two beautiful girls sitting in front of you that can answer all of your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-13\"><em>MR. CARTER: </em>That\u2019s right, they\u2019re in the other case, that\u2019s why they\u2019re sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-14\"><em>THE COURT: </em>No, they\u2019re not. Just use your head, sir.\u201d The court at another point felt it necessary to assist the Prosecutor in getting the value of a sweater into evidence during direct examination of Willie Wells:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-15\">\u201cQ. Can you read the tag on that sweater ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-16\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>To which we object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-17\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Objection sustained. Object if he knows the value of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-18\">Q. Do you know the value of it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-19\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>To which we object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-20\">A. $8.99.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-21\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Let the answer go out. Do you know the value of it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-23\"><em>THE COURT: </em>He knows the value, now ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-24\">Q. What is the value of that sweater ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-25\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>I\u2019m going to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>A. $8.99.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>I want to ask a preliminary question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Over-ruled. Authority Wilson vs. State. Supreme Court says when a Judge sees an inept lawyer, such as the Prosecutor, he should help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>Yes, but he\u2019s got a witness that\u2019s talking out of his mouth and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\"><em>THE COURT: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\"><em>MR. RYAN: </em>And doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and being lead by . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Over-ruled. Authority Wilson verses State, about 220 Indiana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Concerning the defendant\u2019s taking the witness stand, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\"><em>\u201cMR. CARTER: </em>Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object. These questions are all leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Over-ruled. You ought to be thankful he put her on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">We do not commend such running commentaries by a judge who is clothed with the robe and behind the bench, with all the perogatives adhering to such an office, particularly when they are made against a young attorney and one who is unable to retaliate in kind. Tolerance and understanding are much more worthy judicial attitudes under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Initially, we point out that the trial was conducted without a jury and that therefore any remarks made by the judge in the course of the trial could not be said to have prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case in the minds of legally untrained triers of fact. The basic issue is whether defendant received a fair and impartial trial. Defendant contends she received a hearing punctuated with quips and running commentary, judicial intrusion, and premature resolution of the most vital issue of fact. We point out, however, that the trial judge in actuality was critical of the prosecuting attorney. No evidence is apparent that defendant received an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>unfair trial by reason of certain comments by the judge, though we would question the propriety of some of the statements. The evidence was conclusive that the defendant was guilty of shoplifting from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Defendant next claims that there was a fatal variance between the specific allegations of stolen property which appeared in the indictment and the proof made at trial in that the indictment alleged the theft of one blouse, two pairs of men\u2019s pants, and three men\u2019s sweaters. Evidence of the theft of one of the men\u2019s sweaters was introduced in court. Since the theft of just one sweater would be sufficient for a conviction of theft, no further proof was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">A certificate from the Secretary of State established that Shoppers Fair Discount Department Store of Indianapolis existed as of July 4, 1967. The theft occurred August 16, 1967. Since witnesses Willie Wells and Michael Beaver both testified that they worked for Shoppers Fair on August 16, 1967, the existence of the store on that date is recognized. Willie Wells further testified that the sweater taken by the defendant was from the Shoppers Fair Discount Department Store. This is sufficient to prove the allegation in the indictment that the property was in the possession of Shoppers Fair Discount Department Store. <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>State </em>(1970), 255 Ind. 326, 263 N. E. 2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Officer Beaver stated at the trial that he apprehended the defendant just outside the doors of the store. Before advising her of her constitutional rights, Officer Beaver proceeded to ask the defendant if she had anything in her possession that she failed to pay for at the counter. The defendant pulled out a blouse from her purse and said that she had not paid for it. We can only conclude that this testimony was properly admitted. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 requires that warnings be given before the onset of questioning if the situation is one of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d. In the case before us, defendant was merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>asked a question that in fact could have cleared up an inadvertent mistake. <em>Miranda </em>says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201cGeneral on-the scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement. In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 436, 477, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1629, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 725.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The <em>Miranda </em>warning was given after the store manager indicated to the security officer that he would prosecute, the warning not having been necessary prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-7\">DeBruler, J., concurs in result with opinion, in which Prentice, J., concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Concurring in Result</p>\n<author id=\"b738-9\">DeBruler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlL\">I concur in the opinion of the majority in its resolution of the issues of the alleged misconduct of the trial judge and the alleged insufficiency of the evidence. I must depart from the majority, however, in resolving the issue of whether a certain statement made by the appellant would be deemed inadmissible under the ruling of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The appellant was allegedly seen to have hidden some store merchandise upon her person. A witness, Willie Wells, a store employee, testified that he had personally observed the appellant appear to be shoplifting some merchandise and that he immediately contacted Officer Beaver, the arresting officer. Officer Beaver followed the appellant outside the store where he stopped her and asked her whether she \u201chad anything in her possession that she had failed to pay for at the counter\u201d. This question posed by Officer Beaver to the appellant was elicited on the direct examination of Officer Beaver by the State\u2019s prosecution. The appellant\u2019s incriminating response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to this question was brought forth only upon the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the witness Officer Beaver during the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cQ. Now then you said then that you asked her some questions, what did you ask her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">A. I asked her if she had anything she had failed to pay for, as she came through the store . . . through the stand, and she said \u2018Yes, I have this blouse.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Appellant contends that her Fifth Amendment rights were violated in that evidence was introduced which was obtained prior to the warning required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>The record shows that Officer Beaver did give the required warnings after placing the appellant under arrest subsequent to the conversation described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The question then is whether the statement made prior to the warnings was inadmissible as being in violation of the holding of <em>Miranda. </em>The majority holds that <em>Miranda </em>is without application in this instance as the officer\u2019s question was within the ambit of \u201cgeneral on-the-scene questioning\u201d which is not affected by the <em>Miranda </em>holding. The majority further states that the <em>Miranda </em>warning was not necessary prior to the time when the store manager indicated he intended to prosecute. I cannot agree. The decision of a prosecuting witness to \u201cprosecute\u201d is neither a necessary nor a sufficient element in the actual prosecution of an accused. Nor can any such decision, regardless of by whom it is made, be the touchstone in determining when the Fifth Amendment rights of the accused attach themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">In the case at bar, whether the statement elicited from the appellant was inadmissible is decided by determining whether the statement was made during custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">The language of the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>deserves quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">\u201cThe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>procedure safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. (This is what we meant in Escobedo when we spoke of an investigation which had focused on an accused.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">While the determination of when custodial interrogation begins is not without difficulty, I believe the facts in the case at bar do not lend themselves to a conclusion that the officer\u2019s question to the appellant falls within the meaning of general on-the-scene questioning and, therefore, outside the scope of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">As a result of information received from a store employee, Officer Beaver had reason to believe that the appellant had shoplifted certain goods from the store. He followed her outside the store, stopped her and asked her whether she had any articles on her which she had failed to pay for before she left the store. At that time Officer Beaver\u2019s attention was focused upon the appellant not as a general citizen who.might assist in the fact finding process surrounding an unsolved crime but rather as a person who was herself suspected of just having committed a felony. Certainly, a question posed to a <em>suspect </em>which invites an incriminating answer cannot be termed general on-the-scene questioning. Any such question posed to suspects by the police must be preceded by the warnings and waiver required by <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Turning to the issue of whether the statement by the appellant that \u201cYes, I have this blouse\u201d was erroneously admitted, I must conclude that it was not. As stated above this statement was not brought out on direct examination of Officer Beaver. Upon cross-examination the appellant\u2019s counsel asked Officer Beaver only what question he had asked the appellant. Officer Beaver replied with both the question and the appellant\u2019s answer. A motion to strike Officer Beaver\u2019s answer as not being responsive to the question may have been appropriate but it was not forthcoming. An earlier motion to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>press all further evidence of Witness Beaver, a later motion for finding of Not Guilty and discharge were properly overruled. In absence of a move to strike the answer of the witness, I believe it was not erroneously admitted and, therefore, concur in result reached by the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b741-5\">Prentice, J., concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Note.\u2014Reported in 266 N.
