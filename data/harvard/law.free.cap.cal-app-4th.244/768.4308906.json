Stuard (Jeff) and Cynthia Stuard (Cindy).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court awarded grandparent visitation under Family Code section 3104 even though there is no allegation Matthew or his ex-wife, Rebekah, are unfit parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court based its order on findings there is a preexisting relationship between Riley and her paternal grandparents and it is in Riley\u2019s best interest to continue to have contact with Jeff and Cindy.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>On appeal, Matthew contends (1) on its face, section 3104 violates equal protection guarantees by discriminating between divorced parents and married parents who are cohabiting, (2) as applied, section 3104 violates his equal protection rights because he would not be subject to the grandparent visitation order if he were still married to Rebekah, (3) as applied, section 3104 violates his substantive due process rights by undermining his fundamental right to parent in the absence of any finding he or Rebekah are unfit parents, (4) the trial court failed to follow section 3104 in basing the visitation order on Riley\u2019s best interest and her parents\u2019 role in allowing Jeff and Cindy to develop a relationship with her, (5) the trial court awarded need-based attorney fees under section 2030 even though the statute does not apply to grandparent visitation proceedings, (6) a sanctions order imposed on Matthew under section 271 erroneously penalizes his assertion of constitutional arguments against visitation, and (7) an order that he participate in anger management counseling violates section 3190 by failing to limit the duration to one year and for lack of statutorily required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">As to Matthew\u2019s equal protection challenge, we deem the issue to be forfeited for failure to present any argument on this point in the trial court and for lack of analysis on appeal as to how he is similarly situated with parents who are not subject to a grandparent visitation petition. As to substantive due process, we conclude section 3104 permissibly reflects a legitimate state interest in preserving an already existing grandparent-grandchild relationship that is threatened but in the best interest of the grandchild to safeguard. Here, the grandparent visitation order permissibly safeguards a strong bond between Riley and her paternal grandparents that Matthew and Rebekah fostered over the years and Riley\u2019s best interest in preserving her relationship with Jeff and Cindy after her parents\u2019 relationship ended in divorce. United States and California Supreme Court decisions have rejected the contention that the right to parent is absolute except after a finding of parental unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We are not persuaded by Matthew\u2019s argument the trial court misapplied section 3104 by considering Riley\u2019s best interest and her parents\u2019 role in allowing the development of her relationship with Jeff and Cindy. Section 3104 requires the trial court to consider these factors in determining whether to award grandparent visitation. We deem Matthew to be estopped from challenging the applicability of section 2030 to this case because he asked for attorney fees under the same section. We reject Matthew\u2019s characterization of the sanctions ordered under section 271 as a penalty for asserting his constitutional right to parent Riley. Instead, the sanctions under section 271 reflected Matthew\u2019s \u201cobstreperous conduct\u201d that unnecessarily increased the cost and duration of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Finally, we conclude the anger management counseling portion of the trial court\u2019s order did not include the findings required by section 3190 and did not limit the counseling to a period of not more than one year. Accordingly, we reverse this portion of the order and remand for the trial court to make the statutorily required findings and to limit counseling to one year if the counseling order is reimposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Following the well-established rule of appellate review, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment, resolving any conflicts in the evidence in support thereof. <em>(612 South LLC </em>v. <em>Laconic Limited Partnership </em>(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1276 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 780].)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Riley was born to Matthew and Rebekah in 2004. Jeff and Cindy, Matthew\u2019s parents, were present for the birth. When Jeff retired the following year, he became Riley\u2019s primary caregiver. Around that time, at Matthew\u2019s suggestion, Jeff and Cindy moved from Sacramento to Roseville, three blocks from where Matthew and Rebekah lived, to facilitate caring for Riley. Jeff referred to Riley as his \u201cgolden granddaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In 2008, when Riley entered preschool, Matthew would drop her off at school and Jeff would pick her up and watch her after school. This was also the year Matthew and Rebekah separated and ultimately dissolved the marriage. Following the separation, Jeff and Cindy saw even more of Riley, often watching their granddaughter during each parent\u2019s parenting time, while that parent was at work. According to Cindy, they watched Riley about 25 days each month during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">In 2009, Matthew and Riley moved in with Jeff and Cindy, which allowed for even greater contact between the child and her grandparents. Jeff and Cindy helped her get ready for school, took her to and from school, and watched her until Matthew came home from work, or until Rebekah picked her up to exercise her parenting time with the child. The grandparents also attended various school and sports activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">At some point after the move to Jeff and Cindy\u2019s house, the relationship between Matthew and his parents soured. According to Cindy, her son\u2019s personality changed when he began taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He became impatient and uncommunicative, was often angry, rude, and argumentative, and routinely made disparaging remarks. After feeding Riley dinner, Matthew would often <em>take </em>her upstairs to their bedrooms without a word. Indeed, at least when Matthew was home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Jeff and Cindy needed.his permission to say good night to their granddaughter. Jeff tried to talk to Matthew about his behavioral changes, but Matthew was unresponsive. Eventually, Jeff told Matthew to find his own place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Matthew moved out with Riley in 2011, informing Jeff he would never see his granddaughter again. Notwithstanding this declaration, Matthew brought Riley over to visit Jeff and Cindy on various occasions, including her seventh birthday. However, during one of these visits, Riley indicated she wanted to stay and watch television at her grandparents\u2019 house. Matthew responded by taking her home and had little contact with Jeff and Cindy after that. For their part, Jeff and Cindy tried to schedule time to see Riley through Matthew, but were unsuccessful. On one occasion, they went to Riley\u2019s soccer practice unannounced. Matthew told them to leave the practice or he would leave with Riley. When they did not immediately leave, Matthew pulled Riley out of practice and started taking her to his car. Jeff and Cindy then left so that Riley could finish her practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Unable to schedule time to see Riley through Matthew, Jeff and Cindy contacted Rebekah to obtain her permission to attend their granddaughter\u2019s soccer games. Rebekah and her new boyfriend, Will, arranged for Jeff and Cindy to be able to visit with Riley during Rebekah\u2019s parenting time through the end of 2011, including Halloween trick-or-treating, an overnight visit in November, and exchanging Christmas presents. Jeff and Cindy also obtained Rebekah\u2019s permission to participate in Riley\u2019s school activities during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">When Matthew discovered his parents were seeing Riley through Rebekah, he became very angry. Sometime in 2012, Matthew and Rebekah had a conversation about his objection to his parents seeing Riley, after which Rebekah told Jeff and Cindy to work their issues out with Matthew directly. Instead, Cindy contacted Riley\u2019s soccer coach to obtain her soccer schedule. At various points, she also contacted Rebekah\u2019s by-then-fianc\u00e9 Will and her father to seek their assistance in seeing Riley, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The original petition for grandparent visitation in this case was filed in January 2013. Diana Vodrey was appointed to serve as mediator. Vodrey met with Rebekah, Matthew, Jeff, Cindy, and Riley \u2014 in joint and separate sessions, observing Riley with both her parents and her grandparents. Vodrey found Riley to be a smart and articulate child who was neither withdrawn nor shy. Riley said she was happy at her grandparents\u2019 house and wanted to see them, asking Vodrey; \u201cWhy can\u2019t I see [my grandparents]? When can I see them?\u201d Vodrey recommended grandparent visitation, explaining this was what Riley wanted, the bond between Riley and her grandparents was \u201cquite strong,\u201d and Jeff and Cindy were capable of adequately caring for her. Vodrey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>also determined Riley suffered \u201cdamage\u201d as the result of her parents\u2019 decision to keep her from her grandparents, explaining: \u201cSomething was terminated that was very, very important to her. It was ended abruptly. That always hurts children. It\u2019s an abandonment issue. Someone important in her life left.\u201d Vodrey further concluded Matthew was \u201cangry and controlling\u201d toward his parents and recommended anger management counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">An amended grandparent visitation petition was filed in July 2013. In addition to visitation, the petition requested sanctions under section 271, $2,000 in costs for the court-ordered mediation, and $3,000 in need-based attorney fees under section 2030. Matthew opposed the petition and asked the trial court to reject Vodrey\u2019s recommendation regarding visitation. In August 2013, Matthew filed his own request for need-based attorney fees, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Trial commenced in January 2014. The relevant facts adduced during trial are those set forth above, with the following additions. Matthew testified that after he and Riley moved in with his parents, he became concerned about their behavior, which included them making disparaging remarks about Rebekah to Riley. When he made his concerns known, they responded by saying he was crazy or making things up. Matthew also testified he believed the litigation was, as he put it, a \u201cbullying and intimidation campaign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Rebekah testified she and Matthew had difficulties coparenting while married and initially after they separated, but became good coparents following their divorce. As she explained her opposition to grandparent visitation, when Matthew came to her with his concerns about his parents visiting Riley, she decided to \u201crespect him as a parent and validate his concerns\u201d by withdrawing her permission until they had worked things out with him, at which point Cindy \u201ccircumvented\u201d her and went to her fianc\u00e9. Rebekah continued: \u201cGrandparents have rights, but it does not supersede your parental authority, and my big concern and what I heard during Cindy\u2019s testimony yesterday and Jeff\u2019s today is that if they think that they are right that they\u2019re going to do what they want to do, regardless of what I say, and for me when it comes to my child that I am in charge of, that I gave birth to, that I\u2019m responsible for, that\u2019s not okay, and if you want to spend time with her and love her you have to respect me as a parent and my decisions, whether you like them or not, and if I can\u2019t trust you to do that, then I can\u2019t trust you to be around her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The trial court granted the petition. After describing the case as \u201ctragic\u201d and driven by Matthew\u2019s \u201cbitterness at having been asked to depart the grandparents\u2019 residence,\u201d with \u201cno evidence of culpable misconduct of any relevant kind\u201d on the part of either grandparent, the trial court applied section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>3104, found by clear and convincing evidence there was a preexisting relationship between Riley and her grandparents that engendered a bond such that grandparent visitation was in Riley\u2019s best interest, balanced this interest of Riley\u2019s against the right of her parents to exercise their parental authority, and concluded Riley\u2019s interest prevailed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court adopted Vodrey\u2019s recommendations regarding visitation. Two months after the effective date of the order, Jeff and Cindy may have Riley once a week during a weekday overnight visit and one overnight weekend visit per month. Jeff and Cindy may take Riley on a seven-day vacation each summer and have an overnight visit with her around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Additionally, Matthew and Rebekah may not interfere with Jeff and Cindy attending or participating in Riley\u2019s school, social, or athletic activities, and must keep Jeff and Cindy informed of such activities. The trial court also awarded Jeff and Cindy $3,000 in attorney fees under section 2030, $3,000 in sanctions under section 271, and $2,000 in counseling expenses under section 3104, all jointly and severally payable by Matthew and Rebekah. Finally, the trial court ordered Matthew to participate in anger management counseling at his own expense. Matthew appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Statutory Overview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In order to place Matthew\u2019s constitutional challenges to section 3104 in their proper context, we begin with an overview of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\u201cGrandparents\u2019 rights to court-ordered visitation with their grandchildren are purely statutory. [Citation.] Three California statutes expressly address grandparent visitation: [S]ection 3102, which permits visitation by a deceased parent\u2019s children, siblings, parents, and grandparents if such visitation would be in the best interests of the child; section 3103, which permits a court in specified proceedings involving the custody of a child to grant grandparent visitation; and section 3104, which permits grandparents to petition for visitation if the grandchild\u2019s parents are not married or if certain other conditions are met.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Harris </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 210, 219-220 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 842, 96 P.3d 141], fns. omitted <em>(Harris).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">This case involves section 3104. Subdivision (a) of this section provides: \u201cOn petition to the court by a grandparent of a minor child, the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>grant reasonable visitation rights to the grandparent if the court does both of the following: [\u00b6] (1) Finds that there is a preexisting relationship between the grandparent and the grandchild that has engendered a bond such that visitation is in the best interest of the child. [\u00b6] (2) Balances the interest of the child in having visitation with the grandparent against the right of the parents to exercise their parental authority.\u201d (\u00a7 3104, subd. (a).) However, such a petition \u201cshall not be filed while the natural or adoptive parents are married, unless one or more of the following circumstances exist: [\u00b6] (1) The parents are currently living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis. [\u00b6] (2) One of the parents has been absent for more than one month without the other spouse knowing the whereabouts of the absent spouse. [\u00b6] (3) One of the parents joins in the petition with the grandparents. [\u00b6] (4) The child is not residing with either parent. [\u00b6] (5) The child has been adopted by a stepparent. [\u00b6] (6) One of the parents is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Section 3104 also provides for \u201ca rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that the visitation of a grandparent is not in the best interest of a minor child\u201d (\u00a7 3104, subd. (f)) in two situations: (1) \u201cthe natural or adoptive parents agree that the grandparent should not be granted visitation rights\u201d (id., subd. (e)); and (2) \u201cthe parent who has been awarded sole legal and physical custody of the child in another proceeding, or the parent with whom the child resides if there is currently no operative order objects to visitation by the grandparent\u201d (id., subd. (f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Thus, the statutory scheme gives the greatest protection to \u201cthe integrity of the nuclear family unit and the ability of married, cohabitating parents to make decisions free from state interference\u201d by shielding married, cohabitating parents from the filing of a grandparent visitation petition except in very limited situations. <em>(Lopez </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 279, 286 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 71], superseded by statute on another point as stated in <em>Finberg, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 534.) Even where such a petition may be filed \u2014 for example, as here, where the parents are divorced and living apart \u2014 the statutory scheme still protects parental autonomy by creating a presumption against grandparent visitation where both parents agree the petitioning grandparent(s) should not be granted visitation rights (\u00a7 3104, subd. (e)) or where the parent who has been awarded sole legal and physical custody of the child, or the parent with whom the child resides if there is no custody order, objects to such visitation (\u00a7 3104, subd. (f)). At the same time, by making this presumption rebuttable, the statutory scheme recognizes \u201cthe importance of family ties and the value of a relationship between grandparents and grandchildren.\u201d <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 286.) As the author of a recent revision to the statute expressed: \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is common knowledge that children who have strong, loving adults in their lives thrive. Grandparents can be that strong, loving adult for a child. These relationships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>become even more vital during times when families are dissolving and changing . . . \u201d <em>(Finberg, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 536, quoting Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2517 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 23, 2006, p. 3.) \u201c[T]he key to understanding the Legislature\u2019s intent is to remember the primary impetus behind the provision was not the strengthening of grandparental visitation rights, but the protection of the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\n<em>Equal Protection Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Matthew contends, \u201csection 3104 is facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied here, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and California Constitutions.\u201d Jeff and Cindy counter Matthew has not preserved the issue for appellate review because he did not malee any equal protection challenge to section 3104 in the trial court. We conclude Matthew has forfeited the contentions because he did not raise these Equal Protection challenges to section 3104 below and, on appeal, he does not offer any analysis of how he is similarly situated to parents not subject to a grandparent visitation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">In the trial court, Matthew and Rebekah challenged the constitutional validity of section 3104 by citing <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 57 [147 L.Ed.2d 49, 120 S.Ct. 2054] <em>(Troxel). </em>However, <em>Troxel </em>considered only an as-applied challenge on <em>substantive due process </em>grounds to a Washington State grandparent visitation statute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 73.) An equal protection challenge differs in that it focuses on whether similarly situated groups receive constitutionally impermissible disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">\u201cEqual protection under the law means that parties similarly situated with respect to a law must be treated alike under the law. [Citations.] That does not mean, however, that differential treatment is always unconstitutional. Where a statute makes distinctions involving inherently suspect classifications or fundamental rights, it is subject to \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 and may be upheld only if the <em>government </em>establishes the distinction is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. [Citation.] Most legislation, however, is reviewed only to determine whether the challenged classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. [Citation.] In areas of social or economic policy not involving suspect classifications or fundamental rights, a statute must be upheld so long as there is any reasonably conceivable set of facts that provides a \u2018rational basis\u2019 for the classification. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>\u201cMoreover, in those cases <em>not </em>involving suspect classifications or fundamental rights, it is the <em>party challenging the statute </em>who must demonstrate that the difference in treatment is unrelated to the achievement of any legitimate government purpose. [Citation.] This means that the challenging party must essentially negate every conceivable legitimate basis which might support the statutory classification. [Citation.] Because a legislative body is not required to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, whether the conceived reason supporting the statute actually motivated the legislative body is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes. [Citations.] \u2018In other words, a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\u2019 [Citation.] Under the rational basis test, a strong presumption favors the validity of the challenged statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(420 Caregivers, LLC v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2012) 219 Cal.App.4th 1316, 1333-1334 [163 Cal.Rptr.3d 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As the party challenging the application of section 3104, Matthew had the burden to demonstrate he is similarly situated to parents who are not subject to a grandparent visitation petition under section 3104. However, Matthew presented no argument in the trial court that his equal protection right was violated by disparate treatment from a similarly situated group. Consequently, Matthew did not preserve the equal protection issue for appellate review. <em>(In re S.C. </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 396, 406 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 453] [\u201cIn order to preserve an issue for appeal, a party ordinarily must raise the objection in the trial court\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Even if the equal protection challenge had been preserved for appeal, the issue is forfeited in the absence of meaningful legal analysis of the similarly situated requirement in Matthew\u2019s equal protection argument. <em>(In re S.C., supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 408.) In a single paragraph of the opening brief and two paragraphs of the reply brief, Matthew asserts parents who are divorced or separated (and subject to grandparent visitation petitions) are similarly situated to married, cohabitating parents (who are not subject to grandparent visitation petitions) because both categories involve children with two natural parents. Matthew\u2019s assertion lacks any meaningful analysis of how the circumstances of marital dissolution and an end to cohabitation among the parents and child might differ or be considered similar for the categories of parents he believes section 3104 wrongfully discriminates between. Accordingly, we conclude the equal protection argument is undeveloped and therefore forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Substantive Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Matthew\u2019s final constitutional challenge asserts that, as applied in this case, section 3104 violates his federal and state substantive due process rights. We reject the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">We review issues of statutory construction and constitutional validity under the de novo standard of review. <em>(Finberg, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 532.)

An as-applied challenge \u2018contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case ... to determine the circumstances in which the statute . . . has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the [defendant] of a protected right.\u2019 <em>{Ibid.) </em>When reviewing an as-applied constitutional challenge on appeal, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings on historical facts that are supported by substantial evidence, and then independently review the constitutionality of the statute under those facts.

The trial court rejected the argument. In doing so, the trial court acknowledged that \u201cRebekah and Matthew do not err when they argue their parental decisions are entitled to deference and the grandparents\u2019 submission. But decisions are not made in a vacuum and not without consequence. From the child\u2019s birth, both parents permitted the grandparents\u2019 unfettered access to the child. Days grew into weeks, weeks grew into months, and, in time, the months became years. With both regular and increasing contact between the grandparents and their grandchild, the parental authority that would sever the relation \u2014 without more \u2014 reciprocally and incrementally diminished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Matthew\u2019s substantive due process argument rests on the suggestion his and Rebekah\u2019s undisputed parental fitness stands as an impermeable barrier to a grandparent visitation order. The California Supreme Court rejected a similar argument regarding section 3104 in <em>Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 210. <em>Harris </em>involved a petition by paternal grandparents for visitation of a grandchild who had lived with them for a week in California until the mother and child moved out. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 215.) The mother, who had sole legal and physical custody of the child, moved about for several years and eventually settled in Utah. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 215-216.) The paternal grandparents attempted to maintain their relationship with the grandchild by flying from California to visit their granddaughter while mother increasingly withheld access to the child. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 216-219.) The paternal grandparents filed a petition for grandparent visitation that the trial court granted and the Court of Appeal reversed on grounds the visitation order violated mother\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 218-219.) The California Supreme Court granted review and reversed, holding that \u201csection 3104 controls in this case and that the statute is constitutional, both on its face and as applied.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 214.) Although the father continued to support the paternal grandparents\u2019 visitation petition, his parental rights were terminated after the trial court issued the visitation order. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 219, 221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\"><em>Harris </em>involved no allegation of the mother\u2019s parental unfitness. (See <em>Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 221.) Thus, the California Supreme Court considered whether section 3104\u2019s \u201crebuttable presumption against visitation \u2018if the parent who has been awarded sole legal and physical custody of the child in another proceeding . . . objects to visitation by the grandparent\u2019 \u201d sufficed to sufficiently preserve mother\u2019s fundamental liberty interests under the federal and state Constitutions. <em>(Harris, </em>at p. 221.) In its federal constitutional analysis, the <em>Harris </em>court examined the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. 57. <em>(Harris, </em>at p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 210 noted Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Troxel </em>\u201cconcluded that the Washington statute, as applied in that case, violated that fundamental liberty interest. <em>([Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p.] 67.) The plurality stated: \u2018[T]here is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 68.) \u2018Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 68-69 (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) [\u00b6] But the plurality did not prohibit the state from ordering grandparent visitation, stating instead: \u2018The problem here is not that the Washington Superior Court intervened, but that when it did so, it gave no special weight at all to [the mother]\u2019s determination of her daughters\u2019 best interests.\u2019 <em>(Troxel v. Granville, supra, </em>530 U.S. 57, 69 (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).) To the contrary, \u2018[t]he judge\u2019s comments suggest that he presumed the grandparents\u2019 request should be granted unless the children would be \u201dimpact[ed] adversely.44 In effect, the judge placed on [the mother], the fit custodial parent, the burden of disproving that visitation would be in the best interest of her daughters.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 224, italics omitted.) \u201cThe Washington statute was, in the words of the plurality in <em>Troxel, </em>\u2018breathtakingly broad,\u2019 permitting \u2018 \u201c[a]ny person\u201d \u2019 to petition the superior court for visitation rights \u2018 \u201cat any time.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p..225, quoting <em>Troxel, </em>at p. 67 (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In contrast to the \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d Washington statute in <em>Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. at page 67, California\u2019s \u201cLegislature limited section 3104 by creating rebuttable presumptions against grandparent visitation \u2018if the [child\u2019s] parents agree that the grandparent should not be granted visitation rights\u2019 (\u00a7 3104, subd. (e)), or if the parent awarded sole custody objects to grandparent visitation (\u00a73104, subd. (f)). These provisions prevent the situation that arose in <em>Troxel </em>in which the court ordered visitation over the objection of the child\u2019s sole surviving fit parent based upon a finding that such visitation was in the child\u2019s best interest. Unlike the Washington statute at issue in <em>Troxel, </em>section 3104 gives \u2018special weight\u2019 to the parents\u2019 decision, if the parents agree that visitation is not in their child\u2019s best interest, or to the decision of a parent who has been awarded sole custody of the child. The high court recognized as much by citing with approval section 3104, subdivision (e). <em>(Troxel . . . , supra, </em>530 U.S. 57, 70 (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.).)\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 210, 226.) Thus, the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Supreme Court held that \u201csection 3104 does not suffer from the constitutional infirmities that plagued the Washington statute considered in <em>Troxel.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Section 3104 does not violate substantive due process by granting grandparent visitation over the objection of Matthew and Rebekah. This court has previously held \u201cthat because the fundamental parenting right recognized by California courts is not absolute, the opposition of two fit parents to court-ordered grandparent visitation does not, by itself, preclude the court from ordering visitation.\u201d <em>(Fenn v. Sherriff </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1487 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 185].) To be sure, <em>Troxel </em>requires that \u201cif a fit parent\u2019s decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination.\u201d <em>(Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 70.) However, \u201c[gjiving the parent\u2019s determination \u2018special weight\u2019 is different than insulating the parent\u2019s determination from any court intervention whatsoever. <em>Troxel </em>does not support defendant\u2019s suggestion that a fit parent\u2019s decisions are immune from judicial review. Nor can we discern any basis in the law for reaching a different conclusion when there are two parents rather than one. The decision of father and his wife about whether and under what conditions grandparents should have visitation with their grandchildren is entitled to \u2018special weight\u2019 under Troxel\u2014 assuming both are fit parents \u2014 but no more.\u201d <em>(Fenn, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Here, Jeff and Cindy have been an integral part of Riley\u2019s life, from her birth until several years later when Matthew began blocking visitation with her. As the trial court noted, both of Riley\u2019s parents acceded to Jeff and Cindy\u2019s participation in Riley\u2019s daily life, school activities, and social events. The disruption of the grandparent-grandchild bond in this case follows the disruption of another bond \u2014 that between Matthew and Rebekah and its attending consequences for Riley. The continuance of a preexisting relationship with grandparents can provide stable and dependable nurturing the grandchild can continue to count on in the midst of a rift in the parental relationship. Thus, what Matthew seeks to accomplish by his reliance on substantive due process is to disrupt a relationship the court-appointed mediator characterized as a \u201cstrong\u201d bond between Riley and her paternal grandparents. The Legislature, however, did not violate Matthew\u2019s substantive due process rights by safeguarding Riley\u2019s relationship with her grandparents during a time when her parents separated and ended their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The thrust of Matthew\u2019s as-applied substantive due process argument was that the grandparents in this case have <em>no </em>visitation right. Nested within this argument was the assertion that the visitation order was overbroad for \u201cgiving the grandparents over 20% of the time with Riley, ordering the parents [] to pay thousands in attorney fees, sanctions, and counseling fees, and ordering Matthew to indefinite counseling.\u201d As we noted above, \u201cAn as-applied challenge . . . contemplates <em>analysis of the facts of a particular case </em>... to determine the circumstances in which the statute . . . has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the [defendant] of a protected right.\u201d <em>(Tobe, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1084, italics added.) Here, Matthew provided no constitutional analysis of the facts upon which he now rests his as-applied challenge \u2014 namely, the financial and practical day-to-day effects of the visitation order so disrupt his and Riley\u2019s life that the visitation order violates substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We conclude the trial court\u2019s application of section 3104 does not violate Matthew\u2019s federal or state substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\n<em>Whether the Trial Court Abused Its Discretion Under Section 3104</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Matthew contends the trial court abused its discretion under section 3104 by awarding grandparent visitation to Jeff and Cindy. Specifically, he argues the trial court used the wrong legal standard under section 3104 by failing to heed the presumption against grandparent visitation and by adopting an improper \u201cchild-centric\u201d approach. In advancing this issue, Matthew continues to rely on the argument his parental rights over Riley are absolute in the absence of proof of parental unfitness. We rejected this argument in part III, <em>ante. </em>To the extent he argues the trial court failed to exercise its discretion within the parameters of section 3104, we reject the argument based on our conclusion the trial court\u2019s statement of decision demonstrates its adherence to section 3104.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">\n<em>Discretion Under Section 3104</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">In <em>Harris, </em>the California Supreme Court explained, \u201cunder the statutory scheme in question, the Legislature expressly requires the trial court to \u2018[b]alance[] the interest of the child in having visitation with the grandparent against the right of the parents to exercise their parental authority.\u2019 (\u00a7 3104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>subd. (a)(2).) Guided judicial discretion regarding this factor \u2018protects] children against the arbitrary exercise of parental authority that is not in fact motivated by an interest in the welfare of the child.\u2019 <em>(Troxel, [supra, </em>530 U.S.] at p. 89 (dis. opn. of Stevens, J.).)\u201d <em>(Harris, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Generally, \u201c[t]he standard of appellate review of . . . visitation orders is the deferential abuse of discretion test.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Burgess </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 25, 32 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 444, 913 P.2d 473].) This means we will not reverse the visitation order \u201c \u2018 \u201cunless the trial court has exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd determination [citations].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 318 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706], quoting <em>In re Geoffrey G.. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 412, 421 [159 Cal.Rptr. 460].) Moreover, \u201c \u2018[\u201c][w]hen two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Stephanie M., </em>at p. 319, quoting <em>Walker v.

(e).) The trial court\u2019s statement of decision stated, \u201cNo party should read or consider the court\u2019s ultimate decision as suggesting that parental authority does not exist. It does. Rebekah and Matthew each continues to remain as the child\u2019s primary authorities. But effectively, Rebekah and Matthew should comprehend that their conduct of the span of years vitiated ... the parental authority over the grandparents\u2019 access to Riley to the degree that parental authority [for Jeff and Cindy] to attend public functions where Riley was present, assist in school where Riley attended, or initiate contact with Riley diminished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\n<em>Best Interests of the Child</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We are also not persuaded by Matthew\u2019s contention the trial court failed to apply the statutory presumption against grandparent visitation by adopting a \u201cchild-centric approach.\u201d Although Matthew asserts the trial court endowed the preexisting grandparent-grandchild relationship with undue importance, we conclude the trial court properly took into account the statutory prerequisite for a grandparent visitation petition of a preexisting relationship. (\u00a7 3104, subd. (a)(1) [allowing grandparent visitation only when the trial court \u201c[f]inds that there is a preexisting relationship between the grandparent and the grandchild that has engendered a bond such that visitation is in the best interest of the child\u201d].) Subdivision (a)(1) of section 3104 and the trial court\u2019s reasoning reflect the reality that Matthew and Rebekah fostered the grandparent-grandchild relationship at issue in this case. Section 3104 does not create a new grandparent-grandchild relationship where none previously existed. Instead, section 3104 preserves a relationship allowed by the parents to develop and that requires safeguarding to protect the best interests of the child. While Matthew and Rebekah have broad parenting prerogatives, they are not unlimited and do not extend to denying Riley\u2019s best interests in preserving an important and continuing relationship with her paternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In his argument about the presumption against grandparent visitation codified in section 3104, subdivision (e), Matthew essentially casts the presumption as conclusive when he argues that \u201cit is absurd to hold that a grandparent needs no parental permission to have contact with a grandchild if the parent allowed such contact in the past.\u201d Although a total lack of past contact will preclude a grandparent visitation petition for lack of a preexisting relationship (\u00a7 3104, subd. (a)(1)), the nature of the preexisting relationship serves to determine whether the petition may be granted, what the grandchild\u2019s best interests require, and the type of visitation that might be appropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Under Matthew\u2019s reasoning, even when parents encourage extensive daily grandparent-grandchild contact, the parents may nonetheless terminate the grandparent-grandchild relationship without any consideration of the parent\u2019s role in fostering the relationship. We disagree. The extent to which parents encourage a grandparent-grandchild relationship is relevant to overcoming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>presumption against granting a grandparent visitation petition. Matthew\u2019s change of heart regarding Jeff and Cindy\u2019s role in Riley\u2019s life does not render unconstitutional the trial court\u2019s consideration of his earlier conduct in fostering the grandparent-grandchild relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">v-vII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The orders (1) granting visitation under Family Code section 3104 to plaintiffs Jeffrey and Cynthia Stuard, (2) awarding attorney fees, and (3) imposing sanctions are affirmed. The order requiring defendant Matthew Stuard to participate in individual and subsequent joint counseling is reversed and remanded. On remand, the trial court shall determine (1) whether this dispute poses a substantial danger to the best interest of Riley and counseling for defendant is in her best interest, and (2) whether the financial burden created by requiring defendant to participate in counseling will jeopardize his other financial obligations. As required by Family Code section 3190, subdivision (d), the trial court shall set forth the reasons for its findings. If the findings support an order for counseling, the court may require defendant to participate in individual and joint counseling for a cumulative period of not more than one year.
