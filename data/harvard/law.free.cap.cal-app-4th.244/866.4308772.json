Rafael H. \u2014 a maternal uncle who became the minors\u2019 Indian custodian shortly before the commencement of these proceedings \u2014 argues that the juvenile court made numerous errors based on its initial failure to recognize his Indian custodian status under federal law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Rafael claims that he was not given the mandatory ICWA notices and related advisements required for an Indian custodian; that active efforts were not provided to him in order to prevent the breakup of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Indian family as required by the ICWA; that the juvenile court\u2019s detriment finding in response to his request for custody of the children was defective under the ICWA; and that, to the extent any of these issues are deemed forfeited, he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel. In two subsequent appeals, Rafael additionally disputes the propriety of the juvenile court\u2019s April 2014 and October 2014 permanent plan orders maintaining the minors in long-term foster care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Although the juvenile court failed to promptly investigate and confirm Rafael\u2019s Indian custodian status in this matter, we conclude that any errors in that regard were harmless under the specific facts of this case. In particular, we find that the mother (mother) revoked Rafael\u2019s Indian custodianship in January 2013, only three months after the commencement of these proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Seeing no error requiring reversal of any of the challenged findings and orders, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">L BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">A. <em>Status of the Indian Custodian</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Congress enacted the ICWA in 1978 \u201cin an effort to protect and preserve Indian tribes and their resources.\u201d <em>(In re G.L. </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 683, 690 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 356] (G.L.); see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901.) Specifically, the ICWA codifies \u201cthe policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture . . . .\u201d (25 U.SC. \u00a7 1902.) Thus, \u201c \u2018[t]he ICWA presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations, a most important resource.\u2019 \u201d <em>(iGuardianship of DM. </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 242, 249 [164 Cal.Rptr.3d 414] <em>(D.W.).) </em>In order to best effectuate these policies, the ICWA is construed in accordance with \u201cthe canon of construction that statutes enacted for the benefit of Indians are to be liberally construed to their benefit.\u201d (Guidelines for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed.Reg. 10146, 10150 (Feb. 25, 2015) (Guidelines); see also <em>In re Jack C. </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 967, 977 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 6] [the ICWA \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes and preferences\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">As stated above, the ICWA defines an Indian custodian as \u201cany Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian child under tribal law or custom or under State law or to whom temporary physical care, custody, and control has been transferred by the parent of such child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(6); see also Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.1, subd. (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [adopting the ICWA\u2019s definition of Indian custodian in California].) The Indian custodian concept was added to the ICWA \u201cto recognize and protect the practice of parents in many Indian communities who entrust their children temporarily to the care of extended family members and to mandate that such entrustment does not constitute abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>(Ted W. </em>v. <em>State of Alaska </em>(Alaska 2009) 204 P.3d 333, 338, fn. omitted <em>(Ted W.).) </em>As explained in the House report on the ICWA: \u201c[B]ecause of the extended family concept in the Indian community, parents often transfer physical custody of the Indian child to such extended family member on an informal basis, often for extended periods of time and at great distances from the parents. While such . . . custodian[s] may not have rights under State law, they do have rights under Indian custom which this bill seeks to protect, including the right to protect the parental interests of the parents.\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 95-1386, 2d Sess. (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 7530, 7543; see <em>G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Under the ICWA, an Indian custodian \u201cstands in the shoes of the parent and enjoys favored status.\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 692.) Thus, for instance, an Indian custodian \u2014 like a parent or the Indian child\u2019s tribe \u2014 is entitled to notice of any involuntary child welfare proceeding involving foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, the Indian child. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.2, subd. (a); rule 5.481(b).) Further, the Indian custodian has the right to intervene at any point in such a proceeding, and the notice provided must apprise the Indian custodian of that fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1911(c), 1912(a); \u00a7 224.2, subd. (a)(5)(G)(i); rule 5.482(e).) Additional rights afforded the Indian custodian include the right to court-appointed counsel if indigent and the right to an additional 20 days to prepare for the proceeding. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) &amp; (b); \u00a7 224.2, subd. (a)(5)(G)(iii) &amp; (v); rule 5.482(a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Moreover, before a minor subject to the ICWA can be placed in foster care, the court must make \u201ca determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e); see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 224.6, 361, subd. (c)(6), 361.7, subd. (c); rule 5.484(a).) And, finally, \u201c[a]ny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of ... an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d); \u00a7\u00a7 361, subd. (d), 361.7, subd. (a); rule 5.484(c).) With these statutory mandates in mind, we turn to the facts of this particular case and will review independently the issues of statutory interpretation raised. <em>(In re R.C. </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 741, 748 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 418]; cf. <em>Ted W., supra, </em>204 P.3d at p. 336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Here, mother executed a \u201cDesignation of Indian Custodian\u201d (Designation) on October 4, 2012, several days before the minors were taken into protective custody by the Mendocino County Health and Human Services Agency (Agency). The Designation was revocable by its express terms and transferred temporary care and custody of the minors to Rafael as their Indian custodian under the ICWA. The record in this case reveals that the Agency was made aware of the existence of the Designation on the same day that it was executed, when the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda ICWA Representative (ICWA Representative) told the social worker that mother and Rafael had stopped by her office and dropped off the signed document. The ICWA Representative, however, further informed the social worker that the tribe would not recognize the Designation because they were not involved with it and mother did not have an ICWA representative sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We disagree with the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda of Porno Indians (Clover-dale Rancher\u00eda) that the Designation executed by mother and Rafael in this case was insufficient to establish Rafael as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian. In fact, the statutory authority for designation of an Indian custodian does not even require a writing, and such temporary transfers to extended family are often done on an informal basis. <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 693.) We thus conclude that \u2014 as an Indian person \u201cto whom temporary physical care, custody, and control [had] been transferred by the parent\u201d \u2014 -Rafael became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>the Indian custodian of the minors for purposes of the ICWA on October 4, 2012. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Unfortunately, although the Agency was made aware of the Designation on the day it was executed, it did nothing to verify or implement its contents, perhaps relying on the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda\u2019s conclusion that the document was invalid. Moreover, the existence of the Designation was reported in the social worker\u2019s case notes attached to the Agency\u2019s October 12, 2012, detention summary. Yet neither the juvenile court nor any of the parties raised the issue of Rafael\u2019s status until Rafael finally provided the court with a copy of the Designation over four months later, on February 19, 2013. Under these circumstances, we believe it was error for the Agency and the juvenile court not to have inquired further with respect to the import of the Designation at the commencement of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">However, our review of the record further reveals that, on January 16, 2013, mother spoke with the social worker by telephone from her residential treatment center. During that conversation, mother told the social worker that she wanted her children to remain in foster care rather than being placed with Rafael because there were drugs at the house, Rafael did not have a car, and she did not want her children living with Rafael. Specifically, she stated: \u201c \u2018There are drugs on that property, and I want my kids safe, away from all of that, and the drugs.\u2019 \u201d Mother contacted the social worker from residential treatment a second time on February 4, 2013, reiterating her position and noting that \u201c \u2018living out there was a bad situation with me, and I don\u2019t want that for the kids.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Under strikingly similar circumstances, the Supreme Court of Alaska recently concluded that \u2014 by informing the child welfare agency of their opposition to their dependent children being placed in the Indian custodian\u2019s care \u2014 the parents acted to terminate the Indian custodianship. <em>(Molly O. v. State of Alaska </em>(Alaska 2014) 320 P.3d 303, 308-309 <em>(Molly </em>O.) [by telling the child welfare agency \u201cthat they did not want their children placed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>[the Indian custodian], [the parents] effectively informed [the child welfare agency] that any grant of physical care, custody, and control they may have earlier given [the Indian custodian] over their children no longer existed\u201d].) This makes sense as \u201cthe Indian caretaker\u2019s status as an Indian custodian is derived from the temporary transfer of care of the Indian child by the parent. But Congress did not provide in ICWA that the Indian custodian could usurp the parent\u2019s right to raise the child or prevent the parent from rescinding the Indian caretaker\u2019s designation as the child\u2019s Indian custodian.\u201d <em>(Ted W., supra, </em>204 P.3d at p. 338, fn. omitted; see <em>id. </em>at fn. 17 [noting that the ICWA does not place the Indian custodian\u2019s rights above those of the parents].) Instead, \u201c[t]he transfer of an Indian minor\u2019s care and custody to an Indian custodian is, by definition, \u2018temporary,\u2019 and thus revocable.\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 695.) Moreover, since the establishment and maintenance of an Indian custodianship is within the exclusive power of a parent and a parent may create such a custodianship on an informal basis, we see no reason why a parent may not also extinguish that status informally, without recourse to the courts or other recognized legal process. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(6); see <em>G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Further, courts in both California and Alaska have recognized a parent\u2019s authority to revoke an Indian custodianship despite the fact that a child welfare agency has intervened and taken over custody and control of the minors subject to that custodianship. As the Fourth District opined in <em>G.L.\\ </em>\u201cAt the time [mother] revoked [grandmother\u2019s] Indian custodian status, [mother\u2019s] parental rights remained intact and [mother] retained legal custody of G.L., even though she did not have physical custody of her. Thus, [mother] could properly revoke the transfer of G.L.\u2019s care and custody to [grandmother].\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 695; see also <em>Molly O., supra, </em>320 P.3d at pp. 305-309 [parents\u2019 objection to placing minor children with Indian custodian during child welfare proceedings operates to revoke Indian custodianship].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We find unavailing Rafael\u2019s attempts to distinguish this persuasive precedent because the revocations in the cited cases occurred prior to disposition. Although the juvenile court may remove a dependent minor from the <em>physical </em>custody of the parents at disposition pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 361, such parents retain many residual legal rights with respect to that child until those rights are formally terminated or otherwise curtailed. (\u00a7 361, subds. (a) &amp; (c); cf. <em>Ted W\u201e supra, </em>204 P.3d at p. 338 [\u201c[a]s long as their parental rights have not been terminated, parents retain legal custody of their children, affording them \u2018the responsibility for making major decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare\u2019 \u201d].) In fact, pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 361, while the juvenile court may limit the control exercised by a parent over a dependent child at and after disposition, any such order must \u201cclearly and specifically set forth all those limitations.\u201d For instance, any limitations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>the right of a parent to make educational decisions for a dependent minor must be \u201cspecifically addressed\u201d in a court order. <em>{Ibid.) </em>And, such \u201climitations may not exceed those necessary to protect the child.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Thus, while the juvenile court may have had the power to limit mother\u2019s right to revoke Rafael\u2019s Indian custodianship, it did not do so in this case. <em>(In re J.S. </em>(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 244] [\u201c[t]he mere existence of authority to direct a parent\u2019s conduct in relation to his or her child does not in and of itself constitute <em>exercise </em>of that authority, and does not translate to automatic limitations on the parent\u2019s general rights absent some specific direction or order\u201d].) Thus, mother retained the authority to revoke Rafael\u2019s special status under the ICWA despite the pendency of these proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In contrast, when, in the present case, mother indicated through counsel on February 26, 2013, that she wanted the Designation to remain in place, she was at that point without authority to reinstate the custodial relationship that she had revoked by her actions over the previous month. This is because, at both the detention hearing on October 12, 2012, and the dispositional hearing on January 8, 2013, the Agency was given the responsibility for placement and care of the minors by the juvenile court. The dispositional orders also formally placed the minors in the care, custody, and control of the Agency. Thus, mother no longer had the ability to informally transfer \u201ctemporary physical care, custody and control\u201d of the minors to any third party. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(6); see also <em>Molly O., supra, </em>320 P.3d at p. 309 [parent \u201cmay not create or recreate an Indian custodianship\u201d for an Indian child in the custody of a child welfare agency].) Instead, the task of determining placement in accordance with the placement preferences of the ICWA and California\u2019s dependency statutes fell on the shoulders of the Agency. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.31.) We thus agree wholeheartedly with Rafael\u2019s contention that once the Agency intervened, mother no longer had the legal authority to direct who had physical care, custody, and control of her children.  However, having successfully granted Rafael special status as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian under the ICWA prior to the removal of the minors by the Agency, we conclude that mother retained the power to extinguish that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that Rafael was the designated Indian custodian with respect to the minors only from October 4, 2012, through January 16, 2013. Indeed, an argument could be made that Rafael\u2019s Indian custodian status was even more limited. Although mother signed the Designation on October 4, 2012, the record is not clear that she actually transferred physical custody of the minors to Rafael at that time. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>the Agency, the minors were removed from the home of the maternal grandmother, where mother was living. Further, the record does not reflect which adult had actual physical custody of E.R. when mother and Rafael met with the social worker at the Agency on the date of removal, and mother stated at that time that she was the one who cared for the children. Thus, despite the execution of the Designation, mother may never have transferred temporary physical custody to Rafael in accordance with its terms. (Cf. <em>G.L., </em>supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 693 [parties do not dispute that G.L. was in the \u201cexclusive custody\u201d of the Indian custodian at the time she was taken into protective custody].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In addition, since an Indian custodian \u201cstands in the shoes of the parent\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 692), it is not certain whether or to what extent both a parent and an Indian custodian can be actively involved in a child welfare proceeding at the same time (cf. <em>Ted W., supra, </em>204 P.3d at p. 339, fn. 23 [identifying but not deciding the issue]). Thus, mother\u2019s actions in taking a dominant role in these proceedings and accepting reunification services \u2014 presumably with the intent to herself reunify with the minors \u2014 may also have been sufficient to revoke Rafael\u2019s designation as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian. On the other hand, we note that the interpretation of the circumstances in this case that is most favorable to Rafael and the possible preservation of the Indian family is that the minors\u2019 Indian family included both mother <em>and </em>Rafael. Ultimately, we need not decide this issue, but will presume that mother and Rafael could simultaneously possess some form of custodial rights to the minors, at least until mother clearly revoked those rights with respect to Rafael on January 16, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">B. <em>Notice Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">With these conclusions in mind, we consider first Rafael\u2019s claim that this matter must be reversed and remanded for reconsideration of the juvenile court\u2019s September 4, 2013, placement decision because the Agency failed to give him the formal notice of these proceedings that was his due as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian. As mentioned previously, the ICWA\u2019s notice requirement provides: \u201cIn any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or <em>Indian custodian </em>and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. ... No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or <em>Indian custodian </em>and the tribe . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a), italics added; see also Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.2, subd. (a); Guidelines, 80 Fed.Reg., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 10153-10154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>While the express language of the ICWA quoted above mandates notice to the parent <em>or </em>Indian custodian, both the federal Guidelines and California law provide for notice to the parent <em>and </em>the Indian custodian. (\u00a7 224.2, subd. (a); see Guidelines, 80 Fed.Reg., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 10153-10154.) Clearly, in this case, Rafael had actual notice of the proceedings, being present at the removal of the minors and at many of the early hearings in this matter. However, it is undisputed that the Agency failed to provide the statutorily required ICWA notice to him as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian and that, as a result, he did not receive a court-appointed attorney or participate as a party in the proceedings until February 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">A notice violation under the ICWA, however, \u201cis not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense, but instead is subject to a harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 695-696 [listing cases].) Thus, in order to obtain a reversal for lack of proper ICWA notice, an appellant \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that he or she would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of the error.\u201d (G.L., at p. 696.) Here, Rafael was entitled to the statutory ICWA notice from the minor\u2019s removal in October 2012 until his Indian custodianship was revoked by mother on January 16, 2013. (See <em>G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 695 [notice provisions of the ICWA no longer apply to the Indian custodian once the custodianship was revoked].) Under the unique facts of this case, we conclude that the Agency\u2019s failure to provide the mandated notice to Rafael during this time period was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Specifically, during the timeframe at issue \u2014 October 9, 2012, through January 16, 2013 \u2014 the juvenile court held three hearings in this matter: the October 12, 2012, detention hearing, the November 14, 2012, jurisdictional hearing, and mother\u2019s January 8, 2013, dispositional hearing. Even if Rafael had received ICWA notice, intervened, and had counsel appointed prior to the detention hearing, we see no probability, let alone a reasonable one, that the minors would have remained placed with him. The minors were removed from the property where both mother and Rafael lived after suffering significant neglect. The Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda was, from the start, opposed to placement with Rafael. And it was apparent to the Agency that Rafael suffered from some kind of cognitive deficit that required assessment. Under such circumstances, the evidence supporting temporary detention of the minors was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Similarly, significant and uncontested evidence supported the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional finding that mother\u2019s substance abuse placed the minors at substantial risk of harm. Indeed, mother admitted that she had been using methamphetamine since she was 12 years old and indicated at the November 2012 jurisdictional hearing that she wanted to enter drug treatment and \u201cget her life back on track.\u201d Since dependency jurisdiction is taken over children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>rather than parents, the allegations regarding mother\u2019s substance abuse and neglect of the minors were sufficient to support jurisdiction in this case. <em>(In re I.A. </em>(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1491 [134 Cal.Rptr.3d 441]; <em>In re Alysha S. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 393, 397 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 494].) In particular, it was unnecessary that any additional allegations regarding Rafael be expressly asserted or proved. (See <em>In re Briana V. </em>(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 297, 311 [186 Cal.Rptr.3d 397].) Given these facts, we find no reasonable probability that Rafael\u2019s intervention and participation through counsel at the jurisdictional hearing would have changed its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In truth, the real crux of Rafael\u2019s complaint in this matter has always been his desire to regain custody of the minors, with adequate tribal and Agency services in place to support that placement. Although Rafael did not participate as a party in the portion of the dispositional hearing which impacted mother\u2019s custodial status and reunification services, the question of his custodial rights and entitlement to services was, as we discuss further below, exhaustively considered at the September 2013 placement hearing in this matter, where Rafael was an active participant represented by counsel. Thus, again, we find any failure to provide early ICWA notice in these proceedings harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we are influenced by two additional factors. First, this is not a case where the juvenile court ignored the minors\u2019 Indian heritage or deprived the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda of the right to participate in the proceedings. In fact, other than failing to recognize Rafael\u2019s Indian custodian status in the early stages of the case, the proceedings were conducted in accordance with the ICWA, the court properly applied the ICWA\u2019s substantive provisions, and placement of the minors with Rafael was denied in accordance with the request of the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda. (Cf. <em>G.L., </em>supra, <em>111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 696.) In addition, we cannot ignore the current procedural posture of this case, in which Rafael\u2019s Indian custodianship rights have long been extinguished. Under such circumstances, \u201ceven a conditional reversal and remand for further ICWA notice would be futile, \u2018an empty formality and a waste of ever-more-scarce judicial resources.\u2019 \u201d (Cf. <em>G.L., </em>at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">C. <em>Other Compliance Issues Under the ICWA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Rafael also argues that the juvenile court\u2019s September 2013 placement decision must be reversed because the Agency failed to make active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family as required by the ICWA. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).) Although the juvenile court did make an active efforts finding at mother\u2019s dispositional hearing in January 2013 \u2014 which it referenced at the September hearing \u2014 Rafael argues that active efforts specific to him as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian were required before the Agency could lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>remove the minors from his custody. In addition, Rafael faults the juvenile court for failing to make an appropriate detriment finding under the ICWA before formally removing the minors from his custody at the conclusion of the placement hearing. As stated above, before a minor subject to the ICWA can be placed in foster care, the court must make \u201ca determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e).) Although the juvenile court did make a detriment finding at the September 2013 hearing, Rafael argues that the standard used by the court differed from that required by the ICWA and was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Indubitably, had Rafael remained the minors\u2019 designated Indian custodian, the September 2013 placement hearing would have essentially acted as a dispositional hearing with respect to Rafael, where both an active efforts and a detriment finding would have been required under California and federal law. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) &amp; (e); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 224.6, \u00a7 361, subds. (c)(6) &amp; (d), 361.7, subds. (a) &amp; (c); rule 5.484(a) &amp; (c).) However, since we have concluded that Rafael\u2019s status as the minors\u2019 Indian custodian was revoked months earlier, in January 2013, no such findings were necessary at the placement hearing. We therefore need not determine whether the findings actually made by the juvenile court would otherwise have been sufficient under the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Instead, as it turns out, what Rafael was really seeking at the September 2013 hearing was a preferred placement as an extended family member under the ICWA. \u201cICWA provides placement preferences and standards to be followed in foster care placements of Indian children.\u201d <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 697.) As is relevant here, \u201cabsen[t] . . . good cause to the contrary,\u201d preference for the placement of an Indian child pursuant to the ICWA must first be given to \u201ca member of the Indian child\u2019s extended family\u201d such as Rafael. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).) The Guidelines provide a number of factors to be considered in deciding whether good cause exists to diverge from the ICWA\u2019s statutory placement preferences, including (1) the request of the biological parents; (2) the request of the child; and (3) the extraordinary physical and emotional needs of the child as established by the testimony of a qualified expert witness. (Guidelines, 80 Fed.Reg., <em>supra, </em>at p. 10158.) We review a juvenile court\u2019s decision to deviate from the ICWA\u2019s placement preferences for substantial evidence. <em>(G.L., supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 697.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In the present case, as our detailed review of the record in the unpublished portion of this opinion makes clear, the evidence was compelling that good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>cause existed to forgo placement of these special needs children with Rafael.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> First, the Cloverdale Rancher\u00eda, mother, the Agency, and the attorney for the minors \u2014 essentially everyone other than Rafael, himself\u2014 was opposed to Rafael obtaining custody of the children. In addition, the detailed report prepared by Dr. Singer, along with her testimony at the hearing, provided strong evidence that Rafael could not effectively parent these minors due to his significant cognitive deficits. The record also extensively chronicled the numerous and varied developmental and psychological issues faced by the children as a result of the neglect they suffered prior to their removal by the Agency. Both the juvenile court and Dr. Singer recognized that the minors would need strong and structured parenting in order to have the best chance at overcoming these early deficits, parenting that Rafael was unable to provide. Moreover, although Rafael provided evidence of his past involvement in the minors\u2019 upbringing and argued that he had proved his ability to care for them \u201cby the fact that I cared for them very well in the past,\u201d the juvenile court concluded just the opposite, stating: \u201cIn a way, I think it\u2019s one of those proof-is-in-the-pudding things. The four children are doing very badly. To the extent that [Rafael] has been involved in their nurturing, it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d Although we have no doubt that Rafael loves the children and is devoted to them, we find this determination, and the juvenile court\u2019s resulting placement decision, manifestly supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In sum, Rafael has identified no error requiring reversal of the juvenile court\u2019s September 2013 decision denying him placement of the minors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">D. <em>Permanent Plan Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">In his two later appeals, Rafael disputes the propriety of the juvenile court\u2019s April 2014 and October 2014 permanent plan orders maintaining the minors in long-term foster care and regulating visitation between Rafael and the children. Specifically, he first contends that, if this court reverses the juvenile court\u2019s September 2013 placement decision due to the ICWA violations identified in his earlier appeal, we must also reverse the later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>permanent plan and visitation orders made with respect to the minors. He also argues that the permanent placement of the four minors in long-term foster care is not \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d because he stands ready, willing, and able to take custody of all four children with the assistance mandated by the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Given the conclusions reached in this opinion, Rafael\u2019s first argument necessarily fails. With respect to the appropriateness of the minors\u2019 permanent plans, we note that Rafael did not raise this issue in the juvenile court, and we may therefore deem it forfeited. (See <em>In re Dakota S. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 494, 502 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 196] [listing cases]; <em>In re Lorenzo C. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1330, 1339 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 562].) More fundamentally, however, \u201c[o]nce an Indian custodian\u2019s status has been revoked, that person has no role in ongoing child protection proceedings.\u201d <em>(Molly O., supra, </em>320 P.3d at p. 309; see <em>G.L., supra, </em>177 Cal.App.4th at p. 695 [holding that the notice provisions of the ICWA no longer applied to the Indian custodian once the custodianship was revoked].) Of course, Rafael can continue to appear in the juvenile court and request visitation with the minors as an interested relative. And, indeed, the juvenile court seems very aware that Rafael is important to these minors and should remain in their lives in some capacity. Rafael, however, is no longer a party to these proceedings and therefore cannot contest the selection and maintenance of the minors\u2019 permanent plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The juvenile court\u2019s September 4, 2013, order denying placement of the minors with Rafael is affirmed. So too are the court\u2019s April 2014 and October 2014 permanent plan orders.</p>\n<judges id=\"b730-8\">Ruvolo, P.

Indeed, they were corroborated by mother\u2019s own counsel, who stated at the February 19 hearing: \u201cI spoke with my client on the 15th just last week, and she indicated to me that she no longer supports placement with her brother and she wants to see the children remain where they are. So I am withdrawing my request for placement with the uncle at this time.\u201d In determining the legal significance of these statements under the ICWA, we are not, as Rafael suggests, engaged in impermissible appellate factfinding. Rather, we are drawing a legal conclusion from substantial evidence already before us in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> Given the facts of this case, we need not reach the issue of whether mother could have revoked Rafael\u2019s Indian custodianship over the Agency\u2019s, or the juvenile court\u2019s, objection.
