J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq2l\">Nicole H. admitted an allegation that she committed an assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4)). On appeal, she contends the juvenile court erred in placing her at a California facility far from her father\u2019s home, in imposing an electronics search probation condition, and in failing to designate a maximum time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>confinement. In the published portion of this opinion we uphold the decision to remove appellant from her home, but conclude no substantial evidence justified the court\u2019s distant placement of her. We reverse and remand with instructions that the court reconsider that placement. In the unpublished portion we remand for the trial court to modify the search condition and specify the maximum time of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In May 2014, the Contra Costa County District Attorney\u2019s Office filed a juvenile wardship petition (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that appellant committed an assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4)). In September, appellant admitted the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In October 2014, following a contested dispositional hearing, the juvenile court adjudged appellant a ward of the court and ordered that she be removed from her father\u2019s custody and detained in juvenile hall pending placement. The court\u2019s oral and written orders suggested that the probation office consider two placements, Environmental Alternatives and the Children\u2019s Home of Stockton. The court also imposed a number of probation conditions, including a condition permitting searches of appellant\u2019s cell phone and other electronic devices. In November, appellant was placed at the Warner Mountains Group Home. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">On our own motion, we take judicial notice of the facts that (1) Environmental Alternatives is in the City of Tracy; (2) the Children\u2019s Home of Stockton is in the city of Stockton; (3) both cities are in San Joaquin County, which is the county directly east of Contra Costa County; (4) the distance between Stockton and appellant\u2019s father\u2019s home in Oakley is approximately 40 miles; and (5) the distance between Tracy and Oakley is approximately 30 miles. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (h); <em>People v. Posey </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 193, 215, fn. 9 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 551, 82 P.3d 755] <em>(Posey).) </em>In addition, on our own motion, we take judicial notice of the facts that (1) the Warner Mountains Group Home is in Canby, California; (2) Canby is in Modoc County, just south of the Oregon border; and (3) the distance between the group home in Canby and appellant\u2019s father\u2019s home in Oakley is approximately 340 miles. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (h); <em>Posey, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 215, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">On the afternoon of January 22, 2014, appellant arranged for a friend to lure the victim, E.Y., to Heron Park in Brentwood. Appellant and the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>were having a conflict due to a statement made by E.Y. that appellant perceived as a threat, and due to rumors E.Y. had spread about appellant. A school official obtained from an anonymous student a video depicting the events at the park on January 22; the video had been uploaded to a smartphone messaging application and had circulated at school. The video showed an attack on E.Y. by four females, including appellant. One grabbed E.Y. by the hair, struck her repeatedly, and slammed her head on the ground several times. Appellant hit E.Y. more than 11 times, then kneeled on E.Y., who was on the ground. Appellant then \u201cwildly\u201d struck at E.Y. and then kicked the victim. The third and fourth assailants also repeatedly struck E.Y. before the group left.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Appellant admitted her involvement but blamed others for arranging the assault. She said she gave her phone to another individual to record the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">I. <em>The Juvenile Court\u2019s Placement Decision Was an Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Appellant contends the juvenile court erred in placing her at an in-state, out-of-home placement many hours away from her father\u2019s home. We review the court\u2019s placement decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Antoine D. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1314, 1320 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 885].) We review the court\u2019s findings for substantial evidence, and \u201c \u2018[a] trial court abuses its discretion when the factual findings critical to its decision find no support in the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Khalid B. </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1288 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 427] <em>(Khalid B.).) </em>\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018In determining whether there was substantial evidence to support the commitment, we must examine the record presented at the disposition hearing in light of the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the juvenile court law is \u2018to provide for the protection and safety of the public and each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and to preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible, removing the minor from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public. If removal of a minor is determined by the juvenile court to be necessary, reunification of the minor with his or her family shall be a primary objective. If the minor is removed from his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure for the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents.\u2019 (\u00a7 202, subd. (a).) \u2018Minors under the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction must receive the care, treatment, and guidance consistent with their best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>interest and the best interest of the public. (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).) Additionally, minors who have committed crimes must receive the care, treatment, and guidance that holds them accountable for their behavior, is appropriate for their circumstances, and conforms with the interest of public safety and protection. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This guidance may include punishment that is consistent with the rehabilitative objectives. <em>(Ibid.)\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Khalid B., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.4th at p. 1288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">At the dispositional hearing, appellant objected to an out-of-home placement. She argued this was her first arrest, and referred the court to October 2014 letters from teachers and administrators at her high school stating that her behavior and academic performance had been excellent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s father testified regarding the discipline he imposed after the assault and appellant\u2019s good behavior since the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Using an assessment tool, the probation department determined that appellant was at low risk for re-offense. Nevertheless, the department recommended an out-of-home placement based on the nature of the offense, appellant\u2019s lack of remorse, and her need for intensive counseling in a \u201cstructured and therapeutic environment.\u201d In removing appellant from her father\u2019s custody, the juvenile court emphasized appellant\u2019s role in the \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d assault on the victim. The court also emphasized that appellant denied feeling remorse and showed no emotion when probation showed her the video of the assault. The court stated, \u201cAnd the fact that [appellant] had no look on her face while watching [the video], I don\u2019t understand. And it does show a complete void; something has happened along the way to cut off that ability to empathize, to feel remorse, to be ashamed. [\u00b6] I really think, [appellant], that there is something that needs to be addressed.\u201d The court also said it believed appellant\u2019s lack of empathy meant she posed a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Appellant first argues the evidence does not support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that her welfare required that custody be taken from her father. (\u00a7 726, subd. (a)(3).) We disagree. The juvenile court could reasonably infer from the nature of the attack and appellant\u2019s lack of remorse that she was a danger to the community and required treatment in a structured setting. The juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in removing appellant from her father\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">On the other hand, nothing in the record supported placing appellant at an institution many hours away from her home. \u201cAlthough public safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>and the rehabilitation of the minor (presumed to serve the best interests of the delinquent minor) are the preeminent goals of the juvenile law relating to delinquent minors, it is also true that family reunification and the reintegration of the minor into his family are statutorily recognized to be important and complementary goals.\u201d <em>(In re James R. </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 413, 434 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 824].) Thus, while section 727, subdivision (a), authorizes a juvenile court that adjudges a minor a ward of the court under section 602 to \u201cmake any reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the minor,\u201d section 727.1 specifies various criteria the court must consider in making an out-of-home placement, including proximity of the placement to the minor\u2019s parent\u2019s home. In particular, section 727.1, former subdivision (a), in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s placement, provided, \u201c[w]hen the court orders the care, custody, and control of the minor to be under the supervision of the probation officer for foster care placement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 727, the decision regarding choice of placement shall be based upon selection of a safe setting that is the least restrictive or most family like, and the most appropriate setting that is available <em>and in close proximity to the parent\u2019s home</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>consistent with the selection of the environment best suited to meet the minor\u2019s special needs and best interests.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added; see also <em>James R., </em>at p. 432 [\u00a7 727.1 \u201cillustrate[s] the importance of the family connection in the care and rehabilitation of the minor\u201d].) Furthermore, former section 706.6, which specified information to be included in a case plan when foster care is recommended (see \u00a7 706.5), provided, \u201c[a]n appropriate placement is a placement in the least restrictive, most family-like environment <em>in closest proximity to the minor\u2019s </em>home, that meets the minor\u2019s best interests and special needs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 706.6, former subd. (c), italics added.)  Thus, at the time of appellant\u2019s placement, and currently, sections 727.1 and 706.6 expressly require the juvenile court to consider the nearness of the placement to the minor\u2019s home, in order to achieve the goals of family reunification and rehabilitation. Nevertheless, a minor\u2019s special needs and best interests may justify a distant placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>The record is devoid of any evidence or reasoning supporting a group home placement far from appellant\u2019s father\u2019s home. At an October 28, 2014 dispositional hearing before Judge Rebecca Hardie, the juvenile court rejected appellant\u2019s plea to be placed on probation in her father\u2019s home and recommended that the probation department consider \u201cEnvironmental Alternatives\u201d and \u201cChildren\u2019s Home of Stockton\u201d as \u201cpotential placements]\u201d for appellant. In an attempt to reassure appellant and her family, the court stated, \u201cAnd I want everyone to understand that placement is a place to get really intensive therapy, not only for you, Nicole, but for the family. And they encourage the family to participate. You earn weekend passes home.\u201d At a review hearing on November 13, again before Judge Hardie, the court noted, \u201cI see that a referral has been sent to Environmental Alternatives as well as Children\u2019s Home of Stockton and that probation is awaiting response.\u201d The referral notice also stated a referral had been sent to Warner Mountains Group Home, but the juvenile court did not reference that referral.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">On November 20, 2014, appellant was placed at and transported to Warner Mountains Group Home. A review hearing took place on November 26, but this time before Judge Lois Haight. The juvenile court noted appellant had been transported to Warner Mountains Group Home,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> commenting that it was a \u201cterrific\u201d placement and \u201cI did an unannounced visit up there, and, let me tell you, if you are going to do an unannounced visit to a place that\u2019s seven or eight hours away, you stay a long time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel noted the placement was \u201ca little bit of a change of circumstance for my client\u2019s father,\u201d in light of the juvenile court\u2019s prior directive that he have counseling with appellant on a weekly basis. Counsel requested that the court modify that order to specify monthly counseling or phone counseling \u201cto accommodate the distance now.\u201d Judge Haight responded, \u201cYou know, I was not the judge that did this. I feel uncomfortable modifying another judge\u2019s orders.\u201d Nevertheless, the court authorized monthly telephonic counseling. Judge Haight also asked whether Judge Hardie was aware Warner Mountains Group Home was under consideration. Counsel stated they had actually been anticipating a placement in Stockton. Judge Haight acknowledged that, and indicated she would let Judge Hardie know she had modified the counseling requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">As is evident from the above description of the proceedings, Judge Hardie seemed to anticipate a placement in Stockton or Tracy, and certainly made no express finding that a remote placement in Canby met \u201cthe minor\u2019s special needs and best interests.\u201d (\u00a7 727.1.) Neither did Judge Haight make any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>determination; that is, she was not asked to and did not consider the appropriateness of appellant\u2019s placement in light of the evidence in the record. Furthermore, the probation officer\u2019s report and recommendation prepared for the October 2014 dispositional hearing made a strong case for out-of-home placement, but did not provide any reasons why a placement at Warner Mountains Group Home would be in appellant\u2019s best interests. According to the report, \u201cWardship with out-of-home placement is the appropriate response to the issues the minor and her family present. . . . The minor appears to be affected by her mother,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and Nicole will need ongoing therapy in order to address the hardships she dealt with when she was residing with her mother. The minor\u2019s father seems to be an appropriate parental figure and certainly has made efforts to obtain services for his daughter. Nonetheless, the minor would benefit from a structured and therapeutic environment such as out-of-home placement to fully identify and address her underlying issues, cognitive distortions, the stressors in her life, her relationship with her mother, and her use of violence to resolve conflict. In a residential placement setting, the minor will attend school regularly, and receive proper guidance and intensive therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">On appeal, the People argue the placement was beneficial because it took appellant away from \u201cnegative influences.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, there is no evidence in the record supporting that assertion. There is no evidence that appellant was being subjected to ongoing negative influences at home, and, even if there were such evidence, there is no indication the probation department or the juvenile court believed a placement further away than Stockton or Tracy was necessary to remove appellant from whatever negative influences existed in Oakley.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the juvenile court and the probation officer\u2019s report agreed on the importance of fostering the relationship between appellant and her father, which the Warner Mountains Group Home placement made considerably more difficult. Indeed, Judge Hardie sought to support appellant\u2019s relationship with her father by directing the father to engage in weekly therapy with appellant, but that order became effectively impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>implement when appellant was sent to Canby. Accordingly, the People have not shown that any evidence in the present record supported a determination the Warner Mountains Group Home placement was in appellant\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Case law addressing the placement of juveniles at the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ; formerly the California Youth Authority) is instructive. \u201c[T]he statutory scheme contemplates a progressively more restrictive and punitive series of dispositions starting with home placement under supervision, and progressing to foster home placement, placement in a local treatment facility, and finally placement at the DJJ\u201d or California Youth Authority. <em>(In re M.S. </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1250 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 273].) Nevertheless, there is no rule that such a placement cannot be ordered unless less restrictive placements have been attempted, and there is no requirement that the juvenile court expressly state on the record the reasons for rejecting less restrictive placements. <em>(.Ibid., In re Teofilio A. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 571, 577 [258 Cal.Rptr. 540] <em>(Teofilio </em>A.); see also <em>In re Ricky H. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 176, 184 [178 Cal.Rptr. 324, 636 P.2d 13] [although juvenile court failed to articulate reasons for California Youth Authority commitment, evidence in the record showed that \u201cthe purposes of the Juvenile Court Law could not be accomplished by\u201d a less restrictive placement (fn. omitted)].) Rather, \u201cif there is evidence in the record to show a consideration of less restrictive placements was before the court, the fact the judge does not state on the record his consideration of those alternatives and reasons for rejecting them will not result in a reversal.\u201d <em>(Teofilio A., </em>at p. 577.) On the other hand, \u201cthere must be some evidence to support the judge\u2019s implied determination that he sub silentio considered and rejected reasonable alternative dispositions.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, <em>In re Angela M. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1396 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 809].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the present case, as noted previously (fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>there is some basis to conclude Judge Hardie considered the Warner Mountains Group Home placement, because the probation department informed her of its referral. However, any implied finding that the placement was in appellant\u2019s best interests is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In summary, appellant was placed at Warner Mountains Group Home without any evidence in the record that the placement was in her best interests despite the lack of proximity to her father\u2019s home. This was contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>to former and current sections 727.1 and 706.6, and requires that this court reverse and remand for reconsideration of the placement in light of the statutory directives.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The juvenile court\u2019s dispositional order is reversed. The matter is remanded with directions that the juvenile court reconsider appellant\u2019s placement, taking into consideration the statutory preference for a placement proximate to her father\u2019s home; modify the electronics search probation condition consistent with this decision; and specify the maximum time in confinement and the maximum remaining time in confinement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b962-8\">Needham, J., and Bruiniers, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-11\"> All undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b955-12\"> This factual summary is based on the probation officer\u2019s report to the juvenile court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-9\"> Following appellant\u2019s arrest, she spent three days in juvenile hall before being released to her father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b958-5\"> Section 727.1 was amended effective January 1, 2016 (Stats. 2015, ch. 773, \u00a7 51), and the section now refers to \u201cproximity\u201d rather than \u201cclose proximity.\u201d Section 706.6, which specifies information to be included in a case plan, was also amended, but continues to refer to \u201cclosest proximity.\u201d (\u00a7 706.6, subd.
