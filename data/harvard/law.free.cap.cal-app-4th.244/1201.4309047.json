(Picerne) agreed to build an apartment complex for Castellino Villas, A K.F. LLC (Castellino). After construction started, Castellino refinanced the property, replacing the original lender with Bank of the West. Picerne subsequently claimed money due, recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien, and brought this action against Castellino and Bank of the West to foreclose on the lien. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Picerne.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Castellino now contends (1) Picerne does not have a valid mechanic\u2019s lien because it did not record its claim within 90 days after substantial completion of the project; (2) the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents Picerne from taking contrary positions at arbitration and at trial; (3) Picerne did not timely record a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien as to nine distinct buildings within the project; and (4) the trial court erred in calculating the amount of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">Bank of the West agrees that Picerne failed to timely record its claim of mechanic\u2019s lien. In addition, Bank of the West contends (5) that Picerne\u2019s complaint against it is time-barred because Picerne did not name Bank of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>West as a defendant in the original complaint even though it was aware of facts indicating it had a claim against the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">We conclude (1) Picerne timely recorded its mechanic\u2019s lien; (2) Castellino fails to demonstrate the applicability of judicial estoppel; (3) the property constituted one residential unit; (4) the trial court overstated the principal sum due and failed to subtract the $115,453.50 setoff from the principal sum, but the other claims of error with regard to the lien amount have no merit; and (5) the action against Bank of the West is not time-barred because Picerne timely substituted Bank of the West in place of a Doe defendant when Picerne learned of the bank\u2019s interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We will modify the judgment to provide that the mechanic\u2019s lien is in the amount of $2,416,855.06 and affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Castellino and Picerne entered into an agreement in which Picerne would build an apartment complex called Castellino Villas at Laguna West (project or property) in the City of Elk Grove (the City). The project consisted of 11 apartment buildings, separate garages, a clubhouse, and other facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Erich Kopple and John Olsen were the owner\u2019s representatives for the project. Aaron Schein was in charge of the project for Picerne. Picerne employee Scott Wiggins was the assistant superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The City issued certificates of occupancy for the 11 buildings within the project in 2006, after a city inspector conducted a final inspection of each building. The first certificates of occupancy were issued on May 3, 2006. The final certificate of occupancy was issued on July 25, 2006. Castellino did not release the project retention proceeds, which was 10 percent of each progress payment, to Picerne when the City issued the certificates of occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Picerne employees and subcontractors continued to perform work at the project after July 25, 2006, and after Picerne removed its trailer from the jobsite. Superintendent\u2019s daily job reports maintained by Picerne employees showed that work was performed at the project after July 25, 2006. Wiggins worked at the project the entire month of August 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Olsen signed a document accepting building numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6 through 11 for Castellino on August 28, 2006. At that time, Wiggins created a punch list of work still to be completed. The punch list included work within the original scope of Picerne\u2019s contract with Castellino, such as the installation of grip tape on stair treads. The plans for the project called for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>installation of \u201ccontrasting color warning stripe\u201d on all concrete stair treads. \u201cContrasting color warning stripe,\u201d also known as grip tape, is an anti-slip tape applied to a stair tread and is required for safety purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Olsen signed a document titled \u201cOwner\u2019s Acceptance of Site\u201d for Castellino on September 8, 2006. As of that date, work on building numbers 2 and 5 had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Kopple testified Olsen was a \u201cmaintenance person\u201d who did not have authority to sign any acceptance for Castellino. But the trial court found Kopple\u2019s denial not credible. The trial court credited Wiggins\u2019s testimony that Olsen was authorized to sign the owner\u2019s acceptance for Castellino. Wiggins testified Olsen placed a telephone call to Kopple to discuss the \u201cOwner\u2019s Acceptance of Site.\u201d And Olsen told Wiggins that Kopple gave Olsen permission to sign the acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Although Castellino had accepted the site, grip tape had not been installed on all the stair treads at the project. An installer employed by Picerne\u2019s stairway subcontractor installed grip tape on every staircase of every building at the project on September 15, 18, and 19, 2006. The installer worked a total of 22 and a half hours on those dates to accomplish that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Picerne\u2019s roofing subcontractor also performed roofing work at the project after July 25, 2006. That work included installing ridges, rakes, and hips, waterproofing roof penetrations, and straightening out some of the valleys in the roofs. Some of that work was within the original scope of the subcontractor\u2019s contract and was not repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Castellino began renting apartments at the property in October 2006. There were no tenants at the property prior to that time. Picerne asked Castellino to release the project retention proceeds in October 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Picerne recorded a claim, of mechanic\u2019s lien on November 28, 2006. Picerne\u2019s claim included the amounts owed to its subcontractors, Teichert &amp; Son, Inc. (Teichert), American Automatic Fire Protection, Inc., Contractors Door and Millwork, Inc., Hemington Landscape Services, Inc., and Mitchell Jones Concrete, Inc., each of whom separately recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien claim against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Picerne filed a complaint to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s lien on December 29, 2006. The complaint named Castellino and Doe defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Castellino recorded a notice of completion for the project on April 30, 2007. The notice stated the project was completed on April 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>The action was stayed in the trial court to permit Castellino and Picerne to arbitrate their claims and counterclaims, in accordance with the terms of their contract. The arbitration included the parties\u2019 claims relating to Siena Villas Apartments, an apartment complex project for which Picerne entered into a contract with Campbell Comers Limited Partnership I (Campbell), an entity which was related to Castellino. The arbitrator awarded Picerne damages in the amount of $2,484,105.20 on the two projects, and over $1.5 million in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The trial court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award and gave Picerne an additional $144,836.15 in prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">Castellino and Campbell then filed separate petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Castellino, Campbell, and other parties entered into a settlement agreement with Picerne on August 13, 2010. The settlement agreement provided for the payment of the mechanic\u2019s lien claims by subcontractors Teichert, American Automatic Fire Protection, Inc., Contractors Door and Millwork, Inc., Hemington Landscape Services, Inc., and Mitchell Jones Concrete, Inc., and the reduction of Picerne\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim in the amount of any settlement payments made to the subcontractors. American Automatic Fire Protection, Inc., Contractors Door and Millwork, Inc., Hemington Landscape Services, Inc., and Mitchell Jones Concrete, Inc., received settlement payments for their lien claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The settlement agreement further provided that the trial court would decide the validity, priority, and amount of Picerne\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien. If the trial court determined Picerne\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien was valid and senior to any interest of Bank of the West, Picerne would receive a cash payment equivalent to 18 percent of the amount of its lien and then monthly installment payments, including interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum, for the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Shortly after the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, the bankruptcy court confirmed Castellino\u2019s plan of reorganization, which incorporated the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Picerne\u2019s foreclosure action against Castellino and Bank of the West was then tried by the trial court, sitting without a jury. The trial court issued a statement of decision. It determined the project was completed no earlier than September 8, 2006; Picerne timely recorded its claim of mechanic\u2019s lien; Picerne is entitled to foreclose its lien in the amount of $2,562,308.56; and the lien is senior in priority to the deed of trust in favor of Bank of the West. The trial court ordered Picerne\u2019s lien foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>The trial court entered a judgment and decree of mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure. Castellino and Bank of the West appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Castellino and Bank of the West contend Picerne does not have a valid mechanic\u2019s lien because Picerne did not record a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien within 90 days after substantial completion of the project, as required under Civil Code former section 3115.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">We begin by describing our standards for review of this issue. The interpretation of former section 3115 is a question of law which we independently review. <em>(Moorefield Construction, Inc. v. Intervest-Mortgage Investment Co. </em>(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 146, 154 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 709] <em>(Moorefield </em>Construction).) We follow well-settled rules of statutory construction. Our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute. <em>(T.O. IX, LLC v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 140, 145-146 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 602] <em>(T.O. IX, LLC).) </em>We begin by looking at the words of the statute. <em>(Tesco Controls, Inc. v. Monterey Mechanical Co. </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 780, 792 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 751] <em>(Tesco Controls, Inc.).) </em>We also look at the entire statutory scheme of which the subject provision is a part in order to determine legislative intent. <em>(T.O. IX, LLC, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at pp. 145-146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The determination of the date of completion of a work of improvement is a question of fact. <em>(Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne v. Summit Ridge Estates, Inc. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 347, 357 [59 Cal.Rptr. 587] <em>(Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne).) </em>We review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>(Moorefield Construction, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.4th at p. 154.) Substantial evidence is evidence \u201cof ponderable legal significance, . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\u201d <em>(Bowers </em>v. <em>Bernards </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873 [197 Cal.Rptr. 925], italics omitted.) As appellants, Castellino and Bank of the West bear the burden of demonstrating there is no substantial evidence to support a challenged factual finding. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. v. Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings presumes that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. v. Fallon, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 875, 881.) We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving that party the benefit of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in the evidence in support of the judgment. (As <em>You Sow v. Conbraco Industries </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 431, 454 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 399].) We do not reweigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom. <em>(Leff v. Gunter </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 508, 518 [189 Cal.Rptr. 377, 658 P.2d 740].) If substantial evidence exists, it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence or drawing other reasonable inferences might have reached a contrary conclusion. (B<em>owers v. Bernards, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at pp. 873-874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">We next turn to an overview of California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law. The California Constitution recognizes the right of laborers and material suppliers to have a lien for the value of labor done and materials furnished against the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished materials. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 3; <em>English v. Olympic Auditorium, Inc. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 631, 638 [20 P.2d 946] [formerly Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 15].) The California Legislature enacted a mechanic\u2019s lien statute to protect laborers, material suppliers, and contractors. (Stats. 1850, ch. 87,\u00a7\u00a7 1-14, pp. 211-213; <em>Betancourt v. Storke Housing Investors </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1157, 1166 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 259, 82 P.3d 286] <em>(Betancourt)) </em>Effective July 1, 2012, California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute is found in sections 8000 through 9566. (Stats. 2010, ch. 697, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 20.) But the version of the statute applicable to this case is found in former sections 3082 through 3267. (\u00a7 8052.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The mechanic\u2019s lien statute is concerned with the property owner\u2019s interest in clear and marketable title. <em>(Moorefield Construction, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.4th at p. 155; <em>T.O. IX, EEC, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.4th at p. 146; <em>Coast Central Credit Union </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 703, 708, 711 [257 Cal.Rptr. 468] <em>(Coast Central Credit Union)) </em>But the statute is intended to inure primarily to the benefit of persons who perform labor or furnish materials for works of improvement. (Stats. 1862, ch. 297, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 9, pp. 384, 387; <em>Connolly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court of Merced County </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 826 [132 Cal.Rptr. <em>477, </em>553 P.2d 637] <em>(Connolly)) </em>Courts have uniformly classified the mechanic\u2019s lien statute as remedial legislation, to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and material suppliers. <em>(Betancourt, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) Hence, doubts concerning the meaning of the statute are generally resolved in favor of the lien claimant. <em>(Coast Central Credit Union, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">In order to have a valid mechanic\u2019s lien, a claimant must record a claim of lien within a prescribed period of time after completion of the work of improvement or after a notice of completion or notice of cessation has been filed. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2762 [former \u00a7\u00a7 3115 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>3116].) Once recorded, a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien constitutes a direct lien on the improvement and the real property to the extent of the interests of the owner or the person who caused the improvement to be constructed. <em>(Connolly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 808.) But the failure of a claimant to timely record a claim of lien precludes the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>(Coast Central Credit Union, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 709; <em>National Lumber Co. v. Kennedy </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 780, 781, 783 [154 P. 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Former section 3115 set forth the window of time within which an original contractor like Picerne must record a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Former section 3115 provided, \u201cEach original contractor, in order to enforce a lien, must record his claim of lien after he completes his contract and before the expiration of (a) 90 days after the completion of the work of improvement as defined in Section 3106[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] if no notice of completion or notice of cessation [of labor] has been recorded, or (b) 30 days after recordation of a notice of completion or notice of cessation [of labor].\u201d (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In the case of any work of improvement other than a public work, the Legislature defined the term \u201ccompletion\u201d as \u201cactual completion of the work of improvement.\u201d (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2753 [former \u00a7 3086].) In addition, the following are deemed to be equivalent to a completion: (a) the occupation or use of a work of improvement by the owner or his agent, accompanied by cessation of labor thereon; (b) the acceptance by the owner or his agent of the work of improvement; or (c) after the commencement of a work of improvement, a cessation of labor thereon for a continuous period of 60 days, or a cessation of labor thereon for a continuous period of 30 days or more if the owner records a notice of cessation of labor. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2753 [former \u00a7 3086].) Former section 3086 did not equate the issuance of a certificate of occupancy under building regulations with completion of a work of improvement. (Contra, Stats. 1994, ch. 1046, \u00a7 1, p. 6342 [former \u00a7 3260, subd. (c) defined date of completion for purposes of that section as including the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the public agency issuing the building permit].)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the owner accepted the project as of September 8, 2006. We do not disturb the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations with regard to Wiggins and Kopple. <em>(Clark v. Pullins </em>(1959) 171 Cal.App.2d 703, 707-708 [341 P.2d 73].) The owner\u2019s acceptance of the project is the equivalent of completion of the work of improvement under former section 3115. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2753 [former \u00a7 3086]; Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, p. 2762 [former \u00a73115].) Picerne timely recorded its claim of mechanic\u2019s lien within 90 days after September 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Castellino asserts in summary fashion that Wiggins\u2019s testimony is hearsay, and the trial court erred in admitting that testimony. We are not required to examine undeveloped claims. <em>(Badie </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784-785 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 273] [the appellant must support claims of error with meaningful argument]; <em>Tilbury Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 466, 482-483 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 392] [citing cases without any discussion of their application to the present case results in forfeiture]; <em>Maral v. City of Live Oak </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 975, 984-985 [164 Cal.Rptr.3d 804] [an appellate court is not required to examine undeveloped claims].)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Castellino and Bank of the West nevertheless claim that the time for Picerne to record its claim of mechanic\u2019s lien began to run before September 8, 2006. They assert the phrase \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d in former section 3115 means substantial completion of the work of improvement, and the project was substantially completed by July 25, 2006, when the City issued the final certificate of occupancy or early August 2006. Castellino and Bank of the West point out Picerne recorded its lien claim more than 90 days after July 25, 2006, or early August 2006. They cite cases construing Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187, a predecessor to former section 3115, before that statute was amended in 1929, <em>Howard S. Wright Construction Co. v. BBIC Investors, LLC </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 228 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 769] <em>(Howard S. </em>Wright), and <em>In re Showplace Square Loft Co., LLC </em>(Bankr. N.D.Cal. 2003) 289 B.R. 403 <em>(In re </em>Showplace), in support of their claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>There are cases construing the early mechanic\u2019s lien statute which interpreted \u201ccompletion\u201d as substantial completion. Those cases cite the following provision in Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187: \u201cany trivial imperfection in the said work, or in the construction of any building, improvement, or structure, or of the alteration, addition to, or repair thereof, shall not be deemed such a lack of completion as to prevent the filing of any lien.\u201d (Stats. 1887, ch. 137, \u00a7 3, pp. 154-155.) For example, in <em>Bianchi v. Hughes </em>(1899) 124 Cal. 24 [56 P. 610], the California Supreme Court held a material supplier prematurely recorded its claim of lien when a substantial portion of the subject building was not actually completed when the material supplier recorded its claim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 26-27.) Construing Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187, the Supreme Court said the unfinished work (namely, the stairs leading to the basement) was not a \u201ctrivial imperfection.\u201d <em>(Bianchi, </em>at p. 27; see <em>Shumway v. Woolwine </em>(1927) 84 Cal.App. 220, 224-225 [257 P. 898] [lien was not prematurely filed because the building was substantially completed for more than 30 days before the filing of the lien; the uncompleted work was \u201ctrivial in character\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In <em>Hammond Lumber Co. v. Yeager </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 355 [197 P. 111], the California Supreme Court held a material supplier could not enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien because it recorded its lien claim after the statutory recordation period had elapsed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 357-359.) The claimant in that case argued that even though the owner had accepted and occupied the subject building, the building was not completed for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187 because the bathroom flooring and kitchen sinks were subsequently replaced. <em>(Hammond Lumber Co., </em>at p. 358.) The Supreme Court recited the trivial imperfection provision of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187. <em>(Hammond Lumber Co., </em>at p. 358.) It held the trial court\u2019s finding, that the building was substantially completed when the owner accepted and began occupying the building, was sustained by the evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 359.) The Supreme Court explained the replacement of defective work in the bathroom and kitchen did not alter the fact that the work had been substantially completed. <em>(Ibid.-, </em>see also <em>Grettenberg v. Coliman </em>(1931) 119 Cal.App. 7, 9-11 [5 P.2d 944] [lien was recorded too late under the Civ. Proc. Code, former \u00a7 1187; the cutting of the lawn and trimming of shrubbery, the connecting of gas and electric equipment, the replacement of broken window panes, and the dash-coating of a wall to cover the discoloration which occurred as a result of a leak, were trivial and did not alter the fact that the building and improvements were substantially completed]; <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1919) 43 Cal.App. 21, 25-27 [184 P. 517] [mechanics\u2019 liens were untimely recorded under the Civ.

This is because Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187 was amended in 1929 to delete the reference to trivial imperfections in the work of improvement. (Stats. 1929, ch. 870, \u00a7 1, p. 1928; <em>Lewis v. Hopper </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 365, 366-367 [295 P.2d 93].) Unlike the 1951 and 1969 amendments to the statute, the 1929 amendment was not accompanied by a legislative declaration that the 1929 amendment was not intended to change the meaning or substance of the statute. (Stats. 1929, ch. 870, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, pp. 1928-1929; Stats. 1951, ch. 1159, \u00a7 5, p. 2958; Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 10, p. 2783.) \u201c \u2018We cannot presume the Legislature . . . engaged in an idle act\u2019 \u201d when it deleted the statement in Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187 that any trivial imperfection in the work of improvement shall not be deemed a lack of completion. <em>(Tesco Controls, Inc., supra, </em>124 Cal.App.4th at p. 792.) Rather, when the Legislature deletes an express provision of a statute, we presume it intended to effect a change in the law. <em>(Clements </em>v. <em>T. R. Bechtel Co. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 227, 231-232 [273 P.2d 5]; <em>Royal Co. Auctioneers, Inc. v. Coast Printing Equipment Co. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 868, 873 [238 Cal.Rptr. 538]; <em>Bentz Plumbing &amp; Heating </em>v. <em>Favaloro </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 145, 149-150 [180 Cal.Rptr. 223], superseded by statute on another point as stated in <em>Moorefield Construction, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.4th at p. 159; see <em>Gikas v. Zolin </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 841, 861 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 500, 863 P.2d 745] [the court cannot interpret a statute to reinsert a provision the Legislature has deleted].) The Legislature could, in 1929 and thereafter, have easily said \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d means substantial completion of the work of improvement, as many cases had found as of 1929, but the Legislature did not do so, even though the terms \u201csubstantial completion\u201d and \u201csubstantially completed\u201d appear elsewhere in the Civil Code. (See \u00a7\u00a7 895 [definition of \u201cclose of escrow\u201d for construction defect actions], 941, subds. (a), (e) [statute of limitation for construction defect actions]; Stats. 2002, ch. 664, \u00a7 45, p. 3712 [former \u00a7 3110.5, relating to obligations of an owner who contracts for a work of improvement for construction, alteration, addition to, or repair upon a property].) We must infer that by deleting the trivial imperfection provision, the Legislature intended to change the statute governing the timing for recording a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien and to require something other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>substantial completion of a work of improvement to start the deadline for recording a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Cases applying the post-1929 amended statute support our conclusion. <em>Union Supply Co. v. Morris </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 331 [30 P.2d 394] <em>(Union Supply Co.), </em>for example, upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that a work of improvement was completed, within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187, only after the date a laborer performed work on the project, certain electrical fixtures were installed, and certain exterior work was completed. <em>(Union Supply Co., </em>at pp. 337-338 [noting that the contract between the owner and the building contractor included work outside the building].) In <em>Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 347, the appellate court interpreted \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d in Code of Civil Procedure former section 1193.1 as the point when the plaintiff completed its services under its contract. <em>(Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne, </em>at p. 357; see <em>Hundley v. Marinkovich </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 288, 293 [127 P.2d 600] <em>(Hundley) </em>[construction of a building was \u201ccomplete[]\u201d within the meaning of Code Civ. Proc., former \u00a7 1187 when labor on the construction had ceased and the owner occupied the building and recorded a notice of completion, even though the lien claimant subsequently furnished the contractor with a part of a defective lock which was installed in the building].) Interpreting the phrase \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d in Code of Civil Procedure former section 1193.1, the court in <em>Munger &amp; Munger v. McBratney </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d Supp. 866 [280 P.2d 232] <em>(Munger) </em>focused on whether certain work was required by the contract plans and specifications and the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s crew worked 84 hours to accomplish the required work. <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Unlike the cases construing the pre-1929 amended version of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187, the courts in <em>Union Supply Co., Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne, Hundley, </em>and <em>Munger </em>do not refer to substantial completion or to trivial imperfections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\"><em>Howard S. Wright, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.4th 228, a case Castellino and Bank of West cite, does not construe the meaning of the phrase \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d in former section 3115 or the term \u201ccompletion\u201d in former section 3086. <em>(Howard S. Wright, </em>at pp. 238-241.) Instead, <em>Howard S. Wright </em>interpreted the phrase \u201ccompletes his contract\u201d in former section 3115. <em>(Howard S. Wright, </em>at pp. 238-240.) That phrase set the earliest date when a lien claimant may record a claim of lien. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a72, pp. 2752, 2762 [former \u00a73115].) The appellate court in <em>Howard S. Wright </em>recognized the phrase \u201ccompletes his contract\u201d is distinct from the phrase \u201ccompletion of such work of improvement.\u201d (See Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2762 [former \u00a7 3115].) A case is not authority for propositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>not considered and decided. <em>(In re Chavez </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 643, 656 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 54, 68 P.3d 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">It is true that in <em>In re Showplace, supra, </em>289 B.R. 403, another case cited by Castellino and Bank of the West, the court said, \u201cAlthough section 3115 does not define \u2018completion\u2019 as \u2018substantial completion,\u2019 cases interpreting California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien laws have held that \u2018substantial completion\u2019 triggers the 90-day time period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 409.) But <em>In re Showplace </em>cites to cases construing the pre-1929 amended statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we have explained, the Legislature deleted the trivial imperfections provision which was the basis for the opinions construing completion to mean substantial completion. For this reason, we disagree with the statement of law from <em>In re Showplace </em>upon which Castellino and Bank of West rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Castellino also cites a leading California real estate law treatise. The authors of that treatise state, \u201cCompletion refers to substantial completion, and under an older version of the Mechanics Lien Law, a work of improvement is deemed complete despite \u2018trivial imperfections.\u2019 \u201d (10 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2012) \u00a7 28:41, p. 28-147.) But all the cases cited for the proposition applied the pre-1929 amended version of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187. (10 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28:41, p. 28-147.) The treatise authors recognize the decisions they cited were rendered under a former version of the statute which specifically excluded \u201c \u2018trivial imperfections.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28-148.) The authors say even under the current statutory scheme, truly minor matters that do not relate to the performance, occupation, use, or enjoyment of the work of improvement may not preclude a completion, but they do not cite authority for the statement. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We do not find the authors\u2019 comments helpfhl to our analysis because the authors do not cite authority supporting their assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">In sum, the Legislature deleted the reference to trivial imperfections in the predecessor to former section 3115. The Legislature defined completion of the work of improvement as actual completion of the work of improvement and set forth three circumstances which are deemed to be equivalent to a completion. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2753 [former \u00a7 3086].) The Legislature did not define \u201ccompletion of the work of improvement\u201d as substantial completion. Courts have looked at whether the work at issue was required under the claimant\u2019s contract in determining whether a work of improvement was completed. <em>(Union Supply Co., supra, </em>220 Cal. at pp. 337-338; <em>Scott, Blake &amp; Wynne, supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d atp. 357; <em>Munger, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.2d at p. Supp. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Castellino argues that interpreting the term \u201ccompletion\u201d in former sections 3086 and 3115 to mean substantial completion would be sound public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>because it would ensure transparency, visibility, objectivity, and certainty in the relationship between the contractor and the owner in the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens. However, following the language of the statute by construing \u201ccompletion\u201d as \u201cactual completion\u201d does not create uncertainty when reference can be made to the parties\u2019 agreement and the labor and materials furnished. Moreover, as the statute explains, certain ascertainable circumstances are deemed equivalent to completion: occupation or use of the work of improvement with cessation of labor, acceptance of the work of improvement, or cessation of labor under specified circumstances. In addition, contrary to Castellino\u2019s argument, public policy supports the interpretation of completion as actual completion in this specific context. As we have explained, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute is intended to inure primarily to the benefit of persons who perform labor or furnish materials for works of improvement, and it is to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and material suppliers, with doubts concerning the meaning of the statute generally resolved in favor of the lien claimant. Interpreting completion as actual completion gives lien claimants the maximum amount of time to assert their rights before such rights are cut off, whereas interpreting completion as substantial completion could cut off mechanic\u2019s lien rights much earlier. The interpretation espoused by Castellino would contravene the purpose of California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law to protect the right to payment of those who have furnished labor or materials to works of improvement. <em>(.Betancourt, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) Our construction of the term \u201ccompletion\u201d in former sections 3086 and 3115 effectuates the intent of the mechanic\u2019s lien law and is consistent with the 1929 amendment to Code of Civil Procedure former section 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings that even though the City had issued certificates of occupancy for the 11 buildings within the project, roof and stairway work required under the general contract continued between July 25, 2006, and September 19, 2006. Elizar Ortiz testified he worked 22 and a half hours on September 15, 18, and 19, 2006, installing grip tape on all of the stairs at the project. The general contract called for the installation of anti-slip grip tape on all concrete stair treads. Ortiz\u2019s testimony established the work he performed on September 15, 18, and 19, 2006, was not corrective or repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The president of Picerne\u2019s roofing subcontractor testified his company performed roofing work at the project after July 25, 2006. He said such work included straightening out some of the valleys in the roofs, installing nailers and hips on the roof ridges, and nailing trim. The trial court credited the testimony that the roofing subcontractor performed nonwarranty roof work for several months past July 2006 and at least until September 2006. Castellino did not begin renting the apartments at the project until October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>2006. The roof and stairway work performed after July 25, 2006, is not comparable to adding a few strokes of paint or turning a screw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Picerne recorded a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien on November 28, 2006, which is within 90 days of the date Castellino accepted the project and when the stairway and roofing subcontractors performed work required under their contracts. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding Picerne timely recorded its claim of mechanic\u2019s lien under former section 3115.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Castellino argues each of the 11 buildings within the project was a separate residential unit within the meaning of former section 3131; thus, a different deadline for recording a lien claim applied to each of the 11 buildings. Castellino asserts Picerne did not timely record a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien as to nine of the apartment buildings because more than 90 days passed between the time Castellino accepted those buildings and the time Picerne recorded its claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Former section 3131 provided, \u201cIf a work of improvement consists in the construction of two or more separate residential units, each such unit shall be considered a separate \u2018work of improvement,\u2019 and the time for filing claims of lien against each such residential unit shall commence to run upon the completion of each such residential unit.\u201d (Stats. 1984, ch. 148, \u00a7 1, p. 512.) Former section 3131 defined \u201cseparate residential unit\u201d as \u201cone residential structure, including a residential structure containing multiple condominium units, together with any common area, or any garage or other improvements appurtenant thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Stats. 1984, ch. 148, \u00a7 1, p. 512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">We have not found, and the parties do not cite, a case construing the phrases \u201cseparate residential unit\u201d or \u201cone residential structure\u201d in former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>section 3131 or its predecessor statutes in the context of an apartment complex. However, the legislative intent is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The Legislature said it added the provision relating to separate residential units in order to \u201cexpedite the construction of housing units and [to] enable veterans and others to more readily obtain a marketable title to homes purchased by them without, however, adversely affecting the rights of those entitled to mechanics\u2019 liens as accorded by Section 15 of Article XX of the Constitution.\u201d (Stats. 1947, ch. 28, \u00a7 2, pp. 512-513.) The Legislature explained that efforts to alleviate the acute housing shortage in the state at that time were impeded when marketable title to any single residential unit constructed as part of a project could not be obtained until the last house or residential unit in the project was completed because until such time, a mechanic\u2019s lien claim could be recorded against the project. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 512.) And the times for completion of the last house in any such project could be as long as one to five years after the completion of the first house in the project. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Legislature said loans to military veterans for the purchase of a house in a multi-separate residential unit project could not go through until the time for filing mechanics\u2019 liens had expired and lending institutions could certify their loan was secured by a lien superior to all other liens except taxes and the like. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Legislature was concerned that until the time for filing mechanics\u2019 liens had expired, a veteran or anyone else purchasing a home built in a multi-separate residential unit project could not be sure he or she had a clear title to the home. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The 1984 amendment to former section 3131 sought to extend such protection to the owners of a completed unit within a condominium project. (Sen. Republican Caucus, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2526 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 8, 1984, pp. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Having in mind the legislative intent behind the provision relating to separate residential units, we conclude the project here involved a single residential unit within the meaning of former section 3131. Castellino has not shown that there was separate title for each of the 11 buildings within the project such that completion of the final building within the project could affect marketable title to any individual building or unit within the project. Further, regardless of when it accepted any of the buildings within the project, Castellino filed one notice of completion for the entire work of improvement. Castellino did not file a notice of completion for each building within the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>Accordingly, former section 3130 does not govern the timing for recording a lien claim in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">IV, V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The judgment is modified to provide that the mechanic\u2019s lien is in the amount of $2,416,855.06.

[\u00b6] For all purposes of this section, if there is a single structure on more than one parcel of land owned by one or more different owners, it shall not be the duty of the claimant to segregate the proportion of material or labor entering into the structure on any one of such parcels; but upon the trial thereof the court may, where it deems it equitable so to do, distribute the lien equitably as between the several parcels involved.\u201d (Stats. 1969, ch. 1362, \u00a7 2, pp. 2752, 2763-2764.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">See footnote, ante, page 1201.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
