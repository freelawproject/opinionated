The bond not having been given within the time prescribed by the statute the appeal must be dismissed; and the counsel marking his name on the docket, though it may be a waiver of the process, is not a waiver of the bond.

The judgment of the Circuit court was rendered on the 13th of May 1872. Though a supersedeas to this judgment was awarded by a judge of this court on the 9th of November 1872, the supersedeas bond was not executed until the 15th of April 1875; though counsel had put his name on the docket as counsel for the appellee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-20\">F.

The supersedeas bond was not given until the 15th day of April 1875, when more than two years had elapsed since the date of the said judgment. It seems to follow therefore, as a necessary consequence, that the supersedeas must be dismissed under the said law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">This question has, in effect, been decided by this court in the case of Yarborough &amp; wife v. Deshazo, 7 Gratt. 374; the only difference between the law under which that case arose, and the one under which this case arises, being that the limitation prescribed by the *law in that case was five years, while the limitation prescribed by the law in this case is two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The law is now, and was when that case was decided, very different from what it was when Williamson v. Gayle, &amp;c., 4 Gratt. 180, was decided; and therefore the last named case did not govern the former, and does not govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The only ground on which the counsel for the plaintiff in error relies to distinguish this case from that of Yarborough &amp; wife v. Deshazo is, that there was an appearance in the appellate court in this case by counsel of the defendant in error, within the time for giving the bond, without making any objection on account of the failure to give the bond, which, it is contended, lulled the plaintiff in error into a sense of security, and was a waiver, in effect, of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The appearance of counsel referred to was merely to have his name marked on the office docket of the court, as counsel for the defendant in error; and was not intended to be, and had not the effect of being, a waiver of anything, except, perhaps, the necessity of service of process on his client, when such process could lawfully issue. Certainly it could not have been intended, nor could have the effect, in itself, to release the plaintiff in error from his obligation to give the supersedeas bond required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Therefore the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
