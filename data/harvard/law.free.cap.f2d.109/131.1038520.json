This question has just been answered in the affirmative by the Supreme Court in Haggar Co. v. Commissioner, 60 S.Ct. 337, 84 L.Ed.-, reversing the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upon which the respondent relied. Scaife &amp; Sons v. Driscoll, 3 Cir., 94 F.2d 664, certiorari denied 305 U.S. 603, 59 S.Ct. 63, 83 L. Ed. 383, also cited by the respondent is to be distinguished, inter alia, by the fact that the amended return in that case was not filed within the time limited by law for filing the original return.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-24\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
